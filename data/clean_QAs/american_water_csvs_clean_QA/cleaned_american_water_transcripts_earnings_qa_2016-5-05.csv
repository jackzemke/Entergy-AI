Question,Answer
"I wanted to ask about the Market-based Businesses and, speciﬁcally, Keystone. It looks like market-based was nicely proﬁtable this quarter. And so I assume that the Keystone was proﬁtable as well. But I wonder what is it about the rest of the year that brings it down to breakeven?","Well, actually, if you look at the charts, Walter and Linda mentioned that in the ﬁrst quarter we had a $1 million loss at Keystone that starting the 1st of March they have taken on several austerity measures to get back to the earnings-neutral and cash ﬂow positive for the rest of the year. So actually we're mitigating what happened in the ﬁrst quarter and moving to earnings- neutral for Keystone.  On AWE, we basically – if you look at the chart that Linda ended with, it's within the realm of plus and minus, as we looked last year at investor day and projected the growth of AWE. So the business is running well. Also, Linda mentioned, if you look at AWE being year-over-year, quarter being the ﬂat we did accelerate some of the homeowners services marketing cost because we have system implementation in July and we didn't want to have marketing material and what we tend to get our extra calls during a period of time when we were doing that. So actually we are pretty much on our plan as we looked at AWE and Keystone based on the actions that we've taken in the ﬁrst quarter."
"Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. Which is going back to the Keystone, $1 million loss doesn't sound bad considering the deep depression that the energy sector is in and it's great that you'll be able to get it back to breakeven. And I guess there seems like there's a lot more consolidation opportunity in this business as some of the providers go into distress or market share gains as you call now. I wonder if you can provide us with a little bit of outlook about any potential M&A or market share gains, and I'm sure you're seen as a very strong player in that energy business.","Right. Walter, so let me talk about the Water Services providers ﬁrst because Keystone and we mentioned they had about 20% of the market share when we bought them and due to being aﬃliated with American Water not owned by a competitor E&P company we did start seeing market share grow up to now close to 30%. We picked up several new large customers this year. So while the market has gone down from an E&P our share of that market for Water Services has gone up.  Just like the industry experts EIA are basically targeting fall to see this supply numbers based on some projections for the summer going down and having to increase production we see the same thing based on our discussions with our customers. So – but we are very conservative in our outlook in our projections.  So as Linda mentioned in her script we are assuming no increase in production through the year and looking at cost controls for Keystone that include – about 80% of our costs can be variable. We're looking at a lot of process improvements we continue to grow market share.  And you're exactly right we're seeing some of the smaller Water Services providers who simply can't make it through this year. It's very diﬃcult when you don't have a strong of a balance sheet as we do nor have a growing customer segment for those Water Services.  So our Keystone management team has done an outstanding job as you noted in a time like this with a market like this to get us to the position we're in and we're very proud of that."
"Good morning. Hi good morning guys and congrats on another good quarter here. I kind of wanted to follow up on the ﬁrst call as inquiry pertaining you had two questions here, ﬁrst pertaining to the Keystone side.  I am just curious are you guys seeing any sort of – or are you – maybe customer bankruptcies on the horizon or having to enforce any of those take-or-pay contracts or what's the sense of that customer base because when I look at some of the other companies that are somewhat similar you are seeing that happen?","Yeah, well ﬁrst of all when we bought Keystone, they did not invest in a lot of pipeline. Those are relatively new this is for the future of building pipelines and we are ensuring there are strong third-party creditors, credit-worthy partners there. So we don't really have the take-or-pay exposure now so that's good.  But you're right, what we are seeing and you all read the papers everyday, you have bankruptcies of some of the smaller EMPs and you're seeing a consolidation in the oil and gas industry. And let me remind you that in the Marcellus and Utica, the Appalachian Basin basically all of our support is for natural gas, it is not for oil. And we are also seeing to that eﬀect the consolidation of the oil and gas companies are also seeing that they won't credit worthy partners, so to have a larger water services backed by a company by American Water is very attractive to some of our partners. Also keep in mind that you have to build an infrastructure for water before you need it or before you actually start producing natural gas, so we are seeing some interest expressed later in the year to start some projects."
"That's great. Thank you Susan and then continuing on the non-regulated side. You guys want to keep it somewhat of a smaller portion compared to the overall consolidated company, but obviously with the water thing and the (31:44) of American Water that regulated side is going to at least in our view meaningfully grow over the next ﬁve to 10 years. And so that means you're going to probably have to go the non-regulated side to kind of keep it consistent with its current percentage of overall sales. And so what's the internal thinking of let's say over the next ﬁve to 10 years for the non-regulated side? Where American Water might dive into that is still the core water competency, but expands that non-regulated side or (32:19) intend to grow what we have in the portfolio right now?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Rich, that's a good question. First of all let me tell you that dealing with faster regulated growth is a problem that we sincerely hope that we have and just because we've said that 15% to 20% that's more of a limitation not a target. So if the regulated business, if we see that through things that are happening nationally that there is an acceleration in the number of governmental entities that want to sell their water and wastewater and people of been saying this for a long time, we see it very steady, legislation helps. If that happens it doesn't mean we necessarily must ensure that market base is 15% to 20% it's more of a limiter that from a risk proﬁle standpoint it will not be more than that. That does not mean it has to be that percentage. So I'll just say that upfront now in terms of growing the business, so we believe at American Water that there's enough opportunity related very tightly to our core competency that we like to keep our growth engines related pretty directly to water and wastewater.  So I will tell you that as we look at our businesses and market-base we are looking at, of course, our Homeowner Services military and contract. We look at any potential new business and say, does this really play oﬀ our competencies because our market base business beneﬁts because of the tremendous amount of expertise in our regulated business. It also helps our regulated business by bringing in a lot of competitive entrepreneurial type ways to look at things. So we think it's a very healthy relationship.  We go through a very disciplined process to look at new businesses. Just as one example and this is public. We are very excited about the pilot project; we did on geothermal on Long Island at a school where geothermal's been around for decades but its always utilized ground as the heat transfer agent.  And you have to have pipes for example, they're vertical 250 feet in the grand or horizontally you need a lot of land. We're basically using our water main system to be the agent and it's not having eﬀects on the water and it's able to heat and cool buildings through geothermal system. Well we know that our military bases and this is another cross connection between our businesses several of our military bases, or all of them are under a – eventually a net zero charge from an energy standpoint.  This type of technology can save 30%, 40%, 50% on energy costs. So we are looking at those areas that we have expertise that we're aligned with that have really good applications as we look at diﬀerent ways to grow in the Market-based Business."
"That's great. Thank you, Susan. And then my next question pertains to the metering side of things. Obviously smart metering is an initiative that American is pursuing and I'm wondering if there's a possibility, where instead of building out some of the infrastructure that will be required for smart metering, if you've ever thought – if American and I should tell you is that – has ever thought about sharing the same infrastructure with the electricity companies to save on costs?","Well, you know, actually it's interesting you bring that up. We actually are doing some sharing in two locations in the Monterey Peninsula where, of course, we have the conservation measures   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   and drought. We have a pilot in Monterey that we are partnering Paciﬁc Gas & Electric to use their backhaul system, use water meters, smart water meters, use their backhaul system to actually look at the data.  We just announced about two months ago that we are partnering with Commonwealth Edison ComEd. We serve parts of metro Chicago and we're actually partnering with them to utilize a diﬀerent type of smart meter technology to again utilize some of their backhaul infrastructure.  How this is a win-win is that in our business, as we've said, one of the strong parts of our investment thesis is that we have years-and-years of capital investment we need to make because of the system nationally of the water and wastewater infrastructure system.  So for us to say, we will put in the meters and the electricity company may already have some backhaul capability there from their smart meters, then we – where we can partner and utilize some of that infrastructure. It's great for customers and the regulators love it because it shows directly a reduction in the amount of cost per customers. It beneﬁts the electric utility and it beneﬁts us because if we are not building the backhaul, we just put that money into more pipes, plants and pumps replacement."
"Thank you Walter and thank you very much Susan, I appreciate it, and that's it for me. Congrats again guys. I appreciate your time.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question."
"Hey. Good morning, Susan and team. So in terms of the 2016 guidance you mentioned the non- regulated weakness expectations for the remainder of the year. Our regulated and parent   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   segments are either those doing better or they just kind of tracking in line thus far?","So, Jonathan this is Linda. And what we did at the Analyst Day was we set forth some of the key variables that we expect in our earnings guidance range for the year and so we reiterated that chart here. When we look at 2016, we are square within those variables based on what we know today and the ﬁrst quarter results."
"Okay. And then, in terms of 2017 are you expecting Keystone to turn a proﬁt or is it just too early to tell?","For Keystone, we are expecting that they will take austerity measures and that they will be earnings neutral this year."
"Right, but for 2017 are these austerity measures things that are going to continue over?","It's too early to tell Jonathan. I think when we look at our ﬁve-year plan, we continue to see that the market expectations are about the same as they were in December over the long term, and so, we continue to believe in about 1% growth from the Keystone acquisition."
"Okay. And then, I don't know if you can provide any more detail on the military base RFP comments. Are you seeing more bases, I guess, being put up for grabs than you expected and do you expect any 50-year contracts close to being awarded something we might see later this year.","Jonathan, we are seeing quite a tick up in activity in the pipeline of Request for Proposal. We currently – the Department of Defense has about nine proposals that are out right now, and that we are active in.     And also Jonathan, interestingly for the military bases in terms of the capital upgrade, one of the areas that has not been really identiﬁed in the past is in the area of stormwater. It's been water and wastewater. And so, the legislation we believe allows the military bases to utilize us   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   for stormwater services, but there's been a question about clariﬁcation, and I will tell you that there have been, out of, for example, the House Armed Services Committee, as well as some of the Senate. They said, this was intended so we're working to get clarifying language so that on the bases we serve, we would have an additional opportunity to help them address their needs from a stormwater standpoint. So we see that as a potential opportunity in the future."
"Okay. And then, now just turning quickly to the regulated, West Virginia, I know that – it was somewhat in a state of disarray, but now in light of kind of (40:33) your rate case outcome in the pending (40:34) infrastructure mechanism. Can you just update how you're thinking about that state as a core operation that you want to stay in?","Yeah Jonathan, Walter. We think, we got a fair rate case order out of the commission. We're working with them to address customer issues in the states like we're anywhere else, and we feel positive about the future in West Virginia.  The infrastructure mechanism that we just proposed last week is a positive step forward and it's going to allow us to continue to invest in -- invest more into the infrastructure in West Virginia. So, it's a positive for us and for our customers."
"Okay, great. And then last question on the California desal plant, a one-year delayed. Does that have any impact on kind of projected total company CapEx or I know it wasn't a huge amount, so I'm assuming you're just planning on kind of backﬁlling that CapEx with other investments, is that accurate?","Yeah, that's accurate Jonathan. I mean, it's a big plant. But within our capital program, it's not signiﬁcant. So, it's all going to be within the same four to ﬁve year period.     Right. So, you'll see some of the dollar shifting from year-to-year, but it's still within that ﬁve-year capital plan.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. And then I guess even with that shift -- I mean the one-year shift, so you can oﬀset like half the supply. You're talking about some mitigating measures you're taking. I mean, isn't there just an issue with, I guess, having adequate supply for those customers? I mean, what do you have to do to get the other half of the supply in the interim?","Yeah we're going to have to build a facility. And again, the facility is going to be delayed for about a year. We're working with the commission to mitigate that by moving these other components forward. But right now, we're looking at probably starting construction in mid to late 2018.     Yeah. And Jonathan to that point, if you remember Walter mentioned there were two which were the groundwater replenishment which is recycled water, as well as, the ability to do additional reservoir storage for half.  The other half that we're working hand-in-glove with the local oﬃcials there, as well as, during a hearing in Monterey. The Public Utilities Commission, because of the delay, has said that they also would advocate for us to have an extension of the Carmel River withdrawal kind of it was supposed to seize as you know into this year to extend that until we can get the desal part build.  And if fact, it was very positive that we could continue and work on these other components for half of it before we actually build the desal plant for the other half. So, it actually ensures we build part of the project earlier, and then, hopefully get a -- with everybody's supporting the communities and the state, hopefully, didn't get the extension on the water withdrawal permit for the Carmel River."
"Okay. So there's some ﬂexibility there from the requirements. Okay, great. Thank you so much for the time.","Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  And we do have a follow-up from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead with your follow-up.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"I just had -- I wanted to jump down, but I had one other question. I asked Mr. Panagos (44:03) yesterday, and I'm just curious what Americans take is. So, maybe at the end of March very early April, I had conversation with one of the more prominent leaders at the Ed Muzika (44:14). He was telling me that the consumer advocates (44:17) were looking to meaningfully pushback on the DSIC because basically they feel it's being abused. They think that you ﬁle a DSIC and then there's another DSIC and it's just basically one after the next. And so (44:30) yesterday if they were seeing that. I'm wondering if you guys are seeing that at all, and if you are how you – how American tends to deal with it?","Sure. Well, I will tell you I won't talk in general about Muzika (44:44), but in each of our state, we tried to work very closely with the consumer advocates oﬃce upfront when we're ﬁling these mechanisms. We try to ensure and I will tell you we are very transparent about the process. This also goes back to why our ability to not only increase and improve our O&M eﬃciency, but we have a lot of projects on how we also increase our capital eﬃciency. What are we doing to ensure that every dollar we spend is being spent at the highest level of productivity. So it's a one-on-one thing.  It's not with the general Muzika (45:19) but in each of our states, our state president, our staﬀ sit down with the consumer advocates and basically walk-through very openly what we need to do, why we need to do it and what we're doing to mitigate the cost. And I will tell you when we go in for DSIC and capital infrastructure, we say this and I know some of you think we say it too much but I don't think it can be said enough the ability to manage our O&M costs.  So that for every dollar for O&M save (45:45), we can put $6 of capital in the ground (45:47). When you hear like what Walter said is in West Virginia over four years or three and a half years, we reduced O&M costs $1.1 million. We ﬁled in Illinois. We've reduced our O&M costs by 3%, the ability to show that we are being good stewards of the customers' dollar goes a long way."
"That's great. Thank you, Susan. And if I may, you had mentioned about how each one of your employees that runs these states. I got to say and you might be happy about this. I can see that because Jim Jenkins is heart of work (46:22) for you guys. I just wanted to let you know he's doing a great job in my view. So thank you for the time, Susan. I appreciate it.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Thank you, Rich and thanks for the comments about Jim. He is extraordinary. And I tell you the team we've got, I could go down the list and talk about the amazing people we've got. We all just feel fortunate to work with them. Thank you, Rich."
"That's great. Thank you, guys.  Operator  And at this time, we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Thank you, Jamie. I will be sure that I appreciate everybody participating in our call today. If you've got any questions, as always, you can call Greg and Melissa and they will be happy to help you. I will remind you that we are having our Annual Stockholders Meeting on Friday, May 13 in Voorhees that will be lucky Friday May the 13th. Thanks again for participating in our call. We'll look forward to talking with you all later.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending.
