Question,Answer
"Thank you. So, I have a question mostly about the guidance ﬁrst. So just so I'm clear, I mean on the GAPP level, there is this positive -- positive oﬀset to your -- to the $0.05 hit from earnings, I mean, from -- I'm sorry, from COVID-related expenses. I don't have that beneﬁt on an adjusted basis. So are you basically saying that even with that $0.05 hit, I'm still within the adjusted EPS range? Or is there some other oﬀset to that $0.05 hit on an adjusted basis?","Hey, Angie, good morning. Let me address that and I think you've mostly got it right. I think, what we've continued to try to say here is that the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is what we believe to be expected result on a normalized basis. I think, in the ﬁrst quarter, we called that adjusted, because we were dealing with the depreciation issue in New York, obviously, the COVID estimates had not been fully vetted at that time.  We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are, but I think fundamentally it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89 which is where we believe we will end the year, and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP. I think it's important to note, that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations. And that's what we've always   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is. But there is no change from our expectation around sort of normalized results that range of $3.79 to $3.89."
"Okay, I understand. And my second question on New York. I appreciate Walter's comments that the sale transaction continues. It seems like at least based on press reports. There are some attempts to municipalize parts of this system -- of your New York system. So do you expect that the transaction gets delayed by those potential reviews? Or how should we think about it?","Okay. Thanks Angie, it's Walter. How are you? Let me start by saying, we're moving forward with the sale of New York American Water. The regulatory approval process is progressing, there have been some delays related to giving third parties an opportunity to submit alternative proposals to the sale, and we've taken that into account when we look at the -- what we're saying as far as the beginning of 2021.  So, we don't anticipate any other delays because it's a very tight time frame, that they've given these communities an opportunity to submit alternate proposals. One proposal has been received so far, we're reviewing that, but Liberty and American Water committed to moving forward this sale."
"Awesome. And lastly, I mean, we keep waiting to see the interveners ﬁlings in your New Jersey rate case. I understand that they haven't been posted yet. So can you give us at least a sense, what are the key contentious points? And how the rate case is going?","Well. The rate case is proceeding according to our anticipated schedule. We -- the postings have not been public. So we really can't comment on those, but just to say there's really nothing out of the ordinary in these."
"Thank you. My ﬁrst question is just following-up on Angie's questions on the guidance. I under - - I think, I understand the moving pieces and longer-term, I do agree with the fact on a normalized basis that is what it is. But I guess just from an apples-to-apples comparison versus the range that you have given out on adjusted basis as of ﬁrst quarter. It seems like either the COVID expense impact expectation is excluded from a on apples to apples basis or with it you're, essentially trending $0.05 to $0.08 below the original plan. You've talked about your conﬁdence in getting a lot of that back on the disconnect cost and what not. If those things do not materialize, what type of cost measures do you have to potentially oﬀset this? Or is this something that you're just going to hold back to deal with it in 2021?","Walter, I can start there. You can certainly add.     Okay.     I think, as we -- again, let's just talk about guidance for a second. A couple of thoughts I would give you relative to this, maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, let's say, using that terminology, we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we had done New York. So we would be adjusting for them. And essentially saying, they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say these are going to be the results on the books, and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis, again $3.79 to $3.89. So we've viewed this as literally no change in guidance. So again, that's how we think about guidance.  As it relates to sort of recovery, again, we've got orders in 10 of 14 states, and we've got proceedings in the other four, that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue. That is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05, the lost demand $0.04 of unregulated size of business.  So again, we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars, and again, we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to again sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services, we think this is a an event that has occurred during   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   this period. We're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter as I mentioned, so we believe there's some isolation to it and we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery.  And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them as we've outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M eﬃciency ratio and we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business. We think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially aﬀect our ability to sort to serve it."
"No. My follow-up to this question was just going to be -- so when you do provide 2021 guidance, if there are any expectations of lingering COVID related impacts that will essentially be backed out to provide a more normalized GAAP guidance?","Well. Again, I think, we'll continue to talk about any impacts we see from COVID. I mean, that's what I think we're trying to do here is simply highlight for you the signiﬁcant issues that aﬀect results. And in this particular year, it's the New York depreciation issue and it's COVID, to the extent we see lingering impacts in the '21 we'll continue to talk about the impact of COVID and make it very transparent to you what those impacts might be, and how we're addressing them, whether they be from a regulatory perspective or some other.  I'm not saying that we'll adjust for them, again, I'm a bit of a purist as it relates to reporting, I think GAAP results are the best indicator of performance and so were, we think transparency around GAAP results is the right approach and that's what we're doing here."
Understood. And just one follow-up if I may. I think there's been top from the campaign trail about increased clean energy plans and as part of that just focus also on the water side and water quality. How do you see that impacting or beneﬁting AWK from a rate case? Or having to manage expense -- on an expense basis? Or is it still something that's more on a state-by-state basis that you're working on?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. It's really more in a state-by-state basis. We continue to talk to the folks on a federal level about the ways that private water, American Water can help resolve some of the issues and the challenges in the water and wastewater space but it's largely driven by the states."
"Hey, good morning, Susan and Walter, beat on the dead horse a little longer in terms of the guidance, but -- to your kind of saying the COVID impacts from $0.05 so far. If you're looking in your crystal ball for the second half of the year, there's the potential for an additional $0.03, is that what -- how should -- we should view that $0.05 to $0.08 full year impact to GAAP that you're talking about?","Yeah, I think, that's fair Jonathan now, as I said in the release and in our remarks today, there's obviously lots of unknowns and we will attract this just like we do. It's a changing landscape every single day. But we have an expectation that the largest portion of the impact again this $0.05, $0.04 on the regulated side is really driven by demand changes and we expect that to start to moderate. Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up. I think commercial is probably the biggest variable to be honest with you, that you think about restaurants, and some of the smaller commercial enterprises. They were likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So I think, that is the biggest variable.  Our current view is that we'll you see some of that moderation here in the third quarter. So that $0.05 to $0.08 range, we've given around COVID really reﬂect that set of assumptions. That for the balance of the year. Again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those that range that's our current thinking."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, and if for some reason you are successful getting regulators to support recovery of that lost revenue than that'll represent essentially that $0.05 to $0.08 of upsides to the GAAP. If I'm right.","Right. Now again, yeah, as you think about how that process may play out though obviously we'll -- we are working with regulators currently and we'll continue to do so. We'll have to work through a process to get those dollars reﬂected for recovery. So it may take a bit of time where there's been quick action by regulators to-date literally across the country as you know.  Regulatory community has been very supportive of the process to identify a need for a solution here around -- particularly around disconnect and that sort of thing. The lost revenue piece is sort of another layer of challenge that we need to work through with regulators and that may take a bit of time. But yes, I mean, if we can work through that, there is potential upside there.  And as I mentioned in the script or in our prepared remarks and it may have been sort of a subtle comment, at the state level, we are -- we have recorded these loss revenues as recoverable items. We just took a conservative view at the parent and said we don't have regulatory orders in place to support it yet. So, at the consolidated level, we did not record those regulatory assets, but we certainly expect to work through with regulators and we'll see what progress we can make."
"Okay. And then the 12 million regulatory assets that has been recorded on a cost side. Does that assume the other 4 states, I mean, I know Missouri is the only kind of signiﬁcant size one in there, but does that assume that those 4 also, I guess, approve the cost recovery at least through --","Well. We certainly have taken lots of guidance from our discussions with regulators in those states. We have had active and ongoing conversations with them from the beginning. We've certainly ﬁled petition that would support that approach. We have lots of precedents obviously in our other 10 States as well as other states across the country.  So again, we're not trying to predict what regulators will do, necessarily, but we certainly believe we've got good support for that approach and it is reﬂected in the accounting that we've done to-date."
"Yeah that kind of actually leads into my thoughts. So I mean, I know you guys do run a very lean shop and everything, but your comments around kind of make an arbitrary cost reductions that could impact long-term quality versus other utilities out there that seem to be, ﬁnding these costs oﬀsets, that they say, bulk impact, service quality is that just because you already feel like you are super lean where you don't have this little hanging fruit just to kind of oﬀset the loss sales impact and therefore, not have to go back to the weld to ask customers to pick it up. You're already running super lean and that's why you feel like any additional cuts could impact the quality?","Yeah. And I can only speak for our company, Jonathan, but we've been on this journey now for a dozen years focused on eﬃciencies. And we're going to continue to do that. But again, we're going to make the decisions in the context of what's right for our company, for our employees, for our customers and that's really what guides our decisions."
