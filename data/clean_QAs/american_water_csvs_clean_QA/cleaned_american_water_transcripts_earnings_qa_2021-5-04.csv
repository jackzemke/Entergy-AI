Question,Answer
Understood perfect. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time.  Operator  Thanks Durgesh.,"Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Got it. All right. Excellent. And then I suppose a little bit more nuanced here. As you think about the impacts here in the quarter on the non of -- the market based business here, you're probably still broadly within plan on the year and have some oﬀset. Just can you speak to that obviously, the payouts and the warranties et cetera still elevated here. Just if you can speak to that a little bit on the oﬀsets et cetera and how you're tracking. Maybe after the (Multiple Speakers).  Operator  Yes. With the HOS business, we're seeing higher claims on the wastewater side. Now, people are spending more time in their homes and that's causing apparently additional breaks that we're having to repair. And then on the partnership side, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those partnerships yet we still have a really good pipeline of opportunities, but those are the two areas. I think that have been somewhat impacted by the pandemic and our business going forward.","Julien. I might just add on that point in addition to what Walter said, we did see a little bit higher claims in the quarter from these weather-related events. We did see some water claims particularly in Texas, Illinois and a few other parts of the country really driven by the extreme weather that occurred and we would expect of course that to now sort of be over. Some of the wastewater claims that Walter is talking about, as long as we continue this bit more of stay at home, we may see elevated claims there, but I think the exposure to the weather related we've isolated in this quarter."
"Got it. So how do you think about that relative to the full-year? I mean obviously the wastewater continues a little bit elevated just oﬀsets, et cetra, probably not too material, right?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","It's really not too material. No, I mean, we saw roughly a penny or so of that impact related to the stay-at-home activities in this quarter and as you can see across the country, states are starting to loosen up. So there'll be some return. So I certainly think we'll see this start to mitigate and in any event we don't see it as material for the year."
Excellent guys. Thank you all very much. Have a nice day.  Operator  Thanks Julien.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. Just couple for me. The ﬁrst one with the -- the recently announced Pennsylvania and New Jersey transactions, how do you think about potential cadence and magnitude of the equity guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day. Just thinking through 21, 22, if it's going to be split up or are we still assuming kind of a bulk number in one year?  Operator  Well ﬁrst, let me talk about the growth. And we're really excited for these two acquisitions in our two biggest states. It's all part of what we're doing and providing solutions for communities with the City of York in the Wastewater side, and then Egg Harbor City. In the ﬁrst WIPA, that's really important to ﬁrst WIPA acquisition. And we're hopeful many other communities are going to see the beneﬁts of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about providing meaningful solutions. And again, as we talked about having consolidated tariﬀs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impacts. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure that these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment. I wanted to spotlight the follow-on investment, and how signiﬁcant that is to our growth and to providing solutions for community. So we're really excited about these two acquisitions and how they're going to play in the future growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Insoo maybe let me just comment on the equity needs because that was a follow-on part of your question I think. When we built our plan and laid out our ﬁnancing plan over the ﬁve years, we anticipated an increase in our growth from acquisition and we reﬂected that at Analyst Day. Now whether or not we identify these speciﬁc transactions, it's a diﬀerent question but we had anticipated a step up and growth and built our plan accordingly. So long answer to your question, I don't see any change from these speciﬁc acquisitions that we've now highlighted any change to our equity ﬁnancing timing or any of other our ﬁnancing plans over the course of the ﬁve years."
"Got it. Just from a timing perspective, is there a possibility that we could see some of that equity in the '21 timeframe or is it more beyond '21?","No, it's beyond 21. At Analyst Day, I think we indicated that it still -- it is about 700 million of equity in the ﬁve years and it's still roughly in sort of the middle of that ﬁve-year timeframe. So no, I would not anticipate anything in 2021."
"Hi. Good morning. Maybe following up on that last point real quick the sale timing, would it impact I guess where you land within the range of your '21 guidance or phrase diﬀerently, you have some timing assumption associated with close presumably baked in. Can you disclose what that assumption is and what a quarter two diﬀerence may do to where you landed the range?","Hey, Rich its Susan. Probably not going to add much more detail to that, I would just echo what Walter said in his prepared remarks and then his answer a minute ago we just don't see having any impact on 2021."
