Question,Answer
"Good morning. Yeah. I don't usually -- I don't usually lead oﬀ with sort of an M&A question but I know John loves talking about M&A and we saw that in the prepared remarks. And obviously it's timely given the Eversource news yesterday where they essentially put acquiring on the block. Can you speak maybe to your appetite for larger inorganic opportunities? And speciﬁcally, any geographic aversions to the Northeast in light of the developments yesterday. Thank you.","Sure. I think it's a great question. Obviously, we saw the news as well. And John, certainly can comment more. I'd say, ﬁrst of all, of course, we don't comment on any activity in the M&A space of that nature. I think, for us, it continues to be our standards that we've shared. We have to be conﬁdent in the ability to grow. We have to have conﬁdence in regulatory environments, conﬁdence in policy and support in any jurisdiction that we're currently in or other jurisdictions we may be looking at. So, I think that's always the case, which we evaluate opportunities. So I'd probably just say that.  John, any additional comments from your side?     No. Well said."
Perfect. And then just a follow-on. I know you're still kind of working through some of the ins and outs of the Lead and Copper Rule. Is there even a general CapEx upside amount you could give us to think about with the spend sort of be additive in your view to the current plan or would it shift out some spend out like we saw with you know obviously with PFAS spend on the last update. Thanks guys.,"Yeah, sure, let me again sort of generally answer and then Cheryl, can add to it. I think it's ﬁrst of all, sort of too early to be able to give any additional guidance around impacts to our overall plan. I think the important thing to remember here is it is over a much longer period of time than what we're seeing with the PFAS rules for example. So it will give us more time to ﬁgure out what the actual impacts are to the plan, gives us more opportunity to look at opportunity to move other projects around to sort of accommodate whatever spend we think may be incremental here for us. So we just probably need a little bit more time to sort through it and then we can give a clear guidance. Again, as Cheryl said in her prepared remarks, we know it will be signiﬁcant. I don't think it will have a dramatic impact on our plan for shorter-term window like we saw with PFAS, for example."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it.,"Cheryl, anything you want to add to that?     Yeah. The only thing I would add, Shar, is just that we have been making really good progress in that space, and we'll continue to be focused on removing our lead service lines and the customer lead service lines where they exist. But this is a more inclusive rule that, as Susan said, is over a longer period of time. So we'll continue to look at how we can layer that in.     I think just to sort of punch line on that one and Cheryl again made the comment in her prepared remarks. You know this is about unknown service lines, unknown material. And it is about customer own. So as we've been working through our own program of replacing our lines, now we have the added requirement to look at unknown pipe and customer service lines. So that's why it gets bigger, and then again the long-term time horizon to deal with it I think is also important to keep note of."
"Fantastic. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it to someone else. See you soon.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go-ahead."
"Hey, good morning, Susan. Just I hate to go back to the M&A, I know you're kind of going to be very limited in what you can say. But we've been getting a ton of questions on this, so I just wanted to be clear about something. And you see -- your peers generally describe M&A as a   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   high hurdle rate, right, with the organic growth opportunities that they have as a company. How would - how would you characterize the Connecticut Water assets? Are these ones one of a kind assets, those large assets that don't - don't often come to market is extremely attractive. Or would you say, you know, the M&A opportunity is still high hurdle rate versus the organic CapEx that you have. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I just wanted to see how you're thinking about it.","Yeah, Durgesh. I'll tell you at the outset, you're not going to be happy with my answer, because I'm not going to sort of go into a whole lot of detail here. I think our focus continues to be on the communities and the states that we currently operate in. As you know, we're in 14 diﬀerent states. We think there are just a signiﬁcant number of opportunities in those states and we're going to continue to focus on that. As you would expect any one to do, we'll take a look at this kind of an opportunity as everyone would. But I think again our screens are the critical thing you should focus on. Regulatory environment, legislative environment, business climate and the ability to grow. And that we're always going to look at opportunities from that perspective."
"Understood. Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that. Maybe then switching gears, can you just update us on the Pennsylvania rate case, the commission, I think came out in December. I think they may have suspended the rate case schedule. Maybe just talk to that what does that mean, what are the next steps there, please. Thank you.","Yeah. Cheryl I think laid out the details around timing. We've disclosed the size of the case, et cetera. Sort of big picture for me on this case as is the case really with all of our general rate cases we have in progress, it's all about investments. We're not trying to do anything tricky in any of these cases. No signiﬁcant policy changes from our perspective. This is simply about investment, that's what this Pennsylvania cases about. And we'll continue to work through the process (Technical Diﬃculty) indications of any issues associated with this case as we work through the process and we'll continue to, to stay on that path. I'd say, that's generally the case on all of our jurisdictions. All the cases that we have on ﬁle today.  We've been signaling this I think for quite some time that the expectation to be in for general rate cases on this roughly two-year cycle. We've been saying that for probably two, three years now. And this is just the continuation of that program. And it's all really driven again by our investment, the pace of our investment. You know, we've been increasing our capital spend plan for a number of years now to really address the needs that exist in the communities that we serve. And I think our regulatory strategy is consistent with that approach. So, Pennsylvania is no diﬀerent than any other state in terms of our approach to it. And we'll continue to work the process there, like we always do. And we think Pennsylvania again is a - is a very constructive state, and we're conﬁdent in our ability to work through that case."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up there, Susan, like do -- does the procedural -- like the steps in the rate case in terms of testimony, intervener testimony and all that stuﬀ, does that go along as planned with the suspension or is that on pause. I might have seen something that, you may be on pause. So I'm not sure, you know, if (inaudible).","No change. Yeah, no change. Yeah, it's on schedule and on the normal process."
"Good morning. I'm going to ask about Illinois ﬁrst. I mean we have some bad outcomes, regulatory outcomes, on the electric and gas side in the state. You have a case there, we're already seeing some noise around it. So I'm just wondering how you know if there's any lessons learned from what happened in December. And if you've incorporated that into the current timing.  And then secondly on PFAS. So, you know, we're seeing some lawsuits against investor-owned utilities on the back of PFAS. I understand that you've mentioned that you've been in compliance and going beyond requirements. But I'm just wondering how you manage this risk.","Yeah, again let me sort of start-oﬀ here. On Illinois, I would take my answer to Pennsylvania and insert the word, Illinois. We are proceeding there as scheduled with no signiﬁcant issues in that case. It is about investment. And we'll continue to process that case like we always would. Certainly, there is noise around the electric and gas industry cases there. We think again our   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   cases are diﬀerent in that they are about investment-only and we're conﬁdent in our ability to continue to work through that case as well.  On PFAS, Cheryl, you might just actually want to comment on Illinois, if you like. And then on PFAS, there's obviously a lot going on hereto. I think the litigation environment around this is probably not surprising. There'll be all sorts of plaintiﬀs' attorneys looking for an angle here. And I think that's probably what mostly you're referring to in what we're seeing.  But Cheryl, anything you want to add-on either of these topics?     Yeah. I would just say, you know Susan, you completely accurate on Illinois. We've built a really strong case based on capital investment and we feel-good about that case and the process. We're just going to go through the process there the way we normally would.  As far as the PFAS stuﬀ, I do believe that, you know, there we've seen some lawsuits out there and as you mentioned, but we've been working really hard both to make sure that we're in compliance with all the rules that are out there that we're being proactive in our approach. But we're also working with EPA on the circular designation and working at the federal level to try to get protections for water utilities all across the US. Because we believe that we shouldn't be held accountable for polluted waters that are coming to us and we're doing everything we possibly can to treat for that pollutant. And so we think that we should be protected from that. So we're going to continue to work in that vein and in that space. And you know being part of the MDL, that's one-step in that process to get recovery from the people who cost the pollution in the ﬁrst place."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Nicely done on the guidance here. I got to say. Maybe actually to that point on guidance, given the bump here. Just with respect to resetting higher -- the CAGR going-forward. I just wanted to recognize that this goes through 2026. Implicitly, could we say, this (inaudible) through the forecast period are is this more nuanced to the speciﬁc three-year forecast period 2025, 2024-2026 year, if you will.","Yeah. I think we've tried to be clear, Julien on the sort of duration of this additional interest will have on. But, John, you want to -- you want to comment on this further?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Yeah. I think you've got it right Julien. It's, think of this as an increase over our ongoing guidance for that period through 2026 and that's you know -- but we've not made changes as we've tried to describe in our comments from our original guidance on the -- on the regulated strategy from back in November."
"Right. Yeah, understood. I just wanted to clarify that. Extra clear. With respect to Illinois here, obviously, you've got this case out there -- there is a certain degree of attention. Can you comment a little bit about maybe some of the rate mitigation factors. What other pieces could help oﬀset some of the rate increases to customers in Illinois and any other mitigating factors and circumstances around that case that we can speak to here for instance.","Yeah, I'll comment on sort of overall strategy on that point. I think we treat Illinois the team as we do our other states. I mean, we've been very focused on mechanisms or approaches to regulatory solutions that will help lessen and mitigate the direct impact of inﬂationary cost pension and other things. We've done that via trackers. We've done that via deferrals. We've done that sort of across many of our jurisdictions. And we have a good amount of those costs actually frankly already sort of dealt and embedded in rate structures across our territory. No one really no diﬀerent than that.  And as Cheryl said, you know, that we're just not experiencing other issues currently in that case. Now, we obviously have to ﬁnish it. We have to get through the rest of the procedural schedule and -- and work through any issues that may come up. But we're -- we're not anticipating anything materially diﬀerent there."
"Yeah, Excellent, thank you. And then lastly, just going back to the M&A point you're making earlier. I thought you were pretty clear about it. It needs to be accretive and/or provide robust visible growth. I just want to make sure I'm hearing you right about the growth piece there in terms of a key element and ingredient.","Well, I don't know that I said it has to be accretive. Are you -- I guess you're talking about the M&A piece. I think, again, I'll just repeat it. I think our view is that, for us to look at new jurisdictions, it has to be productive regulatory legislative business environment. And the opportunity for growth, I really I guess was referring to you know sort of footprint growth there. And obviously you would you would apply a you know a meaningful ﬁnancial contribution from that too. So it's the same screens we've always had. It's the same dialog we've always had on potential expansion into other territories. So I don't think this particular situation changes anything about how we feel about, you know, growth in other jurisdictions.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Got it. And just going back to lastly on that PUC, you guys commented extensively here, but just a timeline on getting that clarity there and you know you talked about being a little bit more protracted. Just how does this sort of at least from a process perspective, ﬁnally get to some resolution as far as you guys are concerned. And then you know prospects on expanding it even from there, given where we stand.","Well, Julien, you're going to have to help me on ﬁrst part of your question. I'm not sure what you're referring to."
"Well, I just on the fair market value. Just in terms of potentially taking a little bit longer. Yeah, indeed.","Got you. Got you. I just didn't hear the ﬁrst part. Yeah. I think that as I said in my remarks, and John expanded on a bit.I think that what the PUC has done in Pennsylvania is actually quite helpful. And I've got a lot of experience in the regulatory world over the last 40 years or so. I'd see many pieces of legislation enacted and I've seen many situations where commissions have to work-through the implementation of that legislation. And I think that's exactly what we're doing here. And as we said, we applaud the commission for taking this approach and really being thoughtful about it and understanding the importance of this legislation to the larger strategy in the Commonwealth. So, I think the steps are be taken make, make good sense.  Now, having said that, we do have to continue to work through how those guidelines ultimately may be employed. But we think it's just helpful and we'll give a framework for all of us to be able to work more productively in. Now having said that also, we do have to sort out what it means in terms of timing and we've got a number of cases, acquisitions that we're working on in Pennsylvania through the regulatory approval process. And it's obviously impacting that a bit currently, but we expect that to clear soon and be able to get back on our way here."
"Hey, good morning. Just a quick housekeeping question after Julian. You talked about the, the HOS note in the income and you're very clear about that that's more -- were not much of an ongoing earnings number. I think you're talking about maybe it rolls oﬀ in 2026. When we move forward, right, post 2026, should we think about additional rate base that maybe backﬁll that on a more linear growth rate or -- and I know $0.10 of a $5 number is very small, but just something backﬁll that they keep their earnings trajectory pretty linear.","I think you hit on it, Anthony, there at the end. It's not terribly material. We think this is a great beneﬁt from a cash ﬂow perspective. You know, the additional interest is nice to have. We think the certainty associated with the -- that contingent payment we had on the New York contract extension is quite helpful. Now, we have that secured. So we think there's just a variety of things about the restructuring debt made a lot of sense for us, that don't necessarily translate into any material impact to our overall plan.  So long answer to your question, we would not expect there to be a need for ﬁnding additional capital to sort of ﬁll in that very minor hold that this $0.10 will create."
"Great. And just if I could squeeze one more. And it's still -- it's Cheryl the comments earlier and unfortunately it looks like most of the Q&A has been sidetracked by Eversource questions. So I'm not asking you to Eversource question just when Cheryl talked about the increased needs on water systems, cyber security, you just think of that. Is that maybe a foreshadowed that maybe the smaller and bolt on acquisitions may come at a greater frequency because of the requirements that are being -- the compliance requirements that are being put on the smaller systems. I mean was that where that was headed?","Yeah. I think this is an area we've tried to signal I think for the last several discussions we've been having. And I think really probably what prompted that even was PFAS, as an example. You know we see that as just another area that may be diﬃcult for some of these smaller systems to be able to manage both from an investment standpoint as well as an expertise standpoint. Cyber is another great example, you know, interest rates is another great example. I mean the list just gets longer, not shorter for these communities to sort of have to deal with.  And from our perspective you know we have always been very focused on trying to deﬁne what the need is for a community and helping satisfy those needs. And again from an M&A perspective or an acquisition perspective as that list gets longer, it creates more opportunity for us to have that dialog and work with communities to solve those kinds of problems.  So, yeah, we think it does have upside to our acquisition strategy. It's probably not a Tsunami though to use a water term. It's probably a much sort of longer-term impact. I think it takes a bit   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   of time for communities to sort of wrestle with these issues and determine you know impacts to them before they're ready to make a move. So again, we use these kinds of issues in our discussions. I think it will take some time before we see any measurable impact directly related to these issues."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   (multiple speakers) pay you.,"Yeah. John, you want to take this question.     Sure. Good morning, Steve. From a credit perspective, we stay very close to the HOS business. We're in fact a partner and as lender, we're constantly in touch with the business. The company has evolved, the credit has improved. You know extending the New York contract is a signiﬁcantly positive credit move. And as I mentioned in my comments, the company is currently making an acquisition with new equity funding from their owners as well as cash on their balance sheets. So we do have covenants. They've remained in compliance with the covenants. And in fact, we've taken the opportunity to tighten covenants as well. But when you look at the underlying business, it's frankly doing better than it ever has. So we feel very, very good about the underlying credit here."
Okay. Does the owner -- does as the private -- does the ﬁrm back it up too or is it just the business backs up paying rest.,"Yes, the owner backs it up. And that's what I was trying to say. So when there's fresh equity coming into the business to make this acquisition, that's coming from APAC who owns the business."
"Got it. And then just -- I know you had a sharing mechanism too, for the business. Could you just maybe let us know kind of how much income you made on the sharing mechanism part in, let's say, 2023. Yeah.","Yeah, Steve, I don't know if we had that disclosed. Is it separate 10-K. Yeah. Steve, we can point you to it, I'll have Aaron follow back up with you to point you to it, but I think it is in the 10-K, which obviously we ﬁled last night. And this is the revenue sharing mechanism you're referring to where we collect a share of the revenue that's generated from the warranty work that they're doing into our various state jurisdictions where we have (multiple speakers) Yeah, Aaron will direct you to them.  Okay, great. Thanks, Steve."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. On the Pennsylvania case, I think to the Commission sent a letter at the beginning of the case. Just kind of framing it. But I'm not sure -- is that abnormal would you say or is that normal for your Pennsylvania cases. How would you characterize that?","Yeah. I would say it's probably not necessarily customary. But again, we think that this case is proceeding as it should. We don't really see again any issues here. It's a big case. So. I mean, its $1 dollar worth of investment, you know. We were in just a little under two years ago on this case. So certainly material. And again, solely driven by investment in the jurisdictions that we or the communities that we serve there."
"Hey, good morning, team. Just wanted to come back to EPA and the fair market value stuﬀ. Do you anticipate that all the changes to the fair market value will come via the Commission process. Or do you think some of the bills in the legislature will make it across the ﬁnish line.","Yeah. Our view is that this is -- this is the best path and the likely path to sort of resolve issues around fair market value in Pennsylvania. Again, I think this is normal practice and I'm not being speciﬁc to Pennsylvania. I'm just saying normal in my 40 years of experience, which happened, fairly regularly where commissions, you know, are charged with interpreting legislation and applying the provisions of it. And that's what I think this Commission is doing. And I think they took a very proactive step here to do exactly what you're talking about, to resolve the issues and be able to eﬀectively implement the legislation.  I think there is no one -- well, I shouldn't say, no one. There are few probably that have you know conceptual problem with what fair market value legislation was intended to do. I think there is a -- there's a good understanding of the need for consolidation in the state. And this is the mechanism to allow for that to occur. So I think it's -- I think it stands. And I think the commission will do the work necessary to make sure that the legislation is eﬀectively enacted and implemented.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Yes. So, I mean, you're saying PA is in your opinion, very much fully behind continued promotion of consolidation.","Yeah. I think as a state, as the Commonwealth, I believe that is a true statement. Yes."
Okay. What sort of impact do you think it will have on the deal activity. And would you say the proposed RRR will make it tougher for AWK to deliver on the M&A CapEx placeholders.,"I think we'll have to see how it plays out and how, ultimately, it gets worked from a procedural standpoint. But I'd say, generally speaking, no, we do not see it having a material impact on available opportunities and then ultimately the outcomes on transactions."
"And then last question for me, I saw that in at least the PA New Jersey rate case ﬁlings that revenue decoupling requests were made. You know possibly. It's in Illinois case too. Do you typically make those detailed decoupling request and just don't get them or is that something new that you're pursuing?","Yeah, it's a good question. I'd say, it varies across jurisdictions. And again part of our job here is to really understand what each commission is comfortable with and what mechanisms work or don't work-in a particular jurisdiction. And it's also part of our responsibility to educate and to inform commissions and their staﬀs about how various mechanisms can work and what the impacts are. So we do that across our jurisdictions, And I think we have really been more proactive in that regard over the last couple years.  And so. I think as we do that education and that dialog, it will inform where we propose what mechanisms. So, I wouldn't necessarily say it's a broad application the decoupling is always on our list in every jurisdiction. I think it's all circumstantial what mechanisms work best in what jurisdictions, and we work accordingly."
"Okay, but for PA New Jersey, are these new proposals or have they've been there and say your most recent case too?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah. I'd have to go back and look to see if we have those speciﬁcally in those cases. I don't actually recall, but again, I wouldn't necessarily think this is breaking new ground on either of these proposals."
"Yeah, thank you. Just a question on the PFAS settlements. Just sort of your expectation on the outcome following-up on the 3M settlement there. And, you know, thanks for the additional updates. I'm just curious if anything has changed around, you know, your view of the companys sort of legacy liability to PFAS if there is one. Thanks.","Yeah, on the ﬁrst question, Greg, around just settlement expected outcomes. Obviously, that process is proceeding. And we had one settlement approved and the other one in fairness hearing has occurred. And we would expect it to ultimately get approved. And then the process begins of claims submittals and really going through the settlement allocation process. So, obviously, it's too early for us to be able to give you any indication of what we think the outcomes will be ﬁnancially. But as we've said all along, these will be cents on the dollar in terms of recovery. We don't expect obviously for it to cover the full-cost of exposure here. But the amounts to be recovered through the settlement we think is quite important.  And the best avenue as Cheryl said in her remarks to collect dollars on behalf of the customer to reduce the overall obligation the customer has. So it's a good process. We've been happy to be involved in it. Our team, I think in a lot of ways is leading most of the eﬀort around getting this work through the courts and getting outcomes here that are quite favorable.  And to your second question on how do we view sort of legacy exposure here. I don't think our view changes. As we said earlier, this will be an environment like all where there'll be Plaintiﬀs' attorneys that are looking for an opportunity here. And how that ultimately gets worked through the larger process around the MDL the multi district litigation is yet to be teen. But in terms of our exposure, we don't have any diﬀerent view than we've had from a legacy perspective. Again, as Cheryl said on a go-forward basis, we are treating and we're preparing to treat and we're conﬁdent in our ability to do that on a go-forward basis."
