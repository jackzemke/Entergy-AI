Question,Answer
"Great. Thank you. First, I want to start on the Pennsylvania front. With the rate case, curious about the path forward and if settlement is still an option, or if litigating is just the path to close this out. And then separately on Pennsylvania, the fair market value revisions, do you see that 1.68 cap limiting willingness to sell at all?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yes. Good questions, Rich. I think ﬁrst on the rate case. I would say probably just where we are in the process. I would say, settlement is probably unlikely at this stage.  And as Cheryl, I think, outlined, we would expect some activity by the commission here in the next probably several weeks, and then we will wrap that case up later in the summer. So don't expect to settle at this point. And again, we are pleased with where we are in the process related to that case.  On fair market value, lots going on obviously there. And we will continue to watch those activities, and obviously we are involved in discussions around any potential changes that may get made. I think in terms of what impact some of those changes may have on communities' interest in selling, I think it is just wait to see.  I think so many of these communities need the help and we are quite conﬁdent in our ability to help them. And I think our focus always is on coming up with the right solution for these communities, and we will continue to do that. So we will certainly work with whatever framework that is provided to us by regulators and legislators in this respect."
"Got it. I appreciate the commentary there. And then separately on Slide 9, the latest around these new CERCLA designations. I am curious how you view litigation risk under these new classiﬁcations or anything we should be thinking about on the litigation front given the commentary around the liability protections that you also referenced?","Yes, and Cheryl certainly can weigh in here too. I think our view is we will continue to be proactive here in trying to get resolution to a CERCLA designation.  But we are also just conﬁdent in our ability to execute our plan here to be compliant with the rules. We have been doing it for some time in many of our jurisdictions already. So we are quite conﬁdent in our plans and don't expect this to be a huge risk for us. Cheryl, anything you want to add?     Yes, I would just add that we are working really hard on the legislative front to get the language ﬁxed so that we are protected from those CERCLA rules, and we will continue down that path. We have had lots of conversations with EPA around this on this, and their intent is not for us to be impacted by that. But those conversations will continue until we get to a solution that we're all really comfortable with."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Great. Thank you so much, and thank you for the time today.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead."
"Good morning. The Pennsylvania rate case, I understand the sensitivity around it. But there are just a number of issues raised in it by many interveners of the commission itself about how often you ﬁle rate cases, the allowed ROE.  I mean you guys mentioned a number of other rate cases that seem to be going smoothly, but I'm just wondering if there are any thoughts about a change in the strategy as to how often you ﬁle rate cases. Any impact of these comments that you're seeing on the level of capital investments, especially in Pennsylvania? Again, I don't think that we've ever seen ﬁlings like these in Pennsylvania.","Yes, Angie, it's a good question. And again, we remain very conﬁdent in our plans, both in terms of how we execute them and the regulatory process that supports the work that we're doing in the state of Pennsylvania. There's just  tremendous need in the state of Pennsylvania, as there is in many of the jurisdictions that we operate in.  So our focus on investment is really around the need for infrastructure improvement, and we'll continue to do that work. I think the Pennsylvania case is a great example of that. We spent over $1 billion, or will have spent over $1 billion in that case, and it's all focused on rate-based growth.  It is all focused on infrastructure renewal and replacement and the necessary work to be done in the state of Pennsylvania to bring these systems up to appropriate standards so that we can consistently provide safe and reliable water service. So again, we remain very conﬁdent in our plan and our ability to navigate the regulatory arena.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And there is, of course some observation around the speed with which we're ﬁling these cases. And I think it is directly tied to the pace of our spend. We've really increased the level of spend, again driven by the need.  And when you really look at the timeline of this case, it's really not much diﬀerent than other water peers in the state of Pennsylvania. We may be ahead just a bit than our nearest competitor in the state, but not by much in terms of pace. So I don't think it's that unusual. And again, it's all driven by the need for investment and the work that we're doing to improve the quality of service in the state of Pennsylvania."
"Okay. And then there's one other point which is being mentioned is the inclusion of a pending acquisition in that rate case. I thought that that happened in the past. So I'm a little bit surprised that this is a point that is being raised.  I'm wondering if this has anything to do with the changes that are happening to Act 12. You guys referenced that it could take longer to get regulatory approvals for some of these pending acquisitions, and I'm assuming that that is in response to those questions being raised in this rate case. But I'm just wondering again, going forward how do you expect actually these muni deals to be approved or reﬂected in rates?","Yes, I think it's probably a fair assumption to say that all of this is getting a bit tied together. The landscape around the potential legislative changes on fair market value I think do sort of spill over into the rate case analysis a bit.  And to be clear, we included in this case acquisitions that we have approved and expected to close during this period of time. And so as the Commission sorts through that, obviously they've got to take into consideration the status of those acquisitions and their ﬁndings in the case, which we would fully expect them to do. I think on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect there to be really any change in how we consider acquisitions in future rate cases."
"Good morning. More of a general question just, and I might have covered this before. But on sort of the impact of what so many discussions are around these days, just data center presence. And how that impacts your growth and any constraints that that has on your business. Thanks.","Yes, it's a good question. Cheryl, you want to talk about any preliminary thoughts we have about potential water usage and some of these large data center moves?     Yes. Yes, Greg, we haven't seen a big uptake in the amount of water that our customers are asking for related to the data center moves at all. So, we're thinking it's a minimal impact for us, unlike our electric utility peers."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Good morning, Susan. Just on the PFAS legislation that you're advocating for, could you give us some color on whether it's attached to other related bills, and if there's any sort of milestones we should be watching for there? And then could you also just explain what steps you're taking to sort of secure support on both sides of the aisle as it relates to this legislation?","Sure. Yes, Cheryl, you want to take that?     Yes, sure. So there has been legislation ﬁled both on the Senate and the House side that it's the Water Systems PFAS Liability Act. On the House side, it's 7944.  And I'm trying to see. I don't have the Senate number. But this act would help protect us, along with some other industries as a passive receiver. And so we work really hard on both sides of the aisle all the time to connect with our legislators, and also educate them on the real issues at hand.  We've had some really great conversations on the Hill, and are hopeful that this bill will continue to move forward, both in the House and the Senate, so that we can push this forward. And I think you would just watch for the key things, like it getting out of committee, getting a ﬂoor vote. And so we'll continue to push that forward and update you in these calls as things unfold there.     And Cheryl, it is standalone, right? There's nothing else.     Yes, it's not tied to anything else except to try to protect passive users, or passive receivers from this liability."
"Right. That's helpful. Thank you. And maybe just one follow-up there. Is there a particular timeline by which you're expecting this legislation to either pass, or by when should we know whether this thing's going to pass or not?","Yes, I think it's impossible to anticipate the timeline. We would love to say it'll be all completed by the next couple of months. But it could take much longer. The political process is really challenging at times. So we think we've got good support, and we'll continue to push on it as fast as we can. But there's just no timeline for it.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      We do think that it probably helps a bit that we now have the ﬁnal rules out. We've been working on this particular angle for quite some time, even before the ﬁnal rule was published.  So now that the ﬁnal rule is here, that eliminates one reason why legislators didn't want to take this issue up. If they were waiting to see what the ﬁnal rule was and that was an and that was sort of an excuse to not address this issue, I think that's been removed from their list of reasons not to move. So hopefully that helps, and we'll see continued movement here.     Yes, and in addition, the EPA said that they want to be able to use discretion. So part of this is some discretionary ﬂexibility for them because they did not intend, by designating these compounds as hazardous substances, that it would apply to water and wastewater utilities. So they're planning to use discretion. But we think it's a much tighter protection to have this legislation. So we'll continue to pursue that, in addition to working with EPA."
