Question,Answer
"Perfect. And my second question to Linda. So given your updated views on operating cash ﬂows, especially in light of the Pivotal acquisition. Have you been in discussions with credit   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   agencies? And do you think that this improvement is going to be suﬃcient for you guys to avoid any potential credit downgrades?","Yeah. And we are constantly working with our credit rating agencies, we have meetings set up on an annual basis, and we would expect to continue to hold those meetings. We were also in discussions with our credit rating agencies with regard to the Pivotal acquisition. And so we're continuing to work through that. As we mentioned, when tax reform was implemented that, we would expect our FFO to debt metric to drift a bit lower, as a result of tax reform.  We've been making positive improvements on the cash ﬂow front since then, and we'll continue to look and to manage our cash ﬂow very carefully. And we do have to remember that, that is one metric that the rating agencies look at, probably the bigger item around ratings is the risk proﬁle of the water and wastewater industry. And that has not changed. And so -- and we sit very well within that -- that the industry here,."
"I'm quite clear on everything, but I have a question on another area outside of the quarter, and it pertains to safety culture. As you guys all know I'm pretty active with presenting on the conference circuit, and for about the past two years, I've noticed the topic of safety and protection has become an more and more prominent area discussed by other presenters at these events, and originally, it could be considered ﬁller, but it really does appear that this is an emerging trend with some potential for positive impact. I was at the Southwest Infrastructure Water Summit earlier this week and Bill (inaudible) of American Water was discussing how the companies are at the forefront of ensuring employee safety. It was interesting, because he was   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   delivering remarks stating that American's basically considering a bunch of diﬀerent technologies, one of which is robotics.  And so I was just wondering if you could share with me what implementing these technologies could mean for employee safety? And what that could do for both the American Water ﬁnancials, as well as for the customer, because thinking about depending on how that's implemented, it could be a cost and not an investment.","Rich, that's a great question. First of all, I will start with and we tell this to all of our -- almost 7,000 employees. Number one thing is that every employee goes home to his/her family in as good shape as they came to work with. I don't believe that any company can be a great company, if people get hurt or killed at work period. Nothing else you do, I mean, it sends a message as to what value you put on human people and in the nature of our business, I think that's a core value that we all have to have.  That's what the value, and I mentioned, it's also a strategy. Strategically, as you mentioned, some of the things we're doing on technology, we're very excited, we actually launched an internal safety app last week. What this app does, is it allows people in the ﬁeld to be able to go and say -- and some of this is already functional, and the rest will be functional in a few months. I go out to a location, and it's a meter or a pump or something I'm not accustomed to, I can take a picture of it, it will code in and show me exactly what I need to do in terms of operational processes.  It will let me take a picture and send in and say this looks stranger, I need additional equipment, can someone send me equipment out. There is an investment in the technology, but the saving in terms of just fundamentally getting the job done right the ﬁrst time, avoiding injuries, avoiding the costs that come with injuries. Number one is the right thing to do to focus on employee, and by the way, safety for the general public. When you're water company, if safety is not number one, not just for employees, but also for the public in terms of the services you provide, and how you provide it, then I think that company is not going to be long-term ﬁnancially successful.  So we're very excited about what we're doing. And in terms of robotics, for example, a lot of the work that our folks on the front lines have to do is very manual, very physical. We're investing in technology. For example, putting devices on trucks that will open up some of the valve, that will open up and lift some of the meters that weight 50 pounds, 60 pounds, with aging workforce as others have, ﬁnding ways to reduce those tissue, those strain [ph] sprain. So yes, it is an upfront investment, but it is in the an investment that's paying oﬀ from a people standpoint, and its also we're ﬁnding paying oﬀ from a ﬁnancial standpoint.  Walter, you might want to add something?     Yes. Thank you, Susan. Safety is number one at our company, and the safety culture is just taking oﬀ at our company, because as Susan said, there's nothing more important than our employees   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   going home at the end of the day in the same condition in which they came in. And we talk about it, but it's also important that we go out and we demonstrate it with new technology.  And one of the things we're doing, we've talked in the past about drones, we're using drones to do things that before we used to do with people climbing on water tanks to inspect water tanks. And now we're using drones to inspect water tanks. Also above ground water line, we're using drones to inspect those. So we're looking at every available technology to make sure that what we're doing is in the -- is in the interest of our employees and is that we're doing in the safest way."
"That's interesting. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the time. It's really interesting. And again, great quarter. I Appreciate it. Thank you.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  And our last question today will be from Claire Zeng with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead."
"Yeah. So I wanted to do two quick housekeeping keeping items on the market-based businesses. So the ﬁrst is, I think with the Pivotal transaction, you guys are coming pretty close to the 15% mark for EPS contribution from your unregulated businesses. Just wanted to get your thoughts there on, if that's how you think about, that 15% or how that -- is that metric has little more ﬂexibility and the timing for that?","Yes, Claire, thank you for the question. And the way that -- what we disclosed as part of the Pivotal acquisition is that, although, this acquisition really kind of nearly doubles the size of our HOS business. We expect over the next ﬁve years to continue to see the entire market-based business, representing less than 15% of our total earnings per share. And so you're absolutely right there, that's what we see. And when we step back and strategically look at the overall risk   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   proﬁle of the company, the 15% to 20% of our market-based businesses is where our comfort zone is, and only up to 20%, if it is something that has a regulated type risk proﬁle.  So more regulated like in that, in that regard. And so that's where we are, that does not change our fundamental strategy at all in terms of our market-based business or the overall outlook of how large those businesses could become.     And Claire, this is Susan. And to add to that, when you think about how small market-based is for our total business, when we talk about doubling Homeowner Services as Linda said, it's still such a small part of our overall business, because regulated currently is about 90%, it takes a lot to really move that. So something like this really as Linda said, over the next ﬁve years, it could move as closer to the 15, but that's given that we don't do other thing. So -- and our goal is, we really prefer the 15%, which you said regulated like, that's something like Military, where you get the 50-year contract, so that you have some certainty there, that's what we consider to be regulated like. So right now, we're very comfortable with it being right at and below 15%."
"Got it. That's really helpful color. Thank you. And the second question is, since you've had a bit of time to review the Pivotal transaction. Just to be sure that you guys are still saying, it will be irritable in terms of earnings contribution, as in, it will be zero, maybe 3-6 9-12, just want to get some color on that.","Absolutely. So what we disclosed was that, we would be earnings neutral in 2018 after transition costs, and this is assuming that we closing the second quarter will be accretive in the ﬁrst full calendar year 2019. And then that accretion would steadily grow to about $0.12 per share by 2022.  Now that said, we will do a purchase price allocation upon closing, and these businesses as you are aware are capital-light, but they do have some capital investments in operational and customer system. And we plan to integrate those systems over time, and that will likely require accelerated depreciation, as we move to integrate the system. And that's why we've built in this gradual accretion. We need to close it ﬁrst, and then, we'll put together a more detailed integration plan."
