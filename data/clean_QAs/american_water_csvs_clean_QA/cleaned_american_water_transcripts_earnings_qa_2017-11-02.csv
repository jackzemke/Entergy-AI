Question,Answer
"Thank you. I have two questions. First one about M&A, municipal M&A. So two things, one is could you discuss any reaction you're seeing on the municipal front to the New Jersey bill that was recently passed. And secondly in Pennsylvania, the fair value legislation being somewhat questions in a pending asset sale case and how you think about the independent assessments of assets as you go forward and contemplate acquisitions in Pennsylvania. Thank you.","Sure, Angie, thank you. This is Susan. I will start on your last question and then turn it over to Walter and let him add anything to that and then address the issue of the water quality accountability act in New Jersey.  So with the fair market value in Pennsylvania, we think it's important to have an appraisal process that's fairly valued the systems we're acquiring and also sets a fair and sustainable base rate for our customers. We don't want a high appraisal value just to get a higher base rate and we don't -- we want the right base rate for us and our customers for the long-term.  We don't think system should be undervalued or overvalued, because we think either one hurts the process long-term in the spirit of the law. Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation requires appraisals to meet a uniform standard that the professional appraisal sector has and there have been some questions about, so what is the Pennsylvania PUC, what's their role, what's it not.  In our look and we have gotten an approval for McKeesport under that. We think that the Pennsylvania PUC can review the appraisals and determine if they comply. If appraisals don't comply, adjustments should be made, complying with standards as a check and balance that we think clearly the Public Utility Commission has authority for.  So in our recent PUC application for the McKeesport acquisition, we sat down with the parties, we sat down with PUC staﬀ, we sat down with consumer's advocate, we listened to their issues and we tried to ﬁnd a way forward that we could all live with and we are very pleased that this   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   was approved -- the settlement that we reached with the staﬀ, with the consumers' advocate were all approved by the Public Commission last week.  So, Walter do you want to add anything to that.     Yes, Susan. I'd like to emphasize, just the point of how we work cooperatively with the commissions and all the parties to get to a settlement that's fair for everybody. And I think the Scranton and sewer acquisition is an example of that. It's the ﬁrst acquisition in the state where we're dealing with the issue of combining sewer and storm water.  Currently Pennsylvania American Water doesn't have a combined tariﬀ for wastewater. We have a number of diﬀerent tariﬀs, because we've done so many acquisitions over the years. So working through the ﬁrst issue that I said, the combined sewer and storm water, and also working through not having a combined tariﬀ on the sewer side, it takes a lot of cooperation and a lot of dialog with the number of parties including the oﬃcer consumer advocate and commission staﬀ to get to the right place.  But I think we've done that, I'm conﬁdent we've done that, the team has done a great job in working with all the parties. I think it's another example of how we're working to make sure that we get a fair settlement for all and the Scranton Sewer Authority again is a perfect example of that.     And on the New Jersey Water Quality Accountability Act, it's been interesting because the legislation was passed this year and there hasn't -- it hasn't really gone through the regulatory whether it's the DEP Agency, what does that look like in terms of regulations? What does that look like in terms of the reporting and I think our best guess, Walter, is that we think maybe those deﬁning regulations maybe put out as early as the ﬁrst quarter of next year, the ﬁrst half of next year?     Yeah, that's right Susan. There is a requirement to have cybersecurity program in place by the ﬁrst quarter and then the asset management plan by January of 2019, but the DEP's working with all the other agencies to really come up with a really good detailed implementation plan.     So, I think until then, Angie it's a little bit early to say are we seeing an eﬀect. I think people are waiting to see what does this actually mean, what are the regs that I'm going to have to be in compliance with. So we're watching that carefully."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, and the last -- my last question, I haven't heard anything about Keystone Clearwater, I might have missed it actually. But I would have expected it to be mentioned as an earnings driver on the market based side, given the pickup in drilling. So could you tell us a little bit more about it?","Sure, sure. So I mentioned very brieﬂy my remarks, quarter-over-quarter, it's basically neutral. We are still projecting it to be accretive by the year-end because of the backlog of work that we have in the latter part of year -- of the year. We are seeing increased activity. We're actually seeing players that are picking up what they're doing. We're seeing more interest actually, it's interesting, our Keystone got out of the transportation, meaning the moving water by truck, and so we're seeing an uptick in the amount of the drillers who are now wanting to actually put pipe -- a lot of pipe above ground temporary piping. So we are seeing a pick up there. We believe that the latter half of the year that we're going to see a pickup in that and that will be accretive for the year."
"Thank you very much. I have a -- just a few quick questions here, and congrats on the quarter too, I thought it was great. Congrats on this Wright-Patterson Air Force Base win. On a very high level, can you please give us a sense of the timeframe for when price redeterminations from this contract would potentially positive -- positively impact the P&L?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. The price redetermination typically take place two to three years. They happen every two or three years in the contract. So the fact that we just won we've put in the bid for what we believe the upfront work needs to be done, to do some immediate projects, but we also look at the O&M. So you probably won't see a price redetermination for Wright-Patterson for another two to three years, because we just put in a bid, that in that bid, we look at the ﬁrst two to three years and what we think it will take to do some of the capital upgrades on the project."
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then I have a question pertaining to the acquisition strategy. Looking back at 2013 to 2016, versus the years of 2008 to 2012, I mean the number of acquisitions jumped there the past three years, but I'm wondering where the strategy comes in and kind of shifts and goes to, we're going to move away from the actual number of deals and just focus on the customer -- the number of customers moving forward, how many customers we pick up per transaction?  I'm wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of how we should balance thinking about in the model, the number of transactions per year versus the number of customers we pick up. Are we going to go more towards less transactions, more customers or vice versa?","Rich, Walter. Thanks for the question. We've said that's a 1% to 2% EPS growth from customer -- acquisitions is about 30,000 or 60,000 customers across our entire system. Our focus has been on growing our business through acquisitions, adjacent to where we operate, and also looking at our sweet spot as we deﬁne from 5,000 the 30,000 customers.  We've also had a renewed focus on waste water. And over the last three to four years, we focused on buying wastewater systems in areas where we serve water customers. So we're going to continue to do some of the smaller ones where it makes sense in around our footprint. Our real focus is on the larger 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 to 30,000 customers to make sure that these acquisitions are more of sizable, they move the needle, and they represent I think opportunities for us to improve the systems that we buy.  Many of these systems need signiﬁcant investment and the systems of 5,000 to 30,000 seem to need more investment than some of the others. So that's really our focus."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay.,"And if I can add to that Rich, one of the other things that we've been working on with this increase in acquisitions over the last few years is how do we integrate them eﬀectively, whether or not it's a smaller system or a larger system, and so we've really been working to enhance our process so that it is seamless, irregardless -- regardless of the size of the customer additions.     And Rich to your point, Walter again. You can look at how we're executing on our strategy, buying wastewater systems in area where we're serving water system. And I think Scranton and McKeesport are two perfect examples of that where we've been serving the water customers for decades, and the opportunities came up to buy the wastewater systems because we can add value to the communities. And that was the case that we made and the communities agreed and we purchased -- we have purchased or will purchase real soon, McKeesport on that basis."
"Okay, great, thank you guys. It's great color. And then couple more questions here. Thank you again for taking the call. For the nonregulated segment as a whole, looking at a few of the investor decks this year, American was citing that the nonregulated segment, the market based businesses, could potentially be 15% of earnings by 2021. Is that somewhat back half of the next ﬁve years loaded or could we expect to model that in where it's a straight line layer in growth over the next ﬁve years?","So Rich, at this point, that is the guidance we've given as you probably know when we've promoted during this call and we'll continue what was December 12 is now December 11. We will update our ﬁve-year plan on December 11th on our guidance call, and give further color to that and answer that question."
"But the guidance, it is still your guidance though?",That is still our guidance at this point.
"Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. And then just the last one. I mean it's not a secret here the American has been greater cutting in costs. I mean the target rate continuously goes down, the stretch target at what point though, I mean at some point, it's got a kind of stop right? And so where does that come in, is that -- could that be 20 years away, 15 years away, or could we maybe expect over the next couple of years, one of the investor days, Susan you announced, we're going to bring down this O&M expense again over the next ﬁve years even lower?","So we believe we can continually improve our business Rich. We believe that the water industry in general, is a little behind the electric and gas from the technology standpoint. We have really ramped up our technology integration and we've got some very exciting projects going on. And at this point we see a lot of opportunity to continue the eﬃciency gains that we've also seen in the last few years.  Walter you want to add anything?     Yeah. Rich, the improvements will never stop and we have a continuous improvement mindset. We're focused on every cost in this business, and through the uses of technology and best practices we're going to continue to drive cost down for our customers. So that's why I spotlight, some of the things we're doing the business every quarter, just to show you this is a continuous improvement mindset."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's great. Thank you very much for the time guys. I really appreciate it.,"Thank you, Rich.  Operator  The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Not too bad. So far it is going well, so happy there.","I think the (inaudible) community loved [ph] him some another [ph] day, don't they?"
"When Walter, do you think you might get clarity in Missouri regarding the request futured featured test here. Do you have to wait until the ﬁnal order or kind of where you get the thumbs-up or down at some point earlier in the procedural schedule.","I think we'll have indications through our negotiations, but again, it won't be ﬁnal until we get the ﬁnal order. So when that case is settled later in the next year."
"Okay. But, so I mean it might be in like the settlement phase or so?","It could be, but then, we open the comment on it, that's the question. So, I will look to when we receive the order."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. And then lastly, congrats, Linda on the debt reﬁnancing deal. Just curious if there is any earnings beneﬁt in the near term from the interest savings prior to the lower debt cost ﬂowing through to -- in here a bit?","Yeah. In 2017, in addition to the one-time charge that we had for the make whole of the parent of $0.02 per share. I mentioned earlier we had a negative impact of about $0.01 from the overlap of interest expense in the third quarter. Now, we do expect that we will see some beneﬁts in the fourth quarter that will slightly exceed that negative carry that we had in the third quarter, but it's less than $0.01. And then going forward, when we put forward our 2018 guidance, it will be included in there."
"Okay. But I mean there is perhaps some timing beneﬁts before it kind of ﬂows. I guess, all through to rate payers through the rate case process. I guess?","Right. And remember, the majority of this will be for the beneﬁt of our customers and then as we go through our rate cases that will true up. And keep in mind, we talk about the fact that for every dollar of O&M, we say, we can put $7 of capital in the ground. This is great, because this means that with this decades long need we have for investment, this is more investment we can make that doesn't impact the customer bill. So that's the way we look at this."
"Right, right. And then is there a portion that does ﬂow through to the parent that's kind of an ongoing beneﬁt from this deal?",Yes. There will be. We've reﬁnanced 428 million of debt that matured in October that was related to the parent. And we will continue to see the beneﬁts of that lower cost going forward.
"A quick question on military services, has there been any update on the DoD budgeting process. I know there's been some movement on the federal budget. I'm wondering if there's any movement on that front?","Yes, there has been. The sequestration was formally discontinued and so the commanding oﬃcers at the bases are hoping to have larger budgets, eﬀective October 1st. They are getting more money. We think it will be more of a gradual increase in capital for infrastructure, because what's happened in the three, four years of the sequestration their budgets were signiﬁcantly reduced and it wasn't just infrastructure projects like ours that got put on the back burner. They had several other training, warﬁghter training diﬀerent things that now are in the queue.  So we are hearing, there is a pickup it will eventually become -- there will be more infrastructure projects like the type we do on the bases. But the initial increase in funding will go toward more of their mission critical items that they have for the military, men and women there. So, yes the sequestration was discontinued. They are seeing higher not quite up to what it was before the sequestration. We do think it will beneﬁt us, but it will be gradual as they put those additional funds to use."
