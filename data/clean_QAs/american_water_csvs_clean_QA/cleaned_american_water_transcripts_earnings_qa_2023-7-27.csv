Question,Answer
"Great. The ﬁrst question I had was, I know there was a good number of changes on the drivers within full year '23 guidance. If you could just unpack like where were you seeing that better revenue net O&M strength in the year-to-date or second half, wherever it lands.","Yes. Let me comment ﬁrst and certainly, John can add to it. I think really it's -- you can look on the revenue side, primarily timing of rate cases and the resulting revenue increases and then   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   also additional costs that we have built into those rate cases. We've been talking quite a bit about inﬂationary impacts and higher chemical costs and production costs, and we've been successful in getting those higher costs built into a number of the cases we did last year.  And as those cost increases have gone up, the associated revenue recovery has gone up. So I'd say those are the primary drivers. On the sort of ﬁnancing cost side, those changes really driven by just the timing of primarily this long-term debt issue we just did and then higher costs associated with short-term debt ﬁnancing. I think, John, that probably covers the main ones. Any other items to add?     Yes, I think it does. That's right. Paul, we started to pick up New Jersey revenue last September, so that moderates year-over-year growth. And I'd say on from an inﬂation perspective, we're starting to see production costs moderate as we've come through the second quarter here."
"Okay. Great. And then on the balance sheet side, I know a great job cleaning up, taking out all that short-term debt. On the long term, 1 question I had was, I noticed you changed the language slightly to equal to or less than 60% debt to total cap versus before it's just less than 60%. Does that mean you anticipate that trending up closer to 60%? Just overall thoughts on kind of where you stand on that going through the long-term plan?","Yes. Paul, no real change there as we're thinking about it. As you know, we're raising ﬁnancing in a periodic sort of manner. So we do expect to trend up over time until we reset again with equity, but no signiﬁcant change there."
"So ﬁrst, maybe -- you mentioned the rainy July in New York State. I mean it's for us living in the Mid-Atlantic, it seems like it's been the weather pattern in New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So is there any sense how -- if there's an oﬀset to that $0.07 weather beneﬁt from the second quarter thus far in the third quarter?","Yes, Angie, we don't have any sort of prediction so far on impacts in July. I'd just remind you again that our outlook for the year remains on track to hit our expectations, again, on a weather- normalized basis. So just a bit early to tell what impact July may have across the entire territory."
"Okay. Secondly, the exchangeable bonds that you guys did, I mean they came at a low coupon likely -- I mean, probably not something that you have considered in your guidance. So should I think that it's actually a beneﬁt to guidance? And also, how does that tie up to the ﬁnancing of those 2 big acquisitions that you expect to close later this year? Were they always planned to close still in '23. Again, I'm just trying to see if there's any beneﬁt from an interest expense perspective.","I'll answer the second part ﬁrst and then ask John to sort of come the ﬁnancing impacts. We continue to look very closely at the timing of those 2 transactions. And we've always expected them to be sort of at or close to year-end. That's still our expectation. That's been built in our plan all along. The regulatory process is a bit unpredictable, but we feel conﬁdent about the ability to get those wrapped up right towards the end of this year. John, you want to comment on the ﬁnancing piece.     Angie, I would just say on the ﬁnancing piece that we set our plan last fall at a time when we can't predict interest rates. And I think where we've come out on the convert is consistent with our guidance and our aﬃrmation of 2023."
"Okay. And my last question on the municipal M&A. So you've been very successful at those very large acquisitions even though some other companies have stumbled from those. Is this very much sort of a deal speciﬁc issue. So there's no any deterioration in the regulatory environment or the receptivity of municipalities to sell large assets? I mean, again, we're trying to see if there's a trend, you seem to be way more successful than others in large municipal M&A?","Yes. I think, Angie, I'll say what I always say here, I think we are very good at it. I think we spend a lot of time in these communities, cultivating the relationship. Our teams are very much embedded in these communities. I think they work closely with communities to deﬁne the need and to come up with the best solutions to meet those needs. I think that is continuing to be our strongest asset as it relates to acquisitions. I think the prospect for deals also continues to   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   evolve. And I'd say these larger deals have come about I think because circumstances warranted. It doesn't signal a change in our strategy. It doesn't signal a change in what I believe to be the environment either for opportunity or regulatory acceptance or enthusiasm for deals generally. So I'd just say they're circumstantial, and our expertise, I think, continues to be a real advantage we have here."
"Regarding the Indiana rate case proceeding on schedule, are you expecting revenue recommendations from interveners? So is that coming up?","Well, I think the normal process would be to have testimony ﬁled with all the parties in the case, sort of later this summer, early fall. So I think the normal process, we would expect to see sort of full recommendations or positions taken by the various parties through that process."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it. Thank you.,"All right. Thanks, Greg.  Operator  The next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning. It's actually James on for Shar. I guess, just -- First question was just on the PFAS ﬁgures, so the $1 billion. I guess, could you just speak to maybe the puts and takes as it relates to your ability to update with the capital plan on the third quarter call. What, I guess, a little bit more color on how we should think about what of that $1 billion can roll into the forthcoming plan?","Yes, it's a good question and it's something obviously we're continuing to work on. And Cheryl alluded to this in her comments, we would expect to have quite a bit more visibility on our third [ph] quarter call, partly because our evaluation is certainly ongoing and our continued analysis of our various facilities to see where we may have exposure and what sort of treatment may be necessary. So that process is continuing.  But I'd also just say this is the time of year where we're doing all of our work relative to our ﬁnancial plan. All the various updates throughout the business, and our capital planning is certainly a big part of that. So our normal cadence would be to continue to work through that planning process and be complete with it in the early fall with the expectation that we would roll out our guidance and expectations for the next year and then the next 5-year and even 10- year outlook relative to capital when we get to that third quarter call.  So we're just on sort of a normal cadence from a planning perspective. And then, as I said, on the evaluation of potential exposure. We're just still in the process of doing that work. And Cheryl, anything to add there?     No. I would just say that we also continue to collect samples at all these locations to just verify what the levels are and look for any seasonal kinds of variations and such as that. So we're still drilling into the details, but as Susan said, as we go through our regular planning process, we're using our prioritization models and deciding what could we move out or not move out. And so it's a lot of work and the teams really dug into the details right now.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   .Yes. And I think that is the key. We just need to complete that risk analysis piece, and we'll see how much of this $1 billion ultimately results in incremental capital expansion of the plan versus just shifting to later periods, shifting other work to later periods."
"And I guess just the follow-up to that, too, is just the -- so we've got a few diﬀerent regulations, EPA, a little uncertain over the circular designations. But has any of this changed your near-term approach to wastewater M&A?","No, I don't think so. We're continuing to look at that as a very important part of our strategy and continuing to look at those opportunities. We think there's a good set of opportunities in that space, largely driven again by just the aging infrastructure and how many of those systems were built initially and then many of them coming to sort of the end of their useful life. So we think the opportunities are plentiful. I would say it doesn't change our strategy relative to that. But I do think, as we think about sort of total capital allocation and from a risk perspective and a growth opportunity perspective, we'll manage all of those opportunities within our capital ﬁnancing capabilities."
