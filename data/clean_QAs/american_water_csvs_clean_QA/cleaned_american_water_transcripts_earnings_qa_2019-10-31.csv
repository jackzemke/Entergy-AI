Question,Answer
"Susan, can you just touch a little bit on sort of some of the publicly available data in the media that we're seeing around JEA and sort of your interest there? Maybe just a high-level structure of your bid, because it does have an electric business so curious if you're bidding for the entire system or just the water portion of it, and just how you're sort of thinking about that process, because it's actually turning out to be a little bit more competitive than we originally thought.","So Shar, one thing that I will remind everybody is that JEA has publicly announced it would be in the next round of participation and we're very respectful of JEA and their process and so we can't really comment any further on anything additional about JEA. And all I will say is that we've not made any changes to our previously-communicated business model strategy."
"Got it. And then just maybe it's somewhat of a large transaction. Is there any disclosures, assuming that you're the winning bidder, how you would ﬁnance that transaction?","Yeah, we really can't comment about anything on the process at this point."
"Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just around the military services, congrats Walter on West Point and obviously the Joint Base San Antonio deals. Is there anything else for the balance of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   the year that we should sort of be thinking about? And maybe just quickly on how we're thinking about the opportunity set?","You know at one point, we had said we expected an award of up to three bases. We don't like to predict what the Department of Defense will do. The two that were awarded this year that we won, both came in September. We're not sure if there will be any others that are awarded. We do currently have ﬁve outstanding RFPs that we expect over the next one, two, three, four, ﬁve years. We do think there may be some that are awarded in 2020."
"Got it, got it. And then just lastly on California. Is there any remaining approvals around the desalination project, there has been, I guess a little bit of push back at the local level, but is there anything. Do you guys need from a permit or approvals to sort of move forward.","Hi. Shar, Walter here. We need the approval from the California Coastal Commission their next meeting is scheduled on November 14 and they're going to take it up at that meeting. So, that's the next approval that we need."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hey, so quick question, can you elaborate a little bit more on Indiana and the prospective impacts of any legislation in that state to get going here?","Well, we're really encouraged by legislation. That's why I wanted to highlight it on the call. We think it will open up more opportunities, and I think there is a recognition that American Water can play a role there in providing water services for communities are having trouble doing it on their own. So it's consistent with legislation that's been in Indiana and across the country, about how we can play a role to help the communities."
"But just in terms of its translating back to more tangible opportunities, it's still a little bit on the wait and see?","Yes, I mean well, we think that there'll be more discussions, but it's going to take time to work this through and have the communities realize that they do have these options. But it's just part of the overall favorable legislation that we're seeing across the country, because again, I think legislators are realizing that we can play a signiﬁcant role in helping these communities."
"There were some media articles out there about water quality, so I wanted to just check in on that.","Oh sure, right. So I think what you're referring to is, there is a group called the Environmental Working Group that, rather than looking at EPA guidelines and regulations or state regulation,s or even some of the unregulated contaminants that EPA is looking at, I think they have come up with some of their own standards and they've run stories that, gee, even though we have all these water quality results, they're not living up to whatever standard this group has decided is appropriate. So I mean, our response to that is that we take water quality and safety very seriously. The EPA establishes drinking water standards to protect the public health. We treat and deliver water that is meets or surpasses every one of those, and in fact, the EPA has a   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   special program that's called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which looks at another 40 contaminants that really aren't regulated, but we voluntarily have adopted those so that they can look and see what the impacts of those are. We meet or surpass all of our states.  At the end of the day, there are a lot of groups out there who may decide that they're going to set their own goals and their own policies, but we really can't follow what every individual group does along those lines. So, but we are meeting all of the EPA, we are voluntarily adopting 40 that aren't even regulated but that we're continuing to monitor, and we're acting is if they're regulated, and meeting all state requirements."
"Good morning, Susan. Just a follow-up on Shar's question on the military bases, congratulations on the win there. What's the, can you just help us think about the size of those bases relative to the existing ﬂeet of bases that you have currently? And how should we think about margins and revenues coming in? Is it more sort of a 12 to 16 months lag from here on?","Yeah. So Durgesh, Joint Base San Antonio, because it is comprised of two Army and two Air Force Bases, I believe is the largest that we have in our 16 bases. In terms of the 50 year, over 700 million revenue, it's the largest that we've had. And West Point is a nice-sized military installation also. We do know that just like across the US, where there are infrastructure needs, we're ﬁnding that the military bases, that a lot of their infrastructure is from right after World War II when most of the military bases were built. So if you remember, we make money three ways with the military bases. There is the 50-year O&M contract, then when we take over there is typically upgrades we need to make. And then any future projects that are capital or working capital on these bases, we then can add that as part of the O&M and we get paid to do those, plus a fee.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So what we're ﬁnding is the military bases also need infrastructure upgrades and investment, just like the rest of the country does. So we're looking at these in terms of all three of those areas. So we're very pleased in Texas, we have Fort Hood, which is also, I believe, one of the top two or three largest bases we have. So it's very exciting to us to be able to grow in that respect. And then we look, and the Air Force and the Army continue to be quite active. There's a lot of opportunity in Navy, we believe. They have really not done much privatization. So we're stepping back, looking at the bases and facilities across the country. Again, we have ﬁve outstanding RFPs that we're already in the middle of the process and we're looking to any new ones that may come up in the next year."
"Thanks, Susan. What about the margins? I guess I was really asking that the margins from the two bases that were just awarded this past quarter, when should we model those hitting the bottom line? Is it 12 to 16 months out from here, or longer than that?","So ﬁrst of all, we don't talk about margins. However, it's a great point while technically we assume these contracts on September 30th, there is pretty much a standard eight-month transition for each of these bases, and by June 30th of next year we will be fully operational on those bases with the full amount of revenue that we get from those bases at that point."
"Okay, perfect. And then just one quick clariﬁcation. Did we lowered the capex guidance for this year? I'm not sure if I'm reading this correctly.","No, no. And you know what? So it may be a little confusing. What we did on the chart is we broke out regulated acquisitions capital from the infrastructure. So we are still looking at around 1.9 billion, which is what we had guided to. So it's 1.9 billion total, and what we expect that break down to be is around $1.7 billion into our existing regulated infrastructure, and probably 250 million, 260 million on regulated acquisitions."
"Awesome. Thank you so much, that's super helpful.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Our last question today comes from Richard Verdi of Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead."
"Thanks, Susan. So I'm quite clear on things, and some of my other questions have been answered, but I do want to actually revert back to a question I would periodically ask the past, for an update due to some of the events that transpired during the quarter. And to avoid being granular, I'm going to ask this is on a very high level. So when we think about the company's portfolio, obviously it has a nice portfolio of states, given the quarter report, given quarterly reports going back for many quarters. But that doesn't mean that there's not opportunity in states outside the portfolio. On the other hand, the states where the company has a footprint are very compelling from a need to upgrade infrastructure perspective, and also on the regulatory front. So moving forward in the near-to-intermediate-term is a strategy may be more to work within the states in which the company operates, and try to expand within those states? Or could we maybe expect the company to more and more announce it's of trying to enter other states?","Hi, Rich. Walter here. It's really -- it's really both. We continue to invest in our infrastructure in the states where we operate. We continue to look for opportunities in those states, but we also look outside our footprint. And for us to enter a new state, we really need a good business environment, a good regulatory environment, and then the opportunity to grow to a certain size because we just don't want to buy a small system and just be, just have that system. So we want to be able to expand in the state. So we're looking at that, and we actively look at that, but we do both. And as far as growth goes inside, our growth, we're investing, as we said, 1.7 billion this year and we're going to be spending over $250 million to acquire systems in our footprint, which is I think tremendous and just shows that the dedication and the value that we're providing to these communities.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And what is exactly right. And to remind many of you and I think we have said this in the past, when we look at and we do have a corporate business development group and we're always looking at every state across the country. We actually have them kind of in a looking at the regulatory environment. The business environment, but the thing that typically will slow us down from going into new state is we believe it's important that within ﬁve years. We have 50,000 customer connections because part of our brand is aﬀordability and the fact that we're looking at O&M eﬃciency and if you just have a couple of 3,000 in a state is very hard to get those eﬃciencies. So we're looking at whether we would go into a new state. Those are kind of the three gates that we have, that we would go through."
"Okay, that's great, I appreciate the color, guys. Thank you. And great quarter again. Thank you very much.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  The next question today comes from David Peters of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."
"Just, just back to the desal project in California. I know you guys mentioned you still need the permits to get approved there, but just given that the to the staﬀ recommended denial, can you maybe just provide a little bit more color? And I guess if you were to not get the permits, how does that kind of impact the project and the capital plan going forward?","Yeah, I'll take that question. This is Walter. The primary reason that the staﬀ voted no was they see the expansion of the Pure Water Monterey Recycling Project is capable of providing suﬃcient water to meet the future demands. We don't agree with that, and it's actually not in line with what the PUC discovered as well, as far as the future demand. So that's the real area of contention. And so, at the November 14th hearing and meeting, we're going to be putting our views forward on that. But I mean, that's where the disagreement comes in. And we actually had an environmental impact report that stated the demand was much higher as well.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
