Question,Answer
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Congratulations on being able to keep guidance despite this unfavorable weather here. I guess that is my question in a sense that, a big part of the reason you were able to maintain the guidance was cost management. How sustainable are the cost cuts or were you just putting thumb on the expenses this year to kind of oﬀset the weather?","No Neil as we talked about before, our whole focus in cost management is around driving excellence through business process and continuous improvement. So the things that we are doing they're not one oﬀs, they're not slash and burns, they're not just headcount reductions, they're geared around changing what we pose as the three questions. Is what we're doing is it any value? If not, stop doing it. If it does add value is it being done through an eﬃcient process? If not, let's change the process and once it's being done through an eﬃcient process what's the error rate and how do we reduce the errors to zero? That helps create a systematic approach to the way in which we think about our costs and cost drivers and one of the things and Walter may want to make a few comments about it, we're still working on is this integration across all of our states to take the best practice in one place and move them in a standardized way across the other states.     Thanks, Jeﬀ. This is Walter. We're as Jeﬀ said; taking best practices because we're doing things wonderfully in many parts of our company we're expanding that across our entire footprint in reg operations and throughout the entire business. Because we can learn back and forth in the market based businesses through regulated operations. One of the other things too, is the continuous improvement culture. Really focused on driving improvements long-term, and we have a lean leader program where we have more than 100 people throughout our company looking at ways to improve our processes and looking at ways that we can reduce errors. That is contributing signiﬁcantly now and will contribute signiﬁcantly in the future as we root out errors and we become more eﬃcient.     And just one other thing. While that is our, that is our baseline. And we believe that provides us a great deal of ability to minimize operational cost increases and add more capital to the base and that is the basis for rate increases. As we implement SAP just as end of last year we had some additional expenses incurred because of that recovery and that reduced productivity. We'll see some of that and we have seen some of that this year. You don't necessarily see it because we're even doing a better job in reducing our other costs so net-net, we're still down. But we will see those kinds of things and we'll make sure that we pay attention to them."
"Perfect and the other question around dividend growth strategy, obviously a double digit dividend step up this year. How do you think about the pace of dividend growth from here and where you want to be relative to the 50% to 60% payout ratio?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yes Neil, this is Susan. As we've said before, we have two guiding principles. One is that we correlate the growth of our dividend along with our EPS growth, and we have been very transparent about that, and we have a target of saying between 50% and 60% payout. And as you know we're on the low end of that so we have head room."
"Okay, and then the ﬁnal question of the California project in Monterey; can you provide an update of where you stand there?","Yes, I'll ask Walter to add a few things them me put a few on the table. Frankly, things are moving well. It's always, this is the project that will cause rates to increase in this double-digit fashion, so it's under a lot of scrutiny and it's obviously a water constrained area particularly in Monterey. But this project is in fact moving forward quite well. We would expect a commission- recommended decision by August next year.     August 2014. Right Jeﬀ, and there is along the way obviously there's a lot of things that have to occur for that to happen, but there is informal hearings scheduled for early December and we have come to settlements with a number of parties out in the Monterey area and during the hearings, is when everyone will be able to put their case forward. We feel conﬁdent that we're working cooperatively with the people in Monterey to get the right solution.     Two other things we're in the bid process right now for the constructor for that project, and so, that is going along quite well and the testing the initial results of testing relative to the aquifer are, have been very promising. So these pins, the pins that kind of stand in the way are getting knocked down we still have a few to go."
"Hey. Good morning, Jeﬀ, and Susan, and Walter. Following up on Neil's question just a bit, so should we interpret the guidance revision or narrowing today as implying that results would have been in the upper half of the original range had it not been for the weather impact?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","You can probably look at it that way. I mean we said that weather is worth $0.03 to $0.06 a share and we narrowed it to basically the mid-point of the range.     What we prefer to say that we're closer to the end of the year, have a little more look into where we would end up, and so we are good with the range."
"So when we look at costs next year, not from, I guess, the O&M Eﬃciency ratio standpoint, but just an absolute basis with implementation costs falling oﬀ, I mean where do you expect it to be? Is it ﬂat is it still modestly up?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","I assume, I trust that you will be with us on December 17, and we'll talk about that."
"How did I know that answer was coming? Okay. Quickly, just going to the military services group and the contact modiﬁcations. It sounds like they're kind of meaningful, something that is going to provide a boost in 2014 and maybe 2015 results. Is that accurate and then does that kind of cause a head wind potentially in 2016 or so, if you get similar size and contracts moving forward?","Well, I guess, two things. You're right about the timing. Most of these projects are two, one to two and occasionally three years so for example; the major rebuild on the wastewater system at one of the installations that could slip beyond two years. So, but you know, we're always hoping, and looking, and working with our customers on the bases as to what will occur in the next year. The other piece is, as we've said before, there are a number of military installations that are out for bid today. Now we don't go after every single military installation we go after the ones where we believe we truly can add value and that value can be recognized through the size of the contract. We have quite a lot going on in that area and we want to make sure that the ones we take on we can truly excel at, and we have a number of those out in the bid stage today with awards that could happen as early as, let's say early ﬁrst of next year through 2014, so what we look to is to be able to expand the base of business through the addition of new bases to the portfolio, and that this additional modiﬁcation capital is really supplemental to the fundamentals that we have within the business."
"And then last question on the parent debt balance. What is it, I guess, to not associate the subsidiary rate base. Where are you going to be year-end and how does that compare to where you were say Q2 before taking some of these actions?","Right, well, Jonathan, if you remember, it was about $1.2 billion, which we reported $750 million, matured, matures in 2017 and another $450 million matures in 2018. What we did was take out   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   $226 million of the $750 million that was set to mature in 2017."
"And then you said later in the quarter by year-end, you are going to take out some more, is that correct?","Well what we had, not necessarily of that parent company debt, what I mentioned is that we have, we issued redemption notices on November 1, last Friday, for about $149.8 million, $150 million of bonds that or debt that has coupon rates at 8.25% and 10%. That is going to be a nice pickup and we have maturing debt of about $101 million by December 21."
"Just with home owner services becoming increasingly important and a bigger part of your business, can you talk about the risk proﬁle of the business? Meaning, are you wearing the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   event risk or are simply oﬀering a product that is wrapped by a third party insurer and then do your policies cover like systematic or any catastrophic events that could impact a large number of your customers at once?","Good questions Kevin, a couple of things; no we don't use third party reinsurance we basically self insure, but most of these are capped. There is a cap on the total amount that we're exposed too so we'll do the repair or replacement up to X dollars, so that is the way that we manage the ultimate exposure but really, the primary exposure, is our contractor management process, which is a very thorough vetting of both, what's done, how it's done, the oversight of that, and who's doing it. We don't have unlimited exposure for situations we also, obviously will look at, we price diﬀerently in diﬀerent areas. There is not a uniformed price across the United States, and that is because systems are diﬀerent. Their age is diﬀerent; the soil chemistry will be diﬀerent. So, they will have diﬀerent risk patterns. That gets taken into account and as well as the cost of repairs gets taken into account in that pricing strategy.  Are there limitations on the coverage? Absolutely. And then they run from things like you have to have been a customer for usually a 30 days sometimes it's longer than that before any claim can be processed and that is to help ensure that we don't have somebody who realizes they have a leak and try to pick up, I'm sorry, I didn't use that word, warranty for it. And then it also goes to certain limitations relative to acts of God and things of that nature so we protect ourselves in a variety of diﬀerent ways relative to what that exposure can be.     And added to what Jeﬀ said, we have a robust system where we evaluate frequency and severity of each of the events and we look at where those events are, we look at severity, in fact this year we disclosed in an early Q at the end of the First Quarter, that we had a spike in severity so we started managing looking at where that was, evaluating contractors, and we actually were able to remedy that and it's back to its historic rates. We have a really strong system around managing those risks by looking at what is happening, where it's happening, and to just point how we process.     Some of you met Sharon Cameron who runs our market based business. She came out of home owner services and was instrumental in its start-oﬀ and bringing it to this level. She'll be with us at the December 17 meeting so you get a chance to visit with her."
"Great. And just so I'm clear on the ﬁnal part of what you said, you do not insure against like act of God, right, like hurricanes and earthquakes, and large-scale events like that?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yes there is always deﬁnitions about what is included and which kind of thing, but the answer to that is generally yes."
Do you have like a notional like value at risk measurement that we could follow?,"You know that is a good question. We do not put one forward but, you know what, Kevin that is something we want to think about because there are things that we look at but we don't make those available. And part of it is the business size, but we want to think about that. Good, good job."
"It should come as no surprise that I would like to talk about regulatory strategy. If I look at the last two years the amount of rate awards you have gotten in total has been 100 to 120 of rate cases separate from the surcharges even if we assume that the Pennsylvania settlement is completed we're looking at a total amount of rate increases awarded of only about a third of that, I am wondering is this just an oﬀ year are we looking at the new normal? How should we think about your rate case cycle and how you manage rate increases versus infrastructure surcharge increases?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Good question, Heike. Let me pose it in I guess three ways. Remember, if I go back 3, four years ago, the amount we were generating from automatic adjustment clauses was about 13% of the capital investment every year. That was a lower level of capital investment than we're at today and today it's about 40% of all invested capitals coming back through those mechanism. So, the importance of those mechanisms has, and this has been very targeted and strategic, has increased relative to the total amount of rate relief, if you will. The second one is we went through a period of rate-case catch up as we've talked about before, and we're largely out of that today and our focus is in moving the rate cases that we do ﬁle to a much higher percentage of capital cost recovery rather than operating cost recovery.  You'll remember the slide that Susan used that would show if you go back through 2008 though 2010 the, I think it was 56% of the recovery was really operating costs and only about 44% was capital costs whereas now, it's 94% is capital cost, so I guess the point there would be its I am not sure it's eﬀective to look just at the dollars of rate recovery, it's what is driving those dollars, is it capital or operating costs? Also, then what are the other ways in which that revenue is picked up? Because one of the things we're very focused on is to ensure we can drive eﬃciency in our business to minimize the rate-of-rate increase while getting the capital investment that needs to made in the ground.     And remember, if most of your rate case is capital the more of that you can actually recover through surcharges, then you can extend out your general rate cases, and again, not to be another advertisement, but on December 17, we will give a look into incentive that we think can be covered next year."
"Great. Thank you. And kind of as a follow-up question, we used to think of you as loosely on a two-year rate case cycle for most states outside of California. Has that strategy been revisited now or if we're capital focused on rate increases, does the two-year cycle still make sense.","Well it's not just; it also involves the DSIC treatment in that state, et cetera. I think you will see slightly longer because we really were on an 18; to 24-month. You will see slightly longer periods in some states it may go to three years and other states, in other states it will be 2.5, some states will still, will have to, may stay in the 2-year range because we don't have those kinds of cost recovery mechanisms or we also have an issue, of it's not a future test year state, we've got declining usage, so it will vary by state, but I think the drum beat of 18 to 24 months is broken. That's not our future."
"Hey Jeﬀ, just a little more color on the military business then the homeowner services, relative to this year could you give us events of how they're coming through are they kind of on plan, ahead of plan? Just a little color there would be helpful.","Well I think home owner services has done better than we really expected in terms of the rate of subscriptions in the New York area. I just, we really didn't expect that it would be as well- received as it has been and I think part of that is because of the strength of the partnership with New York City in the administration that it has been, they have done a lot to help promote it. And then picking up Nashville, which is another opportunity for a 175,000 customers, we're pleased with the way home owner services has come long and their strong performance. On the military side, you know I tell you, the folks that we have that run that business do a very, very strong job on behalf of their customers, the military, and both in terms of holding cost down and also in terms of quality of performance and bringing home enough of a return that we say this is a good business to be in. I would say that the issues of federal budgets, sequestration to some of extent and then the stand down for awhile does, did impact some timing issues, and so for example; there is an award we thought may have already originally it would have been made by now it's delayed a bit. And it has nothing to do with policy it's all got to do with people being able to be at the oﬃce and do the things necessary to issue awards so it has that side maybe has moved a little slower, but it really hasn't impacted the performance of our overall business and as I said the mods that we received recognize that these bases are old and they need capital investment and we're going to be there to provide it, so we're pleased with the kind of awards that we received in that regard. So both of those business lines have had a very good year so far.     And to add to that, Steve, you know after the First Quarter we talked about that some of the capital projects were delayed, there still will be a certain amount of those that will roll over into 2014. We have made up some of the ground, but we feel our folks in that area feel like that which won't get done this year will all roll over in 2014.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. One other question, we saw over the last I think few weeks an Illinois law that might support more privatization of distressed water companies and then Indiana might be looking at one. Can you talk more about is that something that you're seeing and could be signiﬁcant for you? Or more marginal?","You know Steve, one of the things that we have got built into our strategy and we will talk a little bit about this in December, but is we have our key strategic objectives and metrics associated with it, but we have enablers. It's the enablers that we strategically focus on because without those enablers, that objective is really interesting but you can't get there, so for example, having legislation pass that allows the, a premium to be paid on a troubled system in order to get that under good control and under the state's oversight is one of the enablers. Another enabler is the law that we got passed in Pennsylvania that was geared around being able to roll wastewater rate bases into overall rates to be able, so that the repair work that you have to do with a newly acquired wastewater system doesn't cause such rate shock by a 1005 rate increase just on the few customers that are served by that wastewater system, or the legislation that we got passed this year down in Tennessee which opens the door for frankly, the ﬁling that we just made requesting a number of diﬀerent elements of cost recovery and capital recovery, so these enablers are very targeted. We look at each state, so we have general theorems about what we want to get done, but what you need to do in each state will be diﬀerent. In some states, we may not make it the ﬁrst time so we go back, or we work with the commission and ﬁnd out that the commission understands it. They may not be willing to do it unless the legislature speaks, okay, so we go work with the legislature, so there is a very speciﬁc plan around those items, and they're all geared to open up the pathways for what we believe can be that continued strong growth. Not only of our business, but of frankly, better service to customers."
"Great. Thanks a lot.  Operator  And Mr. Sterba, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue.","Well thank you all very much for joining us today. Have a great rest of the week and for those of you that we see in December, we'll look forward to talking then. And if you have any questions, you all, obviously, you know who to call, Ed. If anything comes up in between. Take care.  Operator  And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. this does conclude the conference call for today. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect your line.
