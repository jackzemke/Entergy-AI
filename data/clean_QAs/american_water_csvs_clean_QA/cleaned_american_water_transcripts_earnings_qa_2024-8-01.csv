Question,Answer
"Good morning, Susan. Susan, thank you for all the color you provided as it relates to Pennsylvania rate case. I'm just thinking about how, if at all, this changes your regulatory strategy in the state, the timing of rate cases, the ask, the capital spending, how should we think about that just thinking about the impacts of the order?","Yes, I think it's a great question. It's obviously something we're going to continue to analyze very closely as we continue to work on our plan update for the fall. But as we said in prepared remarks, the need is not going away. The state of infrastructure and the need for continued focus on improvements and resiliency is not declining in any way. So we know we have investments that need to be made in Pennsylvania. We will need to look, though, at how we -- how and how much capital we allocate to the state of Pennsylvania relative to our other states given this low ROE result in Pennsylvania. It is a real balance of shareholder expectations and the allocation of capital that we really need to think through.  Again, we're not going to compromise service. We're not going to compromise safety in any way. But as we think about the pace at which we are making investments, we do have to take into account the return opportunity provided to investors. So I think it's just a question, Durgesh, we're going to have to continue to evaluate a bit, and we'll have more to say about that as we get into sort of our fall planning and updates that we'll provide later in the fall. In total, we don't expect our capital plans to change at all. We, again, know that the need exists across our entire territory, and to the extent we shift dollars from one state to the other, should not impact our total expectations."
Got it. That's very helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.,"Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  The next question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Following-up on the capital reallocation question earlier. I understand the considerations you just laid out, particularly around ROE, but wanted to ask this speciﬁc to M&A in Pennsylvania. Is that something you're also looking at potentially slowing the pace of acquisitions in the state?","Yes. Again, I think there's so many opportunities in all of our states, really, from an acquisition growth perspective, and we know we've got a great pipeline in Pennsylvania, a lot of good opportunities there, and our team continues to work very, very hard to identify those opportunities and move them all along, and we're not going to slow that pace at all. I think if there's a pace issue at all in Pennsylvania, it'll really be around just the environment related to fair market value and the Commission's process they've put in place to review acquisitions, which we think, by the way, is very positive.  We think the approach the Commission has taken there to really put some guidelines around looking at acquisitions and beneﬁts being provided to customers we think will be helpful. But it's still a diﬃcult environment to get those transactions across the ﬁnish line. So again, our view is we don't change anything about what we're doing. We'll see how the process works with all the parties involved in those types of proceedings and how the Commission handles all of that through the approval process."
"Got it. That's helpful commentary there. And then separately, you pointed out the 2H weighting to earnings and very clear what the drivers of that are. I guess thinking about this dynamic over your forecast period, how do you see your EPS proﬁle tracking over the period? Do you expect any lumpiness in results?","Yes, I'll probably turn to John on that. John, do you want to comment there?     Sure. Rich, not lumpiness. So we maintain our 7% to 9% long-term growth. We don't -- we've been asked a question in the past oﬀ of what base year, we don't pick a base year. As you know,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we came out of a transition in 2021 selling HOS, selling New York. That was '21 to '22. '22 to '23, we were inside of the 7% to 9%, we expect to be this year. And we frankly think our goal is that it shouldn't matter a lot what year somebody picks. We do, as everyone is aware, have the note coming due in 2026, but that's an event that we've been planning for and we will continue to plan for. So we're not -- so we expect to remain in the 7% to 9% range."
Got it. Thank you for the time today. I'll leave it there.,"Thanks, Rich.  Operator  The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead."
"Great. Now, my ﬁrst question was just if you could unpack a little bit some of the detailed guidance changes within the subcomponents, like in particular, you mentioned that decline -- lower than expected decline in customer usage, like how much of that was the guidance raise and just if that carries forward? Also, there's some moves in like MSG and other. If you could just help unpack some of the more material pieces in the change?","Yes, John can add to it. I'd just say high-level, Paul, that's really it. We've continued to track customer usage trends pre and post-COVID. And we've certainly expected some measure of customer behavior and it's probably not tracked quiet as we expected and that's really the driver, I think, of what we're seeing so far in results this year and the reason that we've increased our guidance by narrowing the range.  John, anything to add there?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      No, if you think about kind of a midpoint to midpoint change, Paul, we're talking about a few cents here. So I think you've -- I think Susan got it right."
"Yes. Okay. Great. And then just to follow-up on Durgesh's, Richard's questions about Pennsylvania. Does the commentary about like potentially shift CapEx around also carry to interest in M&A in Pennsylvania? I know it's been kind of along the arduous road and the changes legislative at the Commission. Just any change in your views about kind of growing inorganically in Pennsylvania as well?","Yes, as I said, Paul, just a minute ago, I think in response to Richard's question, it really doesn't change our behavior. We've got a very dynamic and robust process in Pennsylvania to identify opportunities. We've got a great team there that's very focused on identifying opportunities and we'll continue that. We think that the guidance that the Commission has laid out to analyze these transactions going forward is very helpful.  But as I said, it's an environment where multiple parties have opinions relative to these transactions. And so we'll have to see how that continues to play out before the Commission. Again, we think the guidelines are helpful and our part doesn't change in terms of our interest in growing through acquisition in the state of Pennsylvania."
"Great. No, thank you. Very clear. And also congrats again to everyone on the leadership changes.",Great. Thank you.  Operator  The next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead.
"Thank you. So just again, I know it was just one decision in Pennsylvania, but I'm wondering this is the largest rate base for your company. The ROE reduction is quite substantial versus, again, you had a black box settlement, but again, versus the 10% we were all counting on. So as you look to the future, I mean, is there an oﬀset to the slower proﬁtability of this largest asset in your portfolio, or is it just that you're still within the range and so that's why you're reiterating your growth rate from an earnings perspective?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yes, Angie, I think it's again sort of a good question. First, I would just remind folks, and I don't know, back in the back of our deck, we've got detail around rate base on the various jurisdictions. Of course, it changes quickly because we're so active in the regulatory environment, but I think you'll see the gap closing from Pennsylvania to some of our other larger states pretty quickly in terms of rate base. We've been making signiﬁcant investments all across our territory. So while Pennsylvania is large, we have many other states that are gaining ground in terms of size of investment.  I think the other answer to your question, though, we addressed in prepared remarks, but across our 14 states, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to invest. This need is the same across the country. The need for investment in infrastructure and replacement and resiliency, which I think doesn't get enough of a play. The resiliency issue is a huge one as we see climate changing in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent parts of the country. So we need to continue to focus on our resiliency investment.  We have a ton of opportunity across all of our states to deploy capital. So, as I said, I think in response to the ﬁrst question, we don't envision any change in our total capital spending. Where we spend it, we will continue to look at."
"I wanted to build on a couple of the questions that have already been asked, but where exactly does that legal challenge related to Butler stand and how soon do you think that's going to get resolved by the Commonwealth Court?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Well, I think that's really it, it's in the court, and we're waiting. I don't know that we have a whole lot more to add in terms of timing, mostly because we don't have any idea. I think the court will act when it's prepared to do so and we are really just at this point waiting on the court's decision."
"Okay. But there's no like precedent in terms of like how long from the point that the challenge was ﬁled, or are you just waiting on the court order, like all the processes played out at this point?","Yes, not really. There's -- we've looked at that, but we don't really see any deﬁnitive pattern here that would give us the ability to kind of predict timing."
"Okay. I understand that. On the Towamencin deal, I know that's the other kind of large pending one in PA for you. With the fair market value revisions, is that one need to like, potentially be recut, or what's the latest thoughts on when that will be ﬁled and potentially approved and closed?","Yes, it's in limbo, too. John or Cheryl, do you want to comment on current status there?     Yes, Jonathan, we're still moving forward with the approval process on Towamencin in terms of going to the PUC, so there's no additional update on that."
"Okay. All right. And then I did want to dive a little deeper into Paul's question earlier about the components. Like, I saw there's a $0.15 increase in the lower-end of the revenue. Is that all due   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   to the lower-than-expected declines in customer usage or was there even more like downside cushion baked into the previous 105 to 125 range around uncertainty related to the PA outcome or something like that?","John, do you want to cover that?     Sure. Jonathan, I think you said it right. We're seeing, on the demand side, a little bit lower or not as much customer usage decline as we expected to see, and that's a signiﬁcant driver for the change here."
Okay. What about the long-term ﬁnancing headwind? I saw the midpoint there came down by like $0.075. Is that it all relates to the pushback in the expected closing dates of like Butler and Towamencin?,"No, the ﬁnancing, Jonathan, really just relates to the timing of the ﬁnancings that we've done to- date in terms of the convert that we issued last June and then the straight debt that we issued this year."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. Yes. No, I thought the last time you updated it, you had already done that February $1.4 billion oﬀer and so I thought that was already wrapped in there.","Well, we've been sort of waiting on the closing of that for a while, so we probably didn't have fully baked in our expectations around that earlier in the year."
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the MSG and other, I guess kind of what caused it to turn into a potential headwind in '24 versus, like kind of a $0.05 beneﬁt? Is that something that is kind of ongoing or is it timing-related or?","No, that's not an ongoing MSG issue. That's just a collection of smaller, modest puts and takes that are one-oﬀs."
Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much for the time today. I appreciate it.,"Thanks, Jonathan.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Aditya Gandhi from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."
"Good morning. Congratulations on the leadership updates. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the Pennsylvania questions that was asked earlier as it relates to the lower ROE and your 7% to 9% EPS CAGR. I understand you just reaﬃrmed it today, but in the interim, while the rate base in your other states picks up, should we be expecting an impact where you're maybe trending   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   towards the lower-end of your range in the near-term, or are there any other levers or oﬀsets that we should be considering?","I would say in a word, no. We've raised our guidance by narrowing the range to the upper half, and we obviously were taking into account this decision on Pennsylvania, so no impact, and we reaﬃrmed our long-term targets."
Got it. Okay. Have there been any material updates on the PFAS multi-district litigation where you're still waiting for proceeds from some of the defendants there?,"Cheryl, do you want to cover that?     Yes. Sure. Yes. So we have submitted all of our data that was requested to determine what that payout would be, and now we're just waiting to hear that they've closed that period. It was supposed to close last week, and it could get extended, but we think that the date will hold ﬁrm, but now we just have to wait for them to do all the calculations to determine what the payout will be. We don't know for sure when that's going to happen."
