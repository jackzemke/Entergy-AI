Question,Answer
So I guess ﬁrst with -- like starting with trying to get to a clean 2012 and so we need to adjust the guidance for $0.13 to $0.16 for weather and is there any other non-recurring items that we should put into our numbers when we think about the 2013 growth?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   At this point in time the only thing really is weather which is driving the high results for 2012, and yes when you look at 2013 you need to normalize for weather, and I put the word normal in quotes.     Yes, and that's why we gave you the information on the $0.13 to $0.16."
Okay. And then when do you expect to give 2013 guidance?,"Well, we've given it -- last year, we gave it in mid-February, and we'll probably do it in the same time, although I must say that Ellen has a diﬀerent theory about when we should give guidance. Ellen, would you care to?     All right. Well, you're really going to have me do this today [ph].     Yes.     All right. So, the theory is that the Mayan calendar has the destruction of the earth in 2012, so at this point we are not sure we need 2013 guidance.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We do have some concern about Ellen believing in the Mayan calendar and hopefully none of us are going to be the sacriﬁcial lambs of those [ph] Mayan culture, sorry, we just had to laugh [ph].     Okay, next question."
"And Jeﬀ, I guess, given that you spent a lot of time on policy in Washington, I guess under an Obama Administration, do you expect any water rules to be expedited or I guess further tightened over the next four years?","I think there clearly will be -- I think, and it really is not administrative dependent, there is going to be a continued focus on water and I think, rule 316[b] on the power plant side which is a direct impact on water is still outstanding. It won't come out in a ruling until next year. There is going to be, again, a focus on infrastructure and the need for infrastructure. There was a great article in Bloomberg just yesterday in fact I think if you didn't see it that raises this issue again and the reality is it can't be done by the federal budget. So the more that I've talked to folks up there, the more that seems to be well understood. They've got to do something on infrastructure and it can't be done by the Federal government.  So other than that I honestly -- one good thing that is going to come out and in fact it already has been out, the EPA is ﬁnally going to allow what utilities to get their -- the quality notices that we have to literally send to every customer, they are going to allow us to do that electronically. And I -- in one sense that's small, in another sense it's big. It's recognizing that this just isn't a bureaucratic process. It's about giving customers information. I don't think you're going to see major impacts on addition of new contaminants. There is a fair amount of work already being done on the emerging contaminants."
"Jeﬀ, I just want to start oﬀ. I was particularly interested in your comments on Tennessee. Can you just kind of give us an update or an overview of what, I guess, the competitive landscape is there, who are the purveyors of water services in the state? I guess the hopes of gaining a better understanding the long-term opportunity for you guys there.","Yes. The private water supplier is really us. All the rest of both water and wastewater is really done by municipality, some of which are really starting to struggle or their subdivisions of the state. Some of which we've got interconnections with and good relations with, Walter what would you add.  private water supplier is really us, all the rest of both water and wastewater is really done by municipalities, some of which are really starting to struggle or their sub-divisions of the state. Some of which we've got interconnections with and good relations with, Walter, what would you add?     Absolutely Jeﬀ, that's it. We're the largest by far, there are some smaller providers there, but we're the big player within Tennessee and we do have a lot of interconnections and we're looking to expand in that area.  [inaudible] that's it."
"Got it, got it. Okay, thank you. Just kind of some detail on the quarter, if I could. The volume was up and that was encouraging. I'm aware that mostly residential consumers are the most susceptible or kind of aﬀected by weather, but we were encouraged to see that your commercial, your public, and your industrial consumption were all up as well for the second consecutive quarter.  I'm just wondering if you can kind of drill down into the factors that drive demand amongst those consumers and whether we can kind of choke that up to weather as well or perhaps it's   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   tied to some other dynamic, the economy or otherwise?","There is really two pieces. One is, customer growth and the other is consumption per customer. Frankly, we are seeing an uptick in customer growth, particularly in our commercial area, which - - it's something we really haven't seen for the last three years or so, but this year commercial customer growth has moved up well over 1% and residential customer growth is also up. So, that's a positive sign.  Ellen, on the use per customer side?     Yes, again, on the use per customer that continues to decline although this time, it's been oﬀset by the --     Residential customers.     -- residential oﬀset.  On the commercial, industrial, and public, most of that other than customer growth, their use per customer in those three areas has stayed fairly ﬂat. So, this is somewhat weather dependent.     And about 48% of our sales is commercial, industrial and public, other.     Yes, other."
"Okay. And is that part of your rate base spend or is it customer advances, how do you kind of account for that?","Well, not going into rate base, the customer advances obviously supplied against that or it is a net through that. But yes, it goes through the regulatory process. And that's why under those transactions, frankly, we really aren't taking volumetric risk as we add those customers or add those points of interconnection. The cost roll in. They're paying retail price for water.  And as I've told you all before that doesn't mean we won't do things oﬀ on the unregulated side to serve those customers, but we think we really get a double bang when we can do it under this kind of a structure because we'll get the long-term beneﬁt of residential growth as well as overall economic development.  I mean, that's what's going to position us to serve a big area that's growing in parts of the particularly Southwest Pennsylvania that we'll see long-term economic growth and -- in the areas that we currently don't serve.  So, for each of these, Michael, what we eﬀectively do is we then -- we go into the Commission with a -- to get a certiﬁcate of territory expansion. And that's the other hidden -- I won't call it hidden, but that's the other locking up or long-term value that we put development.     So, The thing to know, Michael, is that the pipe has two purposes, it supplies water to the drillers, but it also is supplying water to residents and customers that are there for the long term."
Can you refresh us on where you are with the DSIC mechanism in New Jersey? What's left from a regulatory perspective and when should we assume this impacts?,"Well, We ﬁled the foundational ﬁling back in July and we had it approved on October 23. So, it took roughly the 90 days that we anticipated, and right now we are investing for that foundational ﬁling. As Ellen said, we're going to be recognizing the beneﬁts of those sometime in 2013."
Got it. That is helpful. And then some more modeling-speciﬁc questions. How do you think about long-term tax rates? You've been tracking around 40%. Is that the right number and when is the earliest you would be paying cash taxes here?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Right now, we'd look at our eﬀective rate around 40% probably. We've ranged historically between 38% and 41% or 42%. Right now, we have NOLs of around $1 billion and we look at that lasting anywhere out 8 to 10 years.     The only thing I'd add on that, Neil, is who knows what gets done in the next set of years, but one of the areas where there is agreements between the parties is on corporate tax reduction, rate reduction, and that would extend out the 8 to 10 years.     Right. That's correct."
"Got it. And then ﬁnally on pension here, how should we think about the drag of pension post 2012, both from a tax perspective and then also from an income statement perspective?","A couple of things have happened, as you know the ERISA rules are changing as it relates to calculating that liability and therefore we'll have an impact on that cash ﬂow for us beginning in 2013. So we are taking a look at that. If you could predict the market for the next two months, I might be able to answer that question with a little more certainty. It was doing ﬁne for a while, but we really don't know what's going to happen in the last few months, and we do assume discount rates will continue to decline."
Really good quarter.,"Thanks, Tim.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Thanks, Tim."
"Ellen, I didn't really understand a comment about 2013 guidance, do you plan on giving guidance at some point for 2013?","Sorry, Tim. We will be giving guidance in probably at the same -- in February as we have done historically."
"Okay. Great. And then I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your military base business, the non-regulated part, if you could give us -- is that business currently proﬁtable, do you see opportunities or where are you there?","Yes, that business is proﬁtable. It's a very disciplined business that, frankly, creates some ideas that we are transplanting over into our regulated operations. There has been a slowdown in the issuance of RFPs over the last couple of years for base privatization, and we are seeing that dramatically turn. The number of notiﬁcations for potential privatizations has increased. There are bids outstanding at this stage, but remember these are fairly long processes. They take 16, 18, 24 months from the time that the RFP has left [ph] until the time that an award is made.  One of the things that slowed that business down was that in the law, the original law, there has been a provision that basically said there had to be a 10% savings to the federal government. The problem is that 10% from what, and so the way it had been developed was it was 10% from what they were spending. Well, they weren't doing -- they weren't spending appropriately, and so that was not a good base line.  We got that law change in December of last year and that's what has helped now move forward a new round of RFP. So, we're very bullish on that business. It will be a growth piece for us. We're the largest provider at this stage with 10 bases, but there is obviously others that are in that space and it's -- which is a good thing. It keeps us all on our toes."
"Jeﬀ, just one follow-up question on that. Those 10 bases, do you participate in like construction of projects there that --","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Oh, yes. Oh yes. And what you typically see is that when a base comes on line and there is word, you have a pretty big chunk of catch-up because there are things that just haven't done and they need to be done, and so you end up with capital dollars. So we operate the facilities, but we also manage all of the construction that's done. And so, you end up with annual awards for the construction as well as the operation and maintenance.  The amount of construction will vary year to year based on budgets and based on where those bases stand. Again, the biggest amount of construction that you'll see will be in the ﬁrst three to ﬁve years of the contract because that's when you're playing catch-up and then you're going into a more steady state construction environment."
"Okay. And then did we have -- I don't know, this will be my last question, did we have a earnings bottom line impact from that business for either the three or nine-month period?","Well, it's included in our earnings from the market base businesses. We don't break them out separately between the businesses because quite frankly they're fairly small. Across the board they add up to a reasonable impact, but we don't give the individual business line detail."
"Good morning, everybody. Quick question on the rate cases that are pending and you expect to ﬁle, I know you can't necessarily go into speciﬁcs on states, but just taking a look at the number of pending rate cases, probably as small as we've seen in several years from American Water. Any type of thoughts on how many rate cases you plan to ﬁle on 2013 or is it going to be -- or you're shifting more towards some of the DSIC mechanism, so we can see -- may see a little bit more of a lag between rate cases in certain states? Any type of granularity on that would be great.","Yes, Gerry let me make a few comments and Ellen or Walter may add something to it. Remember that one of our big focuses has been to move to single tariﬀ pricing, and so as we have had success -- really what that means is that as we -- we used to have the ﬁle individual cases for certain territories and states. As we move to single tariﬀ pricing that has collapsed those into one ﬁling for a state. So that reduces the number of cases that may actually be ﬁled.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   The second thing is that DSIC mechanism, which is the major focus because obviously it reduces regulatory lag et cetera. So you're seeing more focus on those kinds of mechanisms, the DSIC type mechanisms. And then the rate cases may -- they may need to be less frequent, a little more time in between.     Yes. Let me -- to further Jeﬀ's point, in California, for example, we now do one rate ﬁling where historically we would do about three a year. Now we do one every three years. In addition, on the infrastructure surcharge the power of that can be seen, in particular, this quarter where year- to-date we've had 118 [ph] in general rate case awards but $15 million [ph] more in DSIC. So probably about 12% or 13% of our rate increases are now coming through this DSIC mechanism."
"Okay. That's generally what I thought. Then one other quick question on the New York service line protection program, I apologize, I am not sure how much granularity you have on the Q. I didn't get a chance to get into it, but I think there were 600,000 customers, or potential customers I should say, how big of a market is this compared to the rest of the service line protection [multiple speakers]?","Well, we look at it as it's basically another New Jersey."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it. And then, ﬁnally one last question in terms of Sandy, North New Jersey and I think Long Island probably too hardest hit areas. Obviously, I haven't necessarily seen it, you only see it on the news, but I am not sure how much damage there was to maybe some of your operating areas. Any potential for the long-term damage that may reduce consumption in the 2013 or any thoughts on that or is that still just way too early?","Yes, hi, Gerry, Walter. We are not seeing any long-term issues there with the supply to our customers. I mean -- and as Jeﬀ said during his prepared comments, our employees did a tremendous job moving generators around to make sure that we continue with our service, but we don't see any impact really long term and any water supply issues.     The one area, Walter, may be like the Barrier Island, but that's such a small.     Yes, on the Barrier Island, we do believe we may have lost a few customers their homes were probably wiped out, but that's a very, very small percentage of our total customer base."
"Okay, that was my assumption. So that's all I have, appreciate it. Great quarter.","Thanks, Gerry.     Thanks, Gerry.  Operator  David Paz, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.     Good morning, Dave."
"Hey, how are you doing? Just a question actually, just a follow-up on the previous question regarding rate cases. So, should we kind of think about the incremental revenue in 2013 being eﬀectively from what you were awarded in 2012 and of course the DSIC [ph]?","Well, remember, ﬁrst, we'll go into detail when we give guidance in February. We've got rate cases as we've said there'll be two more ﬁled this year and there will be some rate case activity next year, but most of them take a bit of time to get processed."
"Okay. And speaking of the DSIC, how it relates to CapEx, I think in your -- maybe in your release you said for 2012 you expect $925 million of CapEx, but in 2013 still your typical [ph] $800 million to $1 billion range, is that correct?","That's correct and we'll give more guidance on that number when we do our guidance for 2013, but it will be within that range."
"It would be in that range. Okay. Oh, and last question just on sales, I apologize if you gave it earlier, but do you have a sense of how weather-adjusted sales were on a percentage basis,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   excluding the New York acquisition so if you're just looking year-over-year, particularly residential?","Yes, the New York acquisition would not have impacted that by quite a bit. New York as a whole is in that other category when you look at somewhere below probably 3% or even less of our revenue as a Company.     And that's all of New York.     That's all of New York."
"Okay, so then weather-adjusted sales in the residential [multiple speakers]?",It's not that much. It wouldn't impact that percentage increase by very much at all.
"Okay. But I'm sorry, so what is the actual percentage increase, weather adjusted residential level?",We talk about it on a total and if you'll remember what we talked about was the impact on EPS is between $0.13 to $0.16.
"Okay. And so your -- and in terms of customer usage it's still -- excluding weather, it's still about 0.5 and 1.5 [ph] annual decrease, is that fair?","Yes, it varies by state, but that's correct, that's what the number is [ph]."
"Thanks. I wanted to go back to this topic of regulation. Jeﬀ, when you ﬁrst joined American Water you had talked about on a more macro level changing kind of the fundamental structure. I wondered if you could give us an update on how you see the receptiveness of commissions regarding some of these mechanisms like addressing declining consumption. And as you look out into 2013, 2014 are there states that you have targeted to expand things like DSIC?","Well, I think by and large there has been receptivity and it's the diﬀerent kinds of things. I mean, we've ﬁled in virtually every proceeding and in some cases it shouldn't be in a rate case, it needs to be in a diﬀerent type of proceeding to address declining use or to address mechanisms to encourage the investment of capital without a regulatory lag so that we can do the thing that's needed on the infrastructure side.  So I think by and large there are always, there is hesitancy about doing something that they haven't done before, even if it's being done somewhere else. We are seeing improvements in people thinking about future test years, a legislation pass [ph] so that's facilitated in Pennsylvania. We had good success in that in Illinois.  So I -- it's never what you want us [ph] to be, Heike, but it's -- I think most commissions are moving in the right direction, let me put it that way.  And are there certain jurisdictions that we have targeted for diﬀerent things, yes. That's something that we talk to the commissioners about ﬁrst. But that's a -- we certainly have a plan about the next set of things that we want to get done."
"Candid to ask [ph], right?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yes. And I wish that we knew the answer. I mean, what we're pleased about is that we have not one, but multiple drillers that are interested in working with us on the kind of approaches that we -- these regionalization approaches, as well as ongoing discussions on more directed speciﬁc kinds of projects that will either be associated with clean-up of produced water or on the provision of signiﬁcant water for drilling. It's a very diﬃcult one to predict."
"Hi, thanks. I just wanted to touch on the Allentown contract. You guys were recently approved as bidders, and I think that they've now gone ahead and are allowing bids to be submitted. I am just wondering, ﬁrst of all when -- the kind of timeline that you expect to play out [ph], obviously it's not exactly clear, I'm sure, even for you.  And then secondly, I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts a bit about what will be the key criteria that you think the city will be looking at and how you are competitively positioned to win that bid?  just wanted to touch on the Allentown contract. You guys were recently accrued these bidders and I think that they've now gone ahead and are allowing bids to be submitted. I'm just wondering, ﬁrst of all when the kind of timeline that you expect [inaudible] obviously it's not exactly clear, I'm sure even for you. And then secondly, I just wanted to kind of pick your due to foster a bit about it, what will be the key criteria that you think that the City will be looking at and how you are competitively positioned to win that bid?","Well, frankly those are great questions, Michael, for you to ask them. It's -- the schedule -- they have -- there is a form of contract, but they haven't issued the RFP, but are [ph] on the qualiﬁcation stage. So until you get that, it's a little diﬃcult to understand the schedule.  I think in their eyes it's a value question. It's what are they going to get as cash upfront for the system for someone to operate those systems. We see some opportunity to improve operations   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   in those systems, but they're not -- they're not terrible systems.  They've done a reasonable job, they've got a capital constrain. So I think price is, well as you would expect, is going to be a signiﬁcant issue, but that's about all I could say at this stage, as we're still working through our strategy, probably [ph] depending on what the criteria are that are in the RFP."
"Right. I mean, not to belabor, I mean, do you think that other criteria, being a public company or having a certain credit quality or capitalization structure or even just your local regulated footprint will kind of be a factor?","I have no doubt that other criteria will be taken into account. I don't think these decisions are -- they are multi-faceted because it's a long-term decision. How they will weigh those factors, we can't really judge or comment on because it's their weighting, but I do believe that they will be cognizant of the other factors, and we're trade guys [ph]."
"Right, right. Okay. I mean, From a bigger-picture perspective, does this represent a potential model, if you will, of course, if it's successful to kind of realize the long elusive dream of the water utility industry to kind of grow the privatized footprint?","Well, Michael, it is a model, it is one of a couple that we're seeing more frequently in the market and I really think that's -- we're going to see some diversity in the models that can be applied to the municipal side. This is one that we do believe in. We think it has got some power.  I think there has been some challenges. For example, the city originally felt that the state was going to regulate the price. They've now been advised by the General Counsel that the state will not do that because the ownership of the system is still with the city. So, I think that changes a little bit of the emphasis about who will play and who has got what, just because of business strategies. So, it will vary by state to state, but I think it clearly is a model that we'll have some lags [ph]."
"Okay. Thanks, Jeﬀ.  Operator  Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Sterba for closing remarks.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Well, I'd just thank you all again for joining us, and I know you join us in thoughts and concerns for the folks aﬀected by the hurricane, and we look forward to seeing you. If we don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a great holiday.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes our conference for today. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect?
