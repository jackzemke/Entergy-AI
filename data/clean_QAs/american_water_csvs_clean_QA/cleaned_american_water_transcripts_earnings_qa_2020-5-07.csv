Question,Answer
"Hey Walter and Susan. Maybe appreciate all the color. Just any quantiﬁable trends, I know it's early, on the regulated side in terms of, you mentioned residential demand being higher and commercial, industrial perhaps slower but any quantiﬁable trends on the -- into April in your regulated subsidiaries. And then also, are you seeing any non-payments or no payments in your market-based businesses. I know it's early on, but any color you could provide I appreciate it.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, Durgesh thanks, Susan, you want to take that and then I'll jump in at the end.     Sure, let me make just a few comments Durgesh. And again I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions, the various States implemented restrictions and stay-at-home orders at diﬀerent times, so obviously depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions that's going to impact, when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. I would again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks, roughly 70% of our load is residential and as you can imagine, obviously folks are at home, so we are seeing in our, in our early data that residential sales are up and again I hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have six weeks' worth of demand data and other cases we may only have 3 or 4 weeks, again dependent on when those measures were put in place and in some cases we have real-time meters, some cases we don't, so we have to wait until we have actual building data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage -- usage up.  On the commercial side, again, it depends on the jurisdiction and it depends on the mix of customers in a particular state but as you can imagine commercial is trending down because of business closures, restaurants closing, et cetera. And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change. And I'll give an example, in Kentucky, we've got a large plant there, an auto manufacturer, so in the state of Kentucky we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales because of the concentration there, but overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total.  So again as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up, the other two are down, our current thinking is that they -- they may tend to oﬀset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes, it depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So, again, I'm not getting directly to your quantify it, but hopefully a bit more color there is helpful.  On the collection side again, I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side and we certainly haven't seen anything on the market based side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of diﬃculties there. Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with these programs because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditure. So, we're quite conﬁdent we'll be able to retain customers and with that goes, the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts.     Yeah. And I think the key to the usage again back to what Susan was talking about is, when do the states get back to normal when do they start opening up a lot of the commercial establishments in Industrial and obviously we're tracking that very closely as we work with the Governor's oﬃces and our plans in working with them."
"Got it, that's super helpful guys. And then maybe just can you update us on the timing of the New York American Water sale. Is that still expected to close. I believe it was late this year, is that   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   still on track.","Yeah, we're still moving forward with the sale, there's no delay in the regulatory process and we're working very well with Liberty and we expect to closing that late this year or early in 2021 Durgesh."
"Got it. And then just ﬁnal one from me, apologize. In terms of just some of your peers have talked about O&M savings Walter and Susan just folks staying home, less mileage expense, less expenses in general, travel, meals, et cetera, are you seeing that and is it sort of, what was the experience. I guess maybe, it's still early to tell, but any color into what -- what you might have seen versus original plan year to date in terms of those expense savings.","Let me start and then I'll hand it oﬀ to Susan. Durgesh, as you know, in my prepared remarks and over the years we focus very closely on O&M expenses and so that's part of our culture. We're going to continue to do that, we're going to continue to drive O&M expenses, down to that. When we invest, we're asking our customers to pay for that investment and not the O&M costs. So again, it's part of our culture, we just -- it's embedded, everybody understands it and that's again the continued focus that we're going to have in this business, just -- not just during the pandemic, as you know. So I'll ask Susan for additional comments.     Yeah, I think, Walter you're right on target. The only thing I would add maybe just as speciﬁc example. And you mentioned travel, it is one obviously we've implemented, no travel across all of our jurisdictions. But what you might not be thinking about is added PPE that we've added for all of our employees including oﬃce employees. So there's added expense there on what we may have saved in other areas. So the bigger picture is, we are still on target for our earnings expectations for the year and I think our ability to navigate all the variables and the result is our expectations remain the same. I think that gives you pretty good indication of how we're managing."
Super guys. Thank you and Walter your ﬁrst quarter as CEO congrats on a very solid quarter.,"Thank you, Durgesh. I appreciate it.  Operator  Now our next question will come from Richard Verdi with Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
Sure. My pleasure. I just wanted to start very quickly with the military operation. Typically turnaround on new contracts can take 12 to 18 months and it's the same with your peers obviously and so it just seems kind of quick of a turnaround that we're going to start to see work being done here in -- here in the second quarter of 2020 and I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what made that turnaround so quick and when we could start to maybe see positive impact on the ﬁnancials from such turnaround.,"Yeah. On our two new bases, we've been in transition services since we got the award and we work very well at both installations, Joint Base San Antonio and West Point showing the value to the communities and we're going to be starting full operations as I said in my prepared remarks, in the second quarter. So I think it's the trust and conﬁdence that they have in our Military Services Group to take over the water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and amazing way as our group does with our Military Services Group. So again, we're really proud to have those two new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point, I'd like to say that but, no, we're really proud of our Military Services Group, they've developed a tremendous reputation and brand with the government, I think it's the conﬁdence that they have in our Group that moved those forward as quickly as we have."
"Okay, thank you for that Walter. And then kind of followup to that, what sort of indication is the Company received on potential delays in new awards and new bases being awarded, because of the COVID-19 crisis, so is there any -- what's kind of going on there.","Yeah. So we're in ﬁve active solicitations right now and we expect still this year to hear on three of those, so we're not seeing any measurable delay on behalf of the government in moving those forward."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then for the municipal acquisition front, do you think that COVID could cause, I mean what's the feeling internally that where COVID-19 causes municipalities to somewhat become cash-strapped and maybe accelerate the sale of the water system to American Water.","Well, we believe, looking at the impact that COVID-19 crisis is going to have on communities that they're going to be a lot of municipalities that are facing ﬁnancial challenges. And so when you look at the eﬀorts that we've put in already over the years of building our pipeline and again, our pipeline is 650,000 customer connections, we've worked on fair market value legislation, we've worked on Water Quality Accountability legislation and when you really add this COVID-19 crisis, and we think it will have an impact on the number of communities that we're having discussions with, so -- we're -- being able to show what we can do in providing solutions for them. We do think it's going to have an impact on those discussions, absolutely."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then just a -- I know I am dragging on -- just the last question here. Thank you for the time. When you look at the guidance for the year of 3.79 to 3.89 and you look into the model, and you also think back to the Analyst Day of how the Company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next ﬁve years. Debt to capital is targeted to come down to 59% to 60% range over time. And then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID. In -- at least in my model when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that 379 ﬁgure into a low 370s, the ﬂowthrough impact of that is that your cash -- your operating cash drops and you either need to make up for that by issuing debt, which will increase your debt to total capital before you issue more equity, which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate or you peel back on CapEx and no one knows, you guys are doing a great job obviously -- no one knows right -- to go on for a long time it could be really unfavorable. So let's just assume a Doomsday scenario. What would be the -- where would the Company look to try to remedy the situation, but also try to keep its long-term growth guidance in range, does the Company say, okay, we're going to let, our debt ratios may be kind of lift, at risk of further credit downgrades, we are going to -- do we issue more equity, do we peel back CapEx. I mean, I'm sure you guys have kind of [ph]implied scenarios internally there, what's kind of Doomsday scenario. What would be a strategy if that occur.","Okay. I think, Susan, you want to take that one.     Yeah, Rich. There is a lot in that question obviously, and I'll start with just simply saying that where we are today, we are conﬁdent in our ability to hit all of the various targets we've laid out, I think we said that sort of throughout our remarks. We -- like I'm sure everyone has done a variety of scenarios and sort of worst case, best case types of analyzes and that's just good ﬁnancial planning. I would say to you that as you outline them in all of your remarks, we would have many levers to pull and I'm probably not going to comment beyond that. I would just say the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our credit, the diversity of our operations,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   there's a whole variety of things about our business model that are set up in a way that makes it possible for us to navigate through situations like this. I made the comment in my remarks that again we're built on fundamentals and we believe this is a very resilient business, and I believe that to be absolutely true. So to the extent we've got to look at diﬀerent approaches to manage whatever crisis come along, I'm conﬁdent in our ability to do so."
"Okay, that's great color. Thank you for that Susan. And I just actually have one more question. I'll wrap it up with this. Can you guys just refresh my memory again please with this 3.79 to 3.89 guidance assuming that was created around on magic number of an expectation of 3.84 for the end of the year at the midpoint of the guidance. What must happen for from that 3.84 for actually 3.79 to be reported what would need to -- what we need to have that low end of the guidance you reported?","Susan, you want to take that. I mean, mostly it's weather impact as you know.     Yeah."
"Okay, great. Okay, great. I appreciate the time guys. Thank you.","Yeah. Thanks, Rich.     Thanks, Rich.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"It is, it is. I know you expect constructive treatment, but if any of your largest States like PA or New Jersey, Missouri Illinois taken concrete action with respect to recovery of incremental COVID-19 cost?","Susan you want to?     Yeah. And I'm going to get to sort of an analysis here we've done, we've actually obviously been active with regulators across all of the jurisdictions, monitoring their actions and then we've certainly developed our own strategy on how we would approach, but we know for certain that California, Maryland, Virginia have addressed, they've already issued orders on cost deferrals. We have pending proceedings in Illinois and Iowa to do similarly, and we have discussions ongoing in every state but Hawaii which is easier and probably say the ones that we don't have. So active discussions or actions already taken across our jurisdictions."
"Okay. That's great. And then Walter can you talk about the calculus on year-end as well as the feedback in the states where you have major rate requests pending. I think your plan on ﬁling another major rate case yet this year and I forgot is those Missouri or Illinois, but any apprehension with being in for rates. Many customers are facing these economic hardships, you've seen some companies kind of defer ﬁling request or extend out the timeline, stuﬀ like that, but it sounds like for you guys, it's kind of full steam ahead in some regards.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah, Jonathan, let me say ﬁrst that we're very sensitive to the situation that our customers are facing right now. We've been investing, as you know, signiﬁcant amounts in our systems, and this is really getting a recovery in that investment. And if you look to Pennsylvania, I know we did ﬁle last week, but those rates will not be eﬀective for 8 to 10 months, so we took that into consideration as we made that decision. New Jersey was already ﬁled in December so we continue to work with the commission on that and in Virginia and California, the same, but we did look at that very closely, but again because of the timing, we felt like ﬁling now for an outcome that's in 2021 is a reasonable decision on our behalf.     I just add to that -- that we certainly are working closely with regulators around this very question and we have not received direction or signals really from regulators that we should not proceed sort of as usual. So, that's a diﬀerent answer than customer considerations, it's really just also taken into account our regulators are expecting and we've not really been pushed to delay the normal process so far."
"That's helpful information and then the last question really just on the military front. Do you expect any new bases will be awarded through the RFP process, later this year at either AWK or one of your competitors.","Yes, that's right Jonathan, of the ﬁve that we're pursuing all indications are that they will award three this year."
"Alright. Well, good luck on getting those and looking forward to the update and stay safe and strong through the pandemic. I appreciate the time.","Well, I appreciate that, Jonathan. Thank you.     Thanks Jonathan.  Operator  This will conclude today's question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Lynch for any closing remarks.
