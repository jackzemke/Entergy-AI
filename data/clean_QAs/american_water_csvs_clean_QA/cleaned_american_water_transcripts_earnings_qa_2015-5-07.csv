Question,Answer
"Hey, just looking at slide 11 and you guys were showing kind of progression toward your stretch target on eﬃciency ratio. Is 34% feeling like a stretch given the fact that you've got four years to get there or is that number going to keep pushing lower and you're going to surprise us again?","Well, the 34% is our stretch target and as you know as you get closer to that, it gets a little bit more diﬃcult. So we still see that as achievable, but it's also a stretch target. So we're working towards that."
"On slide 33 in the back where you guys show the acquisitions completed last year and then what's kind of in-process this year, can you just remind us how much money was spent on the acquisitions capital investment wise in 2014 and then what is the total amount that you'd be putting forth in 2015 to close the deals that are ongoing?","Dan, we had about $8.4 million that we incurred in 2014 for the closed acquisitions. And then we are – currently have approximately $100 million that we have set aside for strategic acquisitions and regulatory acquisitions for the full year this year, for these acquisitions as well as other pending."
"So, Linda, you're going to have to ﬁnd some more deals then what's on here to get to the $100 million, is that right?","Yeah. Remember, Dan, we also have some ﬂexibility in terms of the capital spend to deal with some timing issues there as well."
"Okay. And then I guess just one last question the non-reg side, revenues were up fairly nicely in the quarter, but the expenses moved in step. Did you guys prefund some of the military work in the ﬁrst quarter so that there will be more proﬁt ongoing or is that – or just maybe explain why those things kind of move at the same rate?","Yeah. So we do see an increase in cost associated with the military contracts that is tracking with the revenue that we recorded. We also had some timing issues in the HOS business as we had some marketing and start-up cost with our Orlando and other contracts. And then we also as we continued to optimize the contract services business, we had some one-time adjustments last year."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So if I were to think about normalizing now kind of the Orlando upfront and some of those contract adjustments, how much extra cost was that in the quarter, just trying to get our bearings right?","So, I don't have those numbers right in front of me, Dan, but I think we can – the way that we look at it is that we've included all of those cost in our reaﬃrmed earnings guidance."
"Okay. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. On the E&P business, I think this has sort of been highlighted as a potential opportunity for some time. Are we sort of still in the early phases or are we kind of getting to the point where we'll see some inﬂection points?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Shahriar. This is Susan. We are – there are a lot of changes as you know in the E&P space. What we have found interestingly is that as a lot of the E&P companies are reducing their capital, they tend to look more toward their core business. And for the ancillary services, we found that there are more who are willing to sit down and talk. The real issue becomes the ability to do a partnership that is mutually beneﬁcial. And as we have said before, we are not going to go with a high risk proﬁle to get into that business. So anything we enter would have to require the – we would have to get the return of any capital we expend in a short period of time. So we are in discussions with diﬀerent groups. I think it depends on the deal and we also want to make sure that it leverages the core competencies we have in the water business and doesn't get far outside of that.  So yes, we continue conversations. In terms of are we close or not, it just depends on the deal. And as we see the rest of this year unfold. One thing we do know is in our regulated side on shale, in 2015 we actually look very good for us because as while they are not opening as many wells, the ones they have are much more productive. So on the regulated side, we're seeing some movement there. On the unregulated, we just have a diﬀerent way of looking at it to ensure we remain disciplined."
"Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then just top level pretty good growth in the non- regulated business, is this sort of a refreshed viewpoint on how large you sort of want this business to be as a percentage of consolidated results?","You know, Shahriar, as we've said before, currently the revenues from the market based business is about 10% or 11%. And so our goal is for the revenues or even net income to really let's talk about revenues ﬁrst, not to be over 15% to 20% and we would only be comfortable over 15%, if that was the growth in military services in those parts of market base that are very regulated like, because we are constantly looking at the overall company risk proﬁle to ensure that we don't move that proﬁle."
"Got it, excellent. Thanks, congrats on a good quarter.",Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.
"I wanted to ask a big picture question regarding the overall national regulatory landscape and speciﬁcally, regulated returns on equity, awarded returns on equity which have been kind of on a downward trend the last several years. I wanted to get your view on the outlook for ROEs, in particular whether you think that an improving economy and potential increase in interest rates could actually lead to a rebound in awarded returns over the next 12 months plus?","So if we look out from ROEs, they are largely driven by changes in interest rates. And so if interest rates go up we would expect to see some increase in ROEs as well. In terms of recent decisions, we have had our cost of capital decision in California extended at 9.99% through the end of 2016, we did have our Indiana rate case approved with an increase from 9.7% to 9.75%. So we are seeing just slight movements in the ROE."
"Okay. Well, that's encouraging. Thanks, Linda. And then, my next question has to do with the California situation. We're kind of trying to get our arms around conceptually how the decoupling mechanism will be impacted by the conservation declines. And I guess my question is in theory, decoupling renders any consumption decline a non-event. But obviously the magnitude of these declines are – exceed what the PUC might have envisioned when they designed the system.  So my question is does this or will this complicate the implementation of the decoupling mechanism over the next as these huge consumption declines work through the system. And I guess speciﬁcally, could the RAM balances get to such a – so large that the PUC decides to extend the collection period over a longer timeframe to eliminate rate shock I guess?","Right, Ryan. And we're looking at that very carefully in California as to what would be the cash impact and the recovery period for any delays in collections under the RAM mechanism. The RAM mechanisms now with the California rate case are in virtually all of our areas. In California, they've been now approved. This has been a mechanism that California has supported for quite some time. And it really does drive the alignment of the utility companies and the customer to conserve and to work through the drought related issues.     And you know also, one thing that's interesting is there is a national discussion about the price of water and there are those who would say that out West where you are having the scarcity,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   you're starting to see more appropriate value placed on water.  And so, as we look at this, we compare it to where we've been in the past, it will be interesting to see where this goes in the future though, especially as in 50 of the states in the U.S., 40 water managers say that in parts of their state, they believe will be in drought in the next 10 years. So I think the wider discussion about the value of water and what we do in terms of putting a price on water is pretty important and we may see that in California. We already are seeing that in California.     And Ryan, to both your point on ROE as well as California, we do operate in 16 regulated states. So we do have a diversiﬁed portfolio here and California represents just slightly less than 8% of our total revenue."
"Right, right. Okay. And just a quick question. Obviously you can't disclose what the content of this would be, but are you engaged or has the PUC engaged yourself and other peers and sort of discussed these issues and start to frame the regulatory response or is it sort of a black hole this point?","I wouldn't say it's a black hole. I will tell you that our team at California American is always looking for ways to work with our customers, ﬁnd ways that we can work to ensure that the regulatory processes operate as they are intended operate and so we sit down at the table and open forum, our President Rob McClain participate in a lot of the water forums and the water conferences. So we are engaged in the dialogue throughout the state of California."
"Okay, great. And then just one ﬁnal just quick one for me. The increase in claims on the service line protection, I assume that cold weather was a factor there but was there anything else going on that we need to be aware of in that respect?",An increase in the number of contracts as well as cold weather.
Just a couple of quick ones here from me. First one I want to ask about the New Jersey rate case. That $66.2 million of revenue asked is that inclusive of amounts that are already being recovered via the DSIC?,"No, that's outside the DSIC mechanism. They will be included as part of the rate case in the end but the $66 million is for other things; investment, as you know if you've been following closely, we reduced our cost by $19 million since the last rate case. We invested $775 million in the infrastructure and that's more than we've ever spent in New Jersey. And so asking for 9.9% we think is a big win considering it was a three years since our last rate ﬁling."
"Yeah, absolutely very helpful. And also sticking with the New Jersey DSIC, we have gotten on a pretty good semiannual cycle there. With the rate case in progress now is it safe to assume that we may have a bit of stay out from the DSIC asks or would those be totally separate items there?","No, we time the DSIC with the rate case so we ﬁled in early January. It typically takes 9 to 12 months for the rate case to make its way through the BPU to get an order. We are right in line with that, again we time the investment in DSIC with the timing of the rate case that we can continue to invest up to the cap."
"Okay, perfect. Separately and from kind of a broad standpoint, have you seen perhaps the California drought discussion have any ripple eﬀects across some of your other jurisdictions? And, I guess speciﬁcally I was surprised to see residential volumes down 6% on a ﬁrm-wide consolidated basis, is that perhaps more of that's California than I am expecting? But are you seeing any other usage declines that may be outside of drought stricken areas?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Spencer, there if you look at slide 27 it shows our billed volumes for this quarter compared to last quarter and there is a lot of noise in those billed volumes because we were implementing our customer information system in late 2013. And as a result of that implementation, we held some of our bills to ensure that we had a thorough review. When we veriﬁed that they were accurate and so we had higher bills that went in – that went out in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, which is what's really causing that diﬀerence. If you look at the actual revenue piece of it, that's where those diﬀerences are trued up in the unbilled revenue line item."
"Okay, perfect. I did notice the revenue didn't quite decline with the volume; that makes a lot of sense.","And Spencer, from a big picture standpoint, people are watching California, I think Texas is the next state that would be closest to that in terms of dealing with water supply issues. But we also know that in several states, especially, in Mississippi we tend to have rainfall amount that has been more normal so unless – it's pretty local.  So, when we are in these national conferences and we talk to folks, they are mindful of what's going on in California, but they are not really doing some of the same things. They are just kind of checking to make sure they have adequate water supplies and it actually helps us in terms of the replacement of aging infrastructure where in the country overall we lose 25% of all treated water every year through aging infrastructure, through leaks and all. So, this actually helps our case on aging infrastructure replacement because as we move into a time where there may be less water supply, we cannot aﬀord to lose our water through leaks."
Understood. Very helpful. Thanks. That's all I had.  Operator  Having no further questions this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Thank you so much. So before we conclude our call, I want to remind everyone that our second quarter earnings call will take place on Thursday, August the 6th at 09:00 AM Eastern Time.  We also would like for you to save the date for our 2015 Analyst Day, which will be held on December the 15th in New York City. We'll provide you more information about this as we get closer.  We appreciate your interest in American Water and we commit to continue to be responsible stewards of your investment and the conﬁdence that you place in us. We look forward to speaking with your all again soon. Thanks.  Operator  The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
