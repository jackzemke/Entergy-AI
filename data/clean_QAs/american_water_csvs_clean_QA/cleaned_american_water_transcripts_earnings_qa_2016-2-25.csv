Question,Answer
"Good morning, everyone, very nice quarter and thank you for taking my call here. Just a couple quick and easy questions; ﬁrst, I guess Susan can you please speak to the strategy for capital raises the next few years to fund your program and how you think about raising the dividend versus buying back stock versus issuing equity?","Sure, Rich, and thanks for the question. I will start, and then Linda may want to jump in.  So, when we look at all of the diﬀerent uses of our capital in terms of growth, in terms of raising our dividend, in terms of regulated investment, all of those diﬀerent things, we look at a balance in optimizing those and also where we get the biggest value from every dollar that we spend. So, we look at growth and the returns we get there. We look at regulated investment and let me be clear that in our investment plan, the ﬁrst thing we do, is we invest whatever is needed in every one of our state to ensure that we provide safe clean water that meets all EPA standards. So, then beyond that is what we refer to as discretionary. But there is a base amount which is signiﬁcant well over half of our capital that we spend to ensure that we provide those services.  Then beyond that, we look at our dividend growth, which is, we have said, we want to keep consistent with our EPS growth. So, we want those to be correlated, so that's the guidance we've given and we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio and currently we're at the lower end of that range. So, there is room there.  When we look at things like debt and I'll let Linda talk about this more, the question we ask is what is best for our customers and our shareholders with the next dollar that we invest or whether we pay down debt or whether we're able to provide dividend. So, as you know, to have a – to be in a strong ﬁnancial position as we are, we have a lot of optionality and we're always looking at how we optimize that optionality.     And Rich, I would add to that that as we look and as we outlined in our Investor Day, when we look at the capital structure over the next ﬁve years, we continue to look at about 45%-55% equity to debt capital structure."
"Okay, excellent. Thank you. And next on the O&M and eﬃciency ratio, clearly, this has been a great part of the story very successful, excuse me, couple of years back the stretch target was 35% for 2018, now the stretch target is 34% for 2020. It's 100 basis points lower in three years. I know a portion of these stretch targets were based on the ERP program a while back. Now they are predicated upon automation technology such as the Badger Meter contract recently announced. Without holding you to it, just trying to get a grasp on what lies beyond 2020, how possible is it that American reduces the O&M eﬃciency ratio by another 100 basis points by 2022 to 33%. And would automation and technology be the driver of that reaction or is there   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   something underneath the American umbrella that could drive the third phase of O&M eﬃciency reduction?","Hey, Rich; Walter. I'll take that question. Thanks for it.  We're not going to forecast beyond 2020 and a 34%, but I can tell you our teams are geared towards continuous improvement and that's what's driving this, and technology is going to be a big part of it. As you know, we are about 90% implemented with AMR. We're also looking at AMI and the technology that we're buying now is easily transitioned into AMI. So it's a long- term solution. But I'd tell you looking at the people in our business understand the why and why we are reducing expenses. So we can invest in our infrastructure and provide excellent customer service. So it's really throughout the business sharing best practices, leveraging our supply chain and reverse auctions and power and chemicals, so it's a mindset and it's a commitment by our employees that we're going to get to where we need to go and they understand the why, and I think that is the key to this whole things, and that's been the foundation for our success."
"Okay. Great, thank you very much, and I appreciate it. And that's it for me, I'm going to jump in queue, but I just want to say thank you very much for slide 36 and that's very helpful.","Thanks, Rich.
