Question,Answer
"Okay. There is a nice growth in your industrial volumes in Q4 sequentially as well as year over year. What were the drivers for the volume growth industrials, and do we expect to see the trend ahead in 2014 as well?","If I understand your question correctly, you said the quarter-over-quarter Fourth Quarter, the growth, what was driving the growth and do we expect to see that to continue, is that what you're asking?"
Yes. I'm talking about the industrial volume growth.,"Yes. What happened with the industrial volume, I mentioned that the customer information system implementation, we held several of the more complex bills, and it impacted industrial and the public sales more than it did commercial and residential.  So what we do is, if you look at our 10-K, while we look at billed and unbilled revenue, on water volume we just report billed water volume. As we were holding bills, we had somewhat of a   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   delay in terms of the amount of industrial volumes that we were able to bill.  That's where you might see a little bit of a disconnect. We do expect that to normalize through the year.  We have gone through those bills that are complex, ensured that the new system was generating accurate bills, and we've released the majority of those. Now, we had two waves of implementation.  The ﬁrst wave was in May. Those bills, we've released those. We're on the normal billing cycle. Our second wave was on October 20 is when we implemented it. So after the First Quarter, we should see more normalizations there."
"Okay, that sounds helpful. My second question is on the O&M side. You did a great job lowering it down from 40.1% to 38.7%, the expense ratio. So, the run rate of 35% is already -- which was expected on 2015, was already achieved.  Do we expect to see a gradual slowdown in the run rate going ahead, or if you look at the same run rate then I think we can expect you to achieve the 35% rate, even before 2018? Can you provide some color here?","Yes. The way I'd answer that is we have established a goal of 35% by 2018. We are not driven by that metric so much, as by doing the right thing in managing our cost structure.  That may enable us to get there earlier, but we certainly wouldn't forecast that at this stage. As you move up the tree, collecting fruit, it does become a little more challenged and diﬃcult, but that's why our whole process is around continuous improvement and process excellence. And the reason why we're trying to engage as many of our folks as possible so that this becomes self-sustaining.  So, yes, I think we've had great progress. I think when I came here it was about almost 48%. So we've cut it actually by 10percentage points, or over 20%, almost 25%.  Going forward, we probably won't see it go down at nearly the rate that it has over the last ﬁve years, but we're still going to stay focused on it. Walter, you got anything you'd want to add?     We are addressing this as we know in multiple fronts, and Jeﬀ you talked about Yellow Belt programs and the savings that are driving there, but we continue to look at our cost. The biggest cost we have are power, chemicals, fuel, and we continue to address those, along with labor costs. As you said, we're geared towards 2018 of 35%, and we are working right now to get there.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. So my next question would be, in case you get this 35% quite earlier to 2018, what would you say would be a sustainable ratio? You would deﬁnitely not keep looking at lowering the ratio in terms of costs. So what would be a ratio that makes you happy, and you would say, this is the ratio that I would like to maintain?","One of the things that you get when you really go through all the data that we, from a management side look at, you see that there are diﬀerences by state. For example, California has a higher ratio just by operating in California because, well, it's an extended process to operate in California, and so every utility that operates there has higher ratios.  We happen to be very good in California and so we have a lower ratio than others, but it's higher than it is in many other states. So a lot of what is the right ratio will depend on where our growth occurs.  So if we see growth occurring in some states that have higher cost structures because of the way they operate or their regulatory approach, then we think about it in that way. We look at the 35% on the basis of where we expect to see growth, but also on the basis of our current business. I don't think you can say, here's the optimal percentage.     But Shivangi, I think to your point, though, there is a point at which it's very diﬃcult, because remember when we talk about cost eﬃciency, these are long-term eﬀorts to take cost out of the business. These aren't quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year cuts.  As we look at more automation, more innovation, there are levels that you could sustain. But you're right, at some point you look and say, are we doing all we can do? Then there is usually a step change and something we can do in technology that maybe will help us further, but we don't know what that is right now."
"Okay. And maybe my last question, and then I will get back in line. So the estimated costs that you are expecting out of the Freedom chemical spill will be about $0.02 at this point in time.  I want to mention you have been doing a smooth execution, and it was really great. But then are there any headwinds that can still drive the costs ahead? And when we get a clear understanding that it's not just $0.02, and maybe a little more over $0.02?","Susan can maybe give you a little more detail about what's included in the $0.02 and the costs we have occurred so far. Going forward, it's really dependent on how the legal process goes,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   because that's really the thing that will continue for some period of time, and that's really hard to estimate.  We think a lot of the claims that have been made are easily dismissible. Other claims may have to go a little further before we can get free from them.  But that's what's probably the biggest unknown, is how the legal process will go forward. For example, we recently ﬁled on some of the claims to have them moved into federal court.  We won't know whether that's successful for a while because people may try to get them back into state court. Those kinds of things can help drive what those legal costs will be. So that's why there's uncertainty around that.     But you are correct. This is a First Quarter event. And when we look at the charge for the credit that we mentioned earlier, when you look at the extra production costs, the labor, you look at O&M, you look at the cost of the tankers, bottled water, the legal expenses, the $0.02 that we reported reﬂect the expenses through February 26.  Going forward, as Jeﬀ said, we see the predominance being mostly the legal. Now, because it's a First Quarter event, we will have more information at the First Quarter earnings call where we should be able to be a little more speciﬁc."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Congratulations to your team on the response to the spill in West Virginia. I had a couple of easy questions here. So at the Analyst Day, you outlined several wastewater acquisition targets. Just wanted to get a status update in terms of how that process is faring.","Well, I think we're moving forward on a number of fronts in acquisitions in discussions and negotiations, which obviously we can't talk about who or where they are, both in the wastewater and water arenas. And as we get to a point of any of those being signed we will obviously let you know. That's probably about all I could say, Neil, at this stage.     Except for, as you know, we really beneﬁt the following year from the acquisitions we made in the previous year. We mentioned in our acquisition increase revenue, a large part of that was from New York that we had the full year and not just eight months. So for 2014, we will be beneﬁting from acquisitions we made in 2013."
"All right, fair enough. As you think about your dividend, you've got a payout that's below your long-term target and you've got above average EPS growth. So can you talk through your dividend growth expectations as you look at 2014, but then also beyond that?","Yes. Neil, as we've talked about before, we have a series of criteria that have been what we've established as our dividend philosophy, which is the target of 50% to 60% payout ratio and have a growth rate in dividends that's more in line with our earnings growth rate. So we are slightly below the 50% to 60%.  So in one sense that gives us some ﬂexibility, and we're still believe in the long-term growth rate of 7% to 10%. That's really the guidance that we have relative to dividends. Obviously we just sent out the last one.  The next one is, if you follow our track record, is typically the one where we have announced an increase. So we'll let you know what that will be when we announce it."
"Okay. In California, the Monterey Peninsula, you've got a couple of big projects out there. Could you give a status update on those?","Let me ask Walter to do that.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Okay. First on the dam. We are working through our timeline on the dam and we expect to have that torn down and the river rerouted sometime in 2015, according to our schedule. So that's progressing on time, and the team's done a great job out there.  Also on the Monterey Peninsula water supply project, we're working through the issues out there, and we're working cooperatively with municipalities and with the Commission. We're working with the Commission to look at the environmental impact report, which we expect now in the First Quarter of 2015, and things are going according to plan."
"Jeﬀ, you spoke about total contaminants. Those you test for, those EPA has under consideration, and some others. Given it wouldn't be cost eﬀective to test for all contaminants as a Company, has AWK ever attempted or proposed to regulators to we expand testing beyond state/federal guidelines to encompass all contaminants in a region within a speciﬁc radius of a watershed? On the surface, it would seem possible by scanning MSDS sheets in a region, and my thought   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   behind the question is, it would appear to be a win-win scenario -- greater public safety and also an additional avenue for CapEx investment.","Very good question, Mike. Let me raise a couple of points with you. There are, for example, on the Ohio River, there is, as a result of I think it was the Ashland spill back in the 1980s, there has been a network of testing, and some of it's automated, some of it's still not automated, but a network of testing over, I think it's over 200 miles of the Ohio River, where each of the entities plus some federal monitoring that's being done, is checking. But now, it is not checking all elements.  Part of the problem is that even if you have the sheets, what they put in these tanks changes. And so even once we can get to a point of having the required disclosures of what are in these tanks, then it's also a matter of keeping up with any changes that occur.  Today, take this tank in West Virginia. When I was meeting with the governor of West Virginia, and also with the former governor who's now the Senator, Manchin, one of the things that they said is, look, this tank, this is a material that was deemed non-hazardous. They don't even have to tell us what's in that tank.  So the ﬁrst thing we've got to do is get more transparency, what the heck is in the tanks. Then it's a question of okay, how, for all of these other compounds can you develop, or can you develop, readily testing mechanisms, and you also have to establish a standard.  Take, for example, arsenic or mercury. We know those are contaminants, but they're naturally occurring. And so the regulations say, you can't have more than X in water.  It doesn't say zero, because frankly it's been naturally occurring for thousands of years, but they're concerned about it going above a certain level because there's been epidemiological study to determine what's the level at which it can create harm for people. The ﬁrst thing you've got to do on these 86,000 toxic chemicals, and all the others, is ﬁgure out what the heck a standard is.  So I think there's quite a ways to go, Mike, before we even can think about testing because you don't have a standard, and you don't even know what all the compounds are. I agree with your point that there needs to be examination of what other kinds of testing can be done for broad- based contaminants that you know may be upstream, but it's a bit more complicated, just because we don't even have standards for most of these chemicals."
"Hi. Good morning. I'm ﬁlling in for Angie. The only question we have is wondering about the warranty business you have on water pipes, given the deep freeze this winter in so many of your states. Have you seen any increase in the activity in terms of people either requesting to add warranties and protection or in terms of actual claims ﬁled?","This is Susan, Andrew. When we talk about the warranties, we oﬀer water, sewer, and in-home. We have seen an increase in the in-home, not so much on the water and sewer because they are buried deeper in the ground.  But the in-home is such a small part of our warranty business, it may be 6% of the homeowner services revenue. So really, yes we've seen an increase incident in-home, not necessarily the others. We have been able to manage through that.  And in terms of oﬀering it again, we have a robust, disciplined process before we ever bring on a new contract. We have a system of contractors, we have a master contractor who coordinates that.  We go out to ensure before we institute a contract that there's not pre-existing conditions. We also look for any indications that there could be, if a week later there is a problem.  So yes, we saw an increase in incident in one small part of the business. We have been able to manage it, but we have a robust process to ensure that when we do take on new contracts, that they are actuarially sound."
Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on a solid quarter.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thanks, Heike."
"Wondering if we could talk about New Jersey, and if there is any update on pending CTA decision.","It is still in process. I think New Jersey has had a number of other things occurring that may have taken a little bit of a focus oﬀ this.  We do continue to expect that it will occur, that we'll get some clariﬁcation out of the commission. We don't have control of the timeline, and again at this stage, Heike, we don't have a good sense. I would hope that it will be in the next three months."
"And assuming that we would get some kind of a favorable ruling that makes the way that the Commission treats this a little bit more fair, is that something that you would recognize in the next rate case cycle, or what would be the process once we have a decision?","It would be recognized in the next rate case cycle, absolutely."
"Good morning. Susan, if I could, would you talk about some of those regulated O&M expenses, the drivers. It sounded like two of the increases, there was a lot of unsustainable components to it that we'll see probably drop oﬀ in 2014. But more importantly, the two accounts that dropped by a wider margin, the employee-related costs and the maintenance materials and supplies, how sustainable are those decreases going forward?","First of all, on the increases, you're right. The two big increase areas were the billing and the uncollectibles, and the majority of that was due to the implementation of the new system, which as of 2013 we stabilized ERP.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We see 2014 as the year to stabilize even further CIS and EAM. Also the other increase, as you noted, dealt with temporary labor that we used, and leveraging eﬃciencies of ERP.  In terms of the decreases, we continue to look at preventative maintenance. We continue, in terms of the implementation of automation, for example, across our system looking at the sets, the smart ESS [ph] technology, the communication protocol, of ensuring that we can commoditize the purchase of meters, we can tie it into reading pressure ﬂows, et cetera. In terms of decreases, we're working on all of those.  Let me back up a little bit, though. Remember the goal, the chart we showed on Investor Day? It's to hold O&M as ﬂat as we can, and in order to oﬀset the increased depreciation and amortization, which was $26.2 million incrementally higher in 2013 than 2012, and because we are investing the capital signiﬁcantly in 2014 will also increased, we're having to look at all of the O&M expenses. If I look at each category, there are certain things we can do in each category. But all of our employees and our teams have the goal of trying to keep O&M ﬂat so that we can have experiences like I described at Indiana in their rate [inaudible] and we are [multiple speakers] --"
"Okay. And then just a point of clarity. The 7% to 10% growth rate, is that now oﬀ of the $2.25 weather-adjusted 2013?","No, the wedge starts at $1.99, and the wedge will start at $1.99 for the rest of this year also.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Got you. Anticipating future questions, I like it. And then lastly, congrats on getting that military base contract. Do you know what the timing might be on the next determination from the military? Is there a few more decisions that we might see in 2014, or do you have any clarity there?","Well, the last question really said it clearly. Do we have any clarity? The answer is no. We never really know when they're going to go forward.  We know what are typical schedules, and they seem to be moving forward on the more typical schedule now, and -- because we've said we have about six or so bids that are currently outstanding. We would hope to see one or two of those come out as decisions this year.  On Fort Hill, it's an eight-month transition, which is a pretty quick transition, and it has already started. So we'll start to see the revenues from that transaction this year. And we would hope to see a couple more decisions this year, but I can't tell you that we have intelligence that that's going to occur."
"Just on the West Virginia, could you give us a sense of, do you expect to see additional costs throughout this year from that, or are you just not sure?","Well, Steve, I think as Susan said, the lion's share of our system-related costs are a First Quarter occurrence, and a lot of that I think has already been incurred in January and February in terms of chemicals, overtime, bottled water, tankers, all the things that go along with -- plus the revenue credits that we're providing customers. I think beyond that, beyond the First Quarter, frankly, it'll largely be legal costs associated with working through the suits that have been ﬁled that name us, working with our customers, because we're going to aggressively work to have them not just understand but get comfortable with the water.  One of the learnings out of this is, and it's diﬀerent than a lot of other chemicals. In this instance, it isn't how much can someone drink without putting themselves at risk, it really is, can they smell it.  And so what we're ﬁnding is there is so much lower concentration that someone can smell, way below 200, 300 times below, what's been determined as the acceptable level by the CDC, and that's a diﬀerent challenge. And that's both in people's homes as well as within our system.  We're continuing to do ﬂushing, and yet, that costs because we're pushing treated water through systems. I would say the lion's share of the operating cost impacts, the one-time operating cost impacts, will really just be in the First Quarter."
"Okay. And just any bigger picture thought in terms of highlighting more the -- obviously, this is not directly related to something with a water system, but just, does this refocus on the story you've pushed about needing to replace and upgrade the system that we have overall?","I think it absolutely does. One of the challenges that we had in West Virginia, Steve, when it occurred is, if you will remember, this was right after the Polar Vortex. So we'd had that enormously cold period, and then warmth. And when that happens, you get line breaks.  We had a lot of line breaks in our West Virginia system, which is an old system that is under a lot of duress because of the elevation changes within the system. And so what we ﬁnd is that pipes in West Virginia, frankly, don't last as long as they do elsewhere because of the stress that is placed on them.  At the same time, our West Virginia customers have higher bills than most of our other systems because of density of population, which is very low, and the costs associated with operating   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   such a complex system. That is probably the most -- well, it is -- the most complex system we have anywhere in our 30 states, regulated and unregulated.  So I think one of the things it does speak to is the costs that can be incurred with aged infrastructure. On the water plant side, our folks have done a great job operating that plant. We're going to continue to look at ways to help improve that plant.  One of the issues that has been raised is whether there should be a second intake oﬀ another water source. If we look about that across our systems, some 20%, 25% of our water treatment systems only have a single intake. That is something that has to be looked at in the context of what is the cost.  So I think what it does is this opens the door for good conversation with all of our regulators about the trade-oﬀ between cost and the greater levels of investment, how can we manage that so that we don't push rates up too high but we recognize that these systems are old? That is really separate from the issue of how do we protect against, hopefully not bad actors like I think we had in this situation, but potential contaminants dumped into a river or other water body."
