Question,Answer
"Great. Hello. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about kind of rate strategy a little bit. I mean, obviously, we've seen a pretty big shift in where the top line gains are coming from, from base rates over to kind of DSIC and otherwise, and especially I guess that looks particularly acute in New Jersey.  So I wonder if you could talk about your CapEx and rate strategy in New Jersey, in particular, given that obviously the recent peer rate cases suggests we're looking at lower returns on equity there going forward, you're leveraging DSIC to the extent you can, but that only goes so far. Can you just give us your thoughts on how you managed through the challenge of capital allocation going forward in New Jersey, given that the environment seems to have shifted in terms of ROEs?","Hi, Ryan.     Ryan, it's Walter. Thanks for the question. What we're doing in New Jersey as in the other states, we're maximizing the use of DSIC and other mechanisms. So that we continue to invest and we   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   address the infrastructure challenges and we get recovery in the shortest period of time without having gone through a rate case.  And as you know, our focus on cost, we've been able to keep our costs ﬂat over a number of years. So the real focus for us is where do we invest and the timing of our investment and we just think that the DSIC mechanisms are the perfect mechanisms in each of the states, particularly New Jersey to invest in our infrastructure.     And Ryan, if I could add to that. This is Linda. So when we look at the DSIC mechanisms, they really provide us additional ﬂexibility in terms of the – the timing of ﬁling our rate cases. And in New Jersey, in particular, we're also looking at from the lower ROE issue, the impact of the consolidated tax adjustment. So if that were to be ﬁnal, there would be somewhat of an oﬀset from that as well.     So one thing to kind of overall with what Walter and Linda said, Ryan, I think it's a great for any utility in today's market, where we have interest rates continue to be pretty much artiﬁcially held low, is that through all of the alternative mechanisms we've worked so hard to get in the past few years. It provides us more ﬂexibility and optionality and ensures that when we do go in for rate cases, we don't have the bigger rate increases or rate shocks."
"Okay. And then I guess – I guess boiling that all down to kind of the target growth rate, so I guess you don't believe that having to achieve growth through alternative methods like DSIC will have a negative impact on your ability to meet the 7% to 10% kind of target range over the long-term – over the intermediate term, let's say.","No. In fact, our growth triangle, we shared last year, we looked at the CapEx investment and again, as Walter mentioned earlier, we look in all of our states, we look at where we need to invest, we look at the ROEs. We always provide a level of funding to ensure that we're able to provide the clean, safe, aﬀordable and reliable service. And then we look at other capital that's a little more discretionary and where that goes. But also, when we look at that on top of the CapEx, you have the regulated acquisitions, you've got the market base. So, we have a diversiﬁed portfolio for growth just as Walter said, we beneﬁt from the geographic diversity we have with our state."
"Hey, good morning. Listen, good job again on the improvement in the operating eﬃciency ratios. Can you just maybe give your thoughts on what your trajectory of improvement looks like from here to 2018 to get to your 35% goal? And are you now, as you've succeeded in moving O&M pretty fast, you're reevaluating, maybe where you could ultimately get to?","Well, Dan. If you look at the O&M eﬃciency ratio, as a straight line for improvement, that might be the case. But we've gone from 44.2% in 2010 to the 37.7% in the last 12 months, but really the O&M eﬃciency ratio is more like an exponential curve as opposed to a linear line and the further along that curve you get, the harder it is to make even smaller increments of change. So, I don't think you can look into a straight line rate and think that that's going to hold. We've been very successful. We have other opportunities, especially through automation and technology, but we stand to our stretch goal in 2018 of 35%."
"How much – if you ﬂip around the other way, how much of the improvement in earned ROEs this year versus last is a function of eﬃciency gains relative to, maybe kind of the regulatory relief and mechanisms helping to put some revenues back in the business?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   The calculation is basically O&M over revenues. And you can look at our revenue growth and you can look at our expenses and know that we've made signiﬁcant improvement on expense management. You all ask us frequently, well, do you think there is more to get and the fact is that as Linda mentioned earlier, we're just now stabilizing our SAP system, the implementation from last year, we see opportunities there. And the innovation and technology that I talk about, we think will provide us even more opportunities in the future. So we've done a lot of things. What we do in the future, maybe a little bit more of that, but also some new areas.     And I can say that our drive for eﬃciency throughout our business is really taking hold. We've got, as I said in on prior calls, we have a number of Yellow Belts that are looking at improving processes and eliminating errors. We have a supply chain that's so engaged with the business and looking to reduce the materials that we purchase. And our entire team is really focused on driving our cost down because they understand the why. The why is so we can continue to invest in our infrastructure and do so with minimizing our customer impact. So we've made great progress, and as Susan said we're going to continue to make progress to get below the 35%."
"And I guess just kind of one last question, just to put in context, kind of some weather expectation for the rest of this year. What conditions would you like to see in August and September to help you shore up the upper end of guidance range and what is the risk as you look at the forecast today of seemingly mild temperatures at most places?","Well, what we'd like is hot and dry weather, but our business is based on normal weather. So as long as we have with – and it's hard to determine what normal weather is. But as long as we have normal weather, that's what we're looking for."
So a little more heat and a little less wet from here would be good?,Through at least December.     Through at least.     Through at least December.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)
"Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about the O&M expenses and I understand that it's not going to be linear and all that, but I wonder if, as you work with your ERP system and on projects, if you can better pinpoint the timing of any step change in expenses?","So let me start there. So as you implement an ERP system, it takes a little bit of time to go through stabilization and then optimizing the system and then being able to really drive the improvements and get the eﬃciency out of the system. We are seeing this year, we implemented our ERP system in 2012. We're seeing that eﬃciency coming through this year. We implemented in two phases, the customer information system as well as our work management system in 2013. So we would expect to move through those same stages through time and begin to continuously drive improvements and optimization."
"Okay. Well, sounds like you've got some projects that are going to start bearing some fruit as we get into next year?","Yes. I mean, the SAP and also as I mentioned the NPXpress, again labor and power and chemicals are our largest cost drivers. So the more we can ﬁnd ways to save on the power costs, which by the way, just three years ago, our power costs were $110 million last year, for 2013, they were $94 million. So we're ﬁnding ways to reduce those large cost drivers including the NPXpress also reduces the need for chemicals, with up to 100% of the carbon additive.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So – and as Walter mentioned, the SAP system is allowing us much more visibility into inventory. For example, where we at one time could not see between states when we had in inventory, now we can do more inventory sharing, which is making us much more cost eﬀective. Now those things, as Linda mentioned, don't happen overnight, but we see a steady building of the ability to do this. Some will be over the next year, some the next two years or three years, but we see a path forward for continual improvement."
"Okay, great. Sounds good. I wanted to ask an unrelated question, going back to the DSIC. If you could help us review just on which states have that mechanism in place and where we are with DSIC for some of the other states that you operate in?","Yeah. We have DSIC in a number of states, but our top ﬁve states, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana all have DSIC. So again, a signiﬁcant amount of our investment moves through those mechanisms to get recovery in the quickest amount of time."
Okay. And what does the pipeline look like for the rest of the states?,"Well, we're always – we look at several alternative mechanisms. We look at DSIC, we look at future test year, we're looking at mechanisms to address declining usage. So for all of our states, we're constantly evaluating the regulatory construct in which variations of these type of mechanisms could work best in every state. So we're always looking at all of our states and ways to address these issues."
"Okay, great. And I may have missed this. Did you publish CapEx for this year?",We did. We said that we would spend around $1.1 billion.
"Good morning, everyone. Good morning Susan. Just building on Ryan's ﬁrst question. Is there a speciﬁc timeline for the BPU to ﬁnalize the CTA issue? And how does that impact the timing of your next New Jersey rate ﬁling or more speciﬁcally when do you expect to ﬁle next in the state?","Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, the comments are due back on August 18 and then there's no published timeline, but we'd expect something maybe – by the end of the year. No guarantee but that's what we'd expect.     And Jonathan, to the second part of your question, we're constantly evaluating all of our stake, the appropriate timing for any rate cases."
"Okay. I mean, do you need – I guess a BPU to ﬁnalize that before you can ﬁle the case and actually get the implementation of the new CTA treatment?",Once the BPU makes the decision then it would be eﬀective in your next rate case ﬁling.
Okay. And are you at liberty to say how much that would increase New Jersey's underlying rate base value if the staﬀ proposal is adopted?,We're not. We had – our last rate case was a black box settlement and so each of those components are conﬁdential.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. Moving on to the O&M, is the run rate of 37.7%, is that indicative of where you think the full year will come in?",We believe that we will continue to make progress on the O&M eﬃciency ratio from now through 2018 and then to the stretch goal of 35%.
Okay. So the trend towards the upper end of guidance range is no way weather driven.,"You know, when we look at a range there is some degree of weather variability that we build in there, but that does not account for any extreme weather variability, which is why just in water, just as you see in electrics, the third quarter has such a big impact on our year that we just like to see what happens in the third quarter before we're able to address the range again.  And I will tell you that again, we expect some weather variability that's why you have a range in the ﬁrst place, that's one of the component. But we need to look and see what happens. We're getting preliminary numbers for July, but that's not ﬁnal, we've got to look at August and September to kind of see where we end up."
"Okay. So I guess just continuing with the weather theme a little bit and looking at your consumption numbers, it looks like I guess the residential and commercial maybe down a little more than I would expect, speciﬁcally if Q2 last year was slightly negative due to weather. Is there anything you're seeing there, that's exacerbating the decline from just the normal, I guess 1% to 1.5%, we've seen annually over the years in the industry?","There's really nothing there. You have to remember to what we put out is billed and unbilled revenue and then billed sales volume. So what we're looking at is the billed sales volume piece of it, but we're seeing what would be expected from usage decline.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Yeah, Jonathan. We're still seeing the 1% to 2% decline as we have over the last several years, nothing out of the ordinary there."
"Okay. And then last question on the military base side. One of your competitors recently has indicated a desire to perhaps pursue contracts on the electric side of bases, not just the water and wastewater. Is that something that you're interested in as well?","The 10 bases that we serve, we are partners with those bases and we know our business is water and wastewater, but we also, as I mentioned earlier, have a lot of opportunities in projects at our plants that do look at the whole water energy connection. So we are not claiming that speciﬁcally for any base, but we are open to options in the future based on what we think we can deliver in a cost eﬀective and superior performance standpoint to our partners."
"I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the $700 million placeholder for acquisitions and development. Maybe are there any speciﬁc opportunities out there or is there a particular region you're focused on? Is the environment for municipal acquisitions improving? And why $700 million, just any color there would be helpful?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","When we setup the capital budget for this year, for the ﬁrst time we wanted to say here is the amount that we want to look at regulated CapEx investment in our plants, pipes. And the other part was we said, for regulated acquisitions, we want to make sure that we plan for a budget and then we had the strategic initiatives for those opportunities that might arise, so that we didn't have to then scramble if something came up.  So, for example, for this year, as we look at regulated acquisitions and as we've talked in the past before, Tim, they're very spiky and they don't happen overnight and they are in the pipeline and things come up, referendums, diﬀerent things that may change the timing of some things.  So for us, it's a placeholder. And then we've got the strategic initiatives, as we've said before, there are things that we look at. Walter mentioned all of our work in the shale play, for example, is all regulated, but we continue to have discussions if we can ﬁnd a non-regulated shale play that will not require us to take a risk or change our risk proﬁle because we're not going to take a risk on invested capital in the ground. We want to have a return of, at a minimum, for any of those ventures.  So it was a placeholder. But what we also have the ability to do is as we go into a year, we have the ability to shift some of those funds from one place to the other. For example, if we see one area we may not spend as much, we have the opportunity, if we have a need, for example, in a state for additional investment, we can shift it over there.  So that's why Walter mentioned and I and Linda all we still see a path to the $1.1 billion this year. At the end of the year, it may not be quite in the buckets that we talked about at the ﬁrst of the year."
Okay. And then are – say the drought conditions in the west are – if the economic conditions leaning to an easier environment for acquisitions or are things sort of status quo?,"Well, we do discuss with municipalities and others on California, the opportunity to become part of American Water. We'll continue to do that. I think that would probably play into it long- term.     You know one of the beneﬁts that we've got, Tim, to that point is we have the ability to raise capital. We are, as Linda mentioned, we have a strong credit rating. We have a strong balance sheet. So where regardless of the state, there are opportunities for systems that have huge demands on their resources and choose to not deploy them in water or wastewater, we provide an option for those folks.

"Thank you, Susan.  Operator  And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Story, for closing remarks.","Well, thank you all so much. You know I have to tell you, this is an interesting call as you heard diﬀerent voices on here. It is – I don't think there's ever been a more exciting time to be part of American Water.  We have an amazing team of people. We've got 6600 employees that every day their focus is on making sure that we deliver water and wastewater in all of our services in a way that's clean, safe, aﬀordable and reliable. And we understand what our business is, we're going to stay true to our business with the risk proﬁle you know, but also ﬁnd ways to grow.  So thank you for being part of this and I just want to say that I'm just thrilled to death with the team we've got. Our new CFO is just doing a terriﬁc job, much better than her predecessor. And again, Walter and the continuity we have, with the tremendous expertise we have throughout our state and in our market-base business, I'm just proud to be part of this team and we appreciate you all as investors and analysts.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.
