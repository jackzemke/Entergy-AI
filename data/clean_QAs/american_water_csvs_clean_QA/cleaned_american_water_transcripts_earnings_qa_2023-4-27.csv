Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning, and thank you for the time today. I appreciate all the commentary on the PFAS side, but just want to dig in there a little bit more. Any way to frame the magnitude of capital versus O&M that's particularly levered to an outcome here, at a minimum, is this more of a capital opportunity than an expense concern or you're kind of ﬂagging both as potential impacts to rates on a go-forward basis?","Hey, good morning. Rich. Yeah, it's a great question. Obviously, as Cheryl indicated, we have a lot of analysis to do with this proposed rule at these treatment limits that are proposed. And Rich, how this works, I mean, there is a process to be worked here in terms of comments and feedback to the EPA about the proposed rule, and as Cheryl said, obviously, we're quite supportive of what they're trying to accomplish here. And in fact, even at the four parts per trillion, we don't have huge issue with that. I think the issue is around cost. As Cheryl said, our early expectations here that the EPA estimates around costs are understated, so I think that'll be part of the response that the industry generally provides back to the EPA.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   For us, as I said and Cheryl said, we're continuing to evaluate the impacts. And as you know, we've talked about these many times, we use of a risk-based approach to our capital planning. So as we work these projects into our capital plan, it could very well change that risk proﬁle and move other projects out. So as we think about changes to our overall plan, we still got a lot of work to do to determine that.  Speciﬁc to your question though around capital versus O&M, we think there's of a fair amount of both, that will be necessary at this level. So there'll be capital requirements to have facilities that are able to facilitate the treatment, and then, of course, there will be an ongoing operating cost associated with the treatment itself. So, lots to be learned yet on this, and again, direct impacts to our plan yet to be determined."
"Okay, understood. That's very helpful context. I guess sticking with the cost side, we spent a lot of time last few discussing chemicals cost and it came up in the walk this year in terms of the rate recovery of those higher costs, can you speak a little bit more to the recent trends you're seeing there and maybe bridge that back to your expectations last fall when you laid out the latest plan. How do you think about these expenses impacting customer bills over the next few years?","Yeah, Rich, a good question, and Cheryl and John, certainly can weigh-in on this too, but we have seen, I'd say a continuation of the impacts that we started seeing really in the second quarter of last year. While some of the increases in certain costs may have started to level out a bit, they still are all elevated, and we expect that to continue for some time. I think the real key here and you touched on it is the work we did in the regulatory arena to address these costs early-on and we've estimated that roughly 75% of the cost we will experience in '23, we've got fully baked into rates as a result of those cases we did last year. And as Cheryl mentioned or may be John did in the prepared remarks in the Indiana case we just ﬁled, we've addressed it there too. So we think we have done as good a job as could be done to address these costs early-on so that they don't have bottom-line impact, but we continue to see a fair amount of pressure here on the cost side."
Okay. Great. I appreciate all the detail there as well. And thank you for the time today.,Sure. Thanks Rich.  Operator  Your next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thank you. So ﬁrst maybe like a presentation question. So you no longer show us the breakdown of earnings by segment, right. But no bridge for regulated earnings, market-based and corporate. Can you give us this breakdown for the quarter?","Well, I think the waterfall that you have there probably is as good as there is. The impact from the market-based business, which is now just military is very small, and on a year-over-year basis, just not much of a variation. The other segment, I think we highlighted, the primary driver there, which would have been again the sort of true-up gain on the HOS sale in the ﬁrst quarter of last year."
"Okay. I mean, I try to actually imply it from the 10-Q and I couldn't, but anyway okay. Moving on to, you didn't mention the weather as a factor in earnings and that's I think something that we've seen on the electric side and a couple of your Water peers have also highlighted as a drag on the quarter. Was that a driver at all?","Yeah, ﬁrst quarter for us is not much of a weather impact year. Cheryl, you want to just talk about seasonality or?     Yeah. Our biggest weather impacts are going to be in second and third quarter. Sometimes it will spill-over into the fourth quarter. Typically, the ﬁrst quarter, unless the weather is really, really severe in one direction or another, we won't see any weather impact at all. And this year, I think the weather was not that dramatic for us to see that impact, so I think we're pretty solid."
"Okay. And then lastly, I noticed that you're pursuing an appeal about the denial of the acquisition adjustment related to the Shorelands acquisition, and as the decision will be issued sometime in 2023, so can you, again, I haven't followed that closely, but can you give us a sense of, is this still a long shot, I mean how important is it for any future growth aspirations you might have, and I know that that transaction itself is only $29 million. So that's not that big a deal as far as the goodwill impact, but again, any implications related to this pending case?","Yeah, really no implications of any materiality, but Cheryl, you want to comment on status here.     Yeah, Angie, the issue is still kind of hanging out there, but there's going to be no real impact to us from a ﬁnancial perspective. And in all honesty, we found other ways of doing deals, so that   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we're not so worried about the precedents that this decision sets for us. We still believe like we have a strong case, but in the grand scheme of things, that really has little to no impact."
"Okay. And then just going back to PFAS, I'm sorry. So I looked at these rules, pretty strict requirements with penalties, but again, I think the problem we've seen over the last couple of decades is what EPA hasn't been really imposing those penalties or really going after the systems that have been non-compliant with the regulations. So I'm just wondering is how big a diﬀerence would there be with this one as far as like for example, your municipal grow -- municipal M&A or any sort of additional pressure that that should exert on privately or municipally owned systems, again because EPA hasn't been particularly diligent on imposing on the rules?","Yeah. I think it's a fair observation, Angie and it's obviously one of the things that we'll address in our comments. We think that these rules should apply obviously to all providers and that EPA should use its authority to enforce the rules. There is a track-record here, so we'll have to again sort of comment on that. As it relates to our views on acquisition potential, John, you want to comment on that? We think there could be some opportunity, but I think you've hit on the key issue.     Yes, Angie, I'd just say that we look at this issue as another reason on the list for why municipals may choose to sell to us in the future."
"And congrats on the successful equity oﬀering. Just curious, did you consider placing the full bill $2 billion of equity for the whole plan to just take it out of the way given the strong demand? And I believe I heard you say that you expect the equity oﬀering to be EPS neutral on for the year 2023 versus plan, was that correct?","John, you want to comment here?     Sure. Yeah. On the ﬁrst part of the question, we tried to remain consistent with the messaging that we had provided to investors in the past. So as we thought about the magnitude of the issuance, we wanted to stay within that range, and we did so. With regards to dilution, that's correct. We expect that just given our ability to to pay-oﬀ debt and with where interest rates are and given how we trade from a valuation perspective we look at the issuances as EPS neutral."
"Okay. Great. And then switching topics, I noticed that Indiana legislation as well, does that inﬂuence higher any of that perspective capital or acquisition priorities in the State?","John, you want to comment on that. This is, yeah, the question really, Paul, is around this consolidated rate issue that legislation you're referring to."
"And the additional mechanism from the new legislation that was enacted, it seems like it could help reduce regulatory lag prospectively.","Yeah. I think that's probably fair, and I do think it probably creates opportunity around acquisitions again, I think it gives us more leverage to to grow in Indiana and have use that consolidated revenue mechanism to lessen the bill impact on customers. I think it's a very important piece of legislation from that perspective to again sort of facilitate growth."
Yes. Thank you. Congratulations. I was wondering if I could ask your view on sort of Florida as a market for acquisitions. I think there's legislation that's progressing there on fair value. And then just how you're thinking about the pursuit of litigation regarding the PFAS rules to help pay and sort of how that would get folded in versus the timeline for compliance? Thank you.,"Well, those are two big topics, Gregg. First, maybe on Florida, let me just comment there. I think and obviously, we are following developments there as we do sort of across the nation around legislative actions, regulatory actions, etc. But I'd say our answer is the same as it always is on potential growth into other states, we really have to see an opportunity to grow substantially in a particular state. We look at regulatory environment, legislative environment, those types of things and we're constantly looking at opportunities, but all of the parts have to sort of come together I think for us to do anything signiﬁcant beyond our existing footprint, which of course, we like a lot. We think we have optimized our footprint. We like the environments that we're in. We have great opportunities for growth in our existing jurisdictions and obviously that's where our focus continues to be.  On your second question around PFAS and litigation and impacts there, as Cheryl mentioned, there is litigation and has been for some time around this. And our goal here, I think the industry's goal is to, well, we feel responsible for helping to solve the problem and we are best positioned to do the treatment, we do think it's important that those that are responsible for the production of the chemicals also be held responsible. So we are -- our states are actively involved in that litigation, and we'll continue to be and we do think that's an important part of this overall equation that has to be worked through. And again, customer aﬀordability is at the heart of that. We don't think it's necessary or appropriate for customers to pay for things that they really aren't responsible for. So we'll be actively pursuing that litigation along with the rest of the industry."
"Hey, good morning, team. I just wanted to build a little bit on Angie's earlier question just regarding kind of the segment break-down a little bit. Can you give us some directional guidance, I don't think your full-year was exactly broken out by the two segments and was kind of other being recast to include you know what's left of market-based and other historical parent and other segment. I think full year 2022 was $0.19 from that segment, but that included I think it was in $19 million pre-tax gain. So how should we be thinking about I guess full year '23 kind of overall drag there?","Boy, Jonathan, we're going to go back and look at those numbers, those numbers don't sound right to me for the prior year. We had some true-up activity related to the HOS sale and maybe that's getting confused a bit here, but all that's remaining is our Military Services Group and the earnings year-over-year really not much of a variance and it's a relatively small part of the overall earnings contribution anyway. But we can follow back up on that reconciliation, the numbers that you're quoting, because again, I don't think that's reﬂective of the size of the business."
"Okay. So, but I mean, it sounds like, if we just strip out maybe that $19 million pre-tax true-up gain or whatever that you're kind of thinking, the other part of the business is kind of ﬂattish when we look at it from '22 to '23?","Yeah, certainly the Military Services Group operations year-over-year relatively ﬂat. We'll need to verify that $19 million pre-tax number you're quoting there. That doesn't ring a bell to me. I mean, I know there's a number there, I just don't recall it being that. So we'll have Aaron follow back up with you on that, just to make sure we got the right numbers there."
