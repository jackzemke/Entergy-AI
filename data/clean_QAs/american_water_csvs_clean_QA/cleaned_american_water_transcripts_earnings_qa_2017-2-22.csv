Question,Answer
"I was hoping that you could comment a little bit on Keystone's ability to continue to take market share, even if – especially in light of rising natural gas prices?","Right. So our Keystone operations are in the Appalachian Basin. And we're the only water services provider that does the cycle of water management, except, of course, we do not at the end of the cycle take the waste at the sites and put them into the deep wells that have been controversial. So because of that, we're ﬁnding that more and more of the E&Ps want to deploy their capital for their own, for example, development of pipelines and for their own services. So we can step in and basically handle providing the water and recycling the water on the site and they don't have to worry about it.  So we've gone from 20% when we purchased them in July of 2015 to 35% now. We still believe that there are opportunities for growth in the area. And, in fact, what we're ﬁnding now is that there's so much work in the area that we're seeing some of the pre kind of 2016 downturn. We're seeing some of the pricing come back for the services and the need for the large E&Ps especially to feel comfortable that they have a partner who has a very strong commitment to environmental sustainability. So we do think that there's further room to grow in Appalachian Basin."
Excellent. Thank you. And you guys touched a little bit on this in your prepared remarks but I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about some of the leverage you have to continue to improve O&M eﬃciency?,"Hi. This is Walter. Yeah. We're continually working on reducing our expenses, as you know, when we talk about – I think a big enabler is the technology and that's why I highlighted the technology we're using at Pennsylvania. One of the big advantages we have as a company is we're able to deploy technology in one area, take the learnings of that technology and then apply it across American Water to realize signiﬁcant value.  So I would say the technology I highlighted, the technologies I've highlighted in the past around non-revenue water and ﬁnding leaks in West Virginia, doing things like using   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   technology to streamline our routes, so that our people in the ﬁeld are more eﬃcient, those are the things we're going to be doing across American Water to drive eﬃciencies. And a lot of the low-hanging-fruit we've already gotten but the technology is going to be a key enabler.     One of the things we're excited about, for example, there's a lot in the press about drones and delivering packages. We are actually a New Jersey American utilizing drones and infrared to actually go over pipes in the ground from the air. And we're ﬁnding that we're able to spot leaks and ﬁnd leaks before they ever occur in main breaks. And you don't have to dig up the ground or anything. It's pretty cools on those things we're doing. And there was an FSR that I was out with in Northern New Jersey a few months ago, David.  And he had the smartphone. And when I say we went into a house, I say the royal we. He went in and changed the meter and I was with him in the house and we walked outside. And this gentleman has been with the company 38 years. And he looked. He goes, watch this. He said I can read this meter immediately on my smartphone. So there is a lot of really neat things going on in terms of deploying technology in very practical ways, not just the high-tech level ways, but things that make it easier for our frontline employees to serve our customers better. And we're just at the beginning of that we believe."
"Thank you. So, since your Analyst Day, there's been a lot of updates that could have had impact on your M&A prospects, right. We had a little bit more clarity around the Trump's infrastructure plan and the type of ﬂat water infrastructure he would actually focus on. We have a New Jersey bill that seems to be pushing for similar CapEx requirements for municipal water utilities versus investor-owned utilities. Could you talk about those trends? And also we seem to be having a little bit more movement on the corporate water M&A. If you could just give me a sense of how you think about M&A since the Analyst Day.","Sure, Angie. Thank you for the question. I will start and then Walter can talk speciﬁcally about the New Jersey situation. So, interestingly, I've been involved with a Bipartisan Policy Center working on looking at the whole infrastructure issue around the administration and their eﬀort. And it's interesting. There are a lot of parties that are interested. We have a coalition with the U.S. Chamber and NAM and several groups that are looking at this. I think the question remains is where is the money coming from. So, for us, and the infrastructure, we are very excited that there is a focus on infrastructure.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We like that there is a lot of interest from both sides of the aisle on public private partnerships. So, we'll just have to see how that plays out. But the good news for us is, regardless of what plays out nationally, we have such a strong capital investment program. And being an investor- owned water utility, we could see a bump. But, for us, we're just continuing to do our business, which is robust. And, as we said, we continue to invest more and more capital. So there could be something down there. We're monitoring it closely and hopefully we will see something come from that.  The last question you asked – and then Walter can talk about what's going on in New Jersey with the issue around municipalities. We are constantly – as we said at Investor Day, we survey the landscape of all municipalities and companies that are out there that meet our guidelines and our discipline in terms of acquisition, but we are very disciplined. So when we look, we don't see the need to grow for the sake of growing, unless it is a good investment for us for the long-term.  Our ﬁnancial models – we're always looking at, so what will this mean in ﬁve years, 10 years, 15 years, and ensuring that we have a discipline around those acquisitions. But that doesn't mean we're not looking or that we don't have substantial data and information on these opportunities. It just means that we will not get out there and do something for the sake of just saying that we have an acquisition.  And I do think it's interesting. We've been waiting, as you know, following the water industry as long as you have. Everybody keeps talking about there will be – no pun intended – the ﬂoodgates open on municipalities to be privatized. But it's a one by one battle as municipalities have to look at their own particular circumstances and at all the options that they have available to them.  So our entire strategy is we're in these communities. We're on the ground. We're there to be a solutions provider. We think, in many cases, we can provide services at a lower cost. And we believe that we can improve water quality, improve service and give predictability of cost in many locations better than what exist there. And it's incumbent upon us to make sure that we tell our story. And the New Jersey situation is very interesting. Walter, if you want to talk about that.     Yeah. Thanks, Susan. Yeah. What we're referring to here is Water Quality Accountability Act. And it was introduced by Senator Sweeney recently in New Jersey. And it's working its way through the Senate. It's got to work its way through the Assembly, obviously, and then get signed by the Governor. But what it does is really requires the same things with municipalities and investor- owned utilities. And let me give you a couple of examples of what they're looking at. The testing of valves and hydrants per New Jersey Board of Public Utilities requirements would be not just required of investor-owned, but were required of all the municipalities within New Jersey.  Cyber security program requirements, action plans for any notice of violation, developing a comprehensive long-term capital plan and a replacement rate for pipe targeted about 150 years. These are all the things that we're required to do on the investor-owned side and it's   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   really going to have the same requirements for municipalities throughout New Jersey. And the whole purpose is to make sure that the water quality is protected in New Jersey. And that's really the focus of Senator Sweeney's bill that he introduced."
"But you think on the back of it, municipalities will basically face incremental CapEx and that could actually push them to potentially privatize their systems?","Well, I think it will cause them to take a look, do we want to do this as a municipality or do we call in American Water who has been doing it for decades and decades in New Jersey with great success and leverage our expertise. I think that's something that they're going to have to take at and we'd be glad to talk to them about it because we are a solutions provider.     I think the thing to point out, Angie, is not just for the EPA, what we have found in the past is whereas we would immediately need to and would address issues that came up in terms of any non-compliance in wastewater. For example, that there are many municipalities and cities that have had non-compliant items for decades and there was just a diﬀerent standard of holding them accountable than us.  And I think one of the things we learned from Flint, Michigan is safe water is for everybody. And, regardless of who provides that water, whether it's private or public, there should be the same standards for safe, clean water. And that we have great wastewater services and sanitation services. So I think that as some of these things have happened, people have realized it doesn't matters who the purveyor is, there needs to be standards that everybody follows. And, for us, it's the ability to have a level playing ﬁeld."
"Great. Thanks and good morning. I had a question with regard to the Scranton and McKeesport transactions. And I'm just trying to get a better handle on kind of how this impacts the guidance   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   for 2017 as you do these larger transactions. Can you just walk us through kind of layman's back of the envelope on how that impacts returns this year?  In other words, if – presumably until you get in for your next base rate case in Pennsylvania, there's some kind of a drag there on the returns coming from those systems in particular and that would be maybe trued up once you do get rates and be a tailwind beyond 2017. Is that a fair way to think about that or can you just give us – walk us through the dynamics on that?","Absolutely, Ryan. So, in the investor material and in our slides, we outlined, kind of, the overall acquisition process. And if you look at page 12 of our slides, it really starts with the agreement process. So when we look at the Scranton acquisition, we have now closed Scranton as of December 2016.  That means that we take on the customers. We begin to integrate them into our system. And, generally, from a ﬁnancial standpoint, during the timeframe between when we close and when we get through a ﬁnal rate case decision, we ﬁnance those acquisitions with shorter-term debt. And we would expect these acquisitions to meet certain ﬁnancial metrics, including being accretive to earnings.  And so, that is kind of the process that we go through until we ﬁle our next rate case decision or rate case. In the rate case process, then we will, coming out of that process, have our authorized amount that is included in rate base upon which we would have the opportunity to earn a full return."
"Okay. So if I can paraphrase that, it's accretive right away. But then it becomes more accretive once you actually get base rates in place. Is that a fair statement or no?","It's diﬀerent for every acquisition. But, yes, once you get that full amount in the rate base that's what you would generally expect."
"Okay. Good. And then my other question was just big picture. I know we had the NARUC Winter Meetings recently. And I wasn't able to get there but I'm sure you had a number of people there. I think I saw the agenda. You had some folks on panels and things. Any takeaways there in terms of big picture, emerging themes? What's around the corner from a regulatory standpoint?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   This is Susan, Ryan. I think everybody is just kind of wondering what's going to come out of Washington. They're looking at the issue of infrastructure and what that means. They're looking at any potential changes in the EPA and for the electric side the Clean Power Plan and what does this mean and the waters of the U.S. And I think everybody is also carefully watching for the tax issues.  So I think there are state issues that continue to be state to state. But, I think, at NARUC, just like everywhere else, we're kind of watching to see what is going to happen on the new landscape. And we're all kind of speculating and we can draw general models. But, at the end of the day, we're waiting to see even proposals. If we have proposals, we can model and see what the impacts are.  At this point, we're just kind of guessing. And I think everybody is pretty much in that situation. We continue, though, to look at investment opportunities, regardless NARUC does, with the President of NARUC, Rob Powelson, of course. Pennsylvania has always been very innovative in the way that they look at infrastructure in ensuring that their citizens are taken care of that are our customers. So I think it was kind of the same themes (40:40), but an uncertainty of so what will the new rules be and how long will it take for us to know what those new rules are."
A couple questions here jumping back to Keystone. Have you all disclosed or would you mind disclosing the capital budget for or speciﬁcally for Keystone for this year?,"No. Spencer, we don't do that because it's so small. Basically, they were extremely capital-light. We are open to looking at design build on a ﬁve-year basis. And we would actually look at that ﬁve-year for any capital investment from a depreciation standpoint, at least for our model. But, right now, it's just not signiﬁcant enough and we're just not really disclosing it because it's so small.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. And with the rebound in nat gas prices, is it possible that 2017 could be kind of a quote unquote normalized year for Keystone or is it too early to say that?","Well, I think, it depends on your deﬁnition of normal, what normal is. I think going back to the low turn we've had from the middle of 2015, say, through the end of last year, we know things are picking up. I mean, you can just look at natural gas prices. Even though they have come down a bit because of the really warm weather we've had this winter, we know that, of course, going into the summer – 2015 natural gas was 33% of power generation. Coal was 33%. Nuclear was 20%. Now we're starting to see as gas prices are so aﬀordable that that will probably continue. And we will probably see gas increase. And those of you all who cover electric also know that, regardless of what happens with the Clean Power Plan, a lot of plans are already underway. And people are already building signiﬁcant new combined cycle facilities.  So we believe that we've turned the corner. We see activity tremendously growing, as I said in my comments. We're seeing rig counts up. We're seeing well completion activities up, along with the natural gas prices. We believe that we're getting back to a more normal. What that normal is? I think we're going to have to see over the next few months. And we'll continue at our quarterly discussions to say is it higher than we thought or less than we thought. But we do, as we always are, want to be conservative and make sure that we have a few more months under us to see what can we look at that more predictable. So it's much better than last year. Will it be back to 2014 – 2013, 2014? I think we'll just have to wait-and-see."
"Okay. Fair points there. Very helpful. Switching gears more of a housekeeping question. I know a few months back when we got the West Virginia binding settlement or agreement there, there was kind of an outstanding piece with your own insurance companies that could ultimately net us some cash. Is that still outstanding or has that been settled? Is it possible we get a bit of an inﬂux at some point this year?","Well, it's not settled. And we had two diﬀerent ﬁrms who did not participate. And so we currently – one of them requires arbitration and we have begun the arbitration process. The other, we have ﬁled a lawsuit in West Virginia against and that's public information. So we're continuing. As you know, these things don't happen quickly. But we are in process. October 28, we actually ﬁled in Kanawha County against Starr Indemnity and that one is public record.  And then the other insurer we have actually started the arbitration process. Since they are located oﬀshore, there was mandatory arbitration. And we actually have had the panel – the chairperson of the panel has been selected. So we're continuing that process and both of those – that level of insurance together is $50 million, $25 million each.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. And that would be, I guess, simply a cash ﬂow adjustment or an item perhaps at some point? I guess, obviously, if it were to be on the income statement we could adjust that pretty easily?","Yes. It would be both. And if it were, as you know, the entire settlement was on West Virginia American Water's books because they were the ones that the lawsuits were against. And so if we do recover any additional funds, it would go back to West Virginia American."
Okay. Perfect. That's all I had. Congrats on a really nice year and look forward to seeing you all soon.,"Thanks, Spencer.
