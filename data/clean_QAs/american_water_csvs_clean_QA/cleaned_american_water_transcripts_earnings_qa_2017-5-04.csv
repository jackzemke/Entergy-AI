Question,Answer
Okay. So you don't anticipate anything unique or any kind of unique sort of pushback in terms of the scale of that system and that being causing an issue in terms of single tariﬀ pricing or anything like that? I mean you think it will be pretty straightforward and be treated similarly than any other rate case?,"That's what we expect, Ryan. And again, when you consider the size, $1.3 billion worth of investment over the last four years, this is a signiﬁcant investment but still it's part of the much bigger capital program we have in Pennsylvania."
"Right. Yeah, good point. Now, what about the broader Pennsylvania. I mean it seems like that deal – at least the announced deal has slowed a little bit. I mean, you had Scranton, was obviously big one, McKeesport, but lately there haven't really been any additions. I mean should we interpret that as meaning there is a little bit of a deceleration or are there are a whole lot sort in the hopper that we are seeing yet and the cadence remains really strong?","Well, let me say that we continue to work with communities to address their issues and be a solutions provider for them. And again, we know that we've got a compelling story and we can add tremendous value to our customers."
"Okay. And then one last one, just more sort of a housekeeping short-term issue, but we are – Linda, you mentioned the variability on weather and appreciate the transparency there in terms of the guidance. But any early read on 2Q, we're almost halfway through, on whether that will be a headwind or a tailwind for the second quarter results?","Hey, Ryan. This is Susan. Before Linda answers, if we're able to project what the weather is going to be, none of us may be sitting around this table. But Linda, what do you say?     Yeah. In the ﬁrst quarter, Ryan, we did see a little bit of lower demand, but it was really in line with declining usage that is normally expected."
Right.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),And if you have any inside information we would love to hear it.
"Well, I just mean we're ﬁve weeks into 2Q, right? So, I'm just trying to get an idea whether there is any sense of whether it's been in the ﬁrst ﬁve weeks of 2Q, whether it's been a headwind or a tailwind to sales.","Yeah, and we're not really seeing any large indicators through the April timeframe. I will say that, when we look at weather variability, historically, we have seen the largest variability occur in the late summer months or in the third quarter of the year.     And, Ryan, you bring up a good point."
"Thank you. So, continuing on the M&A front. So I'm wondering you have made two relatively high proﬁle hires in your business development department. Is this a signal that maybe you might consider corporate M&A in addition to municipal M&A or those are completely unrelated?","So Angie, hello, ﬁrst of all. And thanks for that question."
"Very good, thank you. And – but again, can you – we don't obviously see the backlog of municipal deals that you've been working on, and I've heard the comments from Walter. But is there anything more you could let us know? I mean, you have a number of high proﬁle cases in your service territories or close to them with all kinds of issues, water-related issues, lead poisoning or high levels of lead. We would have thought that those would have led to more imminent announcements regarding at least public-private partnerships with companies like yours, but we haven't heard anything yet.","Right. And it is – one of the reasons that in December we shared kind of the long – and you see in the deck today that we shared the long process it takes in terms of acquiring a municipality is that even if there is interest and they expressed an interest, when you're a municipality there is a lot of eﬀorts, politics that are in play. You have to get a lot of people on board. You have to get a lot of people aligned. It's not quick. It would be much faster if the business was corporate acquisitions which has its own set of issues.  But in the municipality we also understand that these are our liken (33:12) oﬃcials and they want to make sure not just that they are getting a good price for their system but that the people who buy their system and their assets are able to serve their citizens well over the coming years and this is big interest. A lot of the mayors and council folks say, yeah, price is one thing and yes, we need to have more capital, but on the other hand, I have to make sure that this is going to last for the next several years, and that we don't put our city in a situation where we have service issues.  So you're exactly right, Angie, as we do more and more work with emerging contaminant, as we are looking not just to lead but other contaminants that aren't regulated that we have growing concerns about and we're looking at ways to deal with them, we are sharing with municipalities all over the country, our eﬀorts, our value proposition. And some of them are interested, some of them aren't, but it's not a fast process, and I don't think it will ever be a fast process because of the politics involved.  And I know one thing that will help though and Walter can mention, the Water Quality Accountability Act in New Jersey is one thing that it takes eﬀect across the country because basically private water companies like us are held to higher standards or where actually the regulations are enforced more strongly with us than they are with municipalities. And we believe that all people deserve clean water. And so, you may want to talk about what's going in New Jersey, Walter.     Absolutely, Susan. And if I can add to that as well, it does take a long time as we know, but our teams in the states are focused on executing and delivering value for the communities that they serve and will serve in the future.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So the Water Quality Accountability Act right now was approved in the environmental committees in both the House and Senate in New Jersey. The next step is to go in front of the Budget Committee which should happen at the end of this month, and then a ﬂoor vote in June, and then the Governor has got 45 days to sign it. So it is moving forward. We expect it to move forward and get approved. But we think this is going to be good not just for New Jersey, but as other states look to New Jersey as a leader in this area that they'll look at something similar in those states.     Yeah. And if I could add to that, when we look at our long-term growth triangle, we continue to see 1% to 2% growth, EPS, compound annual growth rate from regulated acquisitions and that translates into about 30,000 to 60,000 customer additions per year. And they ebb and ﬂow. They can be lumpy as we go through. But we've added 13,000 customers year-to-date."
I was hoping you could just discuss and give a little more color on the Senate Bill in Virginia and how it adjusts? How you might evaluate opportunities in state?,"Yeah, we're really proud of that. We did play a role in moving that forward in Virginia. So what we have is the single tariﬀ pricing, one in the water and then one the wastewater side and we're going to use that like we do another states. So if we acquire system, we can spread those costs across a bigger customer base. And so, we'll just continue to work with our municipal leaders in Virginia to promote the beneﬁts of that. We've seen in all the other states and I think they   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   recognized that because they passed it, the House and Senate and the Governor passed this for a reason because it's going to beneﬁt customers within Virginia."
"And so, would that make acquisitions in the state incrementally more attractive do you think?","Yeah. We believe so. And that's why, we're big believers in the single tariﬀ pricing because, again, it allows us to buy a system and the most of the time, they need signiﬁcant investment and we're able to spread that investment across a larger customer base. So..."
"Got it. Thank you. And then one more question on California. After two years of a drought, how should we think about a potential rise in demand or usage rates? How do consumer trends adjust after conservation from a drought, do you think?","What we expect the behaviors that continue in California. I think the customers there work very, very hard over the last six years to seven years to bring their usage down to levels that they can sustain. So, that's the way we look at it, the continued behavior around conservations very important in California and our customers recognize that.     And also, in California, we have revenue decoupling, which aligns the conservation goals of the commission of our customers and our company."
"Good morning. Given the recent cost of capital application ﬁled in California, we're just curious, what is the revenue sensitivity for every 25 basis points change in return on equity?","So, we can give that – we can give that to you oﬄine. I don't have it right in front of me, but what I can say is that, our cost of capital ﬁling was not extended. So, we did do a ﬁling on April 3. We requested a 10.8% ROE and that is up from our current authorized level of 9.99%. We also requested an increase in the equity ratio from 53% to about 55%. So, we can run through that calculation and get it to you."
Okay. Thank you. And also when do you expect the rates from the new Pennsylvania rate case to go into eﬀect?,"Typically, it takes 10 to 12 months to work through the process there in Pennsylvania."
"Okay, thank you. And then ﬁnally following up on slide 19 as it relates to a potential infrastructure spending bill, I guess we're wondering if an increase in Federal funds for water infrastructure spending could potentially, I guess, limit state incentives for a fair amount value legislation, so Washington, D.C. might not necessarily impact investments in American Water's current assets but may provide headwinds when it comes to future acquisitions.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's a really good question. So from everything we're seeing, when you look at the amount of money spent by the private industry a year, which is between $2.5 billion and $3 billion and you look at the money that's out there for 84% of the water systems and 98% of the wastewater, they actually are spending less from public fund. So it would take such huge numbers of, I'll call, free money to have a big impact. However, there's always the issue and one of the things that we're doing to watch out for our customers is our customers pay taxes just like the customers of municipalities.  So what we're asking for is a level playing ﬁeld. For example, the state revolving funds that get funding nationally, federally, we can participate in states that allow us to on the water side, but not on the wastewater side. So we're working on policy eﬀorts to ensure that if there are pools of low cost money that we have access to them equal to what the municipals have access to and, again, because all of our customers pay taxes also.  So for us it is, there is also in some conversations what we've been involved with in Washington, the $1 trillion infrastructure is not a $1 trillion in actual funding. It is ﬁnding ways that you've oﬀset the need for that. So our ability to invest in job creations, those type of things could actually be used as a measure to count toward that and that's one thing that we're involved in making sure that we get recognized for that."
"Hey, good morning, Susan. How you're doing?  <<A – [063D6J-E]Susan Story – American Water Works Co., Inc.>: Good.  Great. Two quick questions, when you originally established the 2017 guidance, did it contemplate the $0.03 to $0.04 one-time charge for the New York State manufacturing deduction?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Okay, Jonathan. This is a Linda. It did not and so as we began to look at our guidance and aﬃrming our guidance, there were two really discrete tax items that we were looking at that impacts from New York, but also from the change in the new accounting standards for stock- based compensation and so those largely are oﬀset."
"Okay. So, you hadn't contemplated that stock tax beneﬁt though either?","Yeah, we knew about it. This is something that is really hard to predict because it's based upon a level of stock option exercises, the stock price, et cetera. And, so yeah, we did not include it in the guidance. So, that's why we wanted to make sure that we outlined these items for you for additional transparency, so that you could determine the overall quality of earnings."
"Okay. And then just building on Ryan's earlier question, I guess for Walter, probably about the PA rate case. I know, you indicated that you expect to be relatively straight forward, but I think it   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   is the ﬁrst time, I'll use the forward-looking test here, do you expect any issues with that transition during the process and potentially during settlement negotiation?","No, we don't expect any issues there, Ryan (sic) [Jonathan]. We're just going to work through it like we do with our other investments in Pennsylvania."
"I would appreciate it, if you could provide an update on the headquarters move and what your expectations are for tax savings at this point.","Absolutely, Michael. This is Linda. And we are really excited, because we have broking ground on the construction and so you can now probably see it from the Philadelphia skyline, you can see the steel going up if you will. So, we expect the cost of the building to be up to $165 million. For 2017, we would expect to spend about $75 million this year on the construction, as long as we stay on schedule which is expected. We are looking at completing the construction towards the latter half of 2018 and then taking occupancy there.  Now, in terms of the tax credit, the way that this works is that once we move into the building, we become eligible to receive up to $165 million in tax credit over a 10-year period subject to meeting certain criteria. And our goal here is really to make this revenue neutral for our customers and so that is what we're working towards. And we are going to be utilizing grant accounting for recognition of these tax beneﬁts which allow us to recognize those tax beneﬁts over the life of the asset and that's very consistent with our approach to make this revenue neutral for our customers."
"39 years. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Thanks, Michael.     Absolutely. Thank you.
