Question,Answer
Thank you. So I wanted to ask about California about the recent acquisitions. I mean I was a little bit surprised. I always thought that most of the municipal M&A is going to come from the Northeast. Some of those are not muni M&A. But could you talk a little bit more about this?,"Sure, Angie, and thank you for the question. So this is what we call, as you know, a tuck-in. And in California, there is signiﬁcant interest from the Public Utility Commission to help distressed systems throughout the state. We saw that at the cost of capital hearings and some of the discussions that resulted in the increase in our cost of capital.  Our plan that we guide to is basically assuming that all of our acquisitions are these smaller tuck-ins, and you will have larger systems, of course, as you said, and if you look at our history of acquisitions, more have been in the Northeast and the Midwest. This was an opportunistic acquisition. We're pleased to have these folks onboard. It's a roll into service area where we already are, and again we have in the past several months seen for us anyway constructive outcomes at the California PUC, including the approval of the Monterey desalination facility as part of the water supply project, as well as the last general rate case outcome.     And Angie if I can add to that, in our cost of capital decision, as Susan mentioned, we did have a lot of conversations about investments in California. And it's really important to note that although our ROE decreased to 9.2% in that proceeding, our equity ratio increased from 53% to 55.4%."
"Great, thank you. And just one last question about New Jersey. Is there any progress on the implementation of this New Jersey Quality [ph] Accountability Act, meaning as far as it relates to municipal M&A?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","That's a great question, Angie. So many of that the ﬁrst step in implementation was that water providers in the state of New Jersey were going to have to certify to certain parts of those regulations. That is happening, though, as the regulations are currently still being developed by the DEP in New Jersey to be rolled out further. So we were the ﬁrst to certify. For us, it was more business as usual. So we are just now starting to see some of the certiﬁcations coming in. It's our understanding that there may be one or two I think a university that may be looking at consolidating those type of certiﬁcations and looking where diﬀerent systems stand in the state. So it's in the early stages. The regulations are still being promulgated, and we look forward to a continuing rollout over the next probably six to 12 months."
"Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call. And before I ask my question, I just wanted to say, Linda, I wish you all the best in your retirement. Congratulations and that I really appreciate all the time that you gave me from when I would pester you for -- to do conference calls with investor with me or to go on a road to visit investors. So I appreciated all that time and I wanted to say that to make sure you knew that, and I wish you all the best in your retirement. Congratulations on a well-deserved retirement, too, I'm sure.","Rich, thank you so much, and it was my pleasure to have those discussions with you."
"Thank you. Thank you very much. So just kind of -- I'm pretty clear on everything for the quarter. Just kind of I guess more of a high-level question. Last month we saw the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection announce that it had planned to set standards for the PFOS contamination and they're much more strict than the EPA's guidelines. And it appears other states are going to implement similar standards as well. So I was just kind of hoping maybe you could discuss a little bit about how that could impact the company on the regulated side in terms of the acquisition front. And then on in terms of what it could mean to cost to the company since it'll -- it's going to need to deal with the stricter standards as well? And then on   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   top of that, how it could also impact the company in terms of the military business, because a driver of this contamination is caused by the ﬁre extinguisher ﬁrm -- foam used on these military bases every day when they're running their drills. And so I would think that that would be something with this -- with this PFOS contamination could be an impetus to see more of those military bases pursue O&M contracts with the likes of American Water. So just wondering if you could give us some high-level color on how this PFOS contamination could impact the company.","Rich, thank you for this. This is probably one of the largest emerging issues that will need to be addressed across the country, both from states that are doing their own limits on PFOS as well as EPA actually yesterday came out -- what most people don't understand, while the EPA has a recommended maximum contaminant level, there really isn't a regulation. It is not actually a regulated chemical. What it is, is they're recommending not to have over certain limits, but they don't have the force of regulation behind it. The EPA came out yesterday, I read, and basically said they are going to do it. They're looking at the level that they were using for maximum contaminant levels that weren't regulated of 70 parts per trillion. New Jersey, as you mentioned, has come in with a much lower, I believe 13 parts per trillion.  To your point about the company, I mentioned it's interesting you ask this question because I mentioned in my ﬁnal remarks about the role of our R&D group. We've been doing research on these perﬂuorinated chemicals for decades. And in fact -- and I'll talk about Military ﬁrst, then I'll come back to the Regulated business. We have actually already been working on a couple or three of our military bases to actually treat PFOS. We have mobile units where we can actually do on-site decontamination and, for example, at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, we've done tremendous work already with a couple of wells there that we serve.  We believe from a military installation standpoint, it's actually a competitive advantage for us. We have treated to levels that are at or below what the New Jersey requirements are. We know how to do that. So this is a serious situation. And if you want to get a nice four or ﬁve page primer for those out there who want to know the National Institutes of Environmental Health Services has a wonderful three or four page primer because some people use PFOS, PFOA, they're all part of a group of PFCs called perﬂuorinated chemicals, and they're all manmade materials, and the issue comes in is that they are, as you said, ﬁreﬁghting foam, Teﬂon, it comes from even Stainmaster, things that repel grease and water, and it's been used for decades. And so what has happened is as it gets into the water source or the environment that it just stays and it's consumed by humans. It just doesn't get released from the body for years and years, and that's where the concern is coming.  So this is a very serious issue. We applaud all of the diﬀerent states as well as the EPA for making this a priority. We actually see this as a very good thing. We are very supportive of all of the actions being taken on the PFCs in our diﬀerent states, and we really want to be part of being a solutions provider for those and see it as a strength given all the research and actual deployment we've done on how to decontaminate these out of water supplies."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's excellent color. Thank you very much, Susan. I appreciate the time, guys. And again, Linda, I'm going to miss you. Congratulations. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, y'all. Wanted to echo everyone else's remarks. Linda, congrats on the retirement decision. I know you're going to continue to have fun through the rest of your life as you have been while at American Water Works. And I think I understand how that's an easy personal decision for you to make. Then last one I thought when Susan was saying for the ﬁrst time in American Water Works history and had just been talking about Corvettes, I thought she was going to say there was a new Corvette waiting for you in the parking lot. Maybe they don't like you that much, I don't know.","I was hoping that too, Jonathan. But it could still happen."
"(inaudible), yeah. So anyway, Susan, just wanted to ask you, in light of the recent rate case outcome, how do you think about West Virginia in terms of being a core state for you, I know in some previous rate cases there, they were challenging outcomes plus kind of the way the Freedom event was treated seemed less than kind of equitable to you guys. So just wondering how do you view West Virginia today.","So West Virginia, ﬁrst of all, for those who've never been there, it's a beautiful state and we have been in West Virginia since the 1880s. And the last two rate case outcomes we've had, including a settlement. I mean this was a settlement reached with all parties, were very constructive, because in West Virginia there's a realization, maybe as much as any other state, about the importance of clean water and safe water, and it's not just an issue for American Water. The public providers of water there and wastewater services see the same thing. So we have some wonderful employees in West Virginia. We have some outstanding customers in West Virginia, and we're very excited that there is a growing realization from all of the parties, the stakeholders as well as the Regulatory Commission, about the importance of investment for the future to ensure that that state can continue to grow economically and have a safe water, wastewater, and ﬁre protection system for its citizens.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And Jonathan, I'll add to that as well. As you know, West Virginia now has a DSIC mechanism as well for continuing investment in the state. And as part of our settlement of the -- of the rate case, they authorized a 9.75% ROE, which is the same that we had in the last case, but they also increased the equity ratio from 45.84% to 48.4%, so really showing the need for attracting capital to the state."
"All right, yeah, good stuﬀ. Glad, things are improving there for sure. Linda, did you quantify what the weather impact the headwind was in Q1 '19 then. I mean I know it's usually not overly sensitive, but ...","Yeah, we did not have any, really at all, weather impact in the ﬁrst quarter."
Okay. I thought I heard you say that that was a bit of a headwind. Sorry about that. And then I also kind of missed what you said was driving the expected 1% improvement from your prior forecast in the 2023 debt to total cap ratio going to 61% to 62%. What were the drivers there?,"So it was really kind of reﬁning our estimates. Our actual came in much better than we thought for 2018, and we also have had a very, very strong focus on cash ﬂow management."
"Okay, okay. All right. Well, thank you very much and enjoy the future; I know you will.","Thanks, Jonathan. And that's the last question, and we thank you all for participating in our call today.
