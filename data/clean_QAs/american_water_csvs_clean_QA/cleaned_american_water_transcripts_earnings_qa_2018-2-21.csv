Question,Answer
"So, just two questions. First, there's obviously been a lot of analysis on tax reform. And so, much of the focus is centered on cash ﬂow metrics, like FFO to debt. In light of you guys not needing any equity and looking at debt to sort of oﬀset the near-term cash drag from tax reform, can we talk a little bit about what other metrics the agencies could be looking at, especially, as we think about the water industry? I mean, I have to imagine that looking at cash ﬂow metrics in isolation sort of misses the bigger picture especially in this industry.","Yeah. Shahr, this is Linda. And you're right, there has been a real heavy focus on FFO to debt metrics for utilities due to the lower cash ﬂow from the loss of bonus depreciation, the passing back of the tax beneﬁts to customers, and especially for those that are in a federal net operating loss position like us.  And you're right, FFO to debt is an important element of our rating. It represents 12.5% of our rating under Moody's methodology. But it is also important to note that the largest component of our rating is based on our business risk proﬁle, which generally represents about half of our rating. And the business risk proﬁle is based on a more qualitative risk speciﬁc to the water industry and to the unique size and scale of American water.  So, for example, the types of things that are looked at there are items such as the absolute essential service of providing water; the smooth deployment of our small capital projects, like Susan talked about earlier; and the regulatory environment across our diverse 14 jurisdictions that really support our ability to grow, to invest, and to generate cash ﬂow going forward. So, this strong business risk proﬁle is not changing with tax reform.  The other thing that's really important to note is that the business risk proﬁle of the water industry and American Water is unique to us. So, our FFO to debt metrics generally will fall in a broader range than what you see with other utilities. So, a strict comparison of the numbers of FFO to debt with other utilities is really not a good comparison.  So, Shahr, all of that said, as I mentioned in my comments, with tax reform, we do expect our FFO to debt metrics to drift lower. And we very carefully evaluated the right mix of capital   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   investment needed for our customers, dividends for our shareholders, and that we believe we'll be able to carry the tax reform impacts without issuing additional equity. So, the trade-oﬀ is a lower FFO to debt ratio. And our starting point, as I mentioned, is a very strong balance sheet that provided us with that optionality as we work through the appropriate mix."
"Got it. That's super helpful. And then just want to touch a little bit on your growth rate. You have no dilution, obviously, from incremental equity. You have very minimal regulatory or structural lag, and what seems to be fairly perpetual growth opportunities and a very healthy step-up in rate base. So, how are you sort of thinking about where growth should fall kind of within this range, especially, as the beneﬁt of tax reform sort of lands within your outlook, so mainly focused on your 5% to 7% regulated growth outlook?","So, in our growth triangle, we continue to see the bottom part of the triangle as 5% to 7% for rate-based growth. We also see 1% to 2% for regulated acquisitions. And both of those together really kind of translate to what we showed on our rate-based growth chart.     And, Shahr, this is Susan. We tend not to be a company that gets too far ahead ourselves and speculate what we want to see as let's give time for everything to settle in before we start looking at changing anything. We want to feel conﬁdent and comfortable that our plan, which we have presented at the 7% to 10%, is still the best guess we have in terms of the best estimates and projections we have for the next ﬁve years.  So, what you won't see is us going back and forth based on any type of trends or initial analysis, but the points you brought up are good. We will continue to evaluate all market trends. We'll continue to evaluate our balance sheet and our growth opportunities to determine the best projections for our ﬁve-year plan."
"Hey. So, wanted to follow a little bit up on Shahr's questions. Two-fold on the tax reform question. First, on the regulatory front, what are you embedding in the context of your slide, you showed some CFO impacts? And can you touch on some of the regulatory eﬀorts in the key states, say, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Missouri, for instance, just on what the game plan is there, vis-à-vis returning the funds to customers, or otherwise seeking accelerated investment to depreciation?","Yeah. And we are working – as you know, we have 14 regulatory jurisdictions. We're working through with those regulators in terms of how to best pass the beneﬁts back to customers and continue to invest in a much needed infrastructure. And so, as you know, we have currently three open rate case proceedings in New Jersey, California, and Missouri. So, we're having discussions in those proceedings. We're also working across our jurisdictions, where everyone has really opened some type of a tax proceeding. And so, we're working to determine what is the best approach. And I went through some of those strategies on the call.  I don't know, Walter, if you want to add a little bit more to the speciﬁc states?     Yeah, again, as Linda said, we're in rate proceedings obviously in New Jersey, and California, and Missouri, and we're incorporating these discussions in those rate case proceedings. It's a great discussion. We're open with the committee. We're very happy that the commissions are open to discussing these issues as part of the rate ﬁlings. And then, as Linda said, in the other proceedings, we're working through with the commissions to say, we want to mitigate the impact on customers, give back what we can. But then as we invest, we want to make sure that it's smoothing out. So, with that, I think we're having good discussions across our footprint.     And with those discussions, Julien, we put forward on slide 13 the cash ﬂow impacts that are expected using reasonable judgments. And so, we looked at what do we think are the reasonable judgments from a regulatory perspective; what are some of the cash ﬂow strategies that we can deploy across the company? And we wanted to be very transparent to put it there by year.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And, Julien, interestingly, each of our states are in a little bit diﬀerent situation. I mean, for example, I mentioned, we actually had about 1,400 main breaks in the frigid temperatures in late-December and January. So, that goes into our investment planning. Where we've had ﬂooding, where you have natural disasters, we're putting a lot of focus on our critical assets and resiliency plans.  When you look at Indiana, for example, in Gary, Indiana, there are a lot of lower-income customer-owned lead service lines. So, each state has some similarities, but each state also has its own issue in terms of investment needs as well as the ability to be able to continue to have these aﬀordable rates, while we increase our investment. So, each state President, as Walter said, we're very much a local company, and each state President and each state staﬀ is working very closely to determine what that speciﬁc state's needs are and ﬁnding a way forward that works for everybody."
"Got it. Excellent. And then, just coming back to the FFO to debt question, I know that there's been a lot of focus on it. Can you just give us a little bit more of a quantiﬁcation of where you stand relative to where the agencies want to see you, just, again, just broad brush where you kind of end up through the plan?","Yeah, Julien. So, our cash ﬂow from operations remains robust. Moody's just issued their report and published an FFO the debt metric of 17%, covering 12 months ended in September. And we believe the FFO to debt metric continues to remain strong throughout the remainder of 2017."
"Hey, you all. Thanks for taking my question. Can we just comes back on California, the cost capital proposal, and then maybe draw on what we saw with other types of utilities and their   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   cost of capital in California? What do you think that means going forward to water utilities in California? And then, do you think that there's a spillover, or this is a precedent in other jurisdictions? And then, I'll have a follow-up question, please.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, the decision was an administrative law judge proposed decision, so not a ﬁnal decision, as Walter mentioned, we have 30 days before the Commission considers it, and we they can support, reject, or modify it. We will be ﬁling comments next week. We are concerned that the ROE does not reﬂect the current market conditions like interest rates, company's risk proﬁle, et cetera. And we will include those items in our comments back to the Commission. And I think reasonable jurisdictions across the country were not seeing anywhere near those proposals. And I think there is an understanding of the need to have – attract capital to invest in the much-needed water and wastewater infrastructure across the nation."
"And I guess on that point is my second question. You guys mentioned infrastructure plan, and it comes up in conversations, but could you just talk about maybe one or two things – and I know it's early and you all change a lot, but one or two things that actually have (00:44:32) for the water utility industry.","Yeah. So this is Susan, Ben. So, we were actually a little bit surprised at just how much focus there actually was on water and wastewater, and a few things. So, PricewaterhouseCoopers actually came out with a report about six months ago that said that $60 billion to $80 billion of additional private investment could be leased if a few things happened.  Interestingly, there were ﬁve things they listed. Two of those ﬁve I mentioned in my comments, which is one thing people may not understand is state revolving funds that tend to have the least expensive ﬁnancing cost. We're able to take advantage of those in several of our states, but only for drinking water. The Clean Water Drinking Act state revolving fund which is wastewater, it would not allow private. This particular proposal now would allow us to be able to access the state revolving funds, which have a lower ﬁnancing cost. That's one. The WIFIA which is the Water Infrastructure and Finance Act (sic) [Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act], it basically also allows for privates to be able to pay in ﬁnancing debts tied to the Treasury yield without an upcharge, so that would expand the ability to do that.  A couple of things, too, that we're seeing that will be part of this is half of the $200 billion that the administration says is going to leverage the $1.5 trillion, over half of that is for projects, and only 20% of the project costs can come from federal. So, local areas, private companies or municipalities will have to ﬁnd funding for the other 80% of that. We think that's very positive. As well as the fact that the issue of workforce development and looking at things like permitting reform to allow projects to go forward more quickly, we think those are all positive things that will beneﬁt, not just the entire industry, but speciﬁcally, American Water."
"I wanted to – it's understandable, because the tax reform is such an important issue, but it deﬁnitely does seem there's less focus this quarter on the acquisition, M&A -municipal M&A pipeline. So, I just wanted to get more of an update there on the pipeline, especially in key states like Pennsylvania, where you've had so much success the last couple of years, and now with the Act 12 in. And just want to kind of get a little more detailed update on the deal environment and the cadence of the inquiry activity and that sort of thing.","Yeah, Ryan. This is Walter. I'll take that question. The opportunities are robust throughout our pipeline. We've spent a lot of time working on legislation to enable the acquisitions. Our teams are focused on it. The municipal sector, many of them were having a lot of issues that monetizing the assets would really solve their situation, so we're in discussions.  We have, as I said before, about 330,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline across our footprint, and that's up from 145,000 this time last year. So, we have a robust pipeline, we're working through in each of our states. And I can't comment at any one deal that's not public yet, but we are working very hard to meet the 1% to 2% growth of 30,000 to 60,000 customers. And I feel conﬁdent we're going to get there."
"Okay. And in terms of – I know you can't comment on speciﬁc deals. But in terms of the general themes that are coming up on those discussions, I mean, are there certain recurring themes that are preventing things from moving ahead in a number of cases, or is it just kind of a real case- by-case aspect? I mean, any comment threads you can let us in on in terms of how those discussions move ahead or don't move ahead?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. No overall themes, it's really in a case-by-case basis. And again, we feel very good about our pipeline, about the size of the deals. Our focus again has been 3,000 to 30,000 customers, and we feel like we're going to execute on that very favorably over the next ﬁve years.     And, Ryan, this is an area where our geographical diversity also helps. I mean, you mentioned about Pennsylvania, but the fact is we've got numerous states where we have opportunities and that's part of this signiﬁcant pipeline we have, which is we're in 16 states, we have 14 regulatory jurisdictions, much easier to grow from a grassroots where we're in the communities, we live there. So, what we're seeing is more states that we see more activity in. So, we think that's a very big positive."
"Thank you. I'm sorry to go back to the tax question. So, when you show us the projections of the likely degradation of the operating cash ﬂow, I mean, how does it compare to what the credit agencies saw back in January when they put you on the negative credit watch? Because at least,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   versus our expectations, it seems like the reduction and the FFO was a bit lower. I mean, basically, the hit is lower than we had expected.","Yeah. And when Moody's put us on the negative outlook – as you know, they put us on with 23 other companies. And so, didn't really do a deep dive into our ﬁnancials. It was really more about us being in a net operating loss position. And so, we are having meetings with our rating agencies. We're continuing to work through this, but they were not kind of reviewing all of these details as part of that particular analysis.  So, we'll continue to work with them. And what we wanted to do here is really be transparent that from our prior plan to this plan with tax reform, this is our estimate of the potential tax impact on cash ﬂow over that ﬁve-year period, with the key being that you can see it's kind of higher in the earlier years, and then as rate base continues to grow, it lessens."
"Okay. And given that the earnings mix plays such a role in your credit ratings, I mean, are you having, for instance, any second thoughts about the growth in the Market-Based operations in light of this – with this tax reform, just mostly, just to attempt to manage some of the duration and the FFO to debt through maybe some change in the earnings mix?","Yeah. So, when we look at the earnings mix going forward, remember that under tax reform, the Regulated Business is growing and the Market-Based Business is growing. That's being oﬀset somewhat by the additional drag at the parent company. But the earnings mix is still roughly 90/10.     Yeah, and Angie, we have no plans, at this point, to change strategically our outlook for Regulated versus Market-Based."
"Okay. And my last question. So, the infrastructure plan, as you, Susan, pointed out yourself, it actually did cover quite a bit of water-related investments. And so, are the municipalities, basically, even more hopeful that they will get some help from the federal government, and as such, that could further delay any municipal M&A?","Well, one thing that was missing from the infrastructure proposal, there are not large pots of federal money, free federal money. Basically, it's $200 billion to leverage $1.5 trillion, and except for about $50 billion that's set aside for rural infrastructure block grants which also was   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   expanded to include broadband, really the amount of money – half of that $200 billion, $100 billion, is basically 20% of a project, and the municipality has to ﬁnd a way to ﬁnance 80%.  Then you've got some of the block grants that have to include broadband, transportation, and water for $50 billion. Then you've got expanding the federal loan programs that we all have access to. But then again, a municipality has to ensure it has bonding capacity that it's able to do. And then beyond that, you've got about 10% – 7% to 10% that was dedicated for what the administration refers to as transformative projects, like Elon Musk's Hyperloop on transportation. So, what you don't see here are huge amounts of free federal funding that people can access."
"I have a quick question regarding Keystone. On the last call, it sounded like American was guiding to rather ﬂat earnings growth there in 2018. However, on the last call, I had mentioned that if you sift through the ﬁlings since American acquired Keystone, the customer base has more than doubled; rig count is up, let's call it, 10 rigs in the past 10 months; and all of the energy companies that I used to follow were sifting through their transcripts, listening to their calls, are citing that the Marcellus, it's heating up.  I mean just yesterday Hi-Crush said that they're expecting a meaningful increase in shipments to the Marcellus, which means you're going to see much more frac sand there, which means you're going to see much higher water needs. You're going to need to clean it, deliver it, et cetera. So, I'm wondering if you could give us an update on Keystone for 2018, because in my eyes, right now, it looks like that's going to be much stronger than what American guided to just a few months ago.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Well, Rich, one of the things we did cover is that year-over-year Keystone was $0.01 up from 2016, so we were very encouraged to see that. And it didn't show up in the fourth quarter, because the market started picking up in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, you're correct, we currently have about 300 employees. We're looking to hire another 100. The margins are a little less than they were before the market went down, but we're still continuing to grow our percent of the market. There's a lot of big projects underway this year, and we feel very good about the business this year. We think it is going to be a strong business this year."
"Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just one other question and it pertain to the Military Group and the idea that the contracts will true-up on tax reform. I understand under the price re- determination, I can understand how this might be the case. But with economic price adjustments, I mean, the concept there is contractual. And very simply put, the idea is if the water utility spent too much, then they would have to eat it.  But at the same time, when the water utility get the beneﬁt and eat a beneﬁt of tax reform, I guess, everything I'm hearing is pointing to American's going to keep that. And you guys are – seem to be the only ones – and I don't know if it's a conservative approach, but I'm kind of having a hard time understanding how you guys see that passing through.","Sure. So Rich, when you understand price redetermination, so on the positive side, and this helps make it regulated-like, there are three instances that the Department of Defense says that they will true-up your original bid. And you're right, if you make a bad O&M bid, and it doesn't fall into these categories, you live with the results. And one of those is do you have a law change.  For example, if there is a change that requires more environmental monitoring, then we actually can get more money for that. We also look at inﬂation and the O&M contracts get adjusted for inﬂation. And the third component is if we put another capital project. For example, if we build another wastewater facility and operation costs go up or down, it gets trued up. So, understanding that's the deﬁnition of price redetermination.  So what you have now is that the DLA and the DoD has not come in and said, where they see the tax reform falling into. So, yes, we are very conservative. One way you can review and you can interpret what that price re-determination deﬁnition is, is that tax reform was the law, and thus, we would basically give back that money over a period of time, just like we would gain if there was a law passed that increased our cost.  So, that's been our position. I know that not everyone shares that. We're not sure what – they have not basically given – they, the DoD, has not given guidance. But the way we're modeling it is in the most conservative nature. So, if they come back and say, gee, we are going to let you keep a portion of this, then it would just be upside for us. But we feel more comfortable   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   modeling the way we have it based on our interpretation of the caveats under price redetermination."
"Understood. Got it. Okay. Hey, I appreciate the time. Thank you very much, guys. And congrats, again, on the great all around quarter.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Big picture question, just curious how you're thinking about larger scale M&A in a world where tax reform maybe impacts you less than some of your peers, in a world where you're trading at a mid-20s PE multiple, and at a time when you've got one of the best balance sheets in the business?","Well, thank you, Michael. Wow, I wish we had used some of your words on our call. But in terms of how we look at it, when we look at our growth triangle, we don't assume any large acquisitions, we just don't. That 1% to 2% of acquisitions are these – the tuck-ins or the ones in our state, they're very ground up, grassroots up, happen in the local communities.  However, we also do have a corporate strategy group, and we are always looking at the landscape. We are always looking at other water companies. We are always looking at large municipalities. We have mentioned to our investors before, as we look at whether we grow in our existing states or a new state. If we look at going into new state, we look at three factors. We look at the business climate, the regulatory climate, and do we see a way to get to 50,000 customers in ﬁve years, because otherwise, our eﬃciency model doesn't work, and we can't ensure that we have aﬀordable value-added rates for our customers, and that we can leverage our size, scope and scale.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So, the answer is, we're always looking. However, we are also very disciplined in how we look. And we don't believe that you get too in love with any type of deal or that you chase a deal that could be to the detriment of the overall long-term performance of the company. So, we'll continue to look, monitor, and where we see opportunities, we'll pursue them."
And do you see the opportunity set as being changed at all via tax reform?,"That's a really interesting question. I think that the water space is so limited, and that you look at that – and I'm not sure, I don't think any of us understand now how all of this is going to shake out in the next one, two, three years. In terms of municipalities, I don't think it makes a diﬀerence. I think the bigger diﬀerence are things like the age of water systems, wastewater systems, the amount of investment needed, growing pension, unfunded pension liabilities, the amount of roads that need paving, the amount of schools. So, for us, really, I think it's more in a municipal market. It is left to be seen what happens with the entire water/wastewater infrastructure in this country and how we approach that because it is getting at a critical stage. And in the next few years, decisions are going to have to be made, because these systems can't hold up forever if they're not being invested in.  And even more importantly, one thing we really like about the administration's plan, in the past, sometimes you had pools of money, and it only went to a capital project, but there was no requirement for nourishment of those systems ongoing. The interesting thing about this administration is the 50% of the $200 billion that funds the 20%, not only are they looking at investing 20% of those funds into projects that have funding for the upfront capital investment, but they are also requiring a revenue stream that is predictable that will help with operations maintenance and upkeep. We've not seen that before. So, the recognition of lifecycle cost for this infrastructure investment is something that I think is a real positive that you have to step back and look at what are you going to do for the next 50 years.  As Linda mentioned, in the water industry, our assets, we're looking at 50 years. We're not looking at 20, 30 years. They're 50, sometimes 70-year assets. So, we think that, that, based on what happened to this proposal and the overall philosophy about overall infrastructure investment could have more opportunities than any type of impact from tax reform on individual private companies."
"Hey, Susan. In the interest of time, I'm okay. So, thanks. I appreciate you taking it, though.","It's great talking to you, though.  So, we thank all of you for participating on our call today.
