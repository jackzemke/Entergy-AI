Question,Answer
The question is on the returns for each of the market-based businesses. If you could just give me an idea relative to your regulated businesses the returns and the volatility of the returns for each of these?,"Deb, we have been talking about the headwinds in the Military Services Group all year. What is your outlook for the Military Services Group? Do you expect these headwinds to continue into 2017 and beyond? How do you think about growth in the Military Services Group? And also with the change in presidential administration, can you tell us about how you think about that for the military services?     Sure, Linda. Looking at MSG, we talked about earlier how we have, really, two diﬀerent ways that we earn money. For us, the core O&M of operating and maintaining the bases; that's pretty stable. We operate at 50-year contract. We get regular price redeterminations, or economic increases and so that is very stable. No risk -- I mean, I shouldn't say no risk. Low risk and again, I don't see any softness in that space because we've got 50-year contracts.  Where we did some headwinds in 2017 -- 2016 and continuing into 2017 is on the infrastructure projects. It's not around demand for capital investments. When you look across our bases, in 2016, we identiﬁed needs of over $500 million of projects at 12 existing basis. This -- like walter talked about balancing the impact on customers, we identiﬁed a lot of projects. The challenge is the government hasn't been spending as much money.  When you think the Department of Defense. And looking at how they spend their money, we are not only competing with other infrastructure projects at all of the domestic bases, we're also competing with any other investments in planes, tanks, you name it. So that's really what has been causing the headwinds for us in the Military Services Group.  We do see that continuing in 2017; however, to answer your second question with the change of administration, Susan talked about it earlier. We are optimistic. We don't have it baked into our   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   forecast any recovery in 2017; however, there is a possibility that there is some loosening in terms of Department of Defense spend and we're poised to take advantage of that.  When will that translate into net income for us? It depends on when actually the loosening is and where the government -- where the DoD decides to spend that investment. But we're ready with those shovel-ready product -- projects so that if and when the loosening occurs, we will be ready to do the investments and do the capital work.     Thank you, Deb. And Dan, for Keystone? We also faced headwinds in 2016. You talked a bit about the market picking up in 2017. What gives you the conﬁdence that 2017 is going to look diﬀerent? And how do you think that the potential impact for the change of administration could impact your business?     Sure, sure. I'm glad you're asking me that question now instead of six months ago  Like I had stated, the rig count has increased in the Appalachian Basin to about 50 rigs; natural gas price is around $3.50. The completion activity that our Company has seen in the Fourth Quarter and the projections going to 2017 are improved from this year. That gives us great conﬁdence in market recovery.  Energy Information Administration has recently forecasted that natural gas, average natural gas market production in 2016 would be around 77.5 billion cubic feet per day. That's 1.3 billion cubic feet Bcf down from 2015; however, they are projecting an increase of about 2.5 Bcf going into 2017. So that's very positive.  Along with that, domestic consumption is increasing. Exports to Mexico as well as LNG exports are increasing and that is helping drive and contribute to the Henry Hub price average in 2016 which was about $2.47 -- $2.49 to about $3.27 in 2017. So that's very positive.  Along with that, OPEC has recently announced they're going to decrease production which should be positive for pricing in the United States as well as domestic drilling and completion activities. Along those lines, in the Appalachian Basin speciﬁcally, we have seen a number of drilled but uncompleted wells that have been sitting in inventory. That number has been drastically reduced in 2016. So that's a positive sign for increased drilling moving forward.  Along with that, what gives us a lot of conﬁdence is our diversiﬁcation initiative into the municipal services market supporting, like I said, American Water and other municipalities in the Northeast United States. We believe that leverages our core competencies and we are well- situated to diversify our business in that fashion. So those things give us great conﬁdence that the market is recovering and allowing us to forecast Keystone to be accretive to earnings in 2017. As far as the election, it's a little too early to tell but we're very positive about the election here in Keystone.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It should be a positive for the energy sector as well as Keystone. They have called for more increased drilling and completion activity, less restriction on pipelines and other regulations that should promote and facilitate a friendlier environment for the exploration and production companies in the United States. We believe it will very positive for the energy sector and for Keystone as a whole.     Thank you, Dan. Deb, switching to Homeowner Services. Homeowner Services has had a signiﬁcant amount of growth since its inception. Do you see that growth continuing and what are the key risks in that business and what are you worried about in that business?     Sure. So I see huge growth in HOS potential. When you look, there's -- if you -- based on the census, there is 67 billion households across -- million households across the US, single-family homes. We only -- we estimate that only 5% of those homes have water line and sewer line protection plans. So that says the market is really untapped in terms of buying warranties, programs for water lines and sewer lines. So really, we see a lot of runway in terms of market, which is great.  We also see a lot of opportunity for partnerships. We closed on or started new deals with partnerships that represent 260,000 connections in 2016 and we see a lot of pipeline for new partnerships with municipalities and with other utilities into 2017 and beyond. So those two things really give me a lot of conﬁdence in terms of our future growth in Homeowner Services.  Switching gears to the risk. The biggest risk in terms of ﬁnancials for Homeowner Services is claims expense. For claims, it is absolutely the largest expense line item for Homeowner Services and how we manage claims really boils down to its frequency, meaning how many claims you have. And severity, meaning how expensive that claim is.  Frequency, we look at our terms and conditions so we don't cover things like natural disasters. We also look at pre-existing conditions not covering that and then in terms of severity, we have like in New York, we have actually two master plumbers that go around and spot-check claims to make sure that our plumber network is being fair. So that they are not saying a claim requires this amount of replacement at this dollar.  We're watching them if that makes sense. We also have a very robust pipeline of contractors across the US that provide our services to us that allows us to get good pricing with our contractor network and they do a great job for us across the US.     Thank you, Deb. So Dan, you've been part of the American Water family for almost a year-and-a- half now. Can you talk a little bit about how that has impacted your business, both good and bad?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Sure. No bad  It's been very positive for Keystone Clearwater in 2016. It's helped us. The name recognition alone has helped us open new doors with exploration and production companies that we had not worked for; that's been very positive. They have been essential in helping us increase our market share to about 35% for our core service in 2016.  They've been inﬂuential in helping us, having the opportunity to bid work in our Municipal Services Group diversiﬁcation initiative, where we have competitively bid and won work for Deb's Military Services Group, among others, which we're very proud of and we believe that we have a solid platform for growth there. We've adopted many of the processes that American Water has that makes them a great company into Keystone Clearwater and it has truly made us a stronger company in 2016. So yes, the ownership of American Water has been very positive to Keystone Clearwater this year.     Thank you, Dan. Let me open it up to questions from all of you. There's microphones in the back if you could stand.     Absolutely. That's a great question. We get that question, really, all of the time. The way that these are extremely competitive businesses. The way that we look at the returns on these businesses are, really, risk-adjusted returns. When you look at, for example, our Military Services Group, these -- the risk proﬁle of the military services contracts, 50-year contracts backed by the US government, capital-light contracts.  These are really regulated like in their risk proﬁle and we would expect that the returns would be commensurate with that type of risk. And we do the same type of analysis for our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone.     So we don't disclose the actual numbers but that's how we think about it. Good try."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   A question for Dan. I wondered if you could speak more slowly and tell me what municipal services and asset ownership, what those are? I think I heard you say that you're actually buying water pipelines from E&P companies. Then what you do with it? Because it's not regulated.  What do you do with it after you purchase it? Is there -- how do you contract that? How -- what do the cash ﬂows look like from that asset purchase and how much do you spend on that kind of thing? Then Municipal Services, I don't understand what that is.","Sure. I'll start with Municipal Services. So we are, like I said, leveraging our core competencies of water transfer pumping piping to support municipal markets. Building pipelines, water pipelines, temporary pump bypass, emergency response services, water storage solutions. And we've done even some water treatment solutions for American Water. As far as the --"
So how do you -- do you sign contracts with municipalities? I'm just wondering what the revenue stream and return proﬁle looks like?,There are contracts we bidded just like any other service contractor that they currently hire to do the work. Then we do it at a projected return.
"So when they stop producing in that region or at that particular well, then are you left with a stranded asset?",Well we realize the full return in the time of the contract of ﬁve years. That's how we structure them.
"A question for Dan. It involves the policies and practices on water procurement and treatment of produced and ﬂowback water afterward. I'm aware of the coalition forces sustainable shale development. I believe your company has been involved in American Water from inception. It has very strict standards for operating wells, including, I believe, a total recycling of the water.  This all looks good on paper but what is actually happening? Is there penetration of those standards that the coalition has set up or other standards higher than federal and the three states involved? And is that playing into a larger opportunity for you?","Keystone currently is not involved with any of the treatment or disposal of the ﬂowback or the production water. So the process that we witness every day in the course of our normal business is the primary method right now for dealing with production and ﬂowback water is recycling. They are taking water from one well -- or one producing well and recycling and reusing it down the next hole. That is the number one approach.  Companies have begun to share their ﬂuids between one another where one time they would take it to a disposal facility, maybe even a deep well injection disposal well and today, they are   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   actually storing it and sharing to others when they don't have an active completion program. So that activity is what is predominant in the Appalachian Basin. I can't speak to other plays throughout the United States. But that's what we are seeing every day. Keystone does not take ownership of the water. We transport it, we pipe it, we pump it and we work it back to the energy company. Does that answer your question?     Excellent. Thank you for -- we can take one more."
(multiple speakers) My question is just on the military bases. So the current ministration has been in for a long time. But it seems like this slowdown just occurred in the last year or so. So could you just clarify what changed more recently than before and what we should be speciﬁcally watching from the new administration that would indicate that we're back on track?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's a good question. So for us, in Military Services, we actually had a lot of factors. The capital infrastructure projects that we do the government, some of them actually are in the initial RFP so when we take over operating a base, sometimes we'll have a suite of capital projects that we're looking to do and that's typically in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of operating a base. So we had some larger capital investments that we were making in some of our bases that we started operating ﬁve years ago and they stopped.  Or at least they tapered oﬀ of what was in the initial RFP when we got the base period. Then we also had a very large project down at Fort Polk. We installed two water -- wastewater treatment plants. That was a signiﬁcant amount of investment and that project has been completed in 2016. So really, we have all three things which is we have some -- we had some of the initial capital that was in the bid when we won the base that we've completed.  We had the one large project that's completed and we have the sequestration which is limiting the Department of Defense spent. So for me, looking forward, you should look at, when we get a new base, did it have a large capital program that was included in the RFP?  Then also if there is a loosening of Department of Defense budgets, then you can -- we should expect to see some loosening in some capital dollars ﬂowing our way. No guarantee it depends on the mission, which base the Department of Defense is going to invest in and what are the -- all the other needs across that base in terms of where they are going to invest. But if you see loosening of Department of Defense spending and sequestration, then we should -- that should translate into more opportunities for us."
"A couple of questions. First, just Scranton, I think I heard somebody say that it is expected to close by the end of the year. Is that still expectation? Just a facts check there.","Scranton is a very complex acquisition. It's one of our larger ones. A lot of series of issues.  You remember, it is -- it serves this -- Scranton Sewer Authority actually serves more than one city. There is those issues, it was under consent decree, there's a lot of issues. We're ﬁnalizing the last couple of issues. So hopefully could be by the end of the year, or early next year."
"Okay. Thanks. Bigger picture question. Susan, there's been a lot of talk lately about hybrid utility models. So talking about electrics buying water and water buying gas. And that sort of thing. You all seem like you would be in a really good position to do that, something like that, given   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   your scale and given your background. And so forth. Can you give us your view on the big picture on that model, whether or not it makes sense for American Water and why? And I'd also be interested to get Mark's opinion on this, especially if he's done any speciﬁc work on that topic with his team. Thanks.","I will start and then let Mark ﬁnish. Your point about background, for those that don't know, I spent 31 years in the electricity industry at Southern. Our CFO, Linda, spent 22 years at Southern California Edison, including ﬁve years as CFO. Our Senior VP of External Aﬀairs who is not here, actually grew up in the electricity industry.  And for us. And I don't speak for others. And others do what is best for their companies, for American Water our core competency is water, wastewater. And the one water cycle. People you heard like Kevin Kirwan, people like Walter, like Mark Strauss. So for us, we believe there's enough growth opportunity in water and wastewater. And we believe the things that we are good at are that. The growing core competency of customer care and our understanding of legislative regulatory priorities in the construct. So we, just like in our market-based businesses, we want to stay true to what we know our competencies are. And that is water. Mark, do you want to add to that?     I strongly disagree with Susan. No. For those of us who lived through the RWE days, as you might recall, RWE had the dream of being a multi-utility, remember their hand with the many ﬁngers. They were going to be in electricity and gas and water and wastewater. And how did that turn out? I'm expressing a personal opinion. As Susan said, other ﬁrms are left to their strategies.  We have so much to do in the water sector in the United States. I think our view, what we look at is, where are the other opportunities in the water sector. Geographic, the consolidation play that's needed, this country has huge needs in water. I mean water and wastewater, water sources, desal, reuse.  And this country is slowly awakening. Look, let's face it, friends. We have been a very blessed country on water supply. And we have taken it for granted. This country achieved things in last 100 years that, due to a lot of sacriﬁce by people for the last 150 years, we have taken it for granted.  Unless you have got a geyser in the middle of Main Street, people ignore deteriorating subterranean infrastructure. And those chickens are starting to come home to roost for us. As we look at this, yes we have taken a look at it. It just doesn't make any sense for our company. We see room to run, we see a lot of unmet need, we see a lot of customers that could beneﬁt from us participating in a better future for them. And that's where we're focused."
"Susan, Michael Lapides at Goldman. A bit on M&A as well. But staying within water.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Because I look at electric, if I look at gas over the last three to ﬁve years, there has actually been a bit of a heightened M&A trend. Companies using, especially those with strong balance sheets. Using those balance sheets debt as equity to make acquisitions of smaller players.  Among the public companies, water has not gotten involved in that. Across all of you, whether it's you, your peer that's somewhat similar in market cap, or many of the smaller publicly-traded water investor-owned utilities. I guess my question is one, how should we think about the multiples you are paying, when you are buying municipally-owned systems. And compare that to the current trading multiples of where some of the really small cap water utilities are? That's question one.  Question two is, given your balance sheet strength. And the thing that Linda didn't touch on is how much balance sheet capacity would you have, if you are willing to be BBB-plus or BBB? So you would still have a really strong balance sheet. And yet might free up even more capital. How do you think about whether that could give you an opportunity to roll up the sector even faster going forward. And maybe take on whether they're larger municipal acquisitions rather than the 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 customer ones, or even some of the publicly-traded comparables?","That's a great question, Michael. I will start. And Linda and Mark may want to jump in. We actually do look at if we had a major acquisition, how much our balance sheet could handle. What if it were stock, what if it were debt? Of course, if interest rates go up, it's a higher % of debt, it's not going to be quite as attractive. And I think you are already seeing a little bit of downward pressure on multiples.  We do look at everyone. But a couple of things. Number one, you have to have a willing seller. And a lot of times, when you have high multiples and you are only a willing seller if you have a multiple that is higher than the biggest multiple based thing for the past two years. And we have a really technical process -- Mark talked about, we actually have very disciplined ﬁnancials. But we have a last-ditch gut check. And it's called where is the stupid line?  Where is the line that if you think people are going to go, that was really stupid? We also want to have no regrets. In 5 to 10 years, are people going to look back and say, that was a strategic acquisition that looked expensive at the time. But wasn't? Or are they going to say, we're still paying for a bad decision?  We have very healthy debates among our executive team about all of that, at all times. Mark talked about our commercial development committee, that Mark and Linda and Walter are on. And our General Counsel, Michael Sgro, is on. And the states have those. And they come in and they debate. And they push each other and they stretch.  I say that to say, we're always open to look. But we don't think we have to do something that appears desperate, or that we overpay. And we also have models that look at long-term, not just at EPS accretion. You can get EPS accretion without value creation. We look at EPS, we look at ROEs in 5, 10, 15, 20 years.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We look at the impact, diluted or accretive on ROEs, not just on what it does for EPS. So we look at all of that. And at the end, we say, what is the level at which, if somebody was above this, we could say, good, they can have it. And I know that's not a speciﬁc answer. But Linda, do you or Mark want to add to that? Anything more detailed than what I said?     I think would add that in our corporate strategy and business development area. So what are the suite of opportunities that we have? How do we capitalize on those opportunities, in a way that ﬁts us from a strategic standpoint. And ﬁts us from a ﬁnancial standpoint. And which we would have no regrets. So those are the types of things that we look at. And we do that on a continuous basis, Michael."
"Maybe a bit of a follow-up. How should we think about what the multiples you are paying for municipal utilities. So the 10,000, 15,000, 20,000? Relative. And maybe that's at time of acquisition and then more normal run rate, relative to maybe where you trade?","It's hard to translate that directly across. But I will tell you that on balance for all of the vagaries of acquiring municipal systems, I think on balance, it's more value-add for our shareholder. And ultimately for the customer, because of the drivers. You're not looking -- we don't look at it as a multiple. We look at it as, think of a state where you have fair value legislation, right? You can get it all on rates.  You're basically, you can eliminate or really reduce what the premium is going to be. And you've got other mechanisms. Our primary measure is what is the rate of return going to be on the capital we are investing, not what's the multiple on the turn of the revenues type of a thing, because we are not -- typically, if you look upon it as buying a going concern, you're going to add in all those other factors. Municipalities don't think that way. And we usually tie it to bottoms-up modeling rather than take the revenue, give a multiple. And how much are we willing to pay?     And I don't think you've seen us think you've seen us pay $20,000 a customer either. Or $15,000. Some things you have to be careful about.  So take McKeesport, for example. Technically, when you look at retail connections, it looks like $10,000. But there's a lot of collection system with bulks, it's actually $22,000. So maybe sometimes when we do this, the calculation of how we get there. But we're actually extremely disciplined on that. And again, each system also it looks at. So what do you have to promise that you won't make rates go up more than, or is there a cap?  We put all of that in the systems. And I will tell you, the type of rigor we put into this. So about a month ago, we brought in one of the professors at Wharton who actually our modeling group   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   that works with Jim Gamble, came in and they are looking at new modeling techniques that they're going to be rolling out to Wall Street. And saying, we're ﬁnding that these are actually more predictive. So we're always looking at the modeling that we do. And actually working with Wharton and diﬀerent schools to say, how do we actually look at this diﬀerently, to make sure we're not -- that we're are looking at all the factors and that we can make smart decisions?  But to Mark's point, when you look at multiples and you start looking. And a lot of it depends on what's the balance sheet of the acquiree versus your balance sheet. We have a lot of opportunity. But then you look at who you are acquiring. And in the sector, there's a lot of space on a lot of those balance sheets. We also don't want to overpay. And even if you have fair market, overpaying even at fair market, you paying 40% above fair market, you still have to deal with those premiums that are leftover that you can't get in the rate base.  Growth for growth's sake is not what we are after. We are after disciplined growth that allows us to have this EPS growth. But also allows our ROEs to continue decreasing the lag between our allowed ROEs and what we are actually accomplishing. That we share with you. And again, the ability to say we're making smart decisions. You can call it a strategic acquisition, you can't do too many of those that are dilutive long-term."
"Two questions. First, just on the long-term growth rate, the 7% to 10%. If you look at 2016 and 2017 guidance, you are around the lower end of that. And so, as we're thinking about this growth rate, are you thinking that you'll see an acceleration in the later period, to get back in the middle of that range as a midpoint? How should we think about using that growth rate?","When we say 7% to 10%, we believe that we will be in the middle of 7% to 10% long-term over the ﬁve years."
"Okay, is that maybe, that's the market-based businesses, with the headwinds maybe going away?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It's the puts and the takes. When you look at it, we are -- we do a ﬁnancial plan that is both stretch. But also a bit of conservatism. You heard Dan say, for example, we haven't built-in some of the things that he talked about. If there is a loosening of sequester, we didn't build that into some of the plan. Also on the reg side, we're staying 1% to 2% growth, in regulated acquisitions, which would be 30,000 to 60,000.  As you heard Walter and Linda say, we're monitoring. 2016 was a good year, the pipeline is very strong. If we go two or three years and see that there's almost a step change, you will see us come back next year, when we re-up the ﬁve-year and do an adjustment.  Right now, we're trying to do appropriate stretch. But also in conservatism. What we don't want to do is to overpromise. And right now, we are watching carefully what the market trends are. So if we do this, it could be each year, or if we see something mid-year that's a game changer, we would basically change and revise at that time."
"Okay. My other question is on the potential Trump infrastructure plan. You might have answered this, or talked about this at the beginning. But to the degree that they focus on water investments, have you had any discussions with the transition team about how they might look at investing? First of all, how focused are they on water infrastructure investment. And if they did it, how they would actually invest the money?","Yes. That's a really great question. In terms of working, earlier this year I actually co-chaired with Doug Peterson, the CEO of S&P Global, the Bipartisan Policy Center's infrastructure study, that actually had support from both Republicans and Democrats, that said it was transportation, water and wastewater were the focus areas. What was advocated was municipalities need to have the full optionality.  If they want to have private equity ﬁnancing and do it themselves, ﬁne. But for the ﬁrst time ever in P3s, we got into the report, or they can sell their assets in water and wastewater. That was because of the fact that American Water was part of the discussion.  So the Bipartisan Policy Center is working, some with the transition team. Also there are other avenues that we're working through. How the Trump, I think one of the most interesting things is they talk about the 82% tax credit. What they ﬁgured out is that, an example, the repatriation of proﬁts from overseas.  One of the things that actually was presented about three years ago as a bipartisan eﬀort, there were 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans in the House. And ﬁve Democrats and ﬁve Republicans in the Senate, that were looking at infrastructure fund, that what you would do were those companies who have proﬁts overseas could bring those back. And for example the 10% penalty that comes from repatriating proﬁts, if they brought $1 billion back, then the tax would be $100 million, that what the Trump administration has ﬁgured out that an 82% tax credit of that, that for $121 million invested in the infrastructure fund, that those companies could repatriate $1 billion worth of proﬁt. And rather than pay the taxes, actually have an investment in infrastructure fund.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And through what we can gather from the administration is, that fund would not only be open for municipalities to leverage. But also with us. So an infrastructure fund that actually helped to get proﬁts back here. But then also would allow lower priced money for infrastructure, that will be open to all parties. And not just municipalities. We're very supportive of.  And I ﬁnd it fascinating, one thing that's interesting about the plan is, if you're doing tax credits for 82%, you're also, every time you put $1 into infrastructure, then labor is about 44% of every dollar that you spend. Those people making that money are also paying income taxes, at 28%. You're buying equipment and material that has sales taxes.  When you talk about a tax credit to actually spur an infrastructure fund, you're not only potentially getting the opportunity to repatriate proﬁts. But you're actually getting part of that back into the government in taxes through the taxes paid by labor and the sales taxes. If they're able. And again, this is one of very few areas in Washington that there is bipartisan support, if we can ﬁnd a model like that for infrastructure that gets bipartisan support, it wouldn't be quick, I don't think in the ﬁrst few months. But I think that could be something that can be very positive for all of us. Brian?"
"Following up on your comments. And Steve question. That ﬁrst slide where you talked about the impact of President Trump's administration, you referenced the possibility of American Water tapping into lower-cost ﬁnancing, as part of infrastructure opportunities. Can you go into a little more detail on how would that be realized mechanically over the next one or two years?","You can look at the state revolving funds in the states that allow, for example, Pennsylvania American, several of our subsidiaries are already in states where you have state revolving funds. Those funds. And it's a state decision, that the funding is from the federal government. But each state decides whether they will allow private utilities to be part of it. Most of our states do, some of them don't. I will tell you that we already, the way we look at it for the American Water Capital Corp, which is our ﬁnancing arm of American Water, we look at what those costs would be. And in some states where you see we do have some debt now that's actually at a state revolving fund.  So we see it operating probably pretty much like that, unless it's held at the federal level. And then we would see a process similar to that. But we would advocate for it to be state to state. So that the states could then determine how those monies are spent."
"Got you. One more follow-up question. On the same slide, you made reference to natural gas pipelines. And how some of the beneﬁts of the way the new administration might look at those pipelines could also aﬀect water. Clearly historically, there's been a tie between how those asset classes are treated. But could you spend a little more time talking about speciﬁcally what sort of mechanisms or adjustments might happen in the ﬁrst two years of the next administration?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","This is mainly for Keystone. So what I was saying is that one of the issues about -- the good news and the bad news about operating in the Appalachian basin, which is the only location that Keystone operates in is in the Utica and Marcellus as part of the Appalachian basin, is the big constraint with Appalachian basin is the takeaway capacity. It is the cheapest place to drill in the US for natural gas, they have a need for water. But what happened is they are very constrained with takeaway capacities. I think there's nine pipelines or takeaway pipelines that are under construction.     About 15 Bcf coming online of takeaway capacity in the Appalachian Basin to assist this problem. What I'm saying is that as there's more openness and support for building pipelines and takeaway capacities that opens up the Appalachian basin even further, that is very good for our Keystone subsidiary. Not necessarily in tax treatments, pipelines in general. It was more along those lines."
"My question is around the capital spending plan. So for the $5.9 billion for the regulated system investments, I was curious if you could give some color on how much is going for in-plant, how much is out of the plants, like in piping. And if you're investing in some technologies like smart metering. Can you touch on that?","Walter, do you want to answer that?     Pipelines, I'd say about 40% or 50% is in pipes and getting a quick recovery on that. The other is spread across all of the investment projects that we have, upgrading water and wastewater treatment plants. Typically the metering, we replace about 250,000 meters every year on average, on average costs $100, that can give you an idea of what our meter costs are."
"Then a follow-up, in terms of smart meters and just upgrading, does technological upgrades increase the life of these assets? We're saying they need to be replaced over time, would an investment in technology allow them to exist for a longer period of time?","We have diﬀerent replacement rates for meters in diﬀerent states. In New Jersey, it's 10 years, in some other states, it's 20 years. So what we're doing is making sure that as we move to AMI, we   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   have the right equipment on those meters. So we can naturally not have to replace them. But just leverage the AMI technologies."
"I just had a follow-up to that question, actually. When you talk about leak detection sensors and the customer engagement platform spending, how much are you spending on programs like these annually? Are you working with third parties for the data analysis, or do you do that in- house? What's the thought process about that going forward? Then what's the ROI for spending on items like these?","So we don't actually calculate the ROI. What we're doing is looking at the eﬃciencies, the total technology. And what we're getting for it. We don't actually breakdown -- we might consider in the future, Linda, looking at the technology spend. We've just never really broken that down separately.  So but it is -- and it is lumpy. When we put the SAP system in 2012 and 2013, the big spend, now that we have got our back-oﬃce system in, I will tell you this. All the new technology spend that we're looking at in the future is customer facing. We have our SAP system in the background, we've got functionality there. Now we're looking at things like, how can you do those tools that help the front line folks be able to serve the customer better?  I will tell you. So I was up in North New Jersey with Kevin about two months ago. And there was a 63-year-old ﬁeld service rep. And we're rolling out smartphones that you can actually -- they can put in a new meter and immediately see if it's working on their smart phone. And he said this is one of the most -- I've worked here 31 years. And this is one of the most exciting things I've ever seen. So the ability to do that and to do it immediately. And to have the employees buy-in. And a smart phone, it's not that expensive when you buy it in bulk like we do.  So looking for applications that aren't new systems. So what's fascinating to me is, how we can get our technology budget to go down. And yet be so much higher tech. Also, I will tell you though, one thing we haven't talked about today that's really, really important.  The issue of water quality. The fact of the matter is, there are 50 million plus chemicals that are registered today. It took 33 years for the ﬁrst 30 million to ever be registered. 33 years. It took nine months for the last 10 million.  Every 2.6 seconds, a new substance is being synthesized from chemicals breaking down, including in waterways. So this issue of water quality -- and there are 1,400 microbes that can aﬀect drinking water. This issue around water and the thought that smaller systems with staﬀ of 10 or 15 or 20 people are going to be able to stay in front of this.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's why things like Kevin and Radha, they were talking about. And Doug, like having chips that measure water quality immediately, before you have a sample. And by the time you ﬁnd out, people have been drinking it for eight or nine hours. I think for us a big part of the technology investment that we're going to be making in the future doesn't look like it did in the past.  It's going to be things to ensure that the quality of water stays safe, because you talk about reliable and aﬀordable water, the way we look at, if the water is not -- if you don't have quality water and you have dangerous water, nothing else matters. It doesn't matter what other things we're doing, if the water we're serving isn't healthy for our customers.  So we have to make sure we remember those fundamentals. And we're making sure that we put those investments in things like that, that diﬀerentiate us. And ensure the water quality. I think that is going to be, personally, the biggest competitive advantage we have in acquiring systems in the future."
"Angie Storozynski, Macquarie. So I wanted to be a bit picky about 2017 guidance. So if you look at it, the guidance is in line -- largely in line with the range. But it's mostly market-based services that are growing. The growth on the regulated side is actually slow, about 4%, 4.5%.  Is it simply because those regulated acquisitions actually have an earnings drag, until you get a step up in rates? And if that's the case, are we expecting that the next, say two years, will have a subpar growth in regulated earnings? Because if you're showing that your rate base is actually growing at a 5% to 6% rate. And that seemingly the earnings growth on the regulated side actually lacks the rate base growth.","Linda, do you want to take that? That's a great question, that we've talked a lot about.     Thank you, Angie, for that question. When we look at the regulated acquisitions, we talked a bit today about the timeline, that it can take some time to get through the process, to where we have the full acquisition authorized in our rate base.  Well between the time that we close the deal and the time that it's authorized in rate base, we use ﬁnancial metrics, to where we would expect to have a positive contribution to earnings during that timeframe. Then you would hit the full hurdle rates, once you get through the full rate case process. And that's why we ﬁnance that during that period of time, with shorter-term debt, as well. But we would expect a positive contribution, not necessarily the full contribution from that asset right away.  We also -- when we look at the regulated business, depending on the timing of rate cases, things are going to move up and down on a year by year basis. And that's primarily why we get   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   a long-term compound annual growth rate. We are not saying earnings are going to grow 7% or 10% -- or 7% or in the middle of the range every single year, it's a range of 7% to 10% over that period, because of those types of issues.     And if you tend to have two or three of your bigger states have rate case outcomes in the same year, you're going to get a lump year outcome. And also, keep in mind that with the headwinds that we had this year in both military services as well as Keystone, that the market base did not grow at its normal rate this year. So you will see an acceleration, probably next year, especially given we think will be an increase in Keystone. And it will be accretive next year."
"I'd like to ask a couple questions. And I'll preface it by, I realize there's 1,000 variables. But you must have a way of thinking about this. The ﬁrst one, rather simplistically is, what does it cost to replace the water main the day before it breaks versus the day after it breaks?","It's 10 times more expensive to repair a pipe after it breaks, than to repair it before there is a break."
"The second one being, we know is that -- and this could -- you can even look back 10 years or out 10 years. But you must be -- how much faster are water mains breaking as the system gets older and older?","That's a great question, it depends on the pipe. Kevin, do you want to take that?     Sure (inaudible; microphone inaccessible)     This is not going to be a good weekend, by the way. Whenever you get freezing cold weather and then it's 60 degrees on Saturday, that is not good.     (inaudible; microphone inaccessible)      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We actually have a chart we probably should start including in investor materials. We actually have a chart that's showing our investment. And shows that for the last two years we are on the downturn, in terms of main breaks, as we invested more money. It's a great chart."
"I appreciate that. But part of what I was asking is in the municipality that is not doing it as fast as you are doing it, how fast -- how much does is increase happening year-over-year, because presumably the more breaks they have, the more attractive the relationship with you becomes.","On average, in the United States, they are -- we say every 250 years. So it's really 0.4% of lines are being replaced nationally. And you heard Walter say our goal is 1%, which doesn't sound like a lot, one every 100 years. But it's 2.5 times better than the national average.  But to your point, one of the reasons the smaller and medium-sized systems, they get so distressed, because if your municipality -- and remember, these folks have so many priorities. There's schools, there's roads that need paving, there's community centers. And they've got pensions that are unfunded sometimes, pension liabilities.  They are sitting here and they say, okay, are we going to try to replace a pipe that's not really -- nobody is noticing, or wastewater pipes nobody's noticing, or am I going to build a park, or a school? Because -- or potholes, covering up potholes.  What is happening is a lot of this infrastructure was put in the ground before World War II and wastewater, a lot of the wastewater was right after World War II. It's now starting to fail. And it's a failure. And a huge amount of investment that's required. Add to that, typically as a private company, when we have -- for example, if we ever had a consent order, we might be given months to ﬁx it.  There are municipalities who have consent decrees, meaning they have violated wastewater discharges for 10, 15, 20 years. It's not been enforced as much in municipalities. When you see things like Flint and things happening, the EPA is really ramping up their enforcement of the regulations on everyone. And we think that could be a driver, that they are going to either have to invest as a municipality, or they need to ﬁnd other options."
"As just a quick follow-up to that, if the EPA is ramping that up, does it give you fodder for better conversations with the rate authorities?","We think that enforcement of regulations is good. We have a quality of water standard that is typically higher than even required in a lot of places. So increasing water standards, as you heard earlier today, are actually good for us.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"There was one reference in visuals to the combined sewer outﬂow, or outlet issue, which I think of Philadelphia. Enormously expensive. But hugely important to water quality. Are you dealing with, as it were, your fair share of CSO projects, or is that something, in view of the capital intensity, that you'd rather not be dealing with?","That is an interesting question. We've had a lot of discussions. I'll start. And then I think that Mr. Strauss may want to jump in.  For example, in Scranton, the CSO, which is combined, where you have combined stormwater and sewer, we're not looking at buying stormwater systems. Where you have combined, to the point and Pennsylvania just actually acknowledged this through regulation and legislation, also, that the moment wastewater touches stormwater, it's wastewater, which we think is an appropriate way to basically describe that.  We're looking at diﬀerent systems. We are not buying stormwater systems. Where however, there are systems that have the combined sewer and stormwater, we are looking entirely at the entire asset purchase, to determine if that's what we want to be involved with. Mark, do you want to add anything?     The CSOs and American Water's portfolio, wastewater systems, pre-Scranton, is a very limited amount of CSO. Most of it is segregated systems, where we have the wastewater, the storm sewer system is owned by the municipality.  However, to your question, CSOs, that has been an area of focus for enforcement by the EPA. And I think irregardless to the change of administration, that's going to be an issue that's going to continue, because you get these ﬂushes into rivers and waterways where you get a storm, they are typically areas that --older developed areas. And a lot of times, they have ﬁnancial stress as well.  And as you pointed out, it's enormously expensive, especially in a more urbanized area, to go around digging up streets. You're not out in the countryside. It is something that we are focused on. I think it has to do with our ability to deliver capital eﬃciently.  You remember Walter's discussion about capital eﬃciency. There's no pixie dust about this. It's not like anybody's going to come along and say, I can wave a wand and they're going to be separated. It's very intensive work. But there are strategies you can adopt, whether it's retention chambers and then metering to the plant, separating the lines is pretty expensive.  But there are things that can be done. But I guess for us, we do view it as an opportunity. But we're going to be very disciplined about it. We will only go after those opportunities where we think we can make a positive diﬀerence for the rate payer. If we're engaged, if we bought that   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   system, would that rate payer be better oﬀ 10 years down the road than if they were left on their own, or if somebody else acquires them? We're pretty rigorous about that testing.     And one small way we're going to pilot it too, is that our military bases, some of the commanding oﬃcers have said, you have water and wastewater for the military base, we'd like for you to take over stormwater. We believe that the legislation enabling privatization legislation allows us to do that. There's been some disagreements with some DoD lawyers. But that would be a great opportunity for us to test that, from a stormwater standpoint, on a much smaller scale. So we're very interested in doing that."
"And a not unrelated question, is there any happy takeaway from the debacle in West Virginia, in terms of your getting regulatory support for forensic work upstream of your intakes. And just trying to head oﬀ something like that?","Absolutely. The thing with West Virginia is that it's more, it's not as much regulatory as it was legislative. The fact is in West Virginia, there were no requirements for reporting for Freedom Industries, to report even to the state, DEP, what was stored in the facilities. That was remedied through legislation that now requires anyone who keeps chemicals, they have to report to the DEP. And we have access to those reports.  Another thing that happened, of course, is that Freedom Industries went bankrupt. I will tell you that another thing the state has done, is in 2015, they have passed more stringent tort reform, that unfortunately the lawsuits against us after the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries were ﬁled before the tort reform. And there is a regulatory issue in West Virginia that only aﬀects West Virginia American Water, that's not present in any of our other states, nor are the electrics and gas held to it, which is ambiguous to the point of being responsible for any interruption of service.  And we think that is an issue in West Virginia. It's very limited, it's not in any of our other states and it's only for private water in West Virginia. Those are some of the lessons learned that we need to deal with.  Anything else? Well you have our numbers, Mr. Vallejo and Melissa Schwarzell can get anything to us. I just want to close, ﬁrst of all, thank you for being here. I know this is a big commitment close to the holidays. We really appreciate you being here, we appreciate your great questions, your smart questions.  Thanks for your time and attention. And I mean it sincerely, we really appreciate your investment, your clients' investment in us. And I will tell you this, just like for our employees, they care about what they do. And it's more than a job, because what we do matters in communities and the people we serve.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We also understand that we're here because of the owners of our Company, who are shareholders. We don't want them to be surprised, we don't want them to worry in retirement. And we look at it to say, again, to the end of the day, we want to be the stock that you worry about the least, that's most predictable. And that you know where we're coming from. And that we stay true to our knitting.  If we ever have bad news, we will tell you, good news we will tell you. We want to make sure, we'll be measured in how we do it. And somewhat conservative. But we want to make sure that we are the Company that you can be proud to own. And that your clients can be proud to own. If we're ever not, we expect you to pick up the phone and call us and tell us.  Okay? And I will tell you that those of us who got to speak today are speaking on the behalf of the 6,700 amazing, absolutely amazing employees in this Company. I just wish you could get to know more of them and what they do everyday. And the dedication and commitment that they have to our customers. And we have story upon story of the things that they do for our customers that are extraordinary and out of the ordinary, because they just take their jobs not as working for the water company. But providing a critical health service. Thank you for being here, happy holidays. And be safe going home.
