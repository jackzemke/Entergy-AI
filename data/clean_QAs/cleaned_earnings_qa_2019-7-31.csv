Question,Answer
"Good morning. This is a great call and sounds like everything is going really well at the Entergy. So I guess my ﬁrst question with the increased guidance, it sounds like you're still maintaining within the 5 to 7. But, Leo, as you talked about, there's signiﬁcant incremental investment opportunity that you see, including the 7,000 megawatts you talked about. What are the other levers you see that could potentially increase, if not through 2021 but beyond, in terms of the growth opportunity you see at the utility side?","Praful, from an investment standpoint, if you can go back to our last Analyst Day, even we were talking about the number of things that we can do not only to upgrade the technology associated with our generating ﬂeet, uptake of technology and sign up new load, attach new generation to the transmission front, but also a signiﬁcant amount of distribution, distributed energy resources, technological advancements that we can make. Those are the types of things that we're still looking at. Nothing that we're talking about today, nothing that enters the plan are outside of the bounds with the sorts of things that we've been talking about for some time with all of you and certainly working on for even longer internally to the company.     As we looked at it, as we've always said, what we've -- what we're always balancing every day, every decision we make is that three-pronged outcomes that we need for our customers: one, it has to improve the level of service that we provide them; and two, we have to do it to manage their bills. Managing the bills is the governor in terms of how much we can -- we can spend on upgrading the reliability of the system. We've got to balance that and obviously the sustainability objectives that we and our customers and all of you as investors have.  So it is more of the same in terms of what we have to do to be looking at to upgrade that system. The 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts of generation, that's a continuation of what we've been doing. And that is modernizing the ﬂeet to lower O&M, lower fuel costs, improve emissions across the board, as we look to deactivate 40-year-old and 50-year-old units and replace them with new capacity. So if you look at our system, we used to put out that histogram of the age of our ﬂeet. We still have some older units, some of what we're spending the money on right now. The new -- some of those new dollars are actually to go into some of those legacy gas units to make sure they continue to operate reliably while they get into queue to be replaced by the newer stuﬀ.  So it's nothing new. It's nothing that we haven't been talking about before. It's really just to focus on making sure that we balance those three objectives. We want to make sure that we improve the level of service, maintain some of the lowest rates in the country, work on the customers' bills, keep them below the level of inﬂation, while we continue to improve our sustainability footprint, but importantly, as I mentioned, the sustainability of our customers. That's very important to them as well. So..."
"Super helpful, Leo. Thank you for that. And maybe just quickly switching to the nuclear operation side, wanted to understand, any more color on the ANO outage? It seems to be delayed. So just any color on what's going on there and when that would be back on line would be helpful.","Good morning, Praful. It's Rod. We're pleased to report for our customers that ANO is in fact back online and synced to the grid I believe beginning on Monday. And so, that's moving forward. So that's progress for us."
"Hey. So perhaps just to come back to this cost question. Can you elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the cost beneﬁts ﬂowing back to customers? Obviously you just ﬁled an FRP in Arkansas which reﬂected less rate inﬂation in past years. Is some of the O&M that your reductions already in place or is this more prospective and should that kind of limit the inﬂation here for Arkansas for next year's FRP as well? And then maybe just the nuance here, should we expect some transient beneﬁts or is this largely given the annualized nature of all these ﬁlings going to ﬂow pretty simultaneously back to customers?","Julien, this is Drew. So in terms of the ﬂow back to customers, we would expect that, pretty much all of it would ﬂow back to customers in the course of time. As you're noting, depending on the jurisdiction, some would ﬂow back to customers faster than others. And I think that's actually a critical piece of the overall strategy here, because we are aiming to manage our customers' bills.  And by doing that we are creating space in the bill for incremental capital investment to improve reliability. And I think there is -- we don't have it in the main slides but there is an appendix slide, I think it's like slide 38 or so, that talks about how our earnings are expected to change. While it happens, you'll notice that the     net revenue line doesn't really move all that much. And the O&M line is that's creating that space for us. So we would expect that would ﬂow back to customers, because we're not -- we're not anticipating their bills really moving at all as a result of this incremental capital.  In terms of some of the O&M and the progress that we've made, I think the answer is yes, we have made some progress this year. That's part of what gives us conﬁdence that we can execute on this going forward. And I don't know if all of it is in rates today, but it will get into rates very quickly. This year, as you know, we're using it to oﬀset some of the negative weather that we had in the ﬁrst quarter. Plus, I mentioned in my remarks, the industrial sales growth was a little bit below our expectations year-to-date, but it will be ﬁne long-term. But in the meantime, we need to make sure that we are managing to hit our expectations for this year. So some of that is happening now. That's part of what gives us conﬁdence going forward, and it should all ﬂow back into rates."
"Excellent. Just on the CapEx budget, a little bit further elaboration. Some of it, it seems like it was distribution as well, and then also just what does the Texas legislation mean for you guys from a CapEx perspective and is that reﬂected as well?","I'll take the capital and then I'll let Rod answer the regulation piece of it. From a capital perspective, yes, a good chunk of it is in distribution, as you noted. And as Leo mentioned in his remarks and in his answer to Praful's question, it's a lot of what we have been doing. Not all of it is -- some of it is putting in new smart equipment and stuﬀ like that, that can communicate with our network, but a lot of it is just replacing poles and cross-arms and transformers that are -- that frankly just need to be updated. And so that's on the distribution front.  On the transmission side, there is quite a bit of economic development along the corridor between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. That's prompting new reliability investment opportunities for us from a transmission perspective that frankly we weren't planning at the beginning of the year, mainly along the west side of the Mississippi River. And then we have a lot of customer products and services, investments that we're making, as Leo alluded to in his script. So those are some of the main kinds of investment opportunities that we're looking at in terms of this near- term incremental capital.  And I'll turn that over to Rod for the regulatory question.    Yeah. And the beneﬁt of the generation rider legislation in Texas is really reducing lag for purposes of the CapEx that we have in the plan for Texas. But remember, it's an enabling legislation that gives the Texas Commission the opportunity to provide more eﬃcient regulatory recovery, predominantly for those generation investments that Drew made reference to. So it's a risk reduction and the lag reduction     opportunity for us, as Drew I believe stated and Leo in his statement, to align the recovery mechanisms with the timing of our investments and beneﬁts to customers."
"Just maybe to follow-up on Texas, so as the Commission moves on and aligns sort of the legislative intent with the actual recovery mechanisms, is there any potential for the upside to your CapEx plans in Texas?","I think the potential for upside has to do with our ability to manage the costs associated with service delivery. The capital plan we have for Texas is pretty straightforward and we think set. But pulling the levers that Leo and Drew mentioned a little earlier provides us an opportunity to move closer to our allowed ROE. And as I just mentioned, the Texas Commission having tools to help us reduce lag as well gives us the opportunity to do that as well."
Great. Thank you. And then I know it's some time oﬀ the activity on the FERC docket. But I guess what is your range of expectations with what happens there with respect to SERI?,"This is Drew and I'll tackle that one. So there aren't any material updates right now. It continues to be going through the process at FERC. And in terms of our expectations, so as we said for a while, we have a reserve on our ROE and then for whatever the outcome may be there based on our expectations. And then the other elements of the various complaints they are reﬂected in the outlook that we put out today. So there is no -- all of the expectations that we have are reﬂected in towards SERI's outcomes are reﬂected in our outlook."
"Thank you. Good morning. Leo, in your comments. Yeah, hey. On your comments about the 7,000 megawatts to 2030, does that include the four plants under construction and the one in Choctaw?","It does not. The 7,000 megawatts to 8,000 megawatts that we're talking about is 2022 through 2030. And as I mentioned, it'll probably be roughly half renewables and half gas, as we look at it today, obviously subject to what happens technologically and cost wise to the construction of those diﬀerent facilities. But again, that's 7,000 to 8,000 new megawatts."
"Okay. So is that -- I realize it's out a long time, but is that still being driven by the industrial load?","It's still being driven by the need to technologically improve the system. So if you remember, Charles, we have been going through this portfolio transformation with our generation ﬂeet given the age and the vintage of those facilities. That served us really well, but when they start pushing 40-plus years of age, the new plants, the eﬃciency, the O&M levels, the emission levels, and then obviously the fact that they are starting brand new life that overtakes what the maintenance of those older plants would be.  So, for example, the St. Charles plant, over the life of the plant that's going to beneﬁt our customers by $1.3 billion given the lower production costs associated with that plant vis-a-vis what's on our system today and in the market. So that's really the continuation. The load growth obviously is important, but in large part what that does is it keeps the price point down for our customers as well."
"Okay, and since I'm the last questioner, if I can take the liberty of asking one more. Dividend increase, I understood the 2021 review. Will the review by the Board in later this year in the fourth quarter? I'm assuming it's going to stick to that fourth quarter schedule as well as 2020. Do you anticipate like similar 2% to 3% increases until then, or you weren't saying it's going to be no increases until fourth quarter of '21? Is my assumption correct?","We were not saying it would be no increase, you're correct. The Board will take the dividend up every year as it always does. We were just signaling because we've had this objective that we've stated for a while that we want to have our dividend growth match our earnings growth. And as you point out, for the last few years it's been lagging earnings growth. We believe that we'll be at a point in time by the fourth quarter of 2021 to put those in line with our expectation of earnings growth."
"Okay, appreciate it. Thanks for the clariﬁcation. That's all I had.","Thank you, Charles.    Operator  Thank you. And we do you have a question from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open."
"Hi, guys. I'm sorry to jump in last minute. But quick question -- I apologize if I missed this. With the new CapEx ﬂowing in, have you discussed sort of incremental equity       needs or how we should think about that over the next few years?","Yeah. Neil, this is Drew. So in my remarks I mentioned that our equity expectations are exactly as they were at Analyst Day. So it's not until -- we won't have any need for equity until after 2020, sometime in '21 or beyond. And that expectation is around 5% to 10% of our overall capital need (inaudible)."
"Yeah, okay. And should we think about that likely being that rule of thumb holding true as well in '22 and '23 based on what you're seeing right now?","Yes. I think, kind of looking out on a long-term basis, yes."
