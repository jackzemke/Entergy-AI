Question,Answer
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. I was just wondering with regards to the strategic review process if you might be able to provide -,"Jeremy, good morning.  Operator  Jeremy, please go ahead.     Are you there, Jeremy?"
Good morning. I was just wondering if you could provide more color on the timeline for the strategic review process. What milestones we might be looking for to see as more developments come through there?,"Operator, perhaps we should go on to the next question.  Operator  Okay. Our next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. Scott, ﬁrst question just to understand your end game plan here with regards to your Enable ownership. Is the end game plan to essentially see two separate entities where the utility business is separate from the commodity exposed MLP business or are you envisioning something where they are all together, but the commodity exposure is less? Just wanted to understand what you ultimately are looking to get here.","Yeah. Ali, I think, it's diﬃcult and not appropriate to comment on what I think the outcome here is going to be. I mean, we're continuing to look at this. It could take diﬀerent forms. And, as you know, we're in the middle of this process. And we will be in a position later in the year to, I think, clarify the questions or give answers to the questions you're asking."
"Okay. So we should not assume that at the end of the day, there are two separate entities with MLP and – or at least not necessarily the case?",Yeah. I don't think you can automatically assume that that's the outcome.
"I see. And my second question, on the utility REIT structure, what's the milestone in your mind you're looking at right now? And at the end of the day, do you think that is indeed the best structure for Houston Electric to have your CapEx needs given other factors that you will probably need capital for given your CapEx plans?","Yeah. Again, Ali, I think, it's a similar answer here. We've been obviously observing what's going on at the PUC here in Texas. But we're in the midst of doing this evaluation ourself. And, at this point, we're not prepared to comment on it. We'll be in a better position to comment later in the year as we conclude our evaluation."
"Okay. I apologize but one just accounting question. Well, if you can clarify, so Enable when they reported, reported a down year year-over-year, when you report numbers in your consolidated numbers, you have Enable up year-over-year. Can you just explain why that's the case, Q1 result?","Yes, Ali. We have higher accretion related to our Enable investment in 2016 relative to 2015.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. I can ask my follow-up because this one may be targeted to Bill. Bill, when you look at the debt capital structure, over the next two years to three years, how much debt do you think you have outstanding throughout the corporation where either due to reﬁnancing or where the NPV of the make-whole payments would make sense you think you can signiﬁcantly bring down the interest rate on?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Michael, we have $6 billion of debt outstanding at year-end and less than that after ﬁrst quarter. So we have signiﬁcant maturities in 2016, 2017, and 2018 whilst we had some maturities last year aggregating to approximately $1 billion. We do not expect to be a material increase in that borrowings over the next few years. I've talked about that in my prepared remarks. And therefore, it's that $1 billion which helps us reduce interest expense as well as not increasing the amount of debt on the balance sheet."
"Okay. But there's no incremental debt outside of maturities where you think you could pay it down early, reﬁnance at a lower rate and where the NPV of the make-whole makes sense?",There aren't any economic opportunities at this time to do that.
"Got it. I appreciate it, Tracy. Thanks, guys, and congrats on a good start to the year.","Thank you.     Thank you, Michael.    CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator  Your next question is from Brian Russo from Ladenburg."
"Could you just maybe comment on the Minnesota PUC's vote earlier this month on the rate case? And then, historically, it's been the one jurisdiction where you've experienced lag. I am wondering with this vote and outcome, are you able to earn your ROE.","I'll ask Joe to answer this.     Yeah. Brian, good morning. Yes. The Minnesota PUC liberated on the ﬁnal order last week. And while we are not in receipt of the ﬁnal order yet, we expect that early June some time. They did make some decisions and especially with regard to the cost of capital. So let me share a few of those with you. They decided on a 9.49% ROE and a 50%/50% debt/equity capital structure. We're a little disappointed in that 7.7% of that debt capital was at short-term rates. But while we're disappointed in that, we do anticipate that the ﬁnal rate increase amount when we get the ﬁnal order will be in line with our expectations for the ﬁnancial performance of the business and consistent with our overall guidance. And we do expect to be able to continue to earn right at that allowed ROE. And we really don't experience much lag in Minnesota once we ﬁle the case, because we're allowed to put interim rates into eﬀect. And those have been in eﬀect at the $48 million level since some time last year."
"Okay. Thanks. And I think the strategy is to ﬁle every two years in Minnesota. So in year two, do you experience any ROE degradation?","Yeah. There could be some, Brian, as we get – after we get the new rates into eﬀect. But, as you said, we are on a track to continue to ﬁle every other year. And we have substantial rate base additions that we're continuing to make there. And so, we will do everything in our power with the O&M and other decoupling mechanisms certainly helps because that captures the lag from   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   – or not the lag, but any under-recovery from usage variations. So, we'll do everything we can to earn as well as we can towards that allowed return."
"Okay. And then, lastly, is there any changes or updates to your previously disclosed multi-year CapEx forecast and rate base CAGRs?",No. Not to what we shared back at the fourth quarter call back in February.
"Thanks, guys. Really two quick questions. First is relating to the Continuum acquisition. Is that acquisition going to require additional capital or is that already part of the numbers that's been thrown out there – the about $80 million number?","Nick, this is Joe again. No, that won't require any additional capital. As you mentioned, the purchase price was $77.5 million plus working capital adjustments. And we're working very diligently to integrate that acquisition. And we expect to have that completed within the next few months. And that will contribute to our growing income at CES, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, of $40 million to $50 million on an annual basis starting in 2017."
"Great. And I guess on an unrelated note, in terms of guarantees to Enable, speciﬁcally debt and performance for their G&T business, understanding that one of the guarantees expired I believe it was for debt on May 1. What should we think about in terms of what's left?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hi. Nick, it's Bill. Those guarantees relate to our tax basis in Enable. And so they may expire or may look to put other guarantees on in order to manage our tax position."
"Tracy, I had a question for you. You made the comment that the depreciation was running higher because of the amount and the type. If you could just clarify that for me. Is that because the projects were not subject to the DCRF or is it because the type of CapEx was shorter life? If you could just give a little more color there I'd appreciate it.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Sure. Good morning, Charles. We closed a signiﬁcant amount of projects to rate base in the fourth quarter of last year, so that contributed to increase in rate base and the increase in depreciation. We also had capital with shorter depreciable lives that increased the composite rates. So it's a combination of more rate base and a higher composite rate related to – including but not limited to IT capital."
"I mean which doesn't creates an issue. Okay. Okay. And then my second question is – Bill, this is for you, on Continuum. I thought – my memory might be oﬀ on this – that when you closed that deal you thought if things went well that you could maybe push your utility guidance to the upper end. I realize you're only a month into it, but are things going well?","Yes. As Joe stated in his remarks, we are well on our way to integrating Continuum. We closed on April 1 and today is May 10. So we do expect it to be modestly accretive this year. But I think it's too early in the process to report as to how much that might be."
"Hey, guys. Just wondering about free cash ﬂow. I mean if I look at what you did in the quarter, just cash from operating activities minus cash from investing activities generated, if I recall   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   correctly, right around $100 million. And this isn't exactly your biggest quarter. If I look at various forecasts, consensus numbers, et cetera, you're in a position where you might be able to generate a decent amount of annual free cash ﬂow before the dividend payment. How do you think about other uses especially as CapEx kind of moderates in the 2017, 2018 timeframe? How do you think about other uses for that free cash ﬂow?","Michael, it's Bill. As I said in our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our cash generation from operations. And the way we look at that is to back out the funds collected for principle amortization associated with the transition bonds as well as the interest expense associated with that. But that cash from operations in the ﬁrst quarter, you're right, covered our CapEx, covered our dividends and we paid down $100 million in debt, so very strong. For the year, as I said, we're expecting to borrow incrementally $150 million. And we said on the year-end call that 2017 looks like we'll be paying down debt. So, with that thought, beyond that, with respect to other uses, it's a balance between capital investment on behalf of our customers, maintaining our solid credit quality and then thinking through what we do for our shareholders."
"Understood. As we look at the CapEx forecast you gave at the end of the year, with the continued moderation in the outer-years, it almost seems like unless you're targeting a signiﬁcant lower debt to cap at the holding company level and you might be – or signiﬁcantly diﬀerently FFO to debt or unless you're preparing for a deterioration elsewhere in the business that you're going to be in a very strong cash position as we get a couple years further out in time. So I did note there were some thoughts about allocating both to the debt and the equity side of the balance sheet.","We will be thinking about that, but we've not shared any thoughts on that at this time, Michael."
"So essentially tactical maneuvering, no big strategic initiatives like say you start a completely new line of business under the energy services banner?",What we might get with the acquisition is they had some choice customers and we used to be in that business. What I mean by choice is residential customers being able to choose their provider for natural gas. And so we think that might present an opportunity to us within CES for a new line of business as you say. And we've got a great customer platform in our utility business. And so we'll see if we can take up some additional opportunities in that particular segment of the business.
"Scott, I wanted to clarify. In your opening remarks, you were talking about usage pattern (36:14) customers may have come down. So, is customer growth, that 2% number, is that still a good proxy for weather normalized electric sales growth or are you seeing a degradation there from customer usage coming down?","Yeah, Ali. The answer to your question is yes. It is a good proxy for us. So, we are not seeing a reduction in use per customer. The comments about reduced usage had to do with the year- over-year comparison based on the implications of weather or the changes in weather. So, when we weather normalize, we end up with a usage that continues to hold essentially ﬂat at the residential level."
"Use per customer, okay. And then when you look at the Houston Electric results, I mean you were actually down year-over-year. Was that budgeted? I mean how does that ﬁt into the strength overall really that you are planning for the year?","Yeah. It doesn't change our forecast for the year. It's all part of our consolidated guidance that we've given. We anticipated some of this, I will say, because some of this is timing. There's a timing element involved with right of way revenues as well as with some of the O&M expense. So it's down in large part due to, what I'll call, timing related events that we were anticipating. And those will be compensated for reverse throughout the balance of the year."
"Okay. Okay. And then lastly, relative to normal or year-over-year, can you quantify for us what was the weather impact in the utility business?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah. We're looking that up. Hold on, one second.     Ali, one way to think about this would be the heating degree days at the electric business which is Texas, which were 86% of normal compared to 135% ﬁrst quarter of last year. On the gas side, as Joe said, we're largely hedged. So those heating degree days were 87% this ﬁrst quarter compared to 113% of last year."
"Okay. But, overall, Bill, on a bottom-line basis, was weather – I mean can you just give us a sense of what weather really did for earnings?","Weather had some eﬀect, but not material eﬀect to us in the quarter, largely because of the hedging mechanisms that we have in the gas business that Joe reviewed as well as our hedge in the electric business which we use for the winter. So we intend to mitigate weather impacts as much as possible and practical.     Ali, I think, after the hedging, the impact was probably less than $5 million for the quarter."
