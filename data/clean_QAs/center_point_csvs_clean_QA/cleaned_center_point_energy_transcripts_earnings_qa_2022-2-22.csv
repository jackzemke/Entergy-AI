Question,Answer
"So thank you, David. I think you drilled down fairly well on the drivers with sort of the near-term CapEx increases. Do you still see more spending acceleration opportunities, let's say, in the '22 to '24 timeframes. And could this higher CapEx be included in the master energy plan in Houston? Or that collaboration with Houston will be purely incremental to the spend?","No, I think the -- as we tried to walk the tightrope of our words here today, I mean, clearly, the Resilient Now opportunity is a really good one for CenterPoint, but it's early days. We have to complete the master energy plan, which we believe we'll do some point in the latter part of this year. That should identify the incremental capital that's there. I also think that as you think through what we have said over the past seven quarters about the build and our ability to spend capital, remember our ﬁrst was $16 billion plus, then it was $18 billion plus, now it's $19.2 billion. But keep in mind, throughout all of this, we also have said we have $1 billion in reserve capital that we can always look to spend or accelerate and that billion and reserve capital has not gone away.  So as I said, it's early days, but we're really excited about the opportunity in and around Resilient Now and what it can do for our customers here in Houston. But I'm not going to sort of tip our hand as to what that might look like until we're a little bit further down the road."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. And then just lastly for me, Dave. Just what's the timeline for the master energy plan? And I just want to just reiterate one point or just conﬁrm it, whatever comes out of the master energy plan or the resiliency now, are you still sticking with no need for equity to fund the incremental CapEx?","Yes. That really is our North Star at this point in time. I think given what has transpired with the company over the last couple of years, not needing to go back into the equity market is something that is really, really important to us. And so we have other options to fund an acceleration of capital or incremental capital that's out there. We've talked about a number of them over the past several calls. Continued sales of gas LDCs, for instance, would be one. And so the short answer is no, we do not see a need to have to go back in the equity markets and our plan that we outlined here is not predicated on doing that at all."
"Fantastic. That's all I wanted to conﬁrm. Thank you, guys. Congrats.","Thanks.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.     Hey, Steve."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe just following up on that last question on kind of funding. The -- Jason, I think you mentioned the potential of kind of your credit rating, I guess, thresholds coming down fully. Could you give us a sense of what might happen there in terms of those thresholds one year fully out of maturing? Good morning.","Yes, happy to. Currently with Moody's our downgrade threshold is 14% and we're strongly advocating for a decrease to 13%, which we think is more consistent with what our dual fuel peers have today. When we looked at this over the last year or so, one of the reasons we've had a higher downgrade threshold was because of a higher business risk proﬁle with respect to our investment in Enable. Now that's been converted to Energy Transfer or 7% out of that position, we're advocating strongly to be held consistent with our peers. The intention behind that advocation of the lower downgrade threshold though is not to utilize it for funding purposes. We want to retain that and couple that with the fact that we see ourselves sort of in the upper   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   half of the 14% to 15% FFO to debt range really provide about 150 basis point plus cushion between where our credit metrics are and our downgrade threshold."
"Great. And then just, Dave, maybe just you brought up the gas LDCs being a potential another source of capital if needed. I think you called them the prepaid debit card so to speak. Just is it possible that the Houston resilient plan, Resilient Now could be enough to kind of tap that?","Yes. I think as I said, I'm not going to try to front run our thinking on this, Steve. Obviously, we have -- one, we're really excited about the Resilient Now opportunity because I think it's going to be great for not only the city of Houston but the all of the surrounding communities and cities that really are in our territory, but as I said, it's early days. But I think the advantage we have with our gas LDCs is they're of various sizes. So at this point in time, we're not essentially headed down any speciﬁc path. It's just a great option to have as we look at our ability to spend more capital here in what is essentially one of the crown jewels of CenterPoint, which is Houston Electric."
"Great. And just on, I guess, lastly on Indiana. How are you feeling on just conviction on getting your approvals of the various power generation plants? Just overall conviction getting approvals.","Short answer, very positive, but I'll let Jason elaborate on that since it's part of his (inaudible) now.     Thank, Steve. And I'll reiterate the strong conviction that Dave expressed. We continue to work broadly with our stakeholders in Indiana. We think we have a plan that balances stakeholder interests. We see a signiﬁcant amount of support for this cold transition with respect to a number of our industrial customers in Greater Evansville area, who themselves have their own ESG commitments. And so we've taken a feedback from the commission and continuing to work with our customers. We feel like we have a plan that has broad stakeholder support.  We anticipate we'll continue to see approvals on each of the tranches we ﬁled throughout the course of this year, likely the solar PPAs in this upcoming second quarter, the simple cycle or gas CT plant in Q3. And then we'll be making a ﬁling for the balance of the generation transition a little later this year. So we think each quarter, you see a positive data point. We remain strongly convicted that this continues to have strong stakeholder support."
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet With JPMorgan."
"Great. Thank you. Maybe just circling back to the master energy plan, can you speak a little bit more to what that will actually evaluate? And similarly, do you expect subsequent plan updates after the initial ﬁling this year?","Yes. I think what is -- it's basically it is what it says it is. It's the master energy plan for the city of Houston. But also as we said, we are now enrolling some of the surrounding communities into some of the potential outcomes. But as I said in our prepared remarks, it's really focused on what does the power grid need to look like in Houston and the surrounding areas going forward, given the continued fantastic growth that we're seeing in this market. The continued impact of sort of distressed weather patterns either hard freezes or rains or ﬂoods or hurricanes. So getting the system more resilient and more hardened, getting the city ready for basically the EV infrastructure that it needs.  And I think if you'll recall back to our Analyst Day, the city only has like 30,000 or 40,000 EVs and it today with mayor whining $0.5 million here relatively quickly. That's going to be quite a load on the system with respect to what we need to do. And then there's obviously a number of social and community eﬀorts that will come out of this. So I mean I think it's focused in those areas. All of that I think will drive investment opportunities to support our customers and make sure that we continue not to have a major impact on bills."
"Great. Thank you for the color there. And then I know you touched on this in the script, but just what are the guardrails on selling the remaining ET stake? Is there anything more you can give on timing there?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","I'll let Jason handle that one because he's living it by the day.     Good morning, Rich. I'm not going to talk about speciﬁcs, but I'll try to provide a little bit of color. The lock up from the market at oﬀering that we undertook in December expired kind of early February. So now we are free to transact on the remaining position. We do retain ﬂexibility to work with energy transfer on another market oﬀering. We also retain discretion to dribble those shares sort of -- under sort of an equivalent of at the market equity program. So we have a lot of diﬀerent tools to dispose of this interest. And what I would say is we've obviously moved expeditiously to this point. We will continue to do so and we will be well within our goal of exiting the position before the end of this calendar year."
Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Hope to see you guys soon. Maybe if I can I know a lot of questions here around Houston. But what about the Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota here? I mean where do you stand on that process? I think there's some mid-year ﬁlings here. Can you talk about how that could impact the plan as well to a certain extent?,"Sure. I'll let our renewable energy transition master Jason Wells handle that one.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Hey, good morning, Julien, and congrats as well. We're excited about the Natural Gas Innovation Act. To your point, we will have a ﬁling about the middle of this year outlining our plan. We have green hydrogen pilot project coming online here and we look to build on that success with this upcoming ﬁling. I would say at this point, I wouldn't see it as a material driver of CapEx in the short run, call it, the next few years of our 10-year CapEx plan, but there is some opportunity when we look at sort of the back end of the 10 years. We want to make sure that we're starting to develop kind of expertise around alternative fuels, but doing so in a -- at a prudent pace so that it's cost eﬀective for our customers in Minnesota. And we look forward to working with the commission on ﬁnding that balance and kind of growing into this opportunity, as I said, over the course of the full 10-year CapEx plan."
"Thank you very much, I appreciate that. But if I can going back to the tone on the master energy plan in Houston. I mean as I understand it a lot of this is dealing with storms and resiliency. How near term of an opportunity is this, especially when you think about developing transition plans that might require permitting undergrounding, et cetera? It could very well be extended. How near term could we see some of these impacts be realized? And then maybe, Lesar, if you can elaborate a little bit, how long does this extend here? I mean it seems like the analog with South Florida and urban growth in the face of storm seems a reasonable parallel here if you collaborate as well?","Yes. I'll let Jason, I think, Jason handle the question. But I think go back to our Analyst Day, Julien, where we said, we have decades of spending ahead of us in Houston. So although the master energy plan will sort of set the direction and Jason can talk about sort of the near term and short term, this will set the direction for what should be a decade spend in terms of upgrading the system here in Houston. So I think the South Florida analog actually is a pretty good one.     Yes, I think it's a great analog and maybe I'll reinforce a couple of the points that Dave made and then try to unpack this with a little bit more detail about front running the plan. Every day that the Greater Houston area is without power, it cost our GDP $1.4 billion. And so it's really looking at how do we provide a more resilient economy here in the Houston area. As Dave pointed out, it is also about a concerted eﬀort to support the adoption of electric vehicles, both for light-duty vehicles for our customers as well as medium and heavy-duty vehicles for the city of Houston. And then as Dave said, there's also the need to address social equity and the impacts these storms have on certain communities here in the Greater Houston area.  And so with that in sort of the goals behind the master energy plan and you look at kind of what we've done to date. We've made a lot of really great progress on the transmission side of the business. We are in the ﬁnal stages of converting our entire transmission system to an extreme wind standard over the next few years. We've made a lot of progress with respect to our   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   substations after Hurricane Harvey. We embarked on a 10-year project to essentially raise our substations that were prone to ﬂood risk, and we're well underway there. Where I see a real opportunity for us is on the distribution side of the business.  We have about 35,000 miles of overhead conductor that has the opportunity to be hardened. Whether that's undergrounding or changing to stronger poles shorter spans. We have the opportunity to really I think increase some resiliency and improve reliability around the distribution system. And we think about the context of 35,000 miles that is, to Dave's point, kind of decade-long program. And so you'll see hardening of the distribution system. You'll see increases in distribution system capacity to handle electric vehicles. And we're really excited about what this can mean for our customers. We just really want to work with the city and likely will be in a position of unveiling this master energy plan towards the end of this year."
"I wanted to talk about another part of Texas growth potential, which is electric transmission and just thinking about the potential to bring more clean energy into your load centers and just there's some challenges that I think the renewable energy community had around interconnection and actually getting the power to where it's really needed, and I know you all are quite focused on this. But just curious if you get your latest thoughts on the opportunity there, some of the key challenges and bringing renewables into your load centers?","Yes. I think it's a good question because it's something that we deal with every day. Here is some sort of anecdotes to put things in context. Our service territory is only about 2.5% of the geographic footprint in the State of Texas, but we're almost a quarter of the load in the State of Texas from electric standpoint. So having adequate transmission in from the rest of the state into what's a relatively small geographic footprint is really, really critical. I think you're seeing a couple of issues sort of evolve around that. One is, as we said at our Analyst Day, we're seeing more renewables basically built inside of our service territory so that the interconnect to the system is shorter and it's easier to do.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   But there's also I think a focus at the new PUC in Texas in terms of getting more transmission into sort of the high-demand areas and that is a dialogue that we've got going on with them right now. But there clearly is a recognition generally that the renewables are going to be in West Texas and the demand is in the eastern side of the state, and having more access points into where our load center is and the load centers around Dallas and places like that is really critical. And I think you'll see some move in that area over the next year or so. Jason, you got anything you want to add.     I would also just say that we've seen an increase in the number of developers that are trying to say utility scale solar closer to these load centers to sort of Dave's point. So we're not having to build extended transmission lines. And this year we have about 4.4 gigawatts of renewable projects that will be tied into our system here close to city of Houston. We've got about 14 gigs of proposed projects in the queue. And so we see the opportunity for generation interconnects in and around our service territory to be a growth driver. In the short run and as Dave said, some of these longer transmission lines to continue to provide ﬂexibility and resiliency to our electric transmission grid as long-term drivers as well."
"Hopefully, two easy questions. Just I believe I heard you correctly, Jason, but in Texas on the recovery of the mobile generation I believe you said through the DCRF, you get recovering, you start earning order in September, was that in 2023?","That's right. The full balance will be September 2023. We'll make a detailed ﬁling that we'll make here shortly. We'll include the ﬁrst $200 million, so some of that will fold into rate and we'll begin earning an equity return on it in September 2022. We will make a ﬁling for the balance the $500 million for the DCRF ﬁling next year. And so think about this as the full earnings power really coming into rates, and therefore, into earnings in September 2023 and beyond."
"Great. And just a last question and I know it's not a part of the core business. Just on the one of the earlier slides you talked about excluding, I guess, ZENS from the ongoing number. Any thought to -- or is there an ability to monetize your ownership in that? Or is that in your 10-year plan, do you still see the company having ZENS throughout the forecast?","Yes. It's a great question around ZENS and this was originally attached to (inaudible) strategy from the late 1990s and the securities that we own we account for on a mark-to-market basis. And so what we exclude is essentially the mark-to-market volatility since it's not reﬂective of the ongoing earnings power of the company. However, those securities basically oﬀset debt that we also have on our books. The deferred tax bill will be due in 2029 and we are looking at ways to monetize the underlying investment the fees to that and address that deferred tax liability so that it's not something that sits out there until the end of 2029."
"Thank you. Just a couple of clean-up questions if I may. One on that 2022 guidance range. I know it's still excluding midstream, but how should we think about any of the drivers that go into the consolidated non-GAAP versus how you were thinking about it before? Is that really no change or is there something in there that's actually making you incrementally more positive from making this change?","Yes. Insoo, thanks for the question. I mean this is really about trying to simplify the story. We had as part of sort of what I would consider to be a transition year in 2021 really focused on utility EPS is sort of the ongoing earnings power the company. Now that we're out of 70% of the ET segment, we can focus on a consolidated basis. We're still reaﬃrming that 8% growth of the utility segment. I think that when you look at what we're excluding from our earnings related to energy transfer, it will actually be a net positive. But we want to make sure that the market continues to focus on the underlying earnings power of our utility businesses as we fully exit that position this year."
"Okay. Yes. That makes sense. And then, secondly, just I think we have talked in the past sort of try to ﬁgure out that diﬀerence between your rate base CAGR or the ﬁve or 10-year period and then the 8% EPS growth. Just for our modeling purposes, how should we think about the earned dollar raise trajectory versus allowed in this ﬁve-year period? Are we assuming kind of stable you earned dollar raise in '22 through '25 or just to continuously increasing I guess earned ROE, so closing the gap versus allowed?","Yes. I think we have the opportunity to continue to close the gap on earned dollar raise. It depends on the jurisdiction, but generally speaking, in some of the larger jurisdictions we're earning slightly less than our allowed return on a pure sort of I'll call it rate-based map basis. We make up that small amount of under earning with, I'll call it, below the line activity whether it's (inaudible) earnings or incentive revenues that are more that are below the line costs. So as we continue to focus on driving to earning the allowed return in each of our jurisdictions, continue to minimize corporate impaired overhead. I do think we have the opportunity to continue to improve on that earnings growth proﬁle over the course of the next ﬁve years."
Got it. Thank you and congratulations.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Thank you.     Yes. Thank you, operator. If you would -- I think that's going to be all on the queue for now.
