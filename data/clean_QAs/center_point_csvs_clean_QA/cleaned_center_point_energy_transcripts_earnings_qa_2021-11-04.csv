Question,Answer
"Hopefully I contribute to the short earnings call, but just -- I think of the company maybe over the last year, it was maybe more of a transition story. And we got, I guess, three increases in guidance throughout the year, including today. I mean, how do we think about going forward if we're more now on steady-state and the guidance you gave is probably more set and we look to be in the middle of it or do we continue to get maybe increases in guidance? And I have one follow-up.","Yeah. Well, look, I hope you got a sense today of how conﬁdent we are in the business or the direction that the business is going at this point in time. And I think that we're starting to hit on all cylinders. So, I agree, we're in a transition, but I think in a transition to what we believe ought to be a premium utility. So, I think if you listened to what we said today and let me boil it down into pretty simple terms, whatever we do this year, we will do 8% more than next year. Whatever   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   we do next year, we'll do 8% more of the year after that, and et cetera, as we outlined during our Analyst Day. But we've got a lot of tailwinds behind us right now and we really, really like where we are."
"Great. And just one follow-up. Dave, at the Analyst Day you gave us some great insight into, I guess, just commodity prices maybe from a previous job you held. Just thoughts on -- are you seeing any type of change in your view that you think maybe the commodity prices will end up coming down?","No, I think -- I assume you're referring to natural gas prices."
"Great. Thanks for taking my question. I will see you guys at EEI and, Dave, sorry about the Astros.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah. Well, better luck next year, right?  Operator  Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question."
"Just on with the current CapEx plan, you're obviously more levered to electric side of the business and the IRP in Indiana presents some additional upside beyond the ﬁve years for electric investment. Dave, do you have sort of a target mix for electric versus gas contribution? What's the timeline to achieve it especially as we're thinking about potentially further gas optimization funding, which seems to be a very sizable electric decarbonization plan?","Yeah, I think that if you set a step back and take a look at 50,000 -- the sort of 50,000 foot level, the stand and direction and strategy the company is to bias us toward the electric side of our business. Part of it is that coal transition certainly helps that because of the capital that it is going to absorb. And as we've said at our Analyst Day and we've said in some of our prior calls, we don't need equity to execute this 10-year plan, but if other opportunities did come up, we know the inherent value of the remaining gas LDCs. And I could look to them as a source of liquidity, but I think bottom line is we're biased toward electric and that is the way we will continue to drift. I'm not going to put a prediction out there as to what that ratio will be over time, but directionally, that's where we're headed."
"Got it. And then just lastly, obviously, a little bit behind on the CapEx as you highlighted in the prepared remarks, but still kind of targeting that $18 billion plus. Just I guess what are some of the governing factors to increasing the upside or bringing that $1 billion into the base plan that we discussed during the Analyst Day?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Well, I think it's a couple of things. One is just getting sort of ﬁnal resolution and clarity around the new tools in the tool box with respect to the Texas legislative process. We highlighted today the temporary generation, for instance, that we've moved very, very quickly on. Those kinds of things would absorb some of that additional billion-dollar in sort of contingent capital that we laid out on our Analyst Day. And the other just -- the other issue is going to be just ﬁndings suﬃcient crews and labor and parts and inventory and those kinds of things out there to accelerate it.  So, I think the message we tried to leave at Analyst Day is we have $18 billion plus to spend in the next ﬁve years, $40 billion plus to spend in the next 10 years. And we will spend that capital as fast as we can reasonably do so as long as it's consistent with certain rate pressures that we will have and to spend it eﬃciently. So again, we've got the wind at our back on many, many things and our capital spend opportunities is certainly one of those."
"Great. Thanks, and thank you for that. We'll see you guys soon. Appreciate it.","Okay, thanks.     Thanks.  Operator  Our next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Insoo."
"Good morning, Dave. Just ﬁrst question going back to Shar's question on the CapEx and a potential -- or I guess a delayed currently. I understand the reasoning for the year-to-date delay and how you're going to make that up, just when you look out currently at the current environment, does structurally are you seeing any concerns or challenges to get the current CapEx plan executed over the next couple of years, whether it is the labor shortages or just from a -- maybe from a cost standpoint, labor costs or other items that could potentially be a headwind?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","I mean -- look, I mean, just like pretty much every other company and management team in the U.S. were dealing with supply chain issues, upward pressure on labor costs, but I don't think that we have seen it to such an extent that we are going to say that we can't meet the capital plan. We have every intention and we have every conﬁdence we're going to meet the capital plan. We tried to give a little color to it with respect to that on the call today. We have moved aggressively to tie up more construction crews. We have expanded our vendor base in and around that area. One of the tools that we got in the new legislative processes, the ability to put long lead time items into inventory and into rate base.  So, we're looking at all of those. I think the sort of small slip and capital spend this year really was unrelated to any of that. It really was related to the storms that really pounded into Louisiana. And as all utilities do, we help each other when those situations arise. And we released a number of our crews that we're focused on capital, build for us to help the people in Louisiana get back on their feet. Those crews are now coming back. And as Jason said, we've got a short-term plan in place to catch up on that capital spend. But our longer-term view of tying up crews and making sure we have the long lead time items ordered give us a great deal of conﬁdence that the capital plan we have is and it's going to be achievable."
"Understood. And just quickly, this -- the other question I had was, as we think about the closing of the Midstream transaction, remind me, is there -- I know you've already priced up contingent sale of a portion of it, but is there a limit on how much you can sell in terms of the units at any given time?","I'll let my very good CFO, Jason, answer that question.     Insoo, thanks for the question. No, there is no direct limit. And we had talked about previously the need to register those units. Energy Transfer has already undertaken that eﬀort. So we are free to execute contingent for -- up until the close as we have done once the deal is closed. To the extent that we want to execute a marketed oﬀering, we have to obviously coordinate with Energy Transfer. We have full ﬂexibility to do that after the close of the transaction. And then similarly, we will have the ability to dribble the share. So, I think we're moving to a place of full control, no limitation on the number of units."
"Hey, good morning team. Sorry about the Astros there. I wanted to send my condolences as well here.","I'd tell you I didn't think this turn into burial of the Astros, but I appreciate the sentiments. There's always next year, remember that."
"We know they're close to your heart. There we go indeed. Listen, just wondering what's driving the conﬁdence still on the timeline for the ET deal here. Just -- I know you mentioned it here again, you mentioned at the Analyst Day, but maybe remind us where that process stands speciﬁcally with respect to FTC until they continue to put out their own headlines?","Hey, good morning, Julien. It's Jason here. Look, as we've said at Analyst Day, Energy Transfer Enable obviously taking the lead with this in the conversations with the FTC. We're clearly a very interested party and everything that we've observed just gives us conﬁdence that this deal will get close here in the fourth quarter. So, I don't think it's probably more of a direct question for Energy Transfer, for how those conversations are going by the day. But as I said, as we observe the progress, we continue to remain conﬁdent of a close here in Q4."
"Got it. All right, fair enough. And then on this alternate stabilization plan, can you talk a little bit more about the mechanics? Obviously, it's early here, but is there been any feedback so far with the proposal? Obviously, these are somewhat sensitive subject, so I'll let you respond accordingly.","Thanks, Julien. It's a really unique situation obviously in Minnesota with the incremental gas costs from winter storm Yuri, the fact that we've got a regular rate case scheduled there. And so while we ﬁled a typical rate case, we thought it was prudent to bring for what we've deemed in great stabilization plan. And I think we -- what it tries to do is build oﬀ of what was just a recent settlement of the last rate case ﬁled in Minnesota, so keeping similar terms on depreciation rates, cost of capital allows us to recover the capital that we will be spending over the next couple of years to improve the safety of our gas systems. It diﬀers a little bit of the amortization of some regulatory assets for things like COVID-related costs and some of the incremental O&M that we had anticipated. But we think it puts us in a really good position to continue to improve system safety with our capital investment plans while recognizing the rate impact and   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   trying to moderate that for our customers that are in Minnesota. And so early days in terms of the conversations with stakeholders, but we hope that it is seeing as constructive solution in the backdrop of what is a unique situation there in Minnesota."
"Got it. And last one, just super quick there. I heard you guys comment on the backup gen in Texas. But any updates on diﬀerences in Texas Transmission. Obviously the PCT [ph] seem to be moving fairly swiftly still here. Curious if there's anything to be said on that front as a function of reforms?","Yeah, I think maybe just to tease you a little bit. Yes, we're having some dialogue with them on additional transmission lines, but it's really too early to talk about any speciﬁcs on it."
"Hey, good morning, Jason. Just one for me. Just on the Indiana solar program, David, in your commentary, you mentioned 75/25 mix, 75 rate base, 25 PPA'd. Is that sort of what you're targeting going forward in your plans? And just curious as to how you got there in terms of the 75/25 mix.","I'll let Jason answer that.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Good morning, Durgesh. It's -- overall, as we look at this ﬁrst sort of part of our coal transition plan, we're targeting a 50/50 allocation that is 50% owned renewables, 50% contracted through PPAs for the renewable portion for the ﬁrst tranche of the coal transition. We had ﬁled originally, as you pointed out and as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, an initial tranche of solar that was 75% owned, 25% PPA. We then subsequently ﬁled in the third quarter this year for a 100% PPA solar projects. And so again, as you look through kind of each of these individual ﬁlings, we're targeting a 50-50 owned, contract target mix for renewables."
"Just had one kind of a broad question just on draft federal legislation. And as you look at that, I know that's subject to change and who knows what the ﬁnal version will look like. But I was thinking in particular about, I guess two elements. One will be a tax policy and impacts in terms of cash ﬂow, customer bills, et cetera. And then the other was just broad support for clean energy, whether that might change or enhance some of your resource plans and movement towards clean energy or accelerate some of your plans. So just curious what you're thinking there?","I'll -- let me take the ﬁrst crack at it and I'll have Jason can talk about the potential tax impact. But you're absolutely right. It's deﬁnitely a moving target right now and haven't been through many of these eﬀorts that wind [ph] our way through Washington, I learned a long time ago. You really -- you got to just sort of watch the process happen, but you don't want to do anything   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   sort of concrete until it is set along and then you can react to it. I think directionally from -- if you look at sort of the renewables and the ESG aspects of it, it's certainly supportive of the direction that we're going, but based on what we see right now, I don't see it accelerating or decelerating anything that we've got on plans. We have, as you know, set up an industry leading goal out there of net direct emissions to 0 by 2035. And I think that's a good plan. We're going to stick with it. That's the direction we're headed. We get some incremental help with what comes out at D.C., we'll take advantage of it. But it isn't going to bump us oﬀ course from the direction we're headed right now. Jason, do you want to talk about the tax aspect?     Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Stephen. From a tax standpoint, we are a federal cash tax payer. Right now, as you kind of cut through sort of our ﬁnancials, there's a lot of sort of one- time items as we've executed on this transition to a pure play regulated utility and we will continue to see that. As you kind of cut through that for us, we are -- our eﬀective tax rate from a cash tax standpoint is somewhere between 8% to 10%. So clearly a minimum tax of 15% would put a little bit of impact or headwind on the ﬁnancing plan.  We don't think it's certainly something that we can overcome. We don't think it's an impediment to the CapEx plan that we outlined and still feel like we can continue to maintain a strong balance sheet as we outline and deliver on our $40 billion capital investment plan. So early days, we'll follow it, probably not as big impact to us as maybe some of our peers, just given the fact that we have been a federal cash taxpayer, but obviously something we will continue to monitor."
