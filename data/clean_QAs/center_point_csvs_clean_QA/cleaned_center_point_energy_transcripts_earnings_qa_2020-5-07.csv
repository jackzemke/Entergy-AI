Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning. So just two questions here. First, starting sort of with that strategic level. You have obviously review processes in place now and as should we think about the range of outcomes that you've foreseen with this, could we get a little bit of a sense of core versus non-core, stronger jurisdictions versus maybe those that require a bit more work from your perspective? And sort of with an analyst they said, the sort of imply that an outright sale of the company is not part of this kind of internal review process. And I have a follow up.","Yeah. Yeah, I'll start with the last question. Yes, that's correct. This is a -- we have strong support for the business and the model we have now. And so what we're going to do is review those businesses to see where we can optimize those. And clearly our focus is on our utility businesses and we feel like all of our utility businesses have good regulatory compacts and we will always continue to look at how we improve those moving forward and the mechanisms for   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   recovery. But this will be a comprehensive view of all of our businesses. So that we can optimize those as a company moving forward."
"Got it. And then just lastly, you reiterated the utility guidance for 2020 in the 5% to 7% growth, which is very constructive. Could we get maybe a little bit more speciﬁc around the moving piece as maintaining these ﬁgures. There is a lot of moving pieces, i.e. call that COVID headwinds, is that entirely kind of oﬀset by corporate costs? What's implied with future cost cuts at the parent? What mitigates the dilution in the near term? So I'm just trying to get a bit of a sense on how all the drivers, kind of net out even as we think about beyond 2020? Thank you.","Okay I'll start. I'll start oﬀ. Is that, yes. -- I'll start out with 2020 and then Kristie can add to it, and then talk a little bit about moving forward. I mean, we took several steps that we announced back at the beginning of April. Some of them were more driven by credit, to make sure we have very solid credit metrics as we move through this year. And so reducing capital by $300 million helped us there, but we announced $40 million of O&M cuts as well, which we have good line of sight to as Kristie said about 60% of that.  So the combination of a good ﬁrst quarter, those O&M savings and the Cares Act that has the tax beneﬁt, Kristie can speak more to that, oﬀset the impact of our expected range on COVID-19 as well as the dilution as a result of the 1.4 of equity issuance. So those generally -- that group generally nets out for 2020. And then as we move forward, we have the beneﬁt of maintaining that $40 million of O&M savings as well as the fact that we hadn't anticipated raising about this amount of equity over the next three-year time period maybe slightly more already so that dilution from there is not as material as we move forward.  And then we have the announced dividend -- our dividend cut which gives us additional retained earnings. So it's really the combination of all of those that allow us to reiterate 2020 guidance and also reiterate rate-based growth and EPS growth of 5% to 7%. Kristie, would you like to add anything to that?     I think you covered it well."
Terriﬁc. Thanks guys. So much. Congrats on moving forward. And congrats on the deal with (inaudible) team. Congrats.,Thank you very much.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
"Thank you. My ﬁrst question is regarding just ﬁnancing. With the $1.4 billion rate that you guys did, how do you think about the buﬀer that you have or maybe the potential levers that you could pull in the hypothetical scenario that Enable needs to cut it's distribution, again?","Yeah. I'll start out ﬁrst on Enable and that is for the reasons I talked about when I went through my presentation, we looked at a number of scenarios and they were downside scenario, lower oil prices for longer. And when we made the decision the current distribution by 50% we felt very good that, that was the right level. And even though we have seen because of physical constraints some shut-ins, we've seen some positives too.  So we still remain conﬁdent in Enable's ability to maintain that 50% distribution and pull their own levers related to O&M and capital. So that's the starting point, but I'll let Kristie speak to the other part of our strengthening our balance sheet and how we look at that.     Yeah, I mean this transaction has strengthened our FFO to debt. And as John mentioned, we are not currently anticipating any cut in the distribution from Enable."
"Just in the scenario that may be something like that does happen in a very worst case scenario, are your conversations with Moody's, do you have a little bit more room on FFO to debt side to absorb some of that, additional impact?","Yeah, I think we would have conversations about the increased level of regulated percentage in our earnings and our business with the rating agencies at that point."
"Understood. And just one quick follow-up on the strategic review from a stand-alone CenterPoint's standpoint, is the strategy all equal still to try to tend towards that 90% utility earnings by 2024?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Well, that's the foundation we start on. And that's what we have seen really aligns with what we believe are our shareholders' interests. So that's the starting point, but we will comprehensively with that business review committee, evaluate the best options to further maximize shareholder value. So, yes. Yeah, that's the starting point."
Got it. Thank you and stay safe everyone.  Operator  Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
"Hi, good morning. I just want to make it clear. You guys are in that FFO to debt target range for 2020, you're starting oﬀ in that range as you go forward?",With the equity issuance we're a little higher. We're expecting to be a little higher than that in 2020 and then our long-term range is 14 to 14.5.
"Got it. And in terms of the COVID sensitivities. You had a -- it starts oﬀ with the pretty bad April but you're expecting to get better over the summer and then beyond that. Do you have any kind of a ballpark estimate of were seeing -- how much worse the $0.05 to $0.08 could get. Yes, let's say, for instance, the April downturn of 15% to 20% at least of the commercial and 10% to 15% industrial reduction. If that continued at that level for the rest of the year for instance? Where, how much more would it get?","Yeah. I can give you some general ballpark, but again our experience because of -- even though we had it reduced industrial we're not very sensitive because of the way the rates are designed on industrial, we're not very sensitive there. And the commercial downturn was in line with what we had expected and we saw positive on the residential side, both in Houston and in Indiana. So what we saw in April, was very much in line with what we had estimated. And then if you   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   extrapolate that out for the conditions we talked about through August, it was also in that $0.05 to $0.08, but clearly you can extrapolate that out. We don't anticipate that it will impact us through the full year, but you can extrapolate out of that $0.01 to $0.02 impact, four more months and that would be in line with what would happen should that scenario occur. Kristie, you want to add to that?"
"Okay. And maybe just one last question, if you could just maybe comment on the status of the oil and gas industry and your service territory and what's going on there? What your assumptions are for oil and gas reﬁning and drilling part of your customer base?","Yeah, I mean clearly Houston's economy is tied to the oil and gas business. The good news is less tied to that business over time, and we've seen Houston do very well through downturns in the past. I mean with robust growth of 2% plus, our customer count in good times and what we've seen is still stay positive even even through downturn. So we still expect very good market area there. But, yeah, we will monitor. It's too early to tell now, but we'll monitor what impact oil and gas downturn may have on our growth rate moving into next year and update you as we see more. At this point, as we set today we saw still good growth right up through the end of March on customer counts. We still see that we're connecting new developments and new areas so at this point we haven't seen that, but we will monitor closely."
"Okay, all right, thank you very much. A lot of hard work, getting done. Thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research LLC. Your line is now open.
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. And then I have one other follow-up question. Just in this business valuation review, obviously, the one non-utility business left is Enable and that Enable was reviewed by the company several years ago and in the end nothing really happened. Is it -- is there any reason to think that there might be more options or new options this time then three or four years ago?","Steve, I don't know at this point. Clearly, we reviewed it in great detail, looked at various options and concluded the path forward that we took back then made the most sense, but the business review committee will review options related to this. So, way too early to speculate though on whether other options could be identiﬁed or not."
"Good morning. So, you talked a lot about the cost savings of $40 million. As you continue to review, what do you think could be the potential upside to this number across your footprint?","And we are targeting $40 million of savings.     Yeah. And we're -- we feel very good about that number because as Kristie mentioned, we have line of sight directly, things we'd already worked on earlier this year related to our corporate structure and support services and some ITIS type costs that had been identiﬁed. Longer term, it really is a matter of looking at a all types of things, from how we use contractors and our contracts are very important to us, but what's the right approach there, supply chain, savings, use of technologies, other technologies, work management systems.  So we'll be digging into those issues in detail. Now that we've made the decisions and positioned the company now with ﬂexibility on strong balance sheet moving forward. So it's too early to say what the potential is. Right now, we're trying to ensure that we have certainty around the $40 million."
"And you talked about the moving parts in 2020. Utility EPS guidance, could you maybe provide a little more detail on the per share impact from the tax beneﬁt from Cares Act?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yes. In the ﬁrst quarter, we had a $19 million tax beneﬁt from the Cares Act, we also expect to have a future quarter beneﬁt in around a $10 million range to earnings also with favorable cash ﬂows."
"Okay. Absolutely. It's a pleasure, Wanted to follow-up on the outlook through '24 here. Can you comment speciﬁcally about expectations for earning year optimized returns? I know that obviously there is some gyrations in the current year related to COVID, but as you see achieving this ﬁve to seven just speciﬁcally within that kind of going back to the, where the ﬁrst questioner started what are your embedded earned returns? And how do you think about equity in that plant after '22 through '24? And then maybe implicit within this, just to make sure I'm squaring this away appropriately. Given that you have this equity issuance in the ﬁrst couple of years, is the plan back half weighted? Just to kind of think about the equity being able to fund some earnings there.","Yeah, actually. I'll start out with the equity piece and then comment on the returns, some of those issues. But actually, because of the dividend reduction down to targeting 50% to 55% on our regulated earnings. We have more retained earnings in those out years, so we issue an amount of equity through 2022 in the range of the $1.4 billion, which is pretty much in the range we had before, maybe slightly lower, but because of the rate retained earnings in the back side, the old forecast of 300 to 500 per year in that time period, actually there is lower pressure on   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   that now. We believe that will be less in the out years so we'll get the beneﬁt of of the things we've talked about, the O&M savings and the dividend cut.  So not back end loaded at all in fact more modest needs in the back end of the plan, which really helps with the 5% to 7% growth when we're issuing less equity out in those time periods and have the $40 million of O&M savings. And what we're targeting is very much in line with our allowed returns. If we look at Houston Electric we target very close to the 9.4% return on equity with that back cap structure and pretty similar in the other jurisdictions. Kristie, add to that if I have anything that I missed on that?     I think you covered it well."
"Okay. Then turning to the strategic side of things just real quickly. Perhaps clarifying your prior comments here. What is on the table, with respect to the strategic review? Just to ask it more explicitly and bluntly, if I may, you commented on Enable here, just want to perhaps make sure we're fully encompassing and understanding what is contemplated? And how do you think about this, again against the backdrop of having had processes in the past?","Yeah, I mean in the past, a lot of the processes that went on were eﬀective, they were more led by the management team. What we have now is a group, including two new directors, two existing directors or three if you count me, but the ﬁve with us will be looking at this. So it will be a Board level with that new set of experiences involved in at Board level and it will be comprehensive. We'll look at our businesses in total to make sure that we move forward in the most optimized way. So it's similar in some ways, but it has the changes I just talked about. So we're very, we're very encouraged by that. We think it's the right time to further optimize our business."
"Yeah. Just in terms of the plan. Just to clarify this, should we expect management updates and appointments prior to the conclusion of the process?","The plan right now and is clearly the committee, I think will function under its charters through October, and so a normal time that we made we'll talk about that would be in an Investor Day, early in 2021 that would be the base plan. But obviously if there is something that should be communicated before, that we would do that. But the normal schedule is what I ﬁrst laid out."
Right. So no updates to management in the interim either?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Well, should anything occur that we need to update you all on and make public we would do that, but the base plan is to take that amount of time and then be prepared to announce changes and direction certainly at the conclusion of that process, but surely anything happen that changes that we would obviously make public, as appropriate."
Got it. Excellent. Thank you all very much. Best of luck. Talk to you soon.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is now open."
"Good morning. Hopefully, one question, one follow up. I think a little oﬀ a Julien's question and more on the CEO search. Any update on the CEO search on timing of when we may ﬁnd out? How -- when the Board selects someone?","Yeah. I mean the very good news is that the committee has been working for a tight -- well, pretty much since we stood that committee up and they've been very, very rigorous around that. We have a search ﬁrm in place. They've identiﬁed the large number of candidates. They've conducted interviews with a number of candidates. And so we're now more on the backside of that search process. But until its the absolute right person is picked and we can make sure what the timing is on transition period, it's not done till it's done, but I feel good that a lot of good work has been done and we're on the back side of getting that taken care of."
"Great. And then lastly, just more ﬁne tuning, the $40 million of additional O&M cuts that company has identiﬁed in 2020 and I think you've answered this, maybe I missed it, are they more at the parent company, are they more at the operating utility company?","I'll start out, but, yeah, more than half of it that's been identiﬁed is more at the company level, more support services and some of those things as we look at the new mix and more utility focused. Some of those just ﬁt with how we looked at the support services moving forward. But   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   there will be some, some that each of our business units will develop as well. So there will be some, but a good percentage of them are at corporate level. Kristie add to that for me, please.     No, I think that's right. They'll be across the board, but again, over half we've identiﬁed our support level activities."
"So I just wanted to sort of follow up on the business review process. I mean last time on the fourth quarter, it sounded like you guys weren't really looking at necessarily that wider range of potential business combinations or what have you. We have the new investors with this investment what have you. Should we think that perhaps the business review is now perhaps about a wider range of potential options that almost anything could be on the table to enhance shareholder value?","Well, the way I look at it is the business review committee will really look at the business plans across all of our business and think through everything from appropriate regulatory strategies and breakthrough best ways to optimize and how businesses ﬁt together. So I mean that's something you do on a normal basis anyway. So it brings a fresh set of eyes with good experience with our new directors involved through the process. So I think it's in line with what a company normally would do, but with really good expertise, with the opportunities we have now to really take a fresh look at it. So it is diﬀerent, it's a very powerful process I think we can   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   follow and they will make recommendations to the Board for the Board to act on in the time period we talked about. So we think it's a good thing to do moving forward."
"Sure. But I guess I'm sort of wondering is, if there was the potential for a sale of the company or what have you, is there -- is that oﬀ the table I guess is what I'm saying. I mean in other words, would you guys be willing to look at anything that depending on obviously what it is and obviously what the standalone plan is and what your outlook is, should we think of is pretty much anything is on the table potentially as long as you guys see it is in shareholder value or are there certain things that you feel, hey, that just isn't in our game plan, so to speak?","Yeah. The starting point is truly looking at how our businesses are operating and how they function, optimizing those, making the right business decisions in total around the base of this great sort of utility assets. So that's the starting point. That's the focus. Every company has got to consider the other options that you've talked about. That's not where we're starting with this committee. This committee is designed to review, the go-forward plan as great set of utility assets and how to optimize those and conﬁgure those correctly moving forward."
"Okay, great. And then just ﬁnally on Indiana Electric, the write down, was that goodwill? I wasn't completely clear when you said the fair value, is that got anything to do with fair value accounting with respect to the rate base or anything or is that sort of a -- could you just elaborate a little bit further on what the impact is actually at the utility in terms of, if there is one, in terms of either equity or what have you at the utility level in terms of regulatory rate making what have you?","Yes, that was goodwill and it should not impact the regulated utility."
"Good morning. Just wanted to kind of build on some of the points that you touched on here. With regards to the FFO to debt trajectory, just want to see if something by chance moves against you here like Enable dividend cut or something like that, just want to see what levers you have left to pull at this point. Could that include kind of like more capex deferrals or just any thoughts you have there would be helpful?","Yeah. I'll start out. I mean one of the things we would do we, especially with the strength of our balance sheet now heading into that. Couple of things we do is work -- continue to work with the rating agencies going on and talk through the fact that our regulated versus unregulated the next would be enhanced if should that occur. Again, we feel good about Enable's distributions, but that would be where it would start. But clearly, we've taken some very positive steps we believe already, but clearly under those circumstances, we would look at other alternatives and the type that you mentioned would be things that would be evaluated, whether that's a little less capital or continuing to see if we can optimize O&M. We'd look at those as other possible ways that make sure we kept the best balance sheet moving forward. Kristie, add to that please.     I think that covered it pretty well."
Got it. Thanks for that. And just a follow up question with regards to COVID-19 here. Just when do you expect to have clarity on COVID deferrals for the remainder of your jurisdiction?,"Kristie. I mean my understanding is we have a large number, we have good line of sight on -- I mean are already taken care of. My understanding is most of our jurisdictions work to be addressing those issues in the near future. Does someone have a better time estimate on that?     Yeah. I was going to let Jason cover that.     Sure. Hey, this is Jason Ryan. Good morning. So the Oklahoma Commission voted to approve an accounting order earlier this morning. The Minnesota Commission is discussing that topic, I believe as we sit here right now. So I don't have an update on where they're headed, but they are looking at that. And we've been working with our industry colleagues and regulators in   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Indiana on this top end -- topic and expect to ﬁle an application seeking an accounting order either late this week or early next. So that would take care of all of our jurisdictions given that most of them have already active."
"Good morning. In the current guidance, 2020 guidance, utility contribution 88%, midstream 12%. Yeah, John, in the April 1 news release you anticipated utility earnings contribution increasing to nearly 100% over the next few years, that would imply to me that your preference and would realize you've got this the review board now. But your preference at that time was to probably either divest completely or partially Enable. Am I reading more into that quote than I should or is there something else going on that I don't understand?","Yeah, I mean. Eﬀectively what happened is, when we looked at the Enable distribution cut of 50% it was based on the fact that we expect a very little drilling activity to occur this year and heading into next year and is lower for longer period we're in. And so the results are, we took that proactive step on distribution cuts to really protect the liquidity of Enable, as they head into lower earnings in the next year and even moving a little further than that.  So just naturally, as those earnings go to where we expect under this no signiﬁcant drilling in some of those basins from time period I talked about that takes the earnings contribution from midstream down just naturally there. And then on top of that, we're continuing to invest heavily in our regulated business. So you have the positive of the regulated coming up and then just that normal trajectory that we anticipated when we cut distributions to 50% that will result in 95 plus percent, I think regulated earnings mix. Now Kristie, there may be a little bit more on that related to the impairment and how that impacts that, is that correct?     I mean there will be basis accretion as a result of these impairments. But we do still expect that the utility will grow to the 95% of the contribution.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Hi, good morning and congratulations. I think so the Board did a terriﬁc job and congratulations. I wanted to, as you mentioned a little bit, but it would really help, because the last thing left in this whole picture is the new CEO. Can you be a little bit more -- what timeframe? Of course, quicker the better, but do you have any speciﬁc date by which we can heard that announcement?","No, I think we feel positive about the fact that process is moved to this point, we have very good identiﬁed candidates. But as you know, until you ﬁnalize something and when you're looking for someone that's got a really strong track record on utility operations of these type businesses, understands that business, focus on strong balance sheet, we want to make sure, we take the time to absolutely get the right person.  But I feel very good about the individuals that are being talked to now. And so I think it can happen in a reasonably short time period, but until all of those issues are worked out, I'm sorry I can't more speciﬁcally commit to an exact time. But like I said, I feel good about that we've made really good progress to this point and that it can happen in a reasonably short time period moving forward."
"They go away. And then you also mentioned that we get some amortization beneﬁt, how much is that? And does that keeps on ongoing?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Amortization, referring to the basis accretion or?"
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Okay. I mean if...,And that primarily impacts the midstream or unregulated earnings.
"I understand, I understand, but I just wanted to make sure I have the accounting right. Thank you. Thank you so much.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
"I apologize if I missed it somewhere on the 8-K, but I was just wondering if you've disclosed what the terms of the convertibles were. I'm just trying to understand are you -- in your presentation for 2020 in the 5% to 7% growth rate are you assuming sort of as issued in the share count?","Yeah, I think, yes, between the 8-K and what we've posted on our website. I think that those terms and conditions are have been disclosed and had not have then ﬁled. So I think that's in there, but Kristie, would you take the other part of that question?      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes. As to the calculation of guidance we will treat the preferred as if it was common in the dilution calculation."
Okay. And so the 5% to 7% then would reﬂect that dilution through the forecast period.,Yes.     That's correct. And they do. There is a mandatory convert on those 12 months out.     Right.
I just wanted to be -- hey how are you? Just wanted to be clear on the equity needs. So total equity needs through 2022 are not necessarily diﬀerent from what you had previously? And you had the $300 million to $500 million in both '21 and '22 as you had mentioned. Is the idea that the bulk of that will now be met with new holdco debt issuance. So more of a timing shift or is it the O&M savings a dividend cut that essentially take care of that?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Yes. If the question in '23 and '24 we still will have some equity needs, but I would based upon what we're looking at now, anticipated plan we've estimated to be lower than the $300 million to $500 million range we estimated before. And Kristie, can you give more of -- more information on that?     I mean, that's correct. As you said, with the dividend cuts we did, and it is lower than anticipated in those years."
And typically are you going to -- So since today's announcement take care of equity need through '22. Did the '21 and '22 that you were going to issue is that going to be met with the new holdco debt issuance?,"Well, we issued $1.4 billion to today and our plan was to issue $800 million in 2020 and between $300 million and $500 million in '21 and '22. So at the midpoint of '21 and '22 that would have been $1.6 billion versus the $1.4 billion we're doing, so we've satisﬁed our needs upfront for these three years."
"Got it. And to be. Lastly, to be abundantly clear have you vetted to-date plan with the rating agencies?","Yes, we have been in contact with the rating agencies with regards to this plan, and we expect them to consider favorable."
