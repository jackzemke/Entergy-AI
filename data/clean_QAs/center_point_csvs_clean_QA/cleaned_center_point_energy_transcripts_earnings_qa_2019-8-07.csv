Question,Answer
"Good morning. Thank you. Maybe just starting write-oﬀ about, with the 2020 guidance appreciating all the diﬀerent levers and drivers that you'll need to go through to provide us with an update. But as of today, just given the prior guidance that was in place with a midpoint of 182, at least on the regulated side, are you able to conﬁrm that the regulated growth that you had embedded previously is still intact for 2020?","Insoo, good morning. This is Scott. As we said earlier, we're going to go through the whole exercise of updating our guidance through the process of planning, but as Xia pointed out, we are continuing to invest in our utilities and the utilities get their growth through investment and then subsequent recovery. So the growth potential for our utilities is still very, very much intact. But we're going to provide more clarity on exactly what that looks like as we complete this planning process."
"Understood. I guess, understanding that Enable or other non-regulated businesses, there may be more volatility associated with it, but I just didn't know if there were developments on the regulatory -- on the regulated side, since a few months ago that has made any changes to your - - to your assumptions?","No. That's not. We haven't -- As we've said, we have gone through the process. But as we sit here today, we still have the same issues and levers and opportunities facing that business as we did before.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Understood. And thank you for the slide on all the cash contributions coming from the various non-reg businesses, just when you look out into the capital plan over the next few years, is there an updated thought on the ﬁrst time you may need more meaningful equity?","Insoo, like Scott pointed out the capital program for the utility, we think for 2019 to 2023 will be consistent with what we disclosed before at our last 10-K, the timing of the -- the capital like Scott pointed out could move around within this 5-year window. So in terms of the 5-year equity issuance, we are not expecting a change at this time. The timing of it may be a slightly diﬀerent."
"Good morning, guys. One follow-up on the last question about 2020 guidance and the decision to maybe not reiterate that, you did reiterate the 5% to 7% growth oﬀ the 2018 base and the bottom end of that is a $1.76, so that would be kind of in line with your prior bottom end. I just wanted to make sure that your message is clear on that 5% to 7% growth rate over the long term, at least.",That is -- that is still very clear. Yes. Still very much intact.
"Okay. And then the decision to take the Enable sale oﬀ the table, I think is -- it's pretty clear and you articulated the rationale behind that in the comments, but maybe you could give us more detail on the timing choice as to why the decision was made yesterday and the idea that Enable is one of many businesses you have that are non-utility, how do you think about the rest of the businesses and their contribution to the portfolio, cash, or business risk and otherwise.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So from a timing standpoint, it's simply the result of us having completed an evaluation of our thinking about that ownership and it just culminated following some discussions with our Board and we chose Monday to disclose that following those discussions with our Board. So that's the only -- the only thing that went into the timing and it was really driven by, as I said earlier, the post merger environment given where we sit today with our capital requirements, given what Enable has done to de-risk their business observing the consistency of the cash ﬂows, and of course as we know the markets aren't really constructive for unit sales, so it all fell together for us to make this change and communicate the value of the cash ﬂow that Enable brings to our -- to our capital needs.  I think your second -- remind me of your second question, if you would."
"Maybe just kind of the broader picture with the contribution of the other non-regulated businesses to the company cash ﬂow and business risk, how you think about them?","So we look at them as a source of cash. As Xia noted earlier, their EBITDA exceeds their capital requirements. So we look at them as a source of cash for funding. There is more risk in those businesses certainly than the utilities. But we look to operate those in a way where we can mitigate those risks. We do see the value there being the cash."
Okay. So I guess no change from prior in terms of those businesses being core to the company.,"We -- as I said earlier, we appreciate and enjoy realizing the cash that comes oﬀ of them, but we constantly have to challenge ourselves to think about ways each of our businesses can create more shareholder value. It's just part of our process and a great example is exactly what we did with our Enable evaluation and the decision we made around keeping those units."
"Okay. And then just one clariﬁcation, kind of within this line of questioning, your prior or I guess current guidance still is that you don't need equity this year or next. Remind me if selling Enable shares was part of that or selling Enable shares was part of your funding plan over the long- term kind of discreetly.","Yeah. Selling Enable units was deﬁnitely a part of -- in the mix and that's why we were actively out there saying that, that was one of the strategic options for us. So now we've made a decision to keep Enable and the Midstream investment. So as I've said before, I think the equity needs will be driven by -- primarily by the timing of capital. As example, for the ﬁve-year   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   window between 2019 and 2023, if we see Houston Electric or the natural gas utilities needing more capital, more front-ended that potentially could advance the equity issuance, but because the total capital we -- right now what we know today is not projected to be diﬀerent for the ﬁve- year window. I think from an overall standpoint, the timing of the equity could be diﬀerent, but the overall ﬁve-year impact should be the same or similar."
"Okay. That's clear. And from that in the current plans that you have, there is no equity needs in '19 or '20.","Unless we -- as I said before, unless we realize -- we are in the process of updating the details of the capital needs. Unless Houston Electric ﬁnds additional capital needs that we would need to found it sooner than before, then we might consider turning on DRIP or other options in the near term, but we don't know that yet. We're going through the planning process right now."
"Good Morning. First question, just looking at the current year. Scott or Xia, as you point out you've changed again, your Energy Services expectations now and rather than it being ﬂat, it will be down about $0.04 year-over-year. Can you highlight or remind us what is the oﬀset to that $0.04 hit that keeps you in your range for this year?","Absolutely. You see on our EPS walk for the year 2019, we expect $0.62 from our utility, $0.62 increase compared to the same period -- to 2018. So in other words, our utilities, we expect the utility to oﬀset the CES, we also have some favorable income tax expense items. So we are maintaining the midpoint of $1.65 despite of the $0.04 decrease expected from CES.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"So just to clarify that Xia, so are you saying that the tax beneﬁt perhaps was not factored into your previous budget or that the utilities are going to do better than what you were anticipating. I'm just trying to reconcile how (multiple speakers)","Yeah -- so if you look at the second quarter, so quarter 2019 versus second quarter 2018, we had $0.05 of positive variance and that's comprised of that our utility performance and a little bit higher income tax, favorable income tax, so that was not planned. But some of the tax items that you were aware of that we recorded last year, we did plan those. So there are some positive income tax variances that we didn't plan."
"I see. And my second question again a clariﬁcation. Again, Xia, you walked through some of the drivers that will inﬂuence the 2020 outlook Houston Electric rate case, some costs, et cetera. So in summary, just to benchmark it for all of us, is there a -- pressure is to probably put a little downward headwind to the 2020 that you were looking at a few months ago, or does it not changed that, does it move with slightly higher, can you just calibrate this so we have a better sense of framework of how 2020 is shaping up today versus last quarter?","We are not ready to comment on the 2020. We're going through the normal planning process. We want to build a bottom-up plan that incorporates all the newly acquired jurisdictions to really go through a disciplined process to give you a clear picture about 2020. So we need time to do that. As Scott iterated just now, we do expect strong utility capital investment program, we do have -- we're laser focused on O&M management. So the business fundamentals are still the same, but we need to go through the process. We need to hear Enable's 2020 guidance and all of that is to lead us to want to take a pause and really, let's say normal process do its work and give you a guidance on the fourth quarter call."
"Right. And just to clarify that, again, is there anything you heard or seen at Enable today that is looking diﬀerent than what you were assuming when you laid the 2020 guidance out for us originally?",We're not comment on Enable. The one thing you didn't -- you didn't know is we took the lower end of the guidance range to develop our 2019 EPS walk.
"And so -- good morning. So a lot of little cleanup items here from the last two questions. Maybe just kicking things up, can you just aﬃrm you have obviously put the 5-year CAGR out there, once more. Can you kind of give us a sense -- is the individual each year throughout that 5-year is still intact, maybe this is another way to reconcile the '20 guidance.","Julien, I think you were breaking up a little bit there, but could you just restate your question?"
"Is the 5-year CAGR, do you think about each of the individual years implied from that compounding growth factor still intact with respect to each of the individual discrete years?","Well, Julien, probably the best way to answer this is when we're looking at the 5-year plan, the focus is on the eﬀects of investment over a longer period of time, getting out to the end, what the actual impacts are for a given year and in particular, as we think about 2020 is going to really become clear as we complete this planning process. So while we've got conﬁdence in our CAGR, I would say that what we -- what this planning process needs to do is really zero-in on what our 2020 number looks like as we build it up from a combined company perspective as opposed to the way we had been building it up, which was based on a prior plan and making adjustments to the prior plan.  So it's -- I don't want to get out in front of my answer on 2020. But I do know -- I can tell you that as we think about the performance of our business on an annual basis, it's still very much driven   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   very heavily by the investments we make in our utilities and the recovery of those investments."
"Got it. Excellent. And then following up here on the CapEx, you talked about, remaining impact with respect to the 10-K from 2018, does that assume no Vectren electric generation spend through '23, you obviously caveat that the timing might be post 2023 and then separately, we understand coal ash is perhaps a relevant factor here in the state as well. I suppose, with respect to both generation, and coal ash, if there is indeed the RFP executed according to plan, could we see either of those items put back and would that be incremental to the 10-K at that point?","We are assuming -- we are not -- we don't want to get ahead of the process, the IRP process. The team is working very hard on the ground to work with the stakeholders for solutions. But we would expect some spending through 2023 related to the IRP. It probably would not be to the amount that we originally shared with you, but we also know that the pipeline replacement program requires additional capital. We also know that the system modernization program at CEHE requires more capital. So I would say that overall -- from an overall standpoint, you would look at the 5-year as is, it will be very similar from what you had before."
"And then quickly on the utility side, what are the prospects for settlement at this point given where we stand in the case especially turning into September?","Julien, there is always an opportunity for settlement in these cases. I would say at the moment that conversations are being had, but they're not overly active, so we'll still have time between now and when the commission meets to pursue one. I don't know how to handicap it, I can't say that settlements have occurred in the state before, but there are also many cases where the rate case has actually gone to the Commission for decision. So tough to handicap this one, but I don't want to say that settlement is oﬀ the table."
"Got it. Great. And sorry last quick clariﬁcation, integrating the technology systems, that's a diﬀerent set of assumptions in the synergy assumptions you initially articulated and I think we reiterated today of $75 million to $100 million?","Yeah. The systems that we talked about the systems integration work is more in line of the cost to achieve dollars, that would be spent. So those are what I'll say cost to achieve dollars and they are not going to impact the $75 million to $100 million of savings that we have planned for 2020.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys.",Okay.  Operator  Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi. Good morning. A lot of questions have been answered, but on system integration costs, would you say that those are weighted in any kind of way between 2019 and 2020, is it more -- or is it evenly spread over the 2 years?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We're in the process of ﬁnalizing the estimate on the integration costs. I think we have a appendix slide in the earnings deck that we describe the details of the year to date spend and the year-to-date roughly we have spent $150 million and so we will continue to expect a similar range we previously disclosed with you, the timing of it, depending on the system integration costs estimation process could be slightly diﬀerent from prior. But the total amount should be relatively the same, very similar."
And I'm just trying to get a sense of how the timing might be changing and whether that's a signiﬁcant source of uncertainty in the 2020 number that caused you to pull the guidance from for that year?,"It wasn't -- I think we wanted to go through -- again, go through the rigorous process to build up the plan and to have visibility about the variability, the factors we described. One thing we are thinking about is if the integration process goes beyond 2020, how should we treat the cost to achieve and within our outside of the guidance range."
"All right. So I mean factoring my question would be whether it might be more appropriate to exclude them, but I mean if they do continue past 2020, then you might consider including them, I guess, but they're already being included.","Yeah. I think you said it very well. If they do past 2020, the likelihood is that we would exclude it from guidance going forward."
"I see. So longer they last, the more likely you might be to exclude it, and that would include 2020 as well?",Correct.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"Okay. I just wanted to kind of like clarify. And then, Enable said that they're going to take the write-oﬀ, I guess in the fourth quarter, right? So then the lower Enable's guidance that you have for the second half, is that primarily in the fourth quarter, as we look into the third and fourth quarter?","I don't have the quarterly breakdown, it's projected to be for the year, $0.06, you know year-to- date and they are positive to, so for the second half of the year, we have $0.08 downside compared to the same period of last year. For the full year, it's $0.06 down."
"Just wanted to follow up on Enable a little bit. You mentioned the sort of the enhancements that you see in terms of its de-risking and its increase in the distributions everything but what sort of is left out is sort of the valuation, which as you know, it's gone down a bit and I'm just sort of wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on sort of how you guys look at Enable through longer-term here and how the actual -- the valuation of the company has in any way inﬂuenced it or the ability to actually getting out of it and what have you. Just how should we think about that?","So just a couple of thoughts. One, clearly the valuation issues that the sector is seeing is a factor in terms of the ability to sell those units without incredible tax leakage and therefore a very non- value creating transaction for shareholders. So the market clearly has made the idea of selling something more challenging, but the fundamental issue for us was just one around given where Enable sits today and its ﬁnancial health and how they've de-risked their business, their ability to continue to provide cash to us that we use for investment, we feel better about today perhaps than we did years ago. So with their change in their coverage ratios and with their some of the shifts in their contracting and some things that they've done to de-risk their business and knowing that they made it through the more severe downturn years ago without having to cut distributions, we see the real value of Enable being as a source of cash for our capital needs?"
"Okay. So we shouldn't think about perhaps that changing much even if there is a signiﬁcant change in valuation. Is that correct? Obviously there is, at some point, you guys will sell anything, I assume, but just -- but outside of that sort of a huge change we really shouldn't think of you guys making much of a change in your own, is that correct?","That is correct. We went through a -- we went through an analysis, we spent time as management team, certainly with our Board around our position on this and have arrived at the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   conclusion that we believe it's more valuable now to keep and utilize the cash ﬂows than it is to sell."
"Okay. And then just on the Vectren legacy, non-reg stuﬀ or yeah non-reg stuﬀ, how should we think about what your experience has been so far in those businesses, your ability to integrate them and what have you and what's your outlook for them is, is it the same as it was during when you guys announced the merger and just, you guys have had more time to sort of kick the tires here and what have you -- any thoughts about how the composition of that might change or just how the performance of that the outlook for that going forward?","Yeah. Our view on the business hasn't really changed. We've got a good quality management team that came over with the acquisition, the management team over there knows this business well and operates it extremely well. They have, as you've noted, increased their business. So their business performance this year is anticipated to be better than last year and that's as a result of expanding both their distribution business and some of their transmission business continue to see strong demand for that type of work out in the market. So as we sit here today, we see that as a business that has good fundamentals to keep -- to keep driving its performance."
Okay. Great. Thanks so much. My other questions were answered. Thank you.,Okay. Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
"Good morning. Slide 14. So you're -- the three bullet points at the bottom, you're taking CapEx from Indiana Electric and I would assume most of that would have been subject to a traditional rate base, you're pushing it to natural gas distribution pipe replacement and grid mod at Houston Electric, a lot of that is covered by rate track or at least more regularly scheduled type rate adjustments without going through a full-blown rate case. I would think on that CapEx piece, that piece you should have some pretty good clarity. Am I correct or am I missing something?",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Clarity with respect to the additional dollar amount or clarity with respect to how we would recover the investments?
Recover the investment in earnings power?,You are correct. We do have clarity on that. That's right.
"Okay. So then another question on Slide 14, you list the customer growth for Houston Electric, customer growth for natural gas distribution. Do you have some stat, what kind of customer growth you're experiencing at Indiana Electric going back a year ago when Vectren owned it?","They stay pretty ﬂat, but is a very small portion of our total customer accounts, it accounts for 145,000 customers for the entire Indiana Electric."
