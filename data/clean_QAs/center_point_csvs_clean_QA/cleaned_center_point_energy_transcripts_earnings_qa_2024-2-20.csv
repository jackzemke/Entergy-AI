Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, team. A lot to unpack there. If I could just start, Jason, you gave prepared remarks. I think you gave three points about the sale. And one of them was about looking at states where you have combined electric and gas assets for a larger presence. If I then connect that with Slide 16, I'd like to talk more about some of the other gas assets where they're not overlapping to the electric system. Is that also a potential use of proceeds going forward?","Good morning, Anthony. I appreciate the question. Look, I think, we've got a proven track record here where we look to fund our industry-leading growth plan as eﬃciently as possible. This will be the fourth transaction over the last three years doing that.  As it relates to the remaining composition after we close the sale of Louisiana and Mississippi, we're really pleased with the states we have the privilege to serve. I think we pointed out we have a bias on a dual-fuel basis, but we also have a bias where we have presence and so we're really happy with the remainder of the portfolio.  I'll just say that we'll continue to look to fund this growth as eﬃciently as possible, as we've proven over the last few years."
"And then, my tax accounting skills are very weak, so I apologize. Should I think of the incremental $250 million a year plus the proceeds you have from this transaction coupled with, I think, the maturity of the ZENS in 2029, that your annual cash tax bill will increase from now, through the plan, or does your cash tax bill decrease and this additional equity or equity-like proceeds are more for CapEx?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Sure. Anthony, good morning. It's Chris. I think the simple way to think about it is we've consistently been a cash taxpayer for a number of years. The way I would think about these kind of coming together is you have ZENS out in 2029, but the interesting attribute of the corporate Alt Min Tax is that it actually allows us to reduce that exposure over time. And so, as you look at the diﬀerent pieces, you'll have the equity component today, you'll have the proceeds from the sale, and oﬀsetting those would be the combination of the Alt Min Tax, at least at this point, forecasted impacts, again, because that's not ﬁnalized, as well as the increased CapEx that we highlighted today."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a great quarter.,"Thanks, Anthony.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open."
"Yes, thank you, and congrats on the sale announcement. So just a follow-up on the question on the taxes. Chris or Jason, do you have a sense of kind of roughly how much cash tax you'd be paying a year, let's say, $24 million, $25 million, or just something that we can use for that?","Sure, Steve. Morning. I'll just be rough here. It's roughly $150 million a year as we look at the period from '24 really through 2030. If you just step back, maybe I can help paint the sources and uses for you, Steve, if that helps, just to hit it on the nose. You've got -- at the highest order, what we announced today is you've got the fact that we've already invested in the capital, which we replaced the $700 million of rate base associated with the gas LDCs. We did that while maintaining the upward[ph]of debt cushion and the earnings guidance unchanged.  So, as you look at the sources themselves, we've got from '25 to 2030 is the time period I think about. You've got $250 million per year from the equity piece, you've got the -- that gets you to $1.5 billion. Then you've likely got the ATM issuance or equity-like proceeds, right, which is what that comes from. And so, ultimately, just to put that in perspective, at that amount, at that equity, that's less than 1.5% of our market cap per year.  And on the uses side, you've got a roughly similar amount there, right? So similar, or just shy of about $1 billion through 2030 for the projected Corp Alt Min Tax impact, and then the incremental $500 million of growth CapEx that we talked about today. So that gives us a good amount of comfort that we can really deliver the plan for the long-term, fold in potentially some additional capital over time, and proactively position the balance sheet. And so, I think in the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   end, I think we all know that the Corp Alt Min Tax piece isn't ﬁnalized yet. I think that's something that we're all watching. But this is just the essence of us trying to plan conservatively going forward."
"Okay. And just on the Alt Min Tax, is that mainly kind of we should watch the things we've been watching for the industry like the repair deduction and things like that could aﬀect whether that ends up being what you're projecting or not?","That's accurate, Steve. I would think about depending on where the repairs piece lands that could actually lessen the impact here that we're talking about this morning, related to the Corp Min Tax."
"Okay. Great. And then, I know, Jason, you went through all the rate cases, appreciate that. Just curious your thoughts on the new share of the Texas PUC.","Yes. Thanks, Steve. We've got a long history of working with Chairman Gleeson. He stepped in the role of Executive Director, kind of after Winter Storm Uri. And we have tackled a number of issues here in Texas with him, particularly, I'll think back to the last legislative session here this past year and the work that we did around cost of capital and cap structure from a legislative basis. But I think it's a real opportunity for us to continue to leverage that relationship that we built. I was in with Chairman Gleeson in December prior to the announcement, as I stepped in currently in this role. So we'll maintain a really good relationship there.  But I think, Steve, stepping back, I want to provide a little bit of context about how we're positioning all of these rate cases. I think what may be not understood as well as possible is that last year, we increased revenues in our Houston Electric business by about $300 million through settlements. And as we continue to look forward, we're anticipating a relatively ﬂat revenue requirement. Request in this upcoming Houston Electric rate case, and we'll continue to work with parties constructively to resolve it. And so, I think it's continuing to maintain strong relationships with the commissioners, but equally continuing to work constructively with all parties in the cases."
"Just following up on the sale announcement, how are you thinking about the timing of reinvestments and use of proceeds as we just think about the potential accretion versus the plan? And do you anticipate this will create more investment capacity versus the 14% metric you highlighted for '23?","Yes, thanks, Constantine. I think what's important here is we're working oﬀ our front foot. We, as we talked about, increased the 2023 CapEx spend about $700 million for critical investments for our customers. That is basically enabling us to put those investments in rates at the same time that we anticipate closing on this sale in early 2025. So eﬀectively, we've pre-funded the loss of rate base. So I think about these proceeds as eﬀectively paying oﬀ what has been pre- funded, enhancing the balance sheet, and putting us in a position of continued strength moving forward."
"Excellent. That makes sense. And do you have any thoughts on the cadence of future updates, especially as you look to optimize around Texas' resiliency, just would you look at any kind of periodic updates or what to expect?","Yes. No, thanks for the question. As you -- hopefully appreciate at this point, I think we're building a track record of consistent updates throughout the year. I don't think we're going to be, the management team, that waits kind of annually for a cycle. As we have news, we'll share it. And we're constantly looking at enhancing a plan and have built that track record of continuous updates quarter-after-quarter.  I think stepping back more broadly, though, I think as we get to the other side of these rate cases in '25, I look forward to hosting another Investor Day where at that point, we will likely put forward a new 10-year plan into the mid-2030s, just reﬂecting our long-term conﬁdence in the growth that we have here at CenterPoint. And so, expect periodic updates in between now and then. And then on the other side of these rate cases, a much more comprehensive update underpinning the long-term growth that we have in front of us.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Wonderful. Looking forward to it. And maybe just one last cleanup question following up on the regulatory side. Any lessons learned in the active cases, especially as you're considering the Houston ﬁling now in March, and any thoughts on settlement prospects or partial settlement of issues?","A little fun fact on this Houston Electric rate case that as we are putting the ﬁnal touches on the ﬁling, it'll be the smallest revenue requirement increase requested in the history of CenterPoint or its predecessor companies back to 1975. And so, I think it's really --I think reﬂective of the hard work that we're doing to maintain aﬀordable service for our customers despite signiﬁcant increases in improving system resiliency and reliability. So, in that way, I hope we're putting forward, and I think we are a very constructive revenue requirement increase.  As I look forward on that procedural schedule, there's the possibility of potentially settling a Houston Electric rate case sometime mid-summer, kind of in between intervener testimony and hearings. But again, I think our focus is on ﬁling a compelling case for all stakeholders and then working constructively through that process."
Excellent. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking the questions today. Take care team.,"Thanks, Constantine.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open."
"Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for giving me time. Can I just quickly clarify the rate base number on the two gas LDCs that we're selling? Is it $700 million or $800 million?","It was roughly $800 million of rate base that we have invested in Louisiana and Mississippi. The $700 million is what we increased our capital expenditure plan in 2023, eﬀectively pre-funding the anticipated rate base that will go with that sale of Louisiana and Mississippi."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. Thanks so much. And then maybe just as we think about future capital raises, Jason and/or Chris, what's the cadence of equity -- potential funding to equity in future capital raises here as we look to out years?","Sure, Durgesh. And we're going to be consistent here with where we have been and that is as we look at the potential for incremental growth CapEx opportunities. You should think about them funding -- us funding them in line with our regulated cap structure. So again, just directionally about 50-50 there.  And again, as we look even just here in the Houston area, we continue to see really growth on all fronts, the residential side, including housing starts increasing year-over-year, and then substantial opportunities as it relates to the industrial side. In particular, most recently, you probably have seen that the Department of Energy identiﬁed a series of hydrogen hubs across the country. No surprise that one of those is here in Houston.  And really what's compelling about it is, is not only the opportunities that it presents for economic growth for the communities and overall load growth, but the fact that it creates permanent jobs, right, to the tune of over 30,000 to 35,000 jobs is what they've identiﬁed there. So that's really the type of growth that we're excited about there, and it could be hydrogen, it could be residential, it could be small and medium business. We're really just appreciative of the community that we have the privilege to serve."
"I appreciate that color. Thank you very much. And I apologize, but just one last one. The $115 million a year in cash taxes, Chris, that you alluded to, was that incremental or higher cash taxes payments versus your previous plan, or is that inclusive of this whole new AMT? Is that a total amount, or is that just the incremental amount?","I would think about that, Durgesh, as the incremental amount.     So, Durgesh, just a little bit of color around this. As we've talked about, CenterPoint has historically been a federal cash taxpayer. The last couple years, we talked about adopting the repairs tax and really minimizing that bill, right about the time that our cash taxes would be coming down, it's right about the time it will be subject to the mid-tax. And so think about this as kind of incremental as we had worked down that federal cash tax payment position."
Got it. Thanks so much. I appreciate the time again.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
"So, I can ask you a question about the, I guess, the new ﬁling and the new resiliency ﬁling in Texas under the new law, right? So you already have most of your CapEx in Texas recovered through contemporaneous mechanisms. So what kind of an impact do you anticipate from, I guess, separating some part of your capital there into this resiliency trackers potentially?","Yes. Thanks for the question, Sophie. I wouldn't necessarily think about this resiliency ﬁling as changing the mechanism of recovery. I think we'll continue to pursue the constructive distribution and transmission capital trackers that we have currently. I think the real beneﬁt, outside of really putting forward a three-year plan that will look at the cost-beneﬁt analysis of these investments to make sure that we're prudently investing on behalf of our customers. The real beneﬁt ﬁnancially is that the distribution capital that is subject to that approved three-year plan. Eﬀectively, we will minimize regulatory lag associated with that investment. That regulatory lag is eﬀectively when we put that capital into service, we begin depreciating it, we begin to record interest in taxes on it. Those amounts today fall to the bottom line in the form of regulatory lag before the capital is put into rates.  As we look forward now, we have the opportunity to defer those post and service carrying costs until we start collecting the capital investment in rates. The way that I think about this from a rule-of-thumb standpoint is about every $300 million of eligible distribution capital is worth about $0.01 of savings in terms of regulatory lag. And so think about this less as a new mechanism for recovery and more about helping minimize regulatory lag on our system investment."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. That is super helpful. Thank you. And then another question was on the capital plan increase, right? The incremental $4 billion that you guys are showing. Should we think about this as more or less like a ratable increase over the 10 years, like over the remainder of the plan rather, or is there some shape to it?","Sure thing. Hi, Sophie. I think it's fairly ratable. I think maybe a couple of the exceptions relate speciﬁcally to a few things that we're looking at in Indiana in particular related to some generation projects there. Those tend to be just inherently a little bit larger as we work those into the plan. But otherwise, really across the plan, I think the thing to emphasize here is we don't -- there's no real big bets that we're looking at here. This is very straightforward, just base utility CapEx that we're looking at."
"Hey, excellent. So, I just wanted to close this out, if you don't mind, on the next quarter here as we think about the multi-year resiliency ﬁling that you're going to be coming forward with. I just want to clarify this. We've talked a lot about the ATM, the $250 million here. We've talked about the asset sales. How do you think about, especially the asset sales side of this, eﬀectively pre- funding any portion of that resiliency plan to come here in the next quarter? Just want to really clarify how much incremental equity could be coming as part of a yet higher CapEx number associated with a fully dispositive resiliency ﬁling?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes, Julien, thanks for the question. I mean, I think what we're trying to do is lay out kind of the pieces here. We've been investing, as you know, in improved resiliency for the community here in Houston over the last couple of years, starting with kind of resiliency now, and part of the $700 million that we increased our CapEx plan last year in 2023 by were investments directly attributable to improving system resiliency. And then as well, when you think about this transaction, there's the approximate billion dollars in after-tax proceeds, which really helps fund that pre-investment that I've been speaking about.  But the other opportunity that I want to stress is, in our previous 10-year capital plan ending 2030, we had about $1 billion of incremental investment earmarked for Louisiana and Mississippi. Upon closure of those, we'll obviously continue to invest through the close of the sale, but after that sale closes, we'll be able to take that billion that we had allocated to Louisiana and Mississippi and redeploy back here largely into Houston Electric for resiliency programs.  So there's an opportunity there to get the improved recovery that I just mentioned in my answer to Sophie. I think there's also the opportunity, we were under-earning in Louisiana and Mississippi, so by redeploying that capital back in Houston Electric, redeploying it in a jurisdiction where you have a higher earned return, so there's that kind of enhancement. So I wouldn't necessarily look at this as incremental equity coming out of this resiliency ﬁling. This is, again, ways to support the pre-funding, the increases that we've seen, as well as reallocating capital to support those programs and enhancing our long-term EPS growth plan."
"Got it. Excellent. And I know you commented on the Houston Electric ability to settle here, but the gas side of it, assume the same, in terms of broad sentiments, maybe you can speak to that a little bit more on timing, too.","Yes, no, thank you for that question. We've got our third settlement conference in the Texas gas rate case here at the end of the month in February. That was a -- what we believe is a relatively modest rate increase, and as we've talked about in the past, a number of customer classes are experiencing a signiﬁcant rate decrease. And so, we're optimistic that given the constructive nature of the request that we can kind of ﬁnd a settlement.  To the extent that we can't, we would anticipate a decision in that case probably mid-summer this year. So, we'll continue working the settlement front according to that settlement schedule, and then as I said, we have the opportunity with the Houston Electric rate case sometime mid- summer to potentially settle that as well."
"All right. Excellent. All right, best of luck guys. We'll speak next quarter. Cheers.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Thanks, Julien.     Thank you.     Great. Operator, with that, that will conclude our Q&A for today's call.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call.
