Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys. Just a quick one, Scott, I think you expected to give an update on your decision on direction with Enable on the Second Quarter call. Did you mean the call that will take place in the Second Quarter or the actual reporting of the Second Quarter earnings in Q3?","It would be the reporting of the Second Quarter earnings in Q3. We anticipate the exercise would be virtually completed or essentially completed by the Second Quarter. But our ﬁrst opportunity to discuss it would be in the Third Quarter call -- or the Second Quarter call, sorry."
"Sorry about that. I just wanted to clarify.  Then could you also just talk about how you've thought about Enable in making the statement on 2018 growing at the high-end oﬀ of whatever you earn in 2017? Does that contemplate current status or do you think you could be there, in an exit scenario what should we take from that?","Yes, Jonathan, we assumed that the performance of Enable continues to be strong. But we did do some testing of various performance levels of Enable and have concluded that under a number of growth scenarios for Enable, including very modest growth, we would still be able to achieve that."
"Do you think you'd be able to achieve that if you no longer held the position for 2018? Should we assume that, too?",Well I think under that scenario you've got a very diﬀerent picture to look at. But as I told you to the extent that we move forward with an opportunity around the transaction our objectives were to maintain comparable earnings and dividend.
"Hey Scott, Bill, how are you? So ﬁrst, just a technical question, what was the year-end tax basis for Enable?","Steve, I'm looking at Bill. I think he is trying to ﬁnd that number at the moment."
"Okay. And maybe in the meantime, just in terms of just thinking about what you are going to know by the Second Quarter versus what you know now, I mean I don't know if tax reform is something that you need to know for things like the spin, or I guess I'm just a little confused like why hasn't something happened now and what are things that could happen in the next quarter or two that suddenly you know you will have an answer by then?","It's not connected to clarity around tax policy. This is just the ongoing dialogue we've been having with parties and our estimate of when we believe that would come to an end. It has nothing to do with tax.  In fact, as we've mentioned this review is really around trying to address the volatility of earnings. And we are going to conclude this even without having clarity on what the future tax policy may look like."
"Okay. Then I guess Bill, do you have the Enable answer?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   I have that, Steve. That's within our footnote on income taxes and the best way to think about it is the deferred tax liability is $1.38 billion. And the other piece of data you need on that is where we record the investment in Enable, that's in our assets on our balance sheet and that's the equivalent of $10.71 a share at year-end."
"Okay. Then just when you look at the plan for 2017 or 2018, can you give us a sense of where your earned returns are and just make sure comfort that those are going to be okay? I don't think you need to as part of your reviews like DCRF or TCOS or whatever, there is no real review of returns, right?","Yes, Steve, the mechanism that has a return review would DCRF. So we cannot make a DCRF ﬁling if we are earning over our authorized return per our EMR that we ﬁle.  That's the one that has the structured limitation to it. That said we do anticipate ﬁling DCRF this year.     And Steve, our expected return on equity within the equity calculation for rate base would be within 25 basis points to 100 basis points less than our allowed return, depending upon the entity."
"Good morning, guys. Just to conﬁrm, your growth guidance, your trajectory for 2018 doesn't assume any sort of tax policy changes including some of the accretion that you may anticipate. Then when you think about longer-term growth how we should think about that when you've got a front-end loaded CapEx picture as far as on the electric side how we should think about the trajectory a little bit further out?","I will answer the ﬁrst part of that. I will ask Bill to comment on the second. The ﬁrst part is no, we do not assume as we look to 2017 or 2018 forecasted or projected targeted growth performance that there's any form of change in tax policy.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Bill, do you want to comment on the second part of that?     With respect to longer-term growth I think your anchor point should be the rate of race-based grossed. And we would expect earnings contribution to grow approximately 1% less than that."
"Okay, that's helpful. And sorry if I missed this. But what was the O&M guidance for the gas business for 2017. And then when you look at the utility in general how we should think about cost inﬂation through your ﬁve-year plan?","We remain committed to managing O&M in a very disciplined way. And so that will be approximately 2%, perhaps slightly above that in some years given the activity around pipeline integrity expenses. But we will do everything we can to continue with the strong O&M discipline that we've been executing on in the past."
"Hey guys, congrats on a good 2016. One question, I want to make sure I understand for Energy Services what is included and if anything what is not included in your 2017 guidance. Are you including all of the impact of both Continuum and AEM's acquisition in the 2017 guidance?","Michael, this is Scott. Good morning.  Yes. We have factored in the net impact of all of that in our comments around 2017 performance, which includes essentially an integrated continuum and then the eﬀects of the integration process associated with AEM. We think AEM will be I'll to describe it as modestly accretive this year. But all of that is included in the numbers that we provided."
And do you think that business has a diﬀerent growth rate than the gas distribution business does?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),I think that has the potential to grow at or slightly stronger than our utility business. It's really predicated on opportunities that come as a result of additional scale. But I would say it's very close in growth rate. It's not something that's dramatically diﬀerent.
"Got it. And diﬀerent topic. And this one may be for Bill, when I look at your debt schedule, both at CERC, even a little bit at CEHE and not much left at the parent. But you've still got a number of tranches in the almost 6% range up to the high 6%s, almost to the 6.9%.  And it doesn't look like the make-wholes are really that expensive, just treasury yield plus 20 to 35 basis points or so. How are you thinking about reﬁnancing what eﬀectively is high-cost debt in this environment and the timeline for taking some of that out?","Well ﬁrst, you are right, we do have, I think, in today's environment what might be considered high coupon debt. The debt the just matured in February of this year had a coupon of 5.95%. The debt that matures in November has a coupon of 6 1/8%.  We think about that as an investment decision. And if it's net present value positive on a cash- on-cash basis to redeem debt early then we will do that. That's exactly how we thought about it in late 2016 when we executed the make-whole call and redeemed $300 million of debt. It was a $22 million charge to our earnings. But it was a net present value positive decision on our part."
"And the only reason why I ask is that the debt, a lot of the reﬁnancing opportunities that may exist right now are actually either at CERC or at CEHE, meaning not necessarily as much at the parent because you've done a good job of dealing with parent debt. It strikes me that would reﬁnancing a lot of that debt down at the opcos would give you the opportunity over time, especially as you go in for rate relief to potentially impact customer bills, maybe alleviate any upward pressure on customer bills due to the investment you are making. Maybe even give you more headroom to increase the amount of capital you deploy.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","You are correct. And we take a look at those opportunities regularly and should they be NPV positive for the customer, in the case of CEHE and our CERC-related gas utilities then we will redeem that debt and reﬁnance it. And in that case there will be no charge to earnings."
"Thank you. Good morning. Scott, coming back to your thinking through on the Enable ownership, obviously you guys have been working at it for a while now and one of the impediments. And you alluded to that again has been the tax leakage associated with that, particularly if there is a sale for cash. Is it fair to assume that that scenario is probably not high on the table given the tax leakage implications and perhaps sale for stock or spinoﬀ if you are going to do anything are the two most likely outcomes?",We haven't handicapped each of these individually but we've certainly been clear about the challenges we have with a cash sale from a tax leakage standpoint. So I would say your characterization is perhaps accurate. We do continue to have the challenges associated with tax leakage if we were to pursue a sale as you pointed out.
"Yes. And on the OGE ROFO, they have had a ROFO before and you guys decided not to take it and they went the other way and now they have come back with the ROFO a second time around. Again, is that procedural or is that something as a real option given that we've already been through this exercise before with them?","It's Bill. That is largely procedural. If we intend to have discussions with third parties, then under our partnership agreements our partner has a right of ﬁrst oﬀer. And so long as we are having those discussions and don't complete a transaction within a time limit we will need to give them another right of ﬁrst oﬀer."
"I see. Then and then Scott also to be clear on your comments, as you mentioned if none of these options comes to conclusion doing nothing and working with the system is an option.  Am I to read into that that's probably become a bigger option today than maybe it was when you started the process? Are you committed to doing something or doing nothing may end up being the best option after all?","I think we've been pretty consistent about expressing that any of these are viable options. But the real gating item here is whether something other than retaining our ownership would allow us to achieve the objectives we've laid out.  If we can't achieve the objectives we've set forth then our option of maintaining our ownership and continuing to work with Enable to be less volatile is certainly a very viable path. We have been doing that all along, quite frankly. And they've had some great successes in the eﬀorts that they have made in 2016 to just do that. And that eﬀort would continue going forward."
"And last question again just to round this out, fair to say that the fact that it has taken longer than expected has been to try to ﬁgure out the most tax eﬃcient way of making an exit if possible? Has that really been the issue that held you guys back?","You know we, for practical purposes we didn't really, weren't able to start this process until the latter part of the summer last year. Shortly after we made the announcement the market fell oﬀ precipitously. And we needed to have a viable forecast from Enable that we could use in these discussions.  So we weren't really able to start anything until the August time frame of last year. So we are not as far into this as it appears we might be. But we are committed to working this through and exploring the various options that we have. And we will make our decisions accordingly based on our ability to achieve those objectives."
"Hi. Good morning. Just following up on Ali's questions on Enable, I know you mentioned how the decision will likely come before any potential tax reform. But could you walk us through how the tax reform could lower the tax leakage at all from Enable? From a sale or spin of Enable how should we think about the impact there?","Kevin, it's Bill. So on a cash sale of Enable assuming we had a lower statutory rate and that statutory rate was also the capital gains rate for corporations, then that would lower our tax bill."
"Hi. Good morning. You know, since my questions on Enable have been answered let me just give one to Joe before he gets out of Dodge.  Joe, a couple years ago you instituted or were able to get together with the Minnesota commission and get a decoupling mechanism for weather. And if memory serves me this might be your ﬁrst winter where that's really going to come in handy. Is that working or do you anticipate it working to your expectations this winter?","Yes, Charles, your memory is good. This is, in fact, we've had it in place for almost a year now and it beneﬁted us last year as well. And obviously, with these mild temperatures this year it will also continue to be a beneﬁt.  So as I said in my remarks we had a great 2016 despite these mild temps. And that was in large part due to the Minnesota decoupling.  And we recently got it was a $25 million true-up that was approved last fall that we have begun to bill under that mechanism. It's a three-year pilot. So we are hopeful that we can translate that into a permanent tariﬀ after that three-year period expires.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. Then just as a follow-up, with the transmission loop around Minneapolis that you are working on, where does that stand?","Yes. The beltline project continues to go well. We are actually a little bit ahead of schedule. I can't remember the exact date as to when that will conclude.  But we are spending signiﬁcant capital on that, replacing that 60-plus or so mile loop around the city of Minneapolis. And everything is on track if not ahead of schedule."
"You are on the home stretch of that, aren't you? Just another year or two?","No. There is more than that. There is about four or ﬁve more years, Charles."
"Thank you, guys. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Enable, assuming that a transaction does occur is there a thought around what you would do with the preferreds you currently own with the Company?","Nick, it's Bill. Should there be a transaction we could go one of two directions. We could continue to own a preferred and make sure that we are protected in a right way by its current non-cumulative feature and so we've built that into the original structure that we negotiated with Enable or we could include that preferred in the sale or a transaction with another party.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. And that would eﬀectively reduce the tax basis, correct?",The preferred is its own tax basis.
"Well I guess what I'm getting at is that if I take the system maintenance and improvements out you only have about $100 million left. So how does the rate base going from $2.8 billion to $3.7 billion, which is an average of about $200 million a year growth. I'm sure it's probably something else that I am missing.","Nick, this is Joe. I think if you are just trying to back into the rate base number it would be for the most part it's CapEx minus D&A and deferred taxes.     It's Bill, just to jump in here and follow on Joe McGoldrick's comments. You know, rate base is the CapEx less depreciation, less deferred taxes.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
And that's actually a good segue. In terms of your current deferred tax liabilities on slide 25 I understand the $2.3 billion is in the Utility Business. Where is most of that located? Is it Transmission & Distribution or Natural Gas Distribution?,"Well it's across all asset classes but you can see really the majority of that is in PP&E, as disclosed both in this table on 25 as well as our tax footnote."
Okay. And you mentioned there'd be a liability should there be a tax relief presented there would be a reduction in rate. Do you know what that would be if all of this deferred tax liability were to go away in terms of percentage of rate reduction?,That would depend on when new rates are set. So it would be either a matter of going through our mechanisms where they have them at the gas utilities or through general rate cases.  And I said regulatory liabilities because there would likely be diﬀerent regulatory liabilities depending upon the nature of the original deferred tax liability. And the amortization of that life of the regulatory liability would be part of the rate case and/or the mechanism.
