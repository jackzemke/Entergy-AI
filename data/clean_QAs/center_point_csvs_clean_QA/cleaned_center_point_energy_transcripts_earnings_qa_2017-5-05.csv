Question,Answer
"Thanks. Two questions. So, assuming the anticipated decision from ERCOT later in 2017 on the $250 million project, what's the time horizon for actually executing on that capital investment, and when would you think that that transmission line would be in operation? And then, I have a follow-up.","Greg, good morning. This is Scott. The process we would have to step through, and we are stepping through is having ERCOT review our proposal. And assuming that they're supportive of this, the next step would be to ﬁle with the commission. Given all those steps and the timing for each of those steps, we would anticipate that the construction period would be between 2019 and 2021."
"And then, forgive me, if I was distracted earlier and missed it, but can you give us an update at all on the process of the strategic review on Enable?","Yeah. My comments earlier was that that we are continuing that. We had mentioned that on our ﬁrst quarter call, we anticipate providing an update on our – well I said, I'm sorry, on our fourth quarter call that we anticipate providing an update on our second quarter call. So, we're still on track to do that, and we are still in discussions with other parties and evaluating alternatives. So, sit tight, we'll provide an update on or before our second quarter call."
Is it fair to assume that the decision process is banded around some sort of tax-eﬃcient like kind exchange versus a spin through a C Corp?,"Yeah. Well, it's certainly, one of the options, but it's not the only one that's being considered."
"Thanks for taking my question. You just answered my question. I was going to ask also about what's the plan for Enable? And it sounds like, it's still being considered. I guess, the only thing I would add to that question would be, is one of the options just keeping it?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yes, John. One of the options is to keep it there. We've talked about the list of options being a sale, a spin or keep. And even under the keep situation, we continue to work on things that would reduce the variability associated with our ownership of Enable, and a lot of that activity is happening at the Enable level with the nature of the contracts and the deals are putting together."
"Okay. And then just on the guidance. You indicated you expect to be at the high-end of the 4% to 6% earnings growth range for 2018. And then, also as far as the ranges for this year, what are some of the things you're looking at that would put you at the high-end versus the low-end? If you could just maybe provide a little color.  And if you already commented on it, I apologies, I had to jump on late.","John, good morning this is Bill. With respect to 2017, that we are still in the ﬁrst quarter. First quarter, we've done well. First quarter and third quarter are a big quarters of the year and weather inﬂuences both of those. But we are conﬁdent that we are on track, certainly, within the EPS guidance for the 2017 year.  Many of the factors that we've discussed in our prepared remarks for 2017 both apply to 2018 as well, including the momentum that we have in the Midstream segment."
Okay. So it sounds – are you leaning towards the high-end for 2017 as well at this point.,"Given that it's just the ﬁrst quarter, we are not in a position to guide either or within the range of the 2017 EPS guidance."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hey, guys. Just curious, and thank you for taking my questions. In your 2017 guidance, what do you assume for your earned returns on rate base, both on the gas side and the electric side?","Michael, good morning, this is Scott. We have historically performed in the range between 9.5% and 10% for our utilities and our expectations are that that will continue this year as well."
"Okay. And then in the quarter, depreciation – and it didn't look like – and this is not a huge thing, but depreciation was a tailwind, but it doesn't look like it happened at the utility, at CE or at the gas utility. Is there something at the parent that drove that or something along the amortization that drove that change year-over-year?","Michael, that's related to two things allocation of depreciation expense and AMR in transition bonds."
"Got it, okay. I can follow-up oﬄine. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Thanks, Michael.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator   The next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead."
"Good morning. Scott, I wanted to get an update what's your current thoughts on utility consolidation? And to the extent there are opportunities there, is CenterPoint poised to be a player, or are you completely focused on the internal ﬁve year growth?","Well, I think my thoughts are perhaps as similar to others based on observation. It appears that Utility M&A has slowed a little bit. It could be for a number of factors. But our interest in M&A is the same as it's always been and that is that we really focus our energy around investment in our utilities. We look at the opportunity to invest up to and perhaps in excess of $7 billion in our utilities over the next ﬁve years knowing the timeliness and the returns we can get based on investment in our jurisdictions and we have to compare that to the quality of investment through M&A and our emphasis remains on organic investment."
"Yeah. But to the extent opportunities come up, fair to say that you still would be looking more contiguous or close to your service territories no interest in going afar from your current portfolio?","Yeah, I think that's a fair characterization. Look, we are fundamentally a utility company, we believe we run utilities well and if we found an opportunity that made sense to get it – make our utilities larger in a way that created value for our customers, we would certainly consider it."
"Fair. And then, Bill, you mentioned no plans to issue equity 2017 and 2018, does that imply – would 2019 be the earliest year you think that equity could potentially come into the equation given that $7 billion plus CapEx plan or what is it, could it be even further aﬁeld than that?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Ali, I think it's pretty immature for us to comment on 2019 and beyond with respect to equity plans. It is certainly our intent to manage our level of investment, our dividends, and our ﬁnancing in order to maintain our existing credit quality and credit ratings, provide the right investment on behalf of our customers in our growing service territories, and not to dilute our shareholders."
"Okay. And harking back to the days with Gary, I'll have to ask this question of now that Oncor potentially is back on the block, is that something – and they seem to want a Texas-based   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   owner. Is that something that could become more viable or interesting to you again?","Steve, I think, it's not our real practice to comment on speciﬁc opportunities. But it is interesting watching this proceeding unfold. It's my understanding it's not yet closed. So, like you all, we're just watching this thing unfold and seeing what we can glean from the outcomes."
"Okay. And then just lastly on the new transmission project opportunities, is this – I mean, there just seems to be a new industrial facility of some sort or energy facility kind of getting announced in your region pretty much every month or so. So, I'm just curious kind of are there more of these kind of incremental behind it that could pop up?","I think it's possible. I mean, there have been several announcements made and many of these announcements, it's still not clear yet on the siding. So, as they get ﬁrmed up on siding, it may create more opportunity. But the project that we had submitted to ERCOT was based on committed projects by the customers. So it's possible that others could step in and propose and ultimately get approval and pursue. And to the extent that were to happen that may well represent additional investment opportunity for us."
"Hey, guys. Quick follow-up. With regard to Enable, obviously, keeping it if you don't get a reasonable oﬀer is clearly an obvious choice, so is packaging it up and spinning it. And I know that the outlook for Enable has improved dramatically over the last year. But is that improved outlook in and of itself, even if that were to continue for some period of time, enough to increase your desire to keep it or do you still feel that there is a structural dissonance between the long-term volatility and the potential contribution for that business versus what (30:08) from the underlying utility investment that they own. Wondering if I could get your thoughts on that?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. So, let me just share some thoughts on that front. So, the improvement we've seen in the industry and at Enable are certainly great to see. And much of what they have been doing, the nature of their contracts have been going down the path of creating less volatility, which is one of the objectives we were seeking. So, in that regard, it is moving in the right direction. But it is still fundamentally a diﬀerent industry. It's still the midstream space, whereas the rest of our investment is in utility. So, our process will continue to its natural conclusion. And then, we'll move forward from there. But I think it's fair to say as you commented that improvements in the industry and changes that are occurring at Enable are both favorable for us from an ongoing ownership perspective."
"Thank you. Happy Cinco de Mayo. I hope you guys get some margaritas after this? So I don't want to hop on Enable too much, but Enable is a commodity-driven business, volume and price, and so by limiting the volatility, isn't a kind of countermanding the ability to sell and maybe narrowing your pool of potential buyers?","No. I don't – look, this is probably a question that may make sense to ask Enable as well, but I don't see that is aﬀecting the value of the company. The value of the company is going to be predicated on their opportunity to invest and grow in that space. And taking some of the volatility out of their ﬁnancial performance, I don't see that as deterring from the value of the company."
"Great. Next question, Energy Services, if you look at the map that you guys have on the presentation, it is very impressive. But for the small matter of the Northeastern slowing the two biggest consuming areas of natural gas in this country is not covered. So, I'm wondering if there is a strategy in place to try and get a presence there or if by design CenterPoint does not want to be in those two areas?","Lasan, good morning, it's Bill.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
