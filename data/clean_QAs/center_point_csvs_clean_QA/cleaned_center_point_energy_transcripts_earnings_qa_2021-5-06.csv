Question,Answer
"Thank you. My ﬁrst question is in Texas and the pending legislation for securitization there. Thanks for the color there. But could you give a little bit more detail based on your eﬀorts around how -- what do you think the chances are of it getting passed in this session that is coming to the close in the next few weeks? And if it doesn't pass this session, what are the diﬀerent pathways from here for the regulatory process?","Yes, it's a question, obviously that we expected. Number one, number two, I'm going to let Jason handle it, because he is working hand-in-hand with Jason Ryan, who is our Regulatory Aﬀairs leader, who is essentially in Austin now every single day. And as I said, they're working hand-in-hand on this.  Jason, why don't you answer the question.     Thanks David. Good morning, Insoo. I'd say obviously the legislature here in Texas has a number of priorities in front of it right now, but we continue to remain optimistic that the securitization bill for gas cost recovery will be signed into law. At the end of the day, it's probably the most constructive outcome for all the stakeholders. It minimizes or reduces the bill impact for customers by spreading the recovery out over a much longer period of time and it helps to keep the debt oﬀ the balance sheet of the gas LDCs. And I think the constructive nature of this tool is sort of well understood by all.  And while we remain optimistic that it will be signed into law to your point, it is important to note that the Texas Railroad Commission has been very constructive signaling that the gas LDCs will be eligible to recovery -- sorry will be eligible to recover carrying costs, as we look to probably recover these costs over about a three-year period of time again in the event that the securitization bill is not signed into law, but we remain optimistic as I mentioned.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   As that side, Dave and I will be joining, Jason Ryan and our team there in Austin and a little over a week to meet with the new PC Commissioners, the Railroad Commission, and other legislation to continue to make sure that CenterPoint is supporting the state's objectives. And as I said, I think we remain optimistic that this bill will be signed into law here at this legislative session."
"Got it. That's good color. My second question is perhaps for Dave on the gas utilities bill. Given the color you gave on the number of bigger the amount of interest and ultimately the multiple data generated. Just from your standpoint, how do you balance that enthusiasm and what that imply for the potential growth opportunity for gas utilities and investments there? Looking at your other jurisdictions potential for not just pipe modernization, but perhaps items like orangey or hydrogen. Can you balance the multiple that you've seen recently versus potentially those organic opportunities that you could take advantage of in your other systems longer- term?","Yes, it's obviously a great set of options to have, because I think one of the things that sale demonstrated is that clearly the value of our gas LDCs that remain behind are worth more in our share price and I think is reﬂected today. As I said in my comments, I think we do have an obligation to sort of look at that price we got, and then look at the overall options we have as an organization.  But I think as we said in our Analyst Day, we have signiﬁcant capital spend opportunities in our remaining gas LDCs. We like those LDCs, we like the markets that we're in. But if we ﬁnd an opportunity to look at monetizing them as I indicated, we have an obligation to do so. But we would certainly not do that, unless we saw an opportunity to reinvest it back in our business, in our regulated business, something that would have to be accretive to our current 6% to 8% growth rate. And really have an impact on the balance sheet. So, we're still sort of digesting the level of interest that was there, the price we got. But I can tell you it is a great place to be right now."
"Just David, started to handle this, but let me just follow up on the prior question that was asked and maybe a little bit more theoretical. Assuming you do look for further asset optimizations on the LDC side to may be capitalized in this multiples. Do you believe you can eﬃciently redeploy that capital quick enough where potential larger transactions could still be earnings accretive? I mean to point out that you clearly have incremental spending opportunities, not really capital constrained, especially as you bring to light further decarbonization plan. So, maybe a little bit more of a theoretical question, but just thoughts there as you drill down.","Yes, I mean, it's a -- it is a theoretical question. I think the way to answer it is, ﬁrst of all, we're not going to do anything crazy here. We've got a great business. The gas LDCs are wonderful businesses to own right now, and I think that we would take a very rational and I think systematic approach to looking at doing something diﬀerent and we clearly, as we've signaled have billion dollars of capital spend on top of the 16 billion we discussed at our Analyst Day, but I always sort of fall back to, what is your base strategy? And I said it when I answered the last question, we're not going to do anything that is not accretive to our 6% to 8% growth rate. So I think that's where the signals the timing that we would want to do.  We're not going to do anything that impacts the ﬁxing up of our balance sheet and getting to the credit metrics that we want, that would signal I think the timing. And it has to be consistent with our strategy of becoming more and more regulated. So I think there is a way to thread that needle. That has as I said earlier, we're still digesting the opportunity that has been put in front of us with the price that we got for these LDCs. So, give us a chance to digest it.  And then we'll see what -- how to take advantage of this great opportunity. It's either got to show up in the share price or will look at other options."
"Fair enough. Thank you for that. And then just lastly for me. Shifting to the cost cuts and reinvestment, which is near and dear to Mr.Webb's heart. Looks like you guys, you're on plan with the 1% to 2% O&M reduction target, and you show some modest investment from the calendar 2020. Just looking at that 44 million in cost cuts over the near-term, can you just gave elaborate on your comments that you may convert some of that savings into capital? And then theoretically, you could unlock over 700 million of or more of capital with your longer-term savings target as a book and without impacting customer rates, so maybe just some thoughts on O&M versus CapEx ratio.","Sure. I now -- let me just give a bit of an editorial comment, they are near and dear to my heart and Jason's heart and everyone else's heart in addition to Tom. But I'll let Jason answer the speciﬁc question.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Thanks, Shar, and good morning. Obviously we're incredibly pleased with the continued performance of the O&M discipline here. The team has really embraced continuous improvement delivered well last year and that's carrying through our ﬁrst quarter results.  In terms of the enhanced capitalization that's referenced on the slide, I think that's sort of a natural byproduct of the increase in our capital investment plan that we announced as part of the Analyst Day presentation where we signaled $3 billion of incremental capital over the ﬁve year plan, eﬀectively that gives us the opportunity to allocate more overhead to capital than expense, just given sort of the ratio of capital O&M. And so, I wouldn't fundamentally see that category signiﬁcantly changing, it might modestly change as we pull some of the capital investment opportunities that Dave has been alluding to in, but where our focus really is beginning to look at the execution of our core work really driving ﬁrst time quality and I think that's where we'll see beginning of the material opportunities in front of us from a continuous improvement standpoint."
"Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So just on the gas LDC sales, I'm not sure you can give this color. But just would you say that there was a lot of bitters that were kind of close to the range of the outcome such that this is not kind of like a ﬂuke price so to speak that there were several other bidders above the range that you had been targeting.","Yes, I'll answer it. Let Jason throw anything on. There were a number of bidders that were right on top of each other and it was a diﬃcult decision for us. But in the end, we thought Summit was the right answer, because of price and certainty of close and all the other things you typically would look at in a transaction. But this was clearly not an outlier."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   That's very helpful. Thank you. And then on the just in thinking of your talk of a future sale, obviously being tied to having something to redeploy the money in. Is there -- are there some other rate base opportunities beyond that billion dollar kind of increment that are starting to come into any view or would have to be an acquisition or some other just more maybe extending the plan in the future that would drive that?","I don't ever want to rely on having to do M&A to drive your business and grow your business. It is a way to grow a business in my view because of the premium you typically have to pay. It's an ineﬃcient way. And I think that we see suﬃcient capital spend opportunities out there. While you were asking the question, Jason was smiling and nodding his head.  So I will let him answer it from here.     Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Dave. Obviously, we're pleased with the organic growth opportunities that are present here. You know, we've talked a lot about this billion dollars of incremental capital that we have. But there are to your point Steve, other opportunities that may materialize. I think - - as I think the State of Texas here looks at diﬀerent ways to minimize the risk of a future winter storm, there's been a lot of focus on great resiliency, things like introducing economic criteria for building incremental electric transmission lines, things like making sure that there's greater levels of grid control in the event that there are outages and helping minimize the impact of extended outages to communities.  I think to the extent that those bills are passed by the state legislature and signed into law, I think that could create incremental capital opportunity for us to redeploy in. And then we continue to look at the coal transition in Indiana as a possibility for owning incremental amounts of renewables as opposed to securing that transition through a power purchase agreement. So I think on top of the billion dollars that we've been discussing, we do have the potential for increased capital deployment opportunities."
"Okay. And then just one more tied to the last comment Indiana. That directors letter that you got, could you just give a little more color on that and the better visibility you have into doing the renewables program there?","Yes. We were pleased with that recent letter by the Director there and the commission the -- eﬀectively, we had received some feedback on our original integrated resource plan that had asked us to consider sort of morph diversity of fuel sources, sort of more clarity on anticipated electric demand, proposing a smaller percentage of natural gas ﬁre facilities. And we incorporated that feedback earlier this year as we mentioned, ﬁled it into the directors report that you're alluding to, I think acknowledged the clear progress that we have made in being   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   responsive both to the commission feedback as well as the broader community and customer feedback in Indiana.  And so, I think it's a reﬂective of the fact that we feel that there is strong support for the coal transition plan that we have outlined previously."
"Hey. Thanks. Good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. Dave, I was just going to curious your comments around some sort of, you're able to reduce the storm costs, I think you said 300 million by audits and some sort of looking at your records on the gas side of things. Could you just elaborate on that? I'm just wondering if that's an opportunity for some of your peers to do that as well.","Well, I don't know what the contracts that our peers have look like. What we're doing is we're focusing on the excess gas costs that we encouraged, because as I said earlier, they're passed due cost for us and we have an obligation to our customers to make sure that we're paying for per the contract, we're trying to negotiate, we're trying to do everything audit all the things that we listed, but we're doing them really to make sure that we are getting the best outcome for the customers, because as I said they're capacity cost.  Jason, I don't -- why don't you can add anything into that, but it probably covers it.     I think it's deﬁnitely contract speciﬁc. And as you can imagine many of the suppliers alleged throughout the event force major clauses. We challenged some of those, I think also some of the gas suppliers recognize the impact that this storm has had on sort of the broader communities, we have the impact to serve. And so, I think it was a collective eﬀort of as we talk about sort of challenging some of maybe the contractual provisions, how that -- how the contract was interpreted, as well as sort of working to ﬁnd a constructive solution again for all stakeholders. And I think that we're happy with the progress we've made and we'll continue to advocate on behalf of our customers."
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   That's great guys. Excellent. Thank you for the color. Maybe just really quickly to the extent that you can on enable sort of exit here. Is it sort of a ﬁve-year plan or a 10-year plan? Just any color you can share there. Thank you.,"I can guarantee you it's not a ﬁve or ten year plan. It's much more aggressive than amp at all. Jason's going to execute it for us. I'll let him answer it speciﬁcally. But do not even for a second have in your head is ﬁve or ten years.     Our strategy is to eliminate our exposure to midstream once the energy transfer enable merger closes. And we're still not providing a direct timeline. We want to be disciplined and eﬃcient maximize the proceeds from the disposition, aggressively eliminate our exposure to midstream once the deal closes."
"Hey. Good morning team. Actually, if I can stick with the last conversation in brief. Can you elaborate what other elements you could pursue here? I mean, we've seen some of your peers valuing litigation, et cetera. What's your sense of conﬁdence to materially bring up that 300 million in reduced costs and bring down that 2.2 billion as you see it? Have you largely exhausted this or is there still a good chunk to go here?","I think we've seen probably the largest movement today. We are continuing to work with a handful of suppliers on what I would consider to be a much more narrow opportunity set. So I wouldn't look to see probably as signiﬁcant reduction as we reported today, but we're also at the same time not done with those conversations. As I said, we'll continue to advocate on behalf of our customers, but I wouldn't expect it to materially change."
"Got it. And then another little bit more of a detail here. You talked about reinvestment of O&M back in the utility assets. You talked about having a little bit more capital on hand. Can you elaborate a little bit more what we should be seeing here in terms of both the ﬁnancial impact   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   on '21 and '22 on a net EPS basis? But more importantly just timing on when you come back, just given that you're talking about something that's just so O&M here?","Yes I think -- let me again start by answering and throw it to Jason. I think it's -- you think -- you got think of sort of excess capital in two buckets here, one is the 300 million plus that we will get from the gas LDC sales.  Since we don't expect that transaction to close until about the end of the year or thereabout, that's really capital we can spend in '22, which will go into rate base and start impacting earnings in '23. We of course have a lot more optionality around the reinvestment of the O&M savings and I'll let Jason give a little color on how we're thinking about that, where we might spend it, how we might spend it.     Yes, but I think it's important maybe take a quick step back to and I mean, I think we feel like there's a privilege. We have a privilege to serve some of the most premium jurisdictions here in the U.S. and we have the privilege to have industry-leading rate base growth top of the industry earnings growth. That said, as we think about a premium valuation for the company, we think that really materializes with consistent delivery on our earnings. And so, in years where we may be accelerate some of the continuous improvement opportunities or we have better than expected weather, we will look to reinvest some of that savings back into the business for the beneﬁt of our customers. We think long-term that creates the best possible service for our customers, and the path to a premium utility valuation.  And so, as we make progress on O&M, and if we are doing better than expected, we will likely as I said, reinvest that back in the business. As Dave mentioned, the capital investment opportunities, I really think about that as sort of more of a '23 earnings impact just given the time period between executing that capital and then putting it into rates for recovery. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about the O&M and capital opportunity progress."
"Awesome. Indeed. Alright, well, best of luck. Congrats on all the progress thus far.","Thanks.     Thank you.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael, your line is open."
"Hey, just to continue the conversation on capital opportunities. As you're especially as you're trying to go to net carbon zero, maybe you could talk a little bit about opportunities for with RNG investments and methane reduction, methane leakage reduction.  And then also anything on EV charging opportunities that maybe emerging and ﬂushing out the plan? Is this something that these things they could become upside to your current plans?","You sound like you're sitting in our management committee room and so we're discussing all the great opportunities we have in front of us to get ahead of things on the journey towards net zero, but also be able to add to our rate base. And again, I'll let Jason give the details on what our thinking is there.     Yes, I think on the gas side, we're really fortunate to work as there are constructive jurisdictions. We've highlighted our green hydrogen pilot up in Minnesota, the work that we've done on the renewable natural gas tariﬀ. We clearly see that as a start to what is a long-term focus. We are actively working to develop the next round of pilot projects to make sure that we can eﬃciently generate the hydrogen we can that our system responds well to that introduction. We are working with suppliers on the RNG front and I think the learnings that we have in Minnesota are certainly experiences that we can utilize more broadly in our gas footprint.  And so, I think that there are certainly more to come with respect to RNG in green hydrogen for the company. And as you said, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to play a role in the electriﬁcation of the transportation sector. Thinking about here in Houston, it's obviously the fourth largest city in the U.S., but it is a very commuter focused city. And so, we see the opportunity to help with build out of distributed charging networks. That will help with the conversion of electric vehicles here in Houston and for that matter, hopefully up in Evansville. And so I don't see these as materially changing kind of our rate base proﬁle in the next couple of years, but the work that we're doing to gain experience, understanding and the support of the regulators, I think will help support the long-term CapEx plan for the company. So there's certainly a lot more to come on these two fronts.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Great. And just one follow-up on cost savings. With $44 million identiﬁed this year, yes, how can we expect that to ﬂow in? I guess the $16 million already ﬂowing in ﬁrst quarter. Is that going to be mostly in the summer? Or we're going to see that more evenly distributed throughout all four quarters?","I appreciate the question about time, and I think what's important to note is the company really embarked on a focus of continuous improvement, starting with the second quarter last year. And as you can imagine, it was sort of ramping up into sort of building that muscle over the course of the year. And so, quarter-over-quarter standpoint, we probably are seeing the largest variance here in the ﬁrst quarter and that will likely reduce each subsequent quarter as we kind of build into what was sort of the ongoing run rate at the end of 2020. So again, this is probably the largest variance you'll see this year.  And then as I've mentioned a couple of times here to the extent that we continue to make incremental progress, I think it's a really good opportunity to reinvest that savings in the business for the beneﬁt of our customers and we will look it to."
"You've got quite the pick up with Jackie joining IR there. CenterPoint is lucky to have her, so I'd be remiss if I didn't say that. But let me just --","So now she's sitting right next to me with a big smile on her face to hear that.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Thanks, Jeremy.     We're thrilled to have her on the team."
Maybe just a quick question here. You've talked a bit about the $1 billion CapEx. Wondering if you could drill down a bit more on this and what it could look like? What guardrails do you have here? Or what drivers or milestones could kind of make this real?,"Well, I think, ﬁrst of all it is real. I think if you go back to how we described it at our Analyst Day, I think that is still sort of that operative strategy. One is to deploy the capital eﬃciently and with the capital ramp-up that we have ongoing, it really is incumbent on us to make sure that we have the internal engineering resources, the project management resources, all of the sort of internal compliance guardrails you want to have around a fast increase in spend. So that when you spend a dollar, you're spending it wisely, you're spending it on behalf of your customer, as you put it into your rate base.  Second is, ﬁnding the sort of capital to spend that billion dollars on the LDC clearly helps there the O&M savings, help their with sort of the market reaction on the ET sale, enable sale to ET, there could be more proceeds there. So I really just want to reiterate something I said earlier and I hope you're getting a ﬂavor for it here today, is we have great capital spending opportunities in front of us, which is why as we sort of accumulate capital, maybe above and beyond what we thought we would have in our Analyst Day to grow the company we're not forced toward doing M&A. We are going to be able to invest it on a one-time investment basis in our business, in our territories and grow and protect and serve our customers here.  So as I said a number of times, this is such a great position for us to be in, because you throw organic growth on top of all that, that's going to create additional capital spending opportunities. So, that's why in my view we're really sitting in the catbird seat here in terms of what we can do with this business going forward. Not sure that answered your question, but --"
"That is helpful. Thank you for that. Maybe just a quick second one here. Just wondering broadly on tax mitigation strategies, you talked about the LDC here. But just wondering as it relates to enable ET if there's anything you can share there on that side?","That is right in the Jason's wheelhouse. So I'll let him answer that.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Thanks, Jeremy. One of the things that Dave and I took a look at when we joined was the fact that, on a relative basis, we were paying higher taxes than a number of our peers. And I think what has become obvious as we've dug into the situation is we have not necessarily availed ourselves of all of what I would say to be common utility deductions. So one classic example would be tax repairs where you have the opportunity to essentially expense or deduct immediately some investments that otherwise would have historically been capitalized.  I don't think we are fully taking advantage of that. We are currently in the process of conducting our study to support what would be a higher level of deductions. I'm conﬁdent it will result in a increase in available tax deductions for the company, not yet at the point where we're ready to quantify it as the study is not complete. But again just given the progress that we've made, we're conﬁdent that will meaningfully help reduce some of the tax burden that you mentioned from the ET sales. And so, we will likely provide a more fulsome update on opportunity on future earnings calls this year."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.  Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Phil Holder for closing remarks.,"Thank you.
