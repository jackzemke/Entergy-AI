Question,Answer
"Hey. Good morning team and thanks for having me on. Appreciate it. I just wanted to talk quick, you talked about industrial load and just higher demand leading to incremental capital over the course of the 10 year plan. You talked about not issuing external equity for the incremental capital. So I guess, just if you don't -- is it that you don't need the equity or that you would look to further portfolio rotation? Just how should we think about that?","Good morning.     No. I think if you sort of track all the way back to our Analyst Day and what we've talked about since then, the proceeds of Enable transaction, the original LDC sales when matched up against our $40 billion plus plan don't really require us to go into the market for any equity which is a sort of a north star for us right now and nor does it require us divesting of any LDC. So we have suﬃcient cash ﬂow to meet this plan. What we have tried to signal is that as we identify additional capital opportunities either on top of the ﬁve year $19.3 billion or so plan we have or the $40 billion plus plan, at that point, we would look to selling additional gas LDCs. But right now, we have suﬃcient cash ﬂow to meet our needs without issuing any more equity."
"Very helpful. Thank you for that. And then, I guess, just higher level like thinking to the cadence of your updates to the course of 22 here. And as I look back to 2020 and 2021, you've kind of maintained a pace that's been kind of fairly splashy. Understand there's been a lot to do also, but that story is kind of behind us now and things -- to your point, you're prepared remarks are just a lot simpler. So I guess, just to kind of set expectations on the pace of updates are you just kind of planning for this to just be all around a quieter execution here, blocking and tackling on the core metrics or are there larger strategic items in your mind that we should be kind of thinking about?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","No. I think blocking and tackling is probably a good way to summarize it. Although, if you think about even Q1, it was still a pretty active quarter for us. We closed on the LDC sales. We got rid of the rest of the Enable transaction proceeds we had. We continued to execute against a very aggressive rate base growth plan. We certainly met our earnings commitment. We've reiterated our 8% growth for the next few years and set at the top end of the range going forward. We met the challenges of inﬂation and supply chain. So I guess, I would think about it as yes, blocking and tackling. I think we did a really good job to Q1. I don't anticipate that changing, but I think the pace of change that I am trying to drive to CenterPoint is going to continue that's not going to change and we expect to hit all our marks that we have in our strategy."
"So just maybe following on Nick's question and just looking from the Analyst Day incremental capital changes. So at year end, you accelerated $200 million into 2022 and then you added $300 million around this is 500 megawatts in mobile generation and now you're adding another $100 million into 2022 kind of on industrial demand, if my understanding is correct. So that's $300 million of that total $600 million increase since the Analyst Day in 2022, but to point some of that from the back end of the ﬁve year plan. So maybe talk a little bit about that shift and then your ability to sort of back ﬁll capital in sort of year four and ﬁve.","Sure, let me -- let Jason handle that one. He keeps track of our capital going forward literally on a day-to-day basis, as I think you picked up today.     Good morning, Ross and thanks for the question. As you pointed out, we increased the CapEx forecast for 2022 by $300 million and increased the ﬁve year CapEx plan by $100 million. What   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   we eﬀectively did was brought for over $200 million from 2023 and 2022 and then increased the overall plan by about $100 million. Really that increase relates to routine work in our gas and electric businesses. Then we have the luxury to pull forward because as mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have an eﬃcient way to fund that for our shareholders in terms of higher incremental proceeds from the tax repairs deduction as well as higher incremental proceeds from the securitization that's anticipated in Indiana and this work continues to help kind of beneﬁt our customers by improving again the safety and resiliency of the system, which is why we put it forward.  It further helps de-risk any impact from solar delays as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And so as we look at then sort of a longer-term execution to your plan or to your question, we continue to I think make positive momentum I think with the City of Houston around improving resiliency here in Houston. We will likely have an update around that work probably around the Q4 or sorry, Q3 earnings call. And then as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're seeing increased demand from our industrial customers, both here in Houston, as well as Indiana. And as we work to serve those customers' needs, we hope to have a more holistic update around the longer-term impacts to our CapEx plans later this year. So it's an exciting time here at CenterPoint. The best is still yet to come."
"Dave, is Jason doing both the blocking and tackling or is he just doing the tackling?","No, he can do both. He can block and tackle as can everybody on our management team today."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   That's great. Just hopefully two quick questions. One is you talked about the But the O&M targets in your 10 year plan. I believe you said it's about 1% to 2% reduction each year. Just curious current tight labor market, supply chain issues, just maybe how challenging is it going to be to meet that? And I also think you kind of highlighted the AMI investment perhaps I guess went one out in April. Just wondering if you give us some color on the rate base opportunity that AMI represents and plans on getting pregnant or recovery of that. I have one more follow- up.","Okay. I'll let Jason handle the AMI question. I think I'll take the former part of your question. I guess, my view is that's what you pay a management team to do is to sort of take the challenges of supply chain, the challenges inﬂation had on. So I view is every utility is experiencing it. Most companies across the U.S. are experiencing it and it's coming at us every day, believe me. But I think that we have put a standard out reducing our O&M 1% to 2% on average every year. And as Jason said, we believe we're going to continue to do that. As to AMI, I'll let Jason talk about that.     Yes. Thanks Anthony for the question. It's several hundred million over the course of the 10-year plan. We'll seek to recover that. We've started here as Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks in Texas. The recovery will follow our typical capital investment through the grips. And then obviously, the longer-term implementation of the AMI program will be addressed in the gas LDC rate case that we'll ﬁle late 2023. So it follows sort of a normal course of events here and we'll follow kind of a similar process as we roll it out to the rest of our service territory. What I would say and just sort of reinforcing conﬁdence around our ability to continue to meet our O&M objectives is I think this is one of many programs that we've highlighted, whereas we implement improvements to our system to lower our O&M cost structure going forward just like we've highlighted the coal transition in Indiana. I think these O&M reductions from capital is core sort of driver near-term of our ability to meet our O&M targets. And then we continue to see broad adoption of our continuous improvement program throughout our service territory and are excited what that will yield over time as we mature in that area."
"Great. And just lastly, I guess, Dave following up on maybe Nick's question earlier. We've seen LDC valuations have recovered and are more in line with like electric utility valuations. And it seemed that right now investors are really focused on maybe energy security and view of an LDC has kind of changed more favorably. Just I know you don't have any need for funds in the current 5 year or the 10 year plan, but does the recovering LDC valuations change your view that you view them more as a source of funds or as a prepaid debit card? And I'll leave it there.","No, I think as we said, I think nearly every quarter when we've talked about this, I do view them as sort of prepaid debit cards, I guess, that's become the lexicon of the industry. I guess, we've talked about it so much, but my view is it really gives us optionality, but I -- and I do like the fact that their valuations I think are being more accurately reﬂected in share prices today. But   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   because they're opportunistic asset for us, I don't see any reason to accelerate the divestiture any of those until we have an opportunity to redeploy that capital back into our electric business. So we're just going to stay the course in that area for now. As I said, be opportunistic. But as we've said several times in the prepared remarks, we are looking for incremental capital opportunities and I'll trade oﬀ selling gas LDCs at a multiple of rate case and invest in it at one time rate base every day of the week. We just got to wait for those opportunities to develop and then we'll make the decision."
Great. Solid quarter. Thanks for taking my questions.,Thanks.  Operator  Thank you so much. Our next question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.
"So just on as we're kind of looking broadly at sort of some of the supply chain issues and inﬂation and mainly obviously the tariﬀ circumvention investigations going on with the commerce department which could kind of lead to some pricing uncertainty at least through '23 and maybe beyond, I guess, how do these sort of tail risks impact how you're thinking about the electric IRP process especially as we're shifting focus to the upcoming '23?","Yes, Shar. Thanks for the question. Obviously, it's front of mind. I would say as we mentioned, we're not immune to what's going on in the market. However, we've got a great set of development partners that we're working with constructively to ﬁnd a solution. We are seeing the price increases that you alluded to. But I think what's important to reinforce is despite the price increases that we are currently seeing, the path on the coal transition is still substantially less than the cost of continuing to operate these coal facilities. The current estimate given the age of these coal facilities would be -- it would cost our customers in Indiana about $50 a month to continue to maintain and I think will come in despite cost increases at a cost of the coal transition of less than $10 a month.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So while we still see sort of short-term pressure, this is still the best long-term solution for our customers in Indiana. And as we think about gearing up for the IRP, we will be going out with a broader request for proposal here this summer. We will be trying to get kind of the best and latest thinking on pricing technology costs that will factor into the integrated resource plan that we will ﬁle next year that will address the third and handling coal facility. And so more to come on this, but we've got a great set of development partners that we're working with constructively to ﬁnd a solution here."
"Got it. And then just lastly, I know obviously with the Texas Energy legislation passed, you've got resiliency now. There's a lot of incremental opportunities. I guess, at what point can we start seeing some of these opportunities kind of materially come into plan versus these small bumps we've been seeing recently?","Sure. I'll take these small bumps every day second increase since the Analyst Day almost six months or so ago. But that being said, I do think by Q3 this year on the earnings call we should have a better view of the longer-term impact or capital plans around resiliency, not only in the in the City of Houston, but the surrounding communities. And then the pace of the updates around the industrial demand that's going to be dependent on those customers, those industries, but I would likely want to be in a place where we can provide a holistic update to the 5 and 10 year CapEx plan again around the Q3 timing related to that incremental demand as well.     I mean, I would just add maybe an editorial comment. I know that we have sort of teased the update here for a couple of quarters. But I also think it's important for everyone there to understand we are working with the City of Houston here. We're not going to front run the outcome. Those discussions are ongoing, but I think it's just in everyone's best interest to wait until the plan is ﬁnalized and we sort of can announce it jointly and we'll do so when us and the city are ready to do it."
Hey. Good morning team. Thanks for time. Appreciate it. So just to follow up and clarify some of the earlier questions around inﬂation and spending. Just can you speak a little bit more about   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   the sort of normal course inﬂationary impacts on CapEx budget? Just trying to get a sense especially across the industry. To what extent is some of those coal forward and allocated in this year driven in part by just normal course inﬂation? And to what extent does that have sort of an expectation for cascading in to your program? Or said diﬀerently is there sort of an assumption that there's some deﬂation in the back end of your program or is the entire program in inﬂated at this point?,"Yes. Thanks, Julien for the question. At this point, the increase that we've been discussing related to the -- this quarter's update is really a reﬂection of a pull forward to projects, lesser on inﬂation. This is discrete work that we had planned in 2023 pulling forward to 2022 and then planned the incremental $100 million for the ﬁve years is really a component of that $1 billion of capital that we hold in reserve to make sure that we have the opportunity to fold in when we can eﬃciently execute and fund that work. So it really isn't a reﬂection of inﬂation now. That being said, clearly, we are starting to feel the impacts of inﬂation.  I think our supply chain team has been working eﬀectively with our suppliers to ﬁnd long-term commitments around work volumes that can be of interest, not only to their workforce, but interest to kind of our plans as well. And so I think today we're managing the impact of inﬂation. I wouldn't consider it a driver. I consider it a potential risk depending on how long we continue to face this inﬂationary pressure. We're not making any assumptions around deﬂation today on the back end of the plan. We're really just trying to understand how long we'll be in this inﬂationary cycle. And so again, it's really driven by work as opposed to inﬂation at this point."
Right. And just to clarify that even to the extent to which that you look at your plan here is there potential further inﬂationary factors you just reassessed what it costs you for electrical equipment here and gas equipment?,"Realistically, there could be some inﬂationary impact. We're starting to monitor what that risk in terms of a cost increase could be, but to-date, we have not seen that. We need to fold that into the plan yet. So it will be something we continue to monitor and happy to continue to provide updates in future quarters around it."
"Excellent. Just going back to the other Texas conversation on (inaudible). Obviously, you've seen developments in freight with the queue here on transmission. Any thoughts or perspectives to add on that front speciﬁcally moving past the Houston resiliency and just focusing on additional transmission integrity?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We continue to be very excited about the opportunity there. It was clear coming out of the legislature last year that the State of Texas wanted to put a priority around incremental transmission lines bringing more pathways, if you will, to provide electricity. We continue to work with the commission to see how we can accelerate the sighting of new transmission projects. We can execute on that work. So I would say it's early days, but that continues to be another area where we may see incremental upside to the plan and we continue to have excitement around."
"Thank you. Good morning, Dave. So just a question on the, I guess, Indiana and the solar projects in IRP. There's other utilities in Indiana, pretty much all of them are going through the same transition you are. So I'm curious just overall political regulatory feedback on this kind of solar anti-circumvention and do they get us -- do they have -- do they give you the sense that they understand the cost increases and just in the context of obviously everything going on with energy inﬂation?","Yes. Thanks, Steve for the, the question. It's an ongoing dialogue with commission staﬀ as you pointed out. We're certainly not alone, not only other utilities in Indiana, but obviously utilities all over the country are facing these inﬂationary cost pressures, as well as impacts on timing of the projects. And so I think the broader set of issues around timing and costs are well known. And I think that the commission is looking at us to work eﬀectively with the developers to ﬁnd a constructive solution for our customers, for the developers and for the execution of this work and so we'll continue to do so. I think it's early days in those conversations. But again, they're -- I think they're well attuned to kind of the pressures that we are all facing."
"Great. And then one just another quick one. The -- appreciate you highlighted the shift in the business mix more to electric, I think 62% now. Do you have any on a target for that long-term? Where you see that going?","No, I think, Steve, if you would -- if you sort of look at the $40 billion in capital spend, it's clearly biased toward electric. So if we did nothing else, I think you would see that 62% creep up over the 5 and 10 year plan that we have. Clearly as we've indicated if we ﬁnd a big slug of   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   incremental capital to invest in that generally is going to be focused on the electric side. We would have the commensurate sale of an LDC to fund that. So we wouldn't have to issue equity that would push it even more dramatically in the direction of higher bias toward electric. But I think inevitably over time, if we did nothing else, it's going to bias toward electric. And as I said, if we -- if and when we ﬁnd the larger plug a capital, it will push it that direction even more aggressively. So instead of a perfect mix, I don't think there is one out there. But at the end of the day, we'll sort of seek the level that makes sense for our investors and for our customers."
"Hey. Thank you for squeezing me in. Just ﬁrst question, going back to the capital plan and the increases there, we've talked a lot about the cost side on the inﬂationary front, but just in terms of labor availability, are you not seeing any pressures in ﬁnding the labor to accommodate any increase in the CapEx?","No. I think if you remember back two or three calls ago, I can't remember which quarter it was in, we highlighted the fact that we recognized that labor was going to be an issue to basically address the challenges of our capital plan. So we actually moved pretty aggressively at that point in time to tie up crews that were suﬃciently large enough for us to handle the capital spend plan that we have. So at this point in time, we've got those crews sort of tied up in sequence to come in and serve our needs as we do this capital build. Certainly, there's labor cost pressure, but the actual bodies I think were in really good shape on that."
"Got it. That's good color. My other question is just on the Houston electric demand growth. We - - I know customer growth was strong and I think weather may have helped this quarter as well, but still pretty impressive numbers especially on the residential front. Just more color on what you've seen on the ground there that's contributing to that versus some other parts of the country that has seen more normalization?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Well, I mean, yes. I think almost any economic indicator you look at, I mean, Houston is doing just great. I saw a note the other day that there were more housing starts in the City of Houston in the last two years than anywhere in the United States. You look at the turmoil going on in Europe and all of a sudden the pivot toward meeting set of more energy exports out of the U.S. to serve Europe and the whole sort of LNG and petrochemical complex, reﬁnery complex that sits in our territory and in our backyard here in Houston and the number of conversations that are taking place about either starting new facilities, upgrading facilities they have here, the sort of continued industrial growth outside of the ship channel that's taking place in this area, continued population growth, you just sort of go right down the line. And you really just got to come here and experience it, just get in your car and drive around Houston in this area and you just sort of the economic vitality is oozing out of this city at this point in time."
"That makes sense. No, I deﬁnitely felt that at the Analyst Day there last fall. So thanks for the color. Thanks, Dave.","All right. Thank you.     Thanks, Insoo. All right. Thank you, everyone again for joining us for our 2022 ﬁrst earnings call. And with that, operator I think we can all disconnect as that will conclude our call for today.  Operator  Thank you.
