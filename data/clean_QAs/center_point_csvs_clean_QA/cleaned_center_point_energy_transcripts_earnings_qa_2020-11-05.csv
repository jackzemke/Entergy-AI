Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, Dave, good morning, Jason. And congrats on a great quarter. Also Jason, best of luck at the new job. You are moving to a city that has the professional football team with more wins than or the same amount of wins as both of our New York teams so good luck there.  Just quickly, the CapEx raise is quite impressive. If you can give us some clarity on how much of that CapEx is maybe right or eligible or any approvals required for it and if anything requires a rate case? And then, I have one follow-up.","Let -- yeah, thanks for the comment. And yeah, even our football team isn't all that great here either though by the way. But I'll let Jason answer the question.     Yeah. Thank you, Anthony. It's great to be here. And I would say, just shy of $2.5 billion of that incremental CapEx that we've described is right or eligible. I think we are very fortunate to work in very constructive regulatory jurisdictions that provide for capital recovery on a timely basis. And so, as I said, about $2.5 billion -- just shy of $2.5 billion of that is right or eligible, just a little bit more than $0.5 billion will be dependent upon additional approvals in Indiana related to our generation plan that I described in our prepared remarks."
"Great. Just quickly, if you could bridge the gap between the really strong rate base growth of 10% and the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR. Is that just some additional parent interest expense or wondering if you could give clarity on that.","Yeah. No, thank you for the question. We are focused on narrowing that delta over time. I think you hit on one of probably two of the larger drivers. First, let me kind of cover. While we -- while I highlighted some of the constructive regulatory mechanisms that we have to recover our capital investment timely, there is still a small lag in certain jurisdictions. So for example in   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Houston, for Houston Electric, we are able to ﬁle for incremental recovery of our capital investment on the distribution side annually.  On the transmission side, we're able to ﬁle twice a year. But that small little lag provide some of or causes some of that leakage. The second item that I point to is exactly what you highlighted, we do have some parent company debt that is kicking oﬀ some interest expense, that's not recoverable from customers and contributing to that delta. We are focused though on addressing that parent company debt as part of the comprehensive set of BREC recommendations. And so, over time, we would see that delta beginning to narrow."
"Great. And just lastly I guess for Dave. I appreciate the clarity on your -- how you are going to fund the CapEx, you mentioned selling one to two LDCs. Just curious right now, I think the LDC multiple is really contracted over the last 12 months. Do you see that recovering or do you view it as -- are you selling at a low? Just curious on that and that's all I have.","No, I don't think we're selling at a low. When it becomes apparent which LDCs we're going to put it in the market, I think you'll recognize that there are not only a group of ﬁnancial buyers that will look at them, but strategic buyers in those states that will be interested in them. So I'm not concerned at all that we're selling at a low.     I think it's also important, if I could add as well, sort of a diﬀerence of operating sort of big continent. There's been a lot of focus on the coasts around local ordinances banning natural gas and new building codes, but what we're seeing in a number of the states that we have the privilege to serve is that states are -- have either passed or are in the process of proposing legislation to ban those local ordinances. So we are fortunate to serve communities that prioritize the clean nature of natural gas and I think that that will be recognized by the universe of potential buyers."
"Hey, just one primary and then just a quick follow-up. Just getting a little bit more in the weeds on the $1 billion incremental spend, what's sort of the trigger point to put them in plan, how do you sort of plan to ﬁle for the incremental spend and assuming you guys would be able to utilize your trackers, so a little bit more details there, Dave, if it's okay? And then, on the $3 billion increase, anything coming from your other states outside of Indiana and Texas, so anything being sourced in Oklahoma or Arkansas, per se?","Sounds like you're trying to get us to potential (inaudible) I have to say, I'm not going to take the bait and bite on that."
"Got it. And then just since you mentioned the LDC sales, just curious and sorry I have to ask, but where are you kind of in the process? Are you going to be in a position to announce a transaction on the 7th, do you have buyers kind of already there, and then should we really be thinking about this as a sale versus maybe an asset swap and not a counterpart?","No, I think the answer is no, we won't have a sales to announce on the 7th. We clearly will share with you which LDCs we have that we're going to be putting in the market and then you can sort of extrapolate from there what the potential buyer universe will look like, but I think, back to the sort of the prior question, to maximize the value on these things you want to go through a very rational and direct sales process and it's not something we have to hurry. We have the luxury of time here, and we might as we'll take it.    CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Hey, good morning. Had a little deja vu listening to this call, if you know what I mean, Tom, in a good way. And -- but just my question is back to the one about the diﬀerence between the 10% rate base growth and the 7% high-end earnings growth. Are you incorporating in there things like some potential -- the loss of earnings if you sell one or two LDCs, and then also the I guess potential for some need to reallocate parent debt. If something ends up changing on Enable, is that kind of embedded and is that part of the diﬀerence there or would that be something incremental we need to kind of address?","No. I think, Steve, I'll let Jason sort of handle the backend of the question, but to be clear, we do not expect to take a step back in our earnings per share as we put these LDCs in the market. That's why in my view, O&M cost control is so critical in this because it sort of would be crazy to take a big step back in your earnings per share to get the opportunity that sort of boost your earnings going forward. So I think the plan we put in place is a pretty rational one. Next year's   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   earnings will be driven oﬀ whatever this year's actual is and we'll sort of control things from there. I'll look to Jason to sort of address the second part of the question, but I think he did hit on it earlier. The gap between the rate base growth and the earnings growth will close over time.     Yeah, Steve, I obviously won't re-cover what I provided earlier, I will say though that as we were looking at this plan and evaluating our conﬁdence in achieving the high-end of our stated long- term growth range, we did incorporate things like obviously the scenarios around Enable. I'm reticent to go any deeper today. Obviously, we will provide more of an update around Analyst Day there, but the conﬁdence we have in achieving the high-end of that earnings growth range does incorporate our considerations around Enable. It does incorporate smaller things like the loss of the equity return on the securitization bonds at Houston Electric, and so sort of coming back at the central theme that we shared as part of the prepared remarks, it's our job as the management team to address any of the headwinds that we see in our business. And as we've shared with you our conﬁdence in achieving the high-end of the range we've taken into consideration some of those smaller moving parts."
"Let me just make this -- absolutely. If I can pick it up oﬀ of Steve's question a little bit further, just can you clearly deﬁne to us just what the base EPS is for the 5% to 7%, just to make sure we're all on the same page? And then separately, as you think about the trajectory here, you got some up -- earlier dilution if you think about '20 and '21, as you think about pushing this CAGR forward with subsequent years, how do you narrow that gap between the 10% of the 5% to 7%? Does that make sense?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah. And those are perfectly teed up questions for Jason because he and I have talked about this about a 100 times since he's been onboard.     Thanks, Julien for the questions. In terms of the growth from here forward, it really is on the Utility guidance basis range of $1.12 to $1.20 per share. Given where we are in the year, I think it's likely that we end the year right at or slightly above the midpoint of that revised guidance range and so, I'd use that as the factor to grow earnings on the 7% basis going forward.  In terms of conﬁdence ability to deliver at the 7% range, we still continue as I've indicated a couple of times, have conﬁdence of our ability to address some of that drag. Part of our plans coming out of the BREC is to restructure the balance sheet, we have been issuing parent company debt to fund operating company debt needs. We will address that over time, reduce some of the leakage from that excess interest expense, as I've said, and taking advantage of those opportunities will help us grow to that and deliver at that 7% EPS growth range."
Got it. And the top-end there assumes earning your ROEs across all the utilities? Given what...,"We are targeting to earn at or slightly below all of our operating company ROEs. There is -- as I've indicated, a couple of times, there is a small delay in capital recovery. These are very constructive mechanisms that allow us to layer in that incremental expense, but there is some time delay at -- with that and so as a result, there are periodically small diﬀerences in our allowed return, but I think it's important to know that we sort of operate the business on a portfolio basis and across all the utilities or as assuming that we are in the allowed return on equity sort of across the enterprise over that time period."
"Thank you, and congratulations Jason on the appointment. Just a question on Enable on the timing of that. I know the process is ongoing but by December 7th or by -- if not December 7th, is there any broad range of timeline where we could get an update on what that strategic review would entail for Enable?","It's -- I appreciate the question. I know it's top of mind for our investors. We aren't going to comment in any further detail on today's call with respect to Enable. What I will just reiterate is some of the comments that Dave shared in his prepared remarks that we are pleased with the alignment with OG&E. We are focused on addressing Enable. But for purposes of today's call, we're not going to go into any greater level of detail with respect to the timing of that transaction."
"Hey, good to see you again, Tom. Hey, what regulatory strategy are you guys planning to achieve or planning to help achieve close to 7% EPS growth, considering 1% to 2% annual O&M decreases? Do you plan multi-year rate plans across jurisdictions, how are you going to keep customer bills in that below inﬂation zone?","From a rate case standpoint, this is really taking advantage of the constructive mechanisms in these states. We are focused on delivering results that are consistent with our allowed return. As long as we stay and -- in or at our allowed return, we have the opportunity to fold in this incremental capital on annual, semi-annual basis as I've alluded to. And so, the incremental depreciation that will come from this will help sort of oﬀset a little bit of the O&M reductions so that we stay at and earn the allowed returns and have the opportunity to continue to deploy this incremental capital and take advantage of these constructive regulatory mechanisms.  And so, from a procedural standpoint, this is sort of squarely in-line with how our regulators have set-up these systems sort of more broadly as it relates to customer rates, we're very attuned to impact of the cost of our service for our customers and our communities, we have the privilege to serve. I think all-in, we're looking at growing our rates in line with inﬂation. There might be periodic deviations from that but over time, we see the opportunity to grow our rates in each of the states, generally in line with inﬂation. That's really driven by those factors that I discussed, the fact that we've got growth in the majority of the states we serve, that we have O&M discipline around our cost structure and so, that helps balance that incremental capital investment that we shared with you this morning."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just if you can -- to the extent you can, the comment on one to two gas LDCs, is that predominantly -- should that -- should we think about it predominantly driven by sort of you trying to bridge the ﬁnancing gap in the plan or is it that you've identiﬁed two gas LDCs, which are non-strategic and don't ﬁt into your long- term portfolio and that's how you're going about it? Appreciate any color you could share there. Thank you.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah, it's really the former. I mean, we like all our gas businesses as Jason has said a number of time, they're in constructive markets. Our gas businesses make good returns and the others, certainly an integral part of our portfolio but it was really taking the approach that I aligned in the -- in my prepared comments, which is how much can we spend and what we really want to focus on for the future, which is our regulated business in our bigger states with a bias toward Electric and how much can we spend on those and where can we go ﬁnd the capital to make those required investments.  So it was really threading the needle, almost think about it as backward integration of an equation, how much can we spend and therefore, what do we need to go ﬁnd in terms of cash ﬂow and where do we ﬁnd it. And that's going to drive and has driven the conclusion as to which LDCs we're going to sell."
"Hi, good morning. Just want to turn to Slide 7 here and dig in a little bit more. Can you provide a more of a breakdown on the components of your $3 billion CapEx increase here and kind of what's the timing and cadence of generation investments here? And are there any other large projects in your plan we should be thinking about?","We're going to be sharing a lot more detail around this CapEx plan at the Analyst Day but let me kind of just give you a little bit of color today. I think outside of the generation plan in Indiana, the CapEx plan that we're highlighted here is really made up of a series of smaller sort of routine projects, a classic example of that is targeting sort of the low voltage transmission lines in and around the Houston area or 69 kV lines.  It's about a ten-year replacement plan that provides us sort of certainty for ongoing kind of capital investment. And so, I would say, again, outside of the generation plan in Indiana, these are a series of routine and sort of repetitive programs. We will there deﬁnitely be sharing a lot more detail with you at the upcoming Analyst Day.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
