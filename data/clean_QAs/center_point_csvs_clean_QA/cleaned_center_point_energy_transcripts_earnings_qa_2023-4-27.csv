Question,Answer
"Yes. Perfect. It was a bit of a dead spot there. Just a quick question on Texas, the Texas legislature. There's obviously been several regulatory update bills making traction at the legislature, I mean, including, some of it around employee costs, approval of CPCN, storm cost, interim recovery mechanisms. I guess, how do we think about some of these, Jason and Dave, in the context of your longer-term plan, your 6% to 8%, what should we really be focused on? And could any of could any of these sort of unlock some of that $3 billion of incremental capital opportunity that's been out there? Thanks.","Yes. Let me take the ﬁrst shot of that, and then Jason can come in as he likes. First of all, I don't want to front run anything that might come through the legislative process. There's still about a month to go, and a lot can happen. But saying that, we're really appreciative of the support we're getting in the legislative process in this section to really beneﬁt all Texans and certainly the customers of CenterPoint.  So, there are some bills out there that I think would beneﬁt customers. I think it's important to keep in mind though that the 6% to 8% growth we have out there really is predicated on the status quo. So, I think as any of these things work their way through, it certainly will beneﬁt customers primarily, but also CenterPoint."
"Perfect. And then lastly, I mean, obviously, it was a clean quarter and seems like you guys are oﬀsetting some of the pressures like weather and interest rates, despite some reliance on ﬂoating rate debt, which obviously in your prepared remarks has been stepping down. I guess, how do we think about sort of the rest of the year, especially some of the near-term headwinds don't ease? How much of that sort of contingency have you used up like O&M, especially in light of the inﬂationary pressures out there? Thanks.","Thanks, Shar. I'll continue to think we have more tailwinds than we do have headwinds. Obviously, interest on a Q-over-Q basis stood out, but as I mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, we made a conservative assumption around interest expense in the 2023 plan, and current interest rates are at or below the interest assumptions we have in our plan. So, I don't see interest as signiﬁcant headwind to '23, even though it'll be a year-over-year variance. We continue to feel conﬁdent in the continued growth. We're seeing a steady trend of continued 2% customer growth here in the Houston area. We still have signiﬁcant opportunities with respect to O&M. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a number of capital trackers pending in front of many of our jurisdictions that will provide enhanced earnings power for the company in the latter half of the year. So, we continue to feel, as I said, more tailwinds than headwinds. And that's why we're reaﬃrming our guidance on today's call."
"Perfect. And then, Jason, congrats to you and Chris on Phase 2. It's a big win for CenterPoint. Thanks, guys.","Thanks, Shahr.   Chris is smiling, by the way.  Operator  Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning. Hey. I was just curious with the conclusion of the Sempra Oncor rate case, whether or not the outcome of that case had sort of maybe informed your thinking incrementally and how you might approach your upcoming general rate case later this year in the state?","Well, certainly, you take the lessons learned by watching the interaction with the PUC, watching the strategy that they use, but Oncor is Oncor and we're CenterPoint. And so, we have sort of diﬀerent needs, we have diﬀerent outcomes, we have sort of diﬀerent experiences. So, I think, we use it as a data point, but I think, all in all, we've got a great story to put forward in front of the PUC. We're in an entirely sort of diﬀerent climate than the Oncor territory is. But as I said, we'll take the lessons learned and use them, and we'll put the best foot forward to show what a great company CenterPoint is and what we've done for customers with our investments over the past few years.     Jim, if I can add, I want to reemphasize the point that I made on the fourth quarter call. I think we're in a pretty unique position here at CenterPoint given the team's strong work around O&M discipline, such that as we look forward to ﬁling this case later this year, we will likely ﬁle a relatively ﬂat revenue requirement increase despite advocating for a higher cost of capital to attract the critical investment that's needed here in Texas. And so, I think we're in a pretty unique position having driven cost out of the business to be able to advocate for beneﬁts for all stakeholders."
"Great. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it and congratulations on the good quarter.","Thanks, Jim.  Operator  Please stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Absolutely. Hey, so just pivoting here. How do you think about the ability to maintain that 14% FFO debt metric beyond '23 here? Obviously, some slight tweaks in the slides here. Can you elaborate a little bit about how you're thinking about the balance sheet here today, considering kind of the status quo? Obviously, we saw some of the recent headlines around potential recycling. I'll let you elaborate, if you could. And then related perhaps, how do you think about funding that $3 billion CapEx sub-size[ph] in the timing there and considering what could be a protracted process when you kind of recycle?","Yes. Thanks, Julien. Appreciate the questions. There's no fundamental change in our view of the balance sheet. We've worked hard over the last several years to improve the cushion between where FFO to debt metrics actually stand and our downgrade threshold, as I've indicated on previous calls. I believe in running about 150 basis point cushion at a minimum to remove any equity overhang risks. And I think under the current plan that we are able to achieve that. We've made a lot of progress reducing parent company debt as relates to the percentage of as a total company debt. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've taken pretty substantial steps in this ﬁrst quarter to reduce our variable rate exposure.  So, I continue to remain happy with sort of our trajectory. There are a handful of things that could potentially be credit accretive. We've referenced it in some of the comments around the legislative process here in Texas. We're not going to formally update anything until we see the conclusion of those eﬀorts, but the potential of recovering capital faster is both a beneﬁt to the company, but also our customers in terms of moderating any great impacts.  So, more to come on that front as the Texas legislature winds down. In terms of your question around some of the rumors, obviously we don't comment on market rumors. I just want to reemphasize a couple of points. Our current $43 billion CapEx plan through 2030 does not require any incremental equity. So, we don't need to sell any of our businesses. That said, we've got a great set of assets and routinely receive unsolicited interest. That's why we have continued to emphasize that we believe that the market for gas LDCs remains strong. I think this management team has demonstrated routinely that we will always look to maximize shareholder value.  And so, as it relates to your last point on the $3 billion of capital spend, I think, that really is going to come down to ﬁnding ways to eﬃciently fund it and recover it. We're entering a period of time with these rate cases where we will likely not have access to some of our capital trackers   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   as we prosecute those rate cases. That's something that we're mindful of as we think about increasing our CapEx plan, but equally we want to be able to fund it eﬃciently for our stakeholders. And so, that could come in the form of as I said, maybe some of the credit accretive opportunities in the legislative session or potential outcomes in upcoming rate cases. So, we've got a great plan in front of us and we continue to look at ways to potentially enhance it."
"Excellent. Thank you for the clariﬁcation. And then if I can quickly to follow up on the last one here? On the legislative side, can you clarify a little bit on the timeline here? I mean, obviously, you've got a little bit of time to the end this session here, but you've got certain thresholds that you've got to achieve here to move diﬀerent bills et cetera at least to see them moved. Can you clarify a little bit on what we should be seeing or expecting in terms of like the (inaudible) timeline to get some progress?","I appreciate the question, Julien. I mean, I don't think there's any sort of deﬁnitive timeline. It's an important part to see kind of bills moving. Obviously, the House and Senate are doing that. There's still more than 30 days left in the session. And so, I think all eyes are just number of bills outside of those focused just on utility related issues. And we're just trying to work constructively with legislators and key stakeholders to advocate on behalf of our customers. But there's probably not any speciﬁc deadlines that I would point to at this moment."
"Excellent, guys. Thank you very much. I'll see you soon. Cheers.","Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Please stand by for our last question. Our last question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is now The line is now open."
"Just want to revisit some of the local economic trends you referenced in the script. Just wondering, how are these trends across your service story relative to growth expectations coming into the year? Any deviations from original expectations?","I think that if you look back over the, say, last 30 years, the Houston area has sort of grown consistently 2% a year. And we even saw that growth continue through COVID. So, I think right now, we're really seeing more of the status quo. This is a really happening area in terms of attracting jobs. It's got a relatively low residential housing cost. You obviously have the tax advantages you have in Texas with no state income tax. You have low energy prices. So, all of that adds up to continue I think to develop an ecosystem here in Houston that will continue to drive approximately 2% growth. And that's really what we have in our plan. So, we're not planning for any more or any less at this point."
"Got it. That's helpful there. Thanks. And you also mentioned continued feedback on resiliency needs. Could you speak a bit more about your thinking here, how it's evolved, if at all? Does the current capital plan fully tackle, what you'd like to prioritize on the resiliency front, or is there any potential here covered in the $3 billion incremental capital upside you'd spoken to?","Yes. Jeremy, I appreciate the question. I think, we've ramped up capital pretty considerably. A signiﬁcant portion of that incremental capital is really dedicated to enhancing reliability and resiliency, helping make the grid a little smarter a little more self-healing to improve reliability a little bit harder to withstand the impact of severe weather. I think that $3 billion is largely oriented to incremental resiliency work that we would like to fold in the plan when we can eﬃciently execute it and eﬃciently recover it and eﬃciently fund it. So, we'll continue to ﬁnd ways to incorporate that enhanced resiliency spend over the coming years.     For those of you that are wondering, rumbling in the background is it's a terrible weather day here in Houston with lots of thunder and lightning. So, hope it's not impacting the quality of the call here."
"You guys coming through loud and clear. So, thank you for that.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Alright. Good.     Great. Well, operator, I think that's going to conclude our call today. I appreciate everyone that's dialed in and look forward to catching up with everyone soon. Take care.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's ﬁrst quarter earnings conference call.
