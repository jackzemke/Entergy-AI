Question,Answer
"Good morning. Appreciate the updates on the call today, especially with the resiliency ﬁling and I see that it was largely embedded in the 4Q update. But as we think about the $500 million upside, just how are you thinking about in terms of accretion versus the 10% rate base growth and maybe any speciﬁc threshold or incremental on the incremental updates in CapEx? And how are you kind of planning to announce any kind of ﬁnancing optimization there?","Yeah, thanks, Constantine. Pretty comprehensive question there. Let me kind of start at the highest level. And I think there's three main points to this CapEx update. You know, the ﬁrst is, we've got a great base plan, 10% rate base growth through the end of the decade. And the second point I'd make is, we've been spending signiﬁcantly on resiliency because it's the right thing to do for our customers. And case in point, you know, we've increased our CapEx plans over 10% since our 2021 Analyst Day. That was largely to support increased resiliency eﬀorts. And so this is, again, spend that has been already incorporated in this plan.  And then importantly, I do think, third, we have a signiﬁcant amount of opportunities in front of us. Those take the form of continued resiliency investment, particularly on the distribution side. One of the things that I'm probably most excited about is the industrial electriﬁcation opportunity that we have here, particularly in the Greater Houston area. Just as one quick example, there's about 10 gigawatts of hydrogen production in development to come online before 2030. That hydrogen production requires signiﬁcant increases in electric transmission capacity, substation capacity also carries with it signiﬁcant jobs, which will help continue to drive residential load growth. And on the gas side of things, we continue to see signiﬁcant opportunities for incremental CapEx, particularly around maybe local gas transmission pipeline capacity in the Greater Houston area.  We're one of the few gas LDCs in the country that don't have localized gas transmission capacity and I think it can help our customers, help mitigate the cost and severe weather events. And so the short of it is, you know, we've got a great base plan, we've been spending on resiliency and we have signiﬁcant increases in CapEx still in front of us. You know, in terms of being accretive to the plan, we wouldn't spend it if it wasn't the right thing to do for customers, wasn't the right thing to do for shareholders and for all of our stakeholders. I think we've developed a track record of executing upon that. In terms of ﬁnancing, maybe I'll turn it over to Chris to share some thoughts about funding any incremental CapEx from this point forward.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Sure. Happy to hit it, and good morning, Constantine. I think if you look at the larger incremental potential CapEx that Jason was just referencing, you should think about it as just the prior approach that we've referenced, which is continuing to incorporate that into our capital plan as we can execute it, ﬁnance it and recover it. And the way in which we would do it would largely be to fund it in line with our enterprise cap structure. As you look speciﬁcally at the roughly $500 million opportunity we referenced this morning around the resiliency ﬁling, we did reference that we're going to go after some potential both federal and state-based loans and cost matching programs. But to the extent that we're not successful on those, again, the simple way to think about it is we'd be funding in line with the enterprise capital structure."
"Excellent. Appreciate that. And maybe a quick follow-up on that. You kind of highlighted the path on credit metrics and how are you thinking about options of reﬁnancing needs on both ﬂoating rate exposure and kind of near-term maturities? And is there any optimization opportunities there with convertibles, hybrids, any of these kind of federal loan programs to supplement?","Sure. Happy to touch on it. And I have to say, you know, we're pleased with where we are today. You saw us reported 14.6% in terms of FFO to debt based on the Moody's calc and consistently are seeing as we go forward a good trajectory both on the Moody's and S&P calculations. As we think about the diﬀerent ﬁnancing alternatives, it is certainly the case that we are already pursuing some DOE loan program dollars to the tune of just over $2 billion already. So those have already been ﬁled. Really, that's just a cheaper alternative for better ﬁnancing costs for customers. As we look at the ﬁnancing plan throughout the year, certainly, we've got a few maturities here that are coming up. We've hedged against a portion of the current oﬀering that's probably closer here in front of us at the parent level.  And then as you look at hybrid alternatives, I think you referenced there, that's certainly something that we're evaluating, you should assume. We kind of like the proﬁle there, but we are looking really at a couple of alternatives, both for some tax alternatives this year and some hybrid opportunities if they make sense. And it's just my way of saying, Constantine, that we're always going to be pursuing the most eﬃcient ﬁnancing we can as we go forward."
Okay. So everything is on table. And just a quick one on Jason's comments around demand growth that you mentioned. And cost shift has kind of become more of a prominent issue with the inﬂection in load that we are seeing. Do you see any issues in Texas or even Indiana where you would need to adjust kind of cost allocation and would those be addressed in the current rate case process or any kind of separate proceedings?,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hey, Constantine. I think it's a great question. Probably less kind of an issue directly in the service territories that we serve, largely because the growth that we're seeing, both the potential for it up in Southwest Indiana as well as here in the Greater Houston area is really driven by industrial load growth that comes with signiﬁcant jobs. You know, much of the discussion over the last couple of quarters has been around data centers, AI growth. That's, you know, some of the toughest electric load growth to serve, right, low margin, doesn't necessarily come with the jobs, and so it does put, to your point, sort of pressure more largely on cost allocation. I think here, again, where I think it's a clear diﬀerentiator for CenterPoint, we serve load that, you know, it's not only growing from a residential standpoint and industrial standpoint, but it keeps that cost allocation issue sort of, you know, less impactful than maybe some of the peers that have data center growth really driving their electric sales."
"I just wanted to follow up on Constantine's question on the System Resiliency ﬁling. The plan is $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion, which I think is roughly almost double the $1.3 billion you've been spending over the last couple of years. But if I heard you correctly, the $500 million of incremental capital is kind of in line with the higher end of the ﬁling. So if we kind of run this forward, if the PUCT ultimately decides to approve a spending that's, you know, say, near the bottomness or even below the range, could you talk a little bit about where you see other investment opportunities and how would this change your ﬁnancing plan, if at all?","Yeah. Maybe a couple of quick points on that, Jim. So the $2.2 billion, the low end of the range is consistent with a $44.5 billion. The upper end of the resiliency ﬁling, that incremental $500 million would put us to $45 billion overall through 2030. You know, look, I think that there is pretty strong alignment across the state here in Texas around investments to keep the grid resilient and going to help the economic growth that we're experiencing in Texas. I also think what's important part of this ﬁling and what is maybe diﬀerent than some of the historical resiliency spend is, as part of the ﬁling, we have to prove the beneﬁts of the incremental   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   resiliency mitigation measures exceed the cost. So, you know, part of this ﬁling really demonstrates that on a net basis, this is still in the customer's best interest for us to make these investments.  And so, you know, I feel like there's going to be strong support for our ﬁling, the other ﬁlings of the transmission distribution utilities. That being said, to your point, if there is concern around the proposed mitigation measures that we have in our ﬁling, as a quick reminder, this is about 15% of our total CapEx plan. And as I alluded to in my answer to Constantine, I think we have plenty of incremental CapEx opportunities outside of this, whether they be on the gas side of the business, I talked about local transmission pipeline there, potential to accelerate our next- generation smart meter deployment.  And then on the electric side, I just -- I cannot reiterate enough the opportunity with this exponential load growth driven by industrial electriﬁcation and electriﬁcation of commercial ﬂeets. So, you know, I think that there are an abundant set of opportunities of incremental CapEx. And I don't know, Chris, if you want to continue to reinforce thoughts on ﬁnancing plan.     And -- sure, just to build on that, again, as we look at the base plan at the low end of the resiliency ﬁling, that would just support the $44.5 billion with the ongoing very modest ATM program that we've got through 2030. And again, as we look beyond that for some of these incremental opportunities, it really would be ﬁnally [ph] in line with the existing cap structure."
"Yeah, hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just on the Indiana update that you mentioned on the settlement or get delayed in the hearing, just maybe a little more color on how long it's delayed and just likelihood of an agreement?","Good morning, Steve. Thanks for the question. You know, we pushed the start of the hearings by a day, you know, as we continue to explore the potential here for settlement. You know, it's hard to handicap kind of expectations. I think we're working hard with stakeholders to ﬁnd what we believe would be a constructive path forward. And as a quick reminder in this case, a lot of the CapEx that's included in the Indiana Electric ﬁling has been in front of the IREC [ph] and our stakeholders in previous forums, whether that's the cost of coal transition or the transmission and distribution investments that we are making to improve reliability and resiliency in that area.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   And so a lot of the issues of the case have kind of been seen by stakeholders in a number of diﬀerent forums. And so we continue to try to work constructively towards the settlement and you know, we'll update you as we have, you know, more information."
"Okay. Great. And then just on the kind of S&P negative outlook, I just want to clarify, just is your - - I mean, I think these things usually take, you know, like a year or so to go through, but just are you -- your intention is just these metrics will get better just as the Uri impact goes away and that should be suﬃcient to meet the targets there? Is that how to think about it?","Good morning, Steve. That's accurate. Really what S&P was looking at was the past, right, as they evaluated and arrived at that outcome. Our general assumption, it is that roughly year-long period. And as we look at the plan going forward, as we look over the next few years, you'll see naturally that Uri impact roll-oﬀ and we'll see ourselves really as we see even just in 2024, looking at the year, you're going to see us at Moody's continuing to target that 100 basis points to 150 basis points cushion, that won't change. And additionally, you're going to see us grow into a greater cushion at S&P as we walk into the subsequent years. So comfortable with the base ﬁnancial plan and what it informs for the years ahead.     I think, Steve, if I could add to that, obviously, as Chris said, we're comfortable, but I think it's important just to highlight the core diﬀerence in methodology here because it is transitory in nature. You know, the way that -- the issue I'd add is, you know, we've received securitization proceeds from Winter Storm Uri with [ph] signiﬁcant cash inﬂow. We have to pay taxes on that cash outﬂow. S&P's methodology excludes that signiﬁcant inﬂow, but includes the associated cash outﬂow, right. That's sort of a transitory eﬀect. And as Chris said, as we look forward, we feel comfortable about the trajectory that we're on. And so just a very sort of idiosyncratic impact from their calculation."
"Okay. And then last question, just on Texas, and I know you kind of answered this and the hydrogen hub sounds exciting. That just feels like that just takes time, but there's just so many other dynamic economic things, whether it's data centers or other industrial. Just could you just give maybe a little more ﬂavor of kind of CenterPoint's ability to get to opportunity set related to the growth in Texas?","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. You know, what I would say is, I don't think you can ﬁnd a more dynamic setting anywhere in the country, particularly on electric sales growth than you can here. Residential load growth continues to be best in class, right. We continue to see the industrial load growth that I mentioned, transportation electric load growth. And I think that's really reﬂective in our sales numbers for the ﬁrst quarter. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, when we adjust for weather, sales are up 8% over ﬁrst quarter last year, driven by strong residential,   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   commercial and large industrial growth. There's electriﬁcation at one of our nation's largest ports here in Houston. You know, we continue to see incremental growth in the petrochem complex. We're becoming, you know, one of the dominant areas in the country for life sciences.  And so what I would say is, basically, the growth that you see in any one sector, including data centers around the country, we see it in all of those sectors here in the Greater Houston area. And so I see it showing up in the numbers this quarter and I see it driving continued growth, you know, at least through the remainder of the decade, if not well beyond."
"Hey, Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of things have been answered, but I guess just on your comment about kind of pursuing state and federal incentives for this plan, you know, it sounds like some of this is grants, but some of it's also DOE loans. But can you just kind of talk, I think it's very helpful from a ﬁnancing beneﬁt and from a customer aﬀordability beneﬁt, but how do we kind of think about the contribution from EPS if you were to kind of pursue state programs rather than kind of traditional ﬁnancing?","Hi, Good morning. I think about it, just to be clear, very small, right. We're really talking about a component here where we're looking at the federal programs from the loan standpoint, as you mentioned, as well as the speciﬁcity that we provided around the GRIP program that's there, which has already been ﬁled. We've also got some Texas Department of Energy -- excuse me, emergency management funds that we've also asked for on the state level. Those would be in the form of grants. Again, just a situation where we can get better outcomes in total for customers. I don't know, Jason, if you want to give kind of color on higher level how it informs the EPS guide?     Yeah. Thanks, Chris. What we've consistently said, Nick, is that we'll come back after these rate cases next year and provide new 10-year plan, you know, well into the mid-2030s that are reﬂecting our continued conﬁdence of long-term growth. What I want to highlight though are, you know, there's been a handful of things that we've been able to accomplish since we rolled out that guidance, the long-term EPS guidance, which is, you know, again, 8% growth here in 2024 and then the mid to high end of the 6% to 8% range through 2030. And what I would say is, you know, that we certainly have more tailwinds than we have headwinds. You know, from a tailwind standpoint, we had some success in the legislative session helping reduce some   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   regulatory lag in key jurisdictions. You know, as I mentioned previously, we've increased CapEx since we've issued that guidance by more than 10%.  You know, the third thing that I'd point to is, you know, last quarter when we announced the sale of Louisiana, Mississippi and the recycling of that capital, that's moving what is nearly $800 million of rate base and $1 billion of CapEx into jurisdictions that earn a higher return. And I'd be remiss to say that, you know, obviously interest rates are a little higher and we've announced a modest equity program. But suﬃce it to say the tailwinds here exceed the headwinds. And as we get to the other side of these rate cases, we'll be in a better position to give a kind of a long- term comprehensive update to the earnings guidance for the company."
"That's great. And I guess just a kind of a follow-up on, you know, high-grading the plan here. You mentioned in your prepared remarks the higher for longer interest rate environment and you know, expectations I think across the market have certainly changed, you know, from January to today on the trajectory of rates. Can you just kind of remind us on, you know, not necessarily what you're assuming if you don't want to comment, but just how the plan is kind of provisioned into the back half of this year and then going forward, if we do kind of continue to be higher for longer here?","Sure thing, Nick. And I'll just say, you know, as we are building the plan heading into 2023, and I don't know that any of us really could have perfectly predicted the impact there, but I think you saw the company execute well and overcome that pressure. As we look into 2024, walking into the year, we deﬁnitely plan conservatively there. And I -- you know, it's hard for me to be too speciﬁc, but just know that as you look across our plan, I hope that you've seen we're consistently bringing forward conservatism so that there are no surprises in the end. I think it's the same thing on our capital programs, right. As we folded in CapEx over time, we're making sure we're doing so conservatively as we see the opportunity to execute it, to ﬁnance it and recover it. So it really holds on the same side in terms of higher for longer. We walked into this year assuming this was going to be the case."
"Just wondering, going back to the SRP here, if you could frame overall wildﬁre mitigation needs relative to the $140 million in the SRP ﬁling? And looking more broadly, how might SRP capital composition evolve over time from this ﬁrst application? And what does the SRP investment runway look like at this point?","Yeah. Thanks for the comprehensive question. Look, from a wildﬁre standpoint, as you highlighted, $140 million isn't a signiﬁcant driver of the overall $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion plan. I think it's important to understand why. You know, 60% of our system is currently underground. You know, and Jeremy, as I know you know, we have high relative humidity here. So all things being equal, we have signiﬁcantly lower wildﬁre risk than our peers. That being said, obviously, we haven't sat on our hands. We've been addressing this risk with changes in operations, shutting oﬀ automatic reclosers, enhanced inspections during periods of higher wildﬁre risk. But this plan basically addresses about 1% of overhead miles that are in higher ﬁre risk areas. And so this is probably under the current set of conditions suﬃcient to mitigate our wildﬁre risk.  Now obviously, we're going to continue to look at weather patterns, drought patterns to see how that evolves over time. But I don't really see the wildﬁre mitigations being a signiﬁcant long-term driver of CapEx. Where I do see further opportunity beyond this plan is really on the distribution side. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have been really focused on hardening the backbone of our system, the electric transmission and the substation ﬂood control eﬀorts. We will largely be through those programs by the end of this ﬁrst cycle. And so the real opportunities I mentioned is on the distribution side going forward and really creating kind of a more resilient, reliable overhead electric system for our customers. So more to come on that front. We're happy to make this ﬁrst ﬁling and I see the opportunity for continued CapEx growth as we make subsequent ﬁlings in the future."
Got it. Makes sense. If there's one thing we know is that Houston is humid. I'll leave it there. Thank you.,"Operator, I think we have time for one more question, please.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. One moment. And the last question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open."
"Hey, thanks for giving me time. I appreciate it. I'll ask two very quick questions and I'll ask them together. Just ﬁrst, can you help us sort of pin out a timeline for the resiliency plan approval, what to look for there? And then, second, Jason, in your comments, you mentioned regulatory lag as a tailwind opportunity. Can you just quickly remind us what your earned regulated ROEs are as of the end of the ﬁrst quarter? Thank you.","Yeah. Thanks, Durgesh, for the questions. On the ﬁrst side, the timeline for approval of the resiliency plan, I think the legislation called for about a six-month approval period. What I will say is this is ﬁrst-of-its-kind legislation. So we'll have to kind of get in the middle of it. I'm sure there will be a number of parties sort of intervening, but I would look towards the tail end of this year, calendar year to, you know, get a ﬁnal decision on the resiliency plan that we ﬁled. You know, on the question on regulatory lag, you know, we've historically seen, particularly here in the Texas business, about 150 basis points on average regulatory lag. And what I would say is we've sort of meaningfully reduced that amount. But it's an odd time to really be calculating kind of what regulatory lag is at the end of the ﬁrst quarter just because we're in the middle of our rate case ﬁling. And as a result, we don't have access to the full complement of capital recovery mechanisms that we will have sort of on the other side of this rate case. And so just know that we've taken steps to begin to reduce that historical regulatory lag, and I think we'll be in a place that gives sort of a more normalized view of that on the other side of the rate case."
That's very helpful. Thank you so much again. Appreciate the time.,"Yeah. Thanks, Durgesh.     Okay. Operator, with that, that concludes our call for the quarter. Thanks, everyone, for joining.
