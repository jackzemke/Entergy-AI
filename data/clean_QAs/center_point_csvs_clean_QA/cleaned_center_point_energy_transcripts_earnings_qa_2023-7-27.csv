Question,Answer
"Good. Thank you. Just diving in a little bit more on the CapEx increase here. With the $400 million CapEx increase in Texas legislation beneﬁts, how do these items position you on EPS basis relative to your current guidance? And can you walk us through the timing and magnitude of these beneﬁts? And are there any hurdles to formalizing in the growth outlook here?","Yes, let me give you maybe a 50,000-foot view of how we see the sort of recent legislative outcomes, and then Jason can go into more of the details. But clearly, point one would be it was a very successful legislative session that is going to clearly beneﬁt our customers and our other stakeholders and of course shareholders over time.  I think it's important, though, to understand that these laws will basically get layered in over diﬀerent time frames, and Jason can add a little color on that. But I think the real point is the one that Chris sort of ended his comments with. This is just really another tailwind for CenterPoint going forward. So, we really like the outcome. We think it's going to be great for everybody. But Jason, maybe you can give a little more color in and around the timing and potential impact.     Thanks, Dave, and thanks for the question, Jeremy. Clearly this incremental capital we folded in the plan, the successful legislative session, just continue to further strengthen what we believe is already the industry's most tangible long-term growth plan. Maybe to more speciﬁcally answer some of your questions. The bills that I highlighted in my prepared remarks take a signiﬁcant step in terms of reducing regulatory lag and helping us earn closer to our allowed return when using kind of our year-end rate base.  The beneﬁt of the two DCRFs per year will somewhat be a function of the capital spend, but that beneﬁt when you couple it with a recovery of incentive comp should be roughly $0.05 to   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   $0.07 per year. And the earnings beneﬁt for the resiliency bill will obviously be shaped through the rulemaking proceeding and our eventual ﬁling, but I think a good rule of thumb is it should have at least one penny beneﬁt for every $300 million of CapEx eligible for that resiliency deﬁnition.  And so in terms of kind of when we should feel the impact and timing of those beneﬁts, As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we will likely ﬁle a second DCRF this year. So that will, on a full year basis, begin impacting earnings in 2024. The remainder of the earnings beneﬁts from these recent legislations will likely follow our rate case. So think about those sort of ﬂowing into our plan more in 2025 and beyond. And so at the end of the day, this continues to be yet kind of another tailwind that just further strengthens an already great plan."
"Got it. That's great to hear there. And maybe just looking at the regulatory calendar more broadly here, some of the rate case timing has shifted. And just wondering if you could speak more to the regulatory calendar over the next 18 months and really how you see these cases setting up the business for the period thereafter.","Yes, no, thanks, Jeremy. It's going to be a busy period of rate case regulatory activity. Let me just quickly run through those, as we talked about in prepared comments. We've shifted the timing of our Texas Gas rate case to likely November this year. Right about that same time, we'll be ﬁling our Minnesota rate case and Indiana Electric rate case as well, and then we'll likely follow that with the Houston Electric rate case.  Probably sometime late ﬁrst quarter next year, and so obviously there's a number of rate cases that we'll have in front of us. I want to continue to reemphasize, though, given the great work the company has done managing O&M, I anticipate, particularly in the Texas Gas and the Houston Electric rate case, ﬁling a relatively ﬂat revenue requirement increase, which I think will be a constructive signal for resolution of those cases.  On the Minnesota Gas case, that's a case we ﬁle every two years, and really just sort of reﬂects the capital that we intend to spend to modernize our gas system up in Minnesota. And then Indiana Electric, much of the capital that will be subject to that case has already been reviewed as part of some of our regular ongoing ﬁles with respect to our grid modernization program as well as our generation transition plan.  So while it's a very busy upcoming regulatory calendar, we continue to feel like we're putting our best foot forward for our customers and our shareholders."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And the last one, if I could here. With the recent Indiana IRP ﬁling, just wondering how has stakeholder engagement trended into the formal launch here? Is there any notable early highlights on this front?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","I'm really proud of the team's eﬀorts with respect to engaging our stakeholders up in Southwestern Indiana. I think that there was a lot of good feedback on the depth of the conversations, on the alternatives that were considered. And so I feel like we're putting a plan that has probably the opportunity for the broadest possible support going forward to close that coal, third and ﬁnal coal facility.  Again, I just want to reemphasize, the plan we're putting forward is the least cost option to continue to serve our customers up in Southwestern Indiana with a reliable and cleaner energy supply mix. And I think that will come through as we work our way, not only through the IRP, but then ultimately the ﬁlings for each of those projects."
"Hey, good morning. If I could hit up Dave and maybe a follow-up with Chris. Dave, I just want to, tough loss last night against the crosstown rival there, a quarter was better than a game. But just, I guess, on Jeremy's question, but moving more towards 2023, just the headwinds and tailwinds that you're seeing for just 2023, I mean, you're coming in ﬁrst half of the year at, I guess, like $0.58, leaning above the midpoint of where guidance would be just ﬁrst half of the year. What are the tailwinds that get to maybe slightly above or just maybe address what are the tailwinds are headwinds for the remainder of 2023?","Yes, how about let me let Chris answer his ﬁrst question as a center point CFO on that one, because he's the one who every day has to track the headwinds and the tailwinds. But I would just say, as I think a number of us have reiterated, we believe that the tailwinds are greater than the headwinds on us right now, but I'll let Chris tell you why.     Yes, thanks, Dave. And Anthony, thanks for the question. And as you heard me in the prepared remarks, we are beyond the halfway point here. We are beyond halfway through our EPS guidance. And there's a couple of diﬀerent things I want to point out for you.  First is just emphasizing that as you look at the back half of the year, we've got another roughly $220 million in additional revenues from the 2022 distribution investments and our assumption around the mobile generation ﬁling. And so those are either just updated or we anticipate   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   those will be recovered later this year. So those are good tailwinds because really they're just weighted toward the back half of the year.  Weather's been more of a mixed bag for us, deﬁnitely been trending nicely of late. And the impact of the milder winter we had across our jurisdictions in Q1 has been a bit oﬀset from the hotter summer thus far, which has speciﬁcally been the case here in Houston. And as Houston remains hot, the weather impacts we're seeing are kind of normalizing some of what we're seeing for the balance of the year. And I should say we're generally conservative when we're incorporating weather impacts into our plan in the ﬁrst place.  It's no surprise on the headwind side that they're really interest rate driven. As you can imagine, we've been actively working those since last year. And so we continue to assume high rates as we go through the remainder of the year. And we're taking active steps. You've probably seen to move and improve our position, one of those is the move to fund SIGCO on a standalone basis. And there we were reducing its reliance on roughly $450 million of intercompany debt for the parent, right?  So that allows us to take advantage of the relative lower cost of debt thanks to its higher rating. So we collectively put these together. We like where we are at this stage of the year."
"And then just to follow up on Slide 9, you kind of addressed it on the prepared remarks on the, I guess, credit ratings. We see a decline from, 4Q '22 15.4%, to 13.9%. I think maybe that trends back to 14% to 15%. But just what's the thought between the potential for maybe upgrade to Baa1 versus, a fatter cushion at a Baa2 rating?","Sure. So, let me just start with the 13.9% that we're talking about this morning is, is in line with our plan. And so, we had consistently anticipated this quarter really was going to be the trough for a couple of reasons. First is on the debt side. We've got an incremental of roughly $1 billion, of debt in line that's directly in line with feeding our capital plans. And we were front-loading -- excuse me, we were front-loading funding at the start of the year.  Then as you look at the cash ﬂow side, as we've previously mentioned, the annual revenue requirement increases of roughly $400 million -- $430 million this year are anticipated. So over $200 million of that is going to become eﬀective from September onward toward the back end of the year. So if you combine these with higher weather receipts, we see it being additive to the balance of the year's operating cash ﬂows. On the, I do also have to say on the qualitative side, if we're making progress on some of these legislative and then regulatory implementation outcomes, we do see some beneﬁt there over time as we're spending time with the rating agencies."
"Good morning. I guess, Dave, just ﬁrst oﬀ, can you just touch a little bit on what you meant in your prepared remarks? I'm going to paraphrase a little bit here that you now see opportunities well above the $2.6 billion CapEx that remains out by the plan. I guess, can you deﬁne kind of what you mean by well above and the source of the opportunity? So what states are you seeing those? And do you anticipate some of that $400 million increase in '23 to be recurring CapEx in the later years as we're thinking about kind of the run rate?","Yes, good question. Let me have Jason answer that one.     Yes, thanks, Shar, for the question. We've indicated since our very ﬁrst Analyst Day that we think that there are a signiﬁcant number of capital investments that we can make in our customers' interest. And Dave's expression of capital investments beyond the $2.6 billion that we've kind of identiﬁed but not yet incorporated in the plan continue to reﬂect that conﬁdence. It really kind of runs the gamut across our gas and electric business. We'll start ﬁrst with sort of resiliency, we incorporated a signiﬁcant uplift around particularly enhancing grid resiliency here at Houston Electric last year, but I think that there's some potential for more to be done there.  I think when we look at the electric transmission side, I think here in the state of Texas, I think all stakeholders will support the fact that there is more transmission needed to help alleviate congestion and help support the continued economic growth of the greater Houston area. So there's the potential for electric transmission upside.  I think there are also opportunities on the gas side, particularly kind of given the continued growth of our gas systems, potentially incremental gas transmission related projects as we kind   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   of enhance capacity to serve kind of our growing market. So those are just a handful of the opportunities. I think for us, there is an abundant -- abundance of opportunities like CapEx and our focus will continue to be as we've emphasized, on evaluating whether or not we can eﬃciently execute it for our customers, that we can eﬃciently ﬁnance it for our shareholders, and that we can eﬃciently recover it in rates.  And I think we've, as a management team, earned a track record of folding capital into the plan as soon as we see, line of sight on all three of those dimensions. Case in point today, we're increasing, our annual guidance here for 2023 by 11%, as it relates to what that $400 million increase could do going forward, I do think it puts us in a position to more consistently execute at this higher level of capital moving forward. We're just continuing to evaluate our ability to ﬁnance it eﬃciently and recover it timely, particularly given the fact that we're entering a pretty heavy rate case period, where during that time frame, we don't have access to some of these capital trackers that we've been discussing."
"Okay. So, Jason, lastly, and you bring up a good point, I'm getting a lot of questions this morning on the eﬃcient ﬁnancing angle of it, right? And obviously, you guys still mentioned no equity in plan. You guys are kind of at the lower end of that target range as we're thinking about credit metrics. I guess, what do you mean by eﬃcient ﬁnancing? Is there any kind of balance sheet repair embedded in the current plan, internal or external? And where does sort of incremental regulated asset sales kind of ﬁt in the mix there? Thank you very much.","Yes. Let me just be very direct. There's no balance sheet repair in the plan. I do think that this focus kind of on our set of credit metrics is, I don't know, I'll say respectfully a bit misplaced. I would rather continue to maintain a healthy cushion between our actual metrics and our downgrade threshold. That remains our commitment, targeting, as we've previously discussed, around 150 basis points.  Some of peer companies that are often cited for having better credit metrics, while they may have a higher targeted set of credit metrics, they also have a higher downgrade threshold and so they have less cushion. What we're focused on is maintaining this healthy cushion between where we're running the company and our downgrade threshold. So, our focus has been on de-levering this year. Chris highlighted a number of diﬀerent opportunities where we've also turned out variable rate debt as we're in a period of transition this year with a number of strategic transactions. We'll continue to look at opportunities to do that.  And again, I just want to emphasize what Chris said about our credit metrics at the end of the second quarter. The end of the second quarter is the period of time, just the way our capital recovery mechanisms work, where we have sort of the tightest set of credit metrics. Our -- the revenues we get from our capital trackers are deﬁnitely backend loaded, and so you will undoubtedly see an improvement in those metrics as we start to collect on the capital that we deployed in 2022 here in the back half of 2023."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. Okay, perfect. Thank you guys, I appreciate it. Mr.Foster, congrats on your ﬁrst CenterPoint earnings call. Thanks, guys.","I appreciate it, Shar. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you very much for the time. Hope you guys are doing well. So just wanted to follow up here on the last set of questions, including Shar's. Just talking about the, if you want to call it the new norm here, I wanted to clarify a little bit, as you think about this elevated level of spending, more likely post the next rate case, right? Given the recovery dynamics in '24, I just want to clarify in setting expectations following the last comment. And then to that end, how do you think about the associated ﬁnancing considerations or opportunities in '25 when, post this rate case, if you could address that a little bit? How do you think about, balancing both sides of that equation here in the '25? And I've got to follow up.","Yes, that's a great question for Chris to answer.     Sure, Julien, you're right in terms of the thinking about the rate case timeframe. If you just step back and look at it, the kind of last case among the ones that Jason referenced earlier would be the Houston Electric case. So we'd be ﬁling that anticipating, Q1 of 2024 anticipates somewhere around a year to get it resolved.  So that timing would put us somewhere in kind of Q1 of 2025, where we'd be on the other side of really the critical mass of all these cases that are in front of us. And so that put us probably at that stage to be in a position to give everybody a more robust update with respect to really the plan through 2030 and with the potential for extending earnings guidance targets really beyond that, as we'll have greater visibility at that stage.  In terms of ﬁnancing, I have to say, I mean, Jason mentioned our emphasis really on maintaining the cushion as it relates to FFO to debt. You should also just keep in mind that we're consistently looking at really the debt stack that we have at present state and eﬃciently ﬁnancing that, but also we are also evaluating opportunities like the DOE loan program as well, right, at this stage, looking to pull in other opportunities to create ﬁnancing that is actually cheaper for our customers. So a lot of opportunity there in front of us."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Excellent. Thanks for clarifying to clarify that. And then coming back to this resiliency ﬁling, I mean, it would seem like a lot of your capital that is non growth would potentially be eligible for this resiliency ﬁling. Can you talk a little bit about the extent of that eligibility here? As you think about it, and also how that resiliency ﬁling could ﬁlter into A, your any potential further CapEx revisions and B, into the rate case itself. I know they might be somewhat in parallel here if you will.","Yes. Thanks for the question, Julien. Ultimately, this is going to be deﬁned by the rulemaking proceeding. That's going to be in front of the commission. Now, those rules should be established by the end of '23 and then ultimately our ﬁling.  But let me just kind of try to put some high level thoughts around this. I think clearly some of the investments related to create hardening our grant, right? Potential undergrounding a distribution lines, shorter spans, composite poles, et cetera. That all ﬁts sort of squarely in the deﬁnition of resiliency. I think there's also clearly work that can be incorporated through bench management. I think what we need to work with the commission on is maybe some other aspects, including kind of IT-related spending can help from an analytical standpoint and or reduce concern around kind of IT kind of resource availability for weather-related events.  And so, I think conservatively you could probably say there's at least $0.5 billion to $1 billion a year of capital at CE that could qualify for that resiliency deﬁnition. Ultimately, again, it's going to be shaped by the rulemaking proceeding in our ﬁling, but probably somewhere in that zip code.  I think what's important, I think you highlighted it, Julien. The way the mechanisms work here in Texas, the company is eligible for recovering or eﬀectively keeping the growth and revenues associated with, customer account increases. And so about half our capital at CE relates to connecting new customers. So if you think about, that supports a higher level of revenues, there's really very limited regulatory lag on that growth related capital, where we've historically seen our regulatory lag is on our resiliency related investments, having to kind of wait for the capital trackers to come in. By being able to defer the carrying costs of those investments, depreciation, interest, et cetera. Between the time we put that capital into service, and before we start to recover it in rates, we're all but eﬀectively beginning to eliminate regulatory lag at CE and so I just want to underscore just how important, this bill was to continuing to improve our ability to earn, at or allowed return at Houston Electric. And so hopefully that kind of starts to begin to shape a little bit of that resiliency ﬁling, but more to come as the PCT works through the rulemaking and we ultimately ﬁle ﬁrst quarter next year."
Good morning. We've -- let's see we've seen some indications of gas utilities on the market in terms of M&A potential. I was just wondering your latest thoughts on the mix of businesses balance sheet and how that could weave into funding needs over time?,"Yes, thanks David for the question. We love our business mix, we strategically as part of kind of the reset several years ago, said we'd have a slight bias towards sort of the growth in the electric business here in Houston. But our split of roughly call it 60% electric 40% gas is I think a very good split.  That being said, as it kind of gets back to sort of your broader question, as we've indicated on previous responses to questions here. We don't have a need for equity to fund our plan, we don't have a need for asset sales. We continue, though, to receive a signiﬁcant amount of inbound interest on all of our assets. Obviously, there's a number of processes sort of underway across the country, I think continues to reﬂect that there's a high demand for at least high quality utility related assets.  And so we don't have any need to sell any of assets. We're happy with our proﬁle, but we'll always continue to have an eye towards optimizing our plan for the beneﬁt of our customers and our shareholders.     Yes, I guess -- this is Dave. I guess the way I think about it, I think you should think about it is, we are in such a great position right now with the assets we have. We can just sit back and play oﬀense. We don't have to play defense at this point in time, which really gives us an opportunity to be very opportunistic with our business as we go forward. So I think that to me is the bottom line, is we really have preserved almost all our optionality on any direction we want to go.  And as Jason said, the inbound inquiries we get on essentially every piece of our business continue to be there every day. So we really like where we are, but we really don't have to do anything other than execute, I think, which is the greatest plan that's out there in the utility space."
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could just give thoughts on the Indiana Electric rate case coming up later this year in terms of that ﬁling. I was just wondering if you'd expect there to be big items or revenue requirement speciﬁcs or would this be a fairly standard kind of growth-driven rate case that you'd expect to ﬁle?,"Yes. Thanks, David. I appreciate the question. I mean, I think largely it'll be a rate case where we have signaled and actually previewed with the commission and stakeholders many of the elements. I think there are a number of constructive mechanisms up in Indiana. For instance, our grid-related investments on our transmission distribution system. We make a separate ﬁling in advance. We then execute upon it and report.  And so this will be sort of a true-up of the execution of a plan that we've already ﬁled and reviewed several times with the commission. Similarly, on the Generation Transition Plan, not only have we ﬁled an IRP, but then we ﬁled for the individual project approvals. So much of the kind of element of that case will already be previewed between the -- with all the key stakeholders. That being said, rates continue to be a focus in Southwestern Indiana, and I would anticipate that will be part of the conversation there as we ﬁle the case."
"Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one question for me. You obviously a lot of good markets here you mentioned no equity for the planned $43 billion -- you mentioned that you may need some equity as we go beyond that. Just any sort of color you can provide on timing, historically like Q3 last year you provided a big CapEx update. Just any color on timing when we could see the big CapEx update and potentially a new ﬁnancing plan. Is it after you go through the rate cases? Any color would be appreciated there. Thank you.","Hi, Durgesh. Thanks for the question. In short, yes, we've got a really important set of cases that are right here in front of us. Jason mentioned how well we're positioned going into them, given the aﬀordability proﬁle for our customers, but that really is going to be where the short-term emphasis is. So I really would kind of direct you toward the backend that I referenced where we're going to be in a really good position at that stage with the clarity provided through all   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   those cases to be able to revisit some of those targets and give you a better feel for how we'll ﬁnance them.  But I have to say, as you heard this morning, it's really, we're going to consistently look at this as we go, right? As we ﬁnd opportunities to eﬃciently execute, to fund them and recover the revenues, we're going to consistently see if there's opportunity to pull in some of the capital that was referenced earlier. So hopefully that helps give you some color."
"It does. Thanks, Chris. And congrats on your ﬁrst CenterPoint earnings call. Thanks. Thanks, guys.","Thank you.     Great. Operator, with that, I think that's going to conclude our call here for the second quarter of 2023. Thanks, everyone, for dialing in.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for participating.
