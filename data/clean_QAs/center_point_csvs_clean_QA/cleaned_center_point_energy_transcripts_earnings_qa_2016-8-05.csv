Question,Answer
"Just regarding the Enable strategy, I know you can't comment much on that, but with the ROFO notice that you provided to OGE, if they do make an oﬀer for your stake in Enable in the coming weeks, how does that impact, if any, your ability to still potentially pursue the spinoﬀ? Just wanted to make sure -- depending on what they say on the stake and whether you have some oﬀers outstanding with other third parties, if that bounds you toward the sell option versus still having a spinoﬀ option.","Insoo, good morning. It's Bill. The spin-oﬀ and the consideration of sale are two separate tracks. So if OG&E were to make an oﬀer to CenterPoint for CenterPoint stakes, then, we are not obligated to accept that oﬀer."
"Understood. Okay. I know you guys can't comment much more on that, so I'll leave it there. But just moving to the electric utility, given customer growth has been above forecast for the past couple of quarters, how do you see the customer growth for the balance of the year and outlook for future years? I know you've mentioned 2% annual growth as sort of a target, but it seems like it's been trending a little bit higher.","Yeah, Insoo. This is Scott. We continue to see a strong customer growth as you obviously noted and we posted in our results. We see all signs pointing to that continuing. We continue to track the leading indicators about housing development, and that continues to be strong. I will say that one area that may provide a little softening would be multifamily homes. That market is getting a little long here. But I think what that would do is that would probably tend to drive our growth rate from perhaps slightly above 2%, down closer to 2%, nothing that I would consider   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   to be problematic. But that could be the downside piece of it. But other than that, we continue to see very strong local development."
"Scott, ﬁrst question, as you are continuing to look at strategically what to do with Enable, can you tell us what are some of the big milestones or what is it that you're looking at in terms of reaching your ﬁnal conclusion for that? And related to that, if the sale option were to be exercised by you, have you been able to resolve the tax issue, or will that still be the same as you've talked about in the past?","Ali, I'll provide a little bit of comment on this. I'll let Bill comment on the tax piece of it. But our options are essentially the same as we communicated in the past, and that is to look at a sale or a spin.  The timing is such that – as we've indicated, we're just continuing to step through the process. Providing the ROFO notice to OGE was one step in the process. And so we're just going to continue marching down that path, with the expectations that we'll be able to provide an update to you all by – certainly by the end of the year. Bill, would you like to comment on the tax question?     Certainly. Good morning, Ali. The tax consideration is still there. As we've discussed, we have negative basis in our investment in Enable Midstream, and, therefore a sale for cash would   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   result in a signiﬁcant taxable gain."
"Okay. And the sale option, I guess, that reminded me, and you mentioned that, sale for stock would still be an option within that sale option.",Yes. So there's potential to defer an eventual recognition of the gain through a sale for stock or some other currency. We would likely get there if we went on that structure through a reorganization under the tax code.
"Okay. And last question, Scott, there's a lot of consolidation going on – on the regulatory front both in the gas and electric side. Just wanted to get a sense of what your current view is as you're looking at the landscape around you and other opportunities that you guys could potentially capitalize on?","Ali, yes. I certainly observed the same thing you are, and that is that there have been a number of consolidations. The strategy that we have is still very much centered around the investment we can make in our utilities in our current service territories. So our focus continues to be around the $1.3 billion-plus we're spending on our own utilities and growing those utilities to meet the needs of our customers and grow our earnings along with that."
"Hey, guys. I think Dave is going to hate me because I have a couple of them for you. One is simple. In your multiyear – your EPS growth rate guidance for 2017 and 2018, do you assume Enable earnings contribution grows, shrinks or stay ﬂat in that period? I'm trying to just kind of think about the puts and take between utility, regulated utility earnings growth versus kind of consolidated EPS growth.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Michael, as you know, Enable has not put out any information beyond this current year. That said, we have looked at a number of possible growth rates that could come from Enable, and we've tested that against our capabilities at the utility, and combined, under a number of diﬀerent scenarios, we feel comfortable that we can achieve that 4% to 6% rate."
"Got it. So even if Enable were to decline in 2017 and 2018, you're still pretty comfortable getting the 4% to 6% consolidated growth rate.","Yes. We've looked at – like I said, Mike, we've looked at a number of scenarios, and one of them would be one where the growth rates have not returned for that segment as they had been in the past."
"Got it. One question on the Houston business, the CEHE business. I want to make sure I understand the DCRF. The $45 million, what is the incremental amount that's going into rates in September of 2016?","Michael, this is Tracy. We don't think about it as an incremental amount because every year, the revenue requirement is determined on a standalone basis. You might recall that a year ago, we implemented a rate increase of $16 million, and now we're going to be implementing a rate increase of $45 million, but the two are not related because we calculate the revenue requirement independently every year. So, if you're modeling it, just put in $45 million on an annualized basis starting September 1, 2016."
"Yes. But I got to know what's in your current numbers, right, because otherwise we could be overstating – we could be completely misstating. So I'm just trying to make the bridge here.","So the revenue for 2016 for DCRF would be $16.2 million, and the revenue for 2017 would be $53.8 million. Okay?"
"I assume that's what that is, but I'm just making sure I'm understanding that correctly.","That's what it implies, yes.     Yeah. So, Michael, that would be a $4 million step up assuming we did not make another DCRF ﬁling next year."
So this doesn't preclude you from making another DCRF ﬁling next year?,"Yeah. That's correct. Right. We can make another ﬁling next year. And then we would go through a whole new determination, and then it would be a new number that would be in place of the $45 million that's here today."
"I appreciate that. Thank you, Scott. Much, much, much, much more clear there. Much appreciate it.",Yes.  Operator  And your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Just a clariﬁcation on disclosure maybe. When OGE responds within their 30 days on the ROFO, either way, would that be something you're going to disclose what their response is?","Steve, we'll look at the required disclosure at that time, and that, of course, would depend on their response."
"Okay. And then my understanding is, just to be clear, once they've responded, either way, you then have 120 days to basically transact and, after which, the process starts again. Is that right?","Yes. Just to put some clarity on that, Steve, they have 30 days to respond to the ROFO. If they did not respond, then we would move forward with a solicitation of oﬀers, although we're not precluded from doing that at this time. If they did respond, then we would have 30 days to respond to their oﬀer, and then subsequent to that, we would have the 120 days."
"Okay. That's great. And then just on the mark-to-market hit that you took on the Enable hedges, do you expect that will come back to you by the end of the year?","Steve, again it's Bill. If nothing happened other than the forward curve staying the same at June 30, and they didn't enter into any more hedges, as it played out much but not all of that would come back in 2016 with a balance in 2017. But should gas prices go higher, under mark-to- market accounting that could impact what Enable records, or should it go lower or go the other way. So it very much depends upon where gas prices are at each quarterly statement period."
"I had another question around Enable and the possible tax leakage from a sale. If OGE were to make an oﬀer that you would accept, would the same tax consequences arise as if it were a third-party buyer? Would you still be on the hook for the negative tax basis, or is there something diﬀerent about OGE being a buyer?","Neel, it's Bill. Good morning. There's no diﬀerence between OGE and any other buyer with respect to tax consequences."
"Okay. Great. And I noticed in the presentation that you noted that you wouldn't need equity for 2016 and 2017, but I wanted to just understand under what scenario you could possibly need equity 2018 and beyond. Would it be that you found additional growth projects that would kind of put you at the top or above the 6% growth rate at the utilities, or is it something else, or do you feel that you don't need any equity at all until the end of the decade or further?","Neel, here's how do we get to our thinking on equity. We take a look at our credit metrics, principally FFO to debt, and we're currently at approximately 20%. We want to maintain that because we like our credit ratings. Admittedly, we think we have some debt capacity within that. But if that were to erode, then we would consider equity. And that could erode from any number of factors, including, as you said, a higher rate of capital investment."
"Okay. And with the Enable stake, if that were to decline, would that be something that would cause you to issue equity, or do you view that as a separate entity that's self-funding?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Enable, in 2015, was under 20% of our cash ﬂow in the way we think about our internally generated cash ﬂow. So it's signiﬁcant but we'd have to take a look at what the credit metrics would be for us and what that might imply for equity at that time."
"Just want to follow up on the Enable situation, and if you were to sell your stake there and receive stock against that, and then you were to subsequently distribute that stock, would that introduce tax leakage as well, or would that be a way to mitigate that?","Good morning, Jeremy. I'm going to restate what you posited, and then if I don't get that right, correct me. But you're assuming we would sell for stock and would not have a taxable recognition at that time, and then we would spend whatever we received out to shareholders. Is that correct?"
"Yes, spend it out to shareholders. That's right.",Right. So we have not contemplated that strategy. I think that would have some combination of the tax eﬀects you would either have in a sale for stock and a spin.
"Okay. Thanks. And just with the whole strategic review process here, I'm just wondering if you could help us into your thought process. While the commodities have softened a little bit recently, it seems like the cycle has turned a bit. So, I'm just wondering how that enters into the calculus of your decisions here with the cycle getting better?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Well, it certainly is nice to see the commodities turning around as they have, but we went into this evaluation geared at looking for alternatives to reduce the volatility associated with this earnings stream. So, we're continuing our process. We're going to continue through even as commodities are improving because we want to see if there's a way to reduce that volatility in a way that could create value for our shareholders."
"Great. Thanks. And then one just quick one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there was a slug of the energy resources debt $325 million that matured in May. I was just wondering what happened to that, if that was reﬁnanced or if we should take any meaning from that?","You're correct. $325 million did mature in May. We met that maturity with cash ﬂow generated at CERC (39.00) and short-term borrowings. As I said on March on this call, we were cash ﬂow positive for this ﬁrst six months of the year, including investments on CapEx on behalf of our customers and including dividends paid to our shareholders."
"Just to clarify, is OGE required to respond with a yes or a no, or can they just not respond and that's just an implied no?","Brian, good morning. It's Bill. The latter is correct. They can stay silent."
"Got it. Okay. And then also to clarify, the decision not to pursue the REIT structure for the Texas assets, does that conclude all strategic alternative reviews, or are there other options that you're looking at?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Brian, that concludes our strategic review of the concept of a REIT for utility assets, but our other review underway is the consideration around our Enable ownership. And as we've said, that's still ongoing."
"Thanks, guys. Really a couple of just housekeeping items. In terms of the marketing business or Energy Services business that you acquired, when you acquired it, you said that combined with your existing operations and the acquisition, you'd generate anywhere from $40 million to $50 million in operating income. That number seems to be a little higher now. Could you just talk about that real quick?","Joe, do you want to take that one?     Sure. Good morning, Nick. This is Joe. Yes, that's correct. We have increased that guidance for our Energy Services business, given the integration of the business and some improved performance at our CES base business, so we are now comfortable that we will be in the $45 million to $55 million range in the ﬁrst full year which is 2017."
"Okay. And then I guess one of the aspects that you mentioned that would help you meet your EPS guidance in the outer years is O&M or operating cost reductions or not as much growth. But if I look at your O&M expenses, they seem to have been growing by about 5%. Can you just talk about what's driving that and how you guys view that?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. So the 5% that you see on the chart includes some items that have revenue oﬀsets. So if you back that out and you consider some timing aspects of spend on a quarter-to-quarter basis, we're still conﬁdent we can manage this expense in that around 2% to 3% range."
"Hey, Bill, just based on your comment, the eﬀective tax rate, the 37% was really just a one-time thing and – just assuming business as usual with respect to Enable going forward from a modeling standpoint, still 35%, 36% would be a long term rate?",Yes. I would advise using 36% per our provision. It's just going to be 37% this year due to the change in Louisiana Law.
"Okay. And then second question was for Tracy. Right away revenues, remind me or – I mean I know they're going down, but are we still talking $5 million to $10 million in total this year? I forgot what you've said in the past.","Good morning, Charles. We're projecting $10 million to $20 million of right-of-way in miscellaneous revenue this year."
"$10 million to $20 million, which is still an elevated level over normalized, correct?","Well, it depends on what you mean by normalized. Certainly, 10 years ago and beyond that, it would be much lower, but we've had some pretty strong miscellaneous revenues in the last few years, as you recall.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"I see. I understand. Okay. Next question, I guess, is for – well, I guess it's for anybody who wants to answer it, but the hot weather in that area tends to get super hot, and I understand it's approaching 100-degree weather, so maybe Tracy is the best person to ask this question. Are you guys having any issues with infrastructure overheating or melting down, or having any kind of equipment problems even with trucks or anything like that?","Good morning. We're not. The system is holding up very well. Unlike some parts of the country, we're accustomed to this humidity, and so the system is holding up ﬁne. Thank you for asking."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Excellent. I guess this question goes back to Bill, my last question. Is there any way you can engineer a light kind of exchange for Enable, I mean, essentially, to avoid the big tax bill now?","There are ways to continue to defer recognition of taxes if we sold for stock or units of another entity, but it would not be through a like-kind exchange. It would be through a reorganization within the tax code."
"Cash taxes, I know you talked about the eﬀective tax rate, but how long do you expect not to be a cash taxpayer for?","Michael, it's Bill. We will be a cash taxpayer. It's just that it's at a very low rate. We expect to be a cash taxpayer this year as measured by cash income taxes paid divided by accrual income before taxes – and that number will be in the high-single digits."
"And then for how long – like how big do you – how big is your eﬀective whether it's in NOL or a like balanced weather-generated via bonus D&A or something else, how long do you expect to be a very low cash taxpayer for?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   It will gradually creep up to 35% over the planning horizon. In terms of cash tax rate, that of course will be impacted by the level of capital investment and depreciation rates amongst all the other factors that go through our tax return."
So kind of getting closer to a normal GAAP in the cash tax rate by the next two to three years or kind of longer term than that?,"Longer than that, Michael, at the end of our ﬁve-year planning horizon."
