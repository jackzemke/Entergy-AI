Question,Answer
"Dave, if I could think -- it was the ﬁrst question, just some insight or color into the CFO search. Are you looking internally to the utility sector externally? Just what's the ideal candidate? And I have a CapEx question after that.","Okay. No, I think this is going to be a really, really attractive job for a CFO. So we're going to cast that really, really wide essentially across the whole public spear in the US and see what we can ﬁnd. But as I said, I think it's going to be a great opportunity, a great job, and I expect that we're going to see some really good candidates."
"Great. And then on Slide 7, I just wanted to focus on the $3 billion of incremental opportunities. Just if you give us some like structure and timing of that? Is that something that I could apply maybe linear throughout the forecast period as a back-end loaded? Just any color you could give on that $3 billion and where we should be applying that in our forecast?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. I think, the way to think about this is look at the track record that we've developed as a management team. I think, we've done a pretty good job identifying sort of incremental capital opportunities, ﬁnding a way to eﬃciently execute that, fund it and bring it into our rate base at the right time. And this is really no diﬀerent. Maybe it's a little bit bigger than the ones we've had in the past. But I think from a context standpoint, if you think back to our ﬁrst Analyst Day, this is the ﬁfth time that we've raised capital. If you go to our second Analyst Day, this is the third time that we've raised capital.  So I think we've got a pretty good track record of identifying and bringing this into not only execution and then rate base, but then earnings. And as we said a couple of times, and hopefully, Jason sort of walked you through the numbers, our guidance targets do not include any of the earnings from this. But I think the really important thing to focus on is that, we still continue to believe that we will have industry-leading growth as we basically take on all the headwinds and the tailwinds that are thrown at us in this business. But I think the bottom line is, I think industry-leading growth."
"Okay. If I could just squeeze one in for Jason. Jason, you talked about you pulled forward some O&M from '23 [ph] to '22 [ph]. And I think you mentioned maybe some vegetation management. Are you able to quantify how much O&M you pulled forward to '22 [ph]?","Anthony, I would think about it as a couple of cents of pull-forward work that we've incurred already, and we continue to look to optimize our plan in the fourth quarter. And I think this is just an incredible luxury that we have to continue to do more work on the system for the beneﬁt of our customers, as well as kind of giving us additional ﬂexibility as we enter '23 from an earnings standpoint. So we're happy to continue to executing on it. We've incurred about $0.02 of that and still have some to go in the fourth quarter."
"Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And David, the strokes need to win. I don't know if we can handle, if every successful Philly Sports mindset.",We're hoping for the best.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hey, good morning. Good morning, Dave. Congrats, Jason. So just the $2.3 billion of CapEx that's in the plan, but not kind of in the earnings power, how should we -- I mean, I assume you're not going to spend that if you're not going to get it recovered. So is it just a matter of kind of getting the certainty on the visibility of recovery to get that into the kind of earnings outlook instead of just earnings power?","Thanks, Steve, for the question, and that's right. We wouldn't spend it, if we didn't have full conﬁdence that we'll earn on it. We continue to stress that we've got great capital recovery mechanisms here across our jurisdictions, that this is capital that our customers are asking for. And so, we have conﬁdent that as we execute this work, we will fold it into rate base and earn on it.  Really, the fact that we haven't increased the long-term EPS growth targets is really a function of the point that I stressed in our prepared remarks. I mean, we are entering a period here in 2024, where we'll have several major rate cases, Houston Electric, Texas Gas, City and Electric, among others. And I think it's just prudent for us. We've taken conservative assumptions as we approach those rate cases. But I think it's prudent for us to kind of get to the other side.  I think the takeaway, though, is the capital we're deploying will ﬂow at a rate base. We have conﬁdence in that and undoubtedly enhances the long-term earnings power of the company. I think, the other thing just to point out beyond the capital from the standpoint of the long-term earnings power of the company, I want to reemphasize what I shared in my prepared remarks, we've already prefunded a higher equity ratio at Houston Electric as well. And while we have not assumed that increase in the long-term earnings growth rates that we provided, should we be successful in achieving that higher equity ratio, that presents yet another tailwind without a ﬁnancing overhang. And so, I think we are just continuing to put ourselves in a position to over deliver for our shareholders, our customers and continue to enhance what is an already industry-leading growth rate."
"Okay, great. That's helpful color. And when you talked about kind of incremental CapEx going back in the past. There was also a discussion of potential asset sales that could potentially help fund it. And I think there's been more concern in the market just on asset sale values given just the ﬁnancial market conditions, higher rates. Could you just comment if anything changed in the strategy on asset sales and why maybe that's not discussed as part of this updated plan?","Sure. Thanks for the question, Steve. No change in our strategy. Our strategy is to ﬁnance our incremental capital as eﬃciently as possible. We are fortunate today as part of this CapEx update to have identiﬁed sources of funding that are more eﬃcient than incremental sales of our utility assets. We've had a handful of conservative assumptions around tax positions, which have all resolved themselves favorably for the company.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   As I said, we prefunded the equity ratio at Houston Electric. We will either have higher FFO coming out of that as a result of that higher equity ratio, we can pull back and use the cash to fund the capital directly. And so, I think we have not changed our approach to strategy. We just continue to ﬁnd the most eﬃcient sources of funding this incremental capital.  More broadly, to your point though, we have not seen a softening in the private demand for utility assets as we've talked about extensively over the years. With our previous communications, we still continue to receive pretty extensive outreach and interest. We just have not, as I said, needed to take that approach, because we continue to ﬁnd other sources that are more eﬃcient to fund the CapEx that we've announced today."
"Of course, absolutely. If I may just picking up on Steve's question there a little bit further here. Can you talk a little bit about when you get to a position to talk about that mid-to-high end of 6% to 8% here, I mean, as you describe it, you're going to wait until the other side of these cases, which puts you perhaps in the later half of '24 to give that update on the '25 onwards outlook. And at the same time, if I can, during the pendency presumably of a CEHE case, presumably there might be additional lag given the lack of the track or follow through. How do you think about the step up in '25 earnings power given the additional CapEx, as well as the related step up type earnings from the cases, given the trajectory of 8% in '24 and 6% to 8% in '25?","Thanks, Julien, for the question. There's a lot there. Let me try to sort of unpack a handful of these items. I wouldn't ascribe an exact time line to the update on the long-term growth rates of company sort of post these rate cases. As you said, we want to resolve those cases constructively and favorably for all stakeholders as we have better certainty, we will provide an update.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   I think, what I want to stress around this point, though, is we would not spend this capital if we didn't assume and have a high degree of conﬁdence that it would be included in rate base. And so, as you model as others model, I would look at enhancing and increasing the long-term earnings power of the company sort of post these rate cases.  I think, as it relates to kind of navigating a handful of these time lines, we have a fair degree of ﬂexibility with respect to the capital trackers just given the multiple jurisdictions that we operate in. We will not have access to the capital trackers here in our Texas businesses while we're in those rate cases. So that does present a small amount of additional regulatory lag as we look to earn on those. We have tried to get in front of that issue by accelerating additional capital here into '23 that we will ﬁle for recovery for -- sorry, here in '22 that will ﬁle for recovery in '23, and we'll be fully into the earnings power of the company in '24.  We also have a fair degree of ﬂexibility in Indiana Electric, particularly with the generation transition that will coincide with the timing of these rate cases. As you may recall there, as we bring our renewable projects online, we can begin earning at the month they become operational. And so, there is minimal if any regulatory lag with respect to the investments in Indiana Electric. And so, we're sequencing these investments, either having accelerated as I said this year, we're balancing some of the chunkier projects over the next couple of years to sort of seamlessly work through the rate cases that are on the horizon. But the short of it is, again, we wouldn't spend this capital if we didn't believe and have conﬁdence that we'd earn on it. And so, the takeaway should be, this enhances the long-term earning power of the company."
"Got it. Indeed, it does. And if I may, just going back to the -- here and now, if you will. Thanks for the additional details on the reduced variable rate debt year-to-date. You mentioned accelerating rate cases and oﬀset. You talked about timing of costs and accelerating some of those costs. What are the other mitigation opportunities at corporate or else or, frankly, to dampen the impact of these higher ﬁnancing costs to maintain the EPS trajectory, which you obviously have, but what other latitude levers might there exist?","I would say, Julien, I think you hit on the cost side. I think the big one that we talked about that people sometimes forget about it as soon as we talk about it is our organic growth. I mean, we are spreading -- as we reduced our O&M where we're spreading a smaller amount of O&M across a larger rate base or a larger customer base year-after-year-after-year, and that's just the luxury most other utilities don't have."
"Got you. Indeed, excellent. Well, good luck and we'll see you soon.","(Multiple Speakers) Thanks, Julien.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator   (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open."
"Thanks for taking my question here. And just wanted to build a little bit more, I guess, in Houston opportunity. And what milestones are you looking for from Houston to incorporate more of this $3 billion potential incremental capital? I'm just trying to get a feel for timing possibilities here.","Yeah, thanks again for the question, Jeremy. I mean, a couple of points that I'll stress that Dave made in his prepared comments. We have had a history here now 5 times since our ﬁrst Analyst Day, 3 times since our second Analyst Day of increasing our CapEx. So hopefully, we've built a track record of that as we identify this capital that's in the best interest of our customers, we look to eﬃciently fold it in. I wouldn't, again, put a time line on it.  What we're looking at is kind of balance sheet in probably three factors, conﬁdence in execution. We've been signiﬁcantly increasing our CapEx over the last couple of years. We want to make sure that we have access to the materials, the crews and that we're putting away this capital eﬀectively for our customers. And second, we always are cognizant of where we are with respect to rate increases for our customers and so, we try to balance that over the plan.  And then third and ﬁnally, we look to ﬁnance the incremental capital eﬃciently for the beneﬁt of our shareholders and investors. And so, I wouldn't think about this as I'm not going to sign a speciﬁc time line. I wouldn't also look at this as a series of big chunky projects. This is sort of additional routine spend that we will look to fold in when we have conﬁdence on those three factors. And hopefully, we've earned the trust that we have a track record of doing so.      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. I would just like to add, I think Jason did a great job sort of covering the strategic aspects of it coming in and hit on the really important point at the end there. And then, I hope that with all of you, we've developed the conﬁdence. You have the conﬁdence in us that we're always going to do the right thing at the right time, what's best for our customer and what's best for our investors. And I think you should think about this $3 billion and no other context than that. When we kind of identify it, we'll execute it. We'll get it in the rate base, and it will help our customers.     Operator, if you would (Technical Diﬃculty) have time for one more call.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is now open."
"Yeah, absolutely. Just one quick question, and then I'll follow up with Jackie on the other one. Could you just give us what the pro forma variable debt amount would be post securitization proceeds for the dollar amount? And then as a percentage of your total debt, please? Thank you.","So the one point, it's for the Texas securitization, because we have two securitizations spending the Texas guests securitization, it's $1.1 billion of incremental debt that we will pay down, and then we have the second securitization in Indiana, which is about another $360 million in proceeds that we expect kind of at the end of the third quarter. That will leave us with about $1.5 billion of variable rate debt as we enter next year. Some of that, as I said, attributable to our Texas gas businesses that we will ﬁle a rate case for in the middle of next year that helps reduce any potential long-term earnings drag from that higher level of interest costs that we'll see there."
Cost of $1.5 billion. Thanks so much guys. Appreciate the time.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"All right. Operator, thank you so much for the time today, everyone, for the call. This will conclude our call, and we look forward to seeing everyone in EEI.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.
