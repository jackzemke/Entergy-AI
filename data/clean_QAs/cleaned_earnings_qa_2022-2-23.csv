Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning, Leo and team. It's actually Constantine here for Shahriar, congrats on a great quarter and close out to the year. Appreciate the comments on potential upside, some resilient to spending in the prepared remarks and I believe Mississippi has received an independent consultant recommendation on resiliency. Do you have any early indications on what the governing factors are and including some of the spending? Is it bills, regulatory constructs, ﬁndings and needs? Any color on the early discussions that you may have?","Yeah, this is Rod. Good morning. I think the early discussions are going to be focused on the state-by-state cost beneﬁt analysis. If you think about our desire to accelerate resiliency, Leo will lead to it. We got four dimensions that we talked about, one of them being storm, intensity, the frequency, the duration, and the location. We're in early stages right now of doing the statistical analysis around various scenarios, each of those scenarios are going to play out diﬀerently in each of our jurisdiction. We think the lion's share of the work as you might expect is going to show up in Louisiana that's the subject of the technical conference. When we kind of zero in on the scenarios and the planning assumptions, where the regulator along with the customers would be in a better position to make a decision on what direction they want to go.  But as Leo alluded to that the technical conference is the prelude to the ﬁlings later in the year, when we start to actually show the public kind of what we have to believe in order to put a speciﬁc acceleration plan in place, that the nuance is being a state- by-state play if that's helpful, but it's early in the process which is why you're hearing us framing it up in general terms."
"Okay that's helpful color. And just with the FEMA applications for resiliency funding of the $450 million. Does that kind of play a factor and how those plans get developed and are those projects included in the CapEx plan, or would you can fund those projects yourself the FEMA applications don't go through?","As we stated before anything that comes from the Fed help to oﬀset, otherwise be borne by customers. And so we're going to remain actively involved ensuring we could maximize whatever input the Fed's might be able to provide. That said, we still have to go forward with regulators assuming that the Fed's don't contribute. Whether it's oﬀsetting existing storm costs or our putting forth federal funds toward future resilience spend. But our plans are assuming from the scenario planning perspective both dynamics, but it's not dependent on federal funds."
"Okay. That's great color. And just a quick follow-up on the equity needs and kudos on to the whole team for materially kind of mitigating the needs from the Analyst Day. Curious on your thoughts, on the timing for the remaining $700 million and plan, is there a threshold or event that could accelerate or do you have some cushion to defer given the progress made in 2021 may be a continuation of the ATM at modest level?","Yeah, this is Drew. We are still mindful that we'd like to get this done and so we're continuing to work through with the ATM that we've been put in -- that we put in place before. I think you'll continue to see us use that and we could knock this out fairly quickly with that framework, we'll be mindful of any other opportunities that as the right market conditions come along that allow us to go ahead and ﬁnish it oﬀ     through a block. So, we're paying close attention to that. But as you can tell the number got much smaller and so the end of sort of insight for us overall."
Thanks. That's very helpful. And thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a strong 2021.,Thanks Constantine.    Operator  Thank you. Next up we have on the line Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
"Just want to start on load growth. If I could just, if you could provide a little bit more detail on the signiﬁcant growth on the industrial side, you provided some commentary there in the slides. But just wondering how you see that trending? I guess relative to pre-pandemic levels and I guess expectations to kind of exceed that. And then you talked a bit about green demand. Just wondering if you could update us a little bit more on where does the green tariﬀ demand stand now across this customer base versus where was 12 months ago, and how you see that kind of evolving over time?","So, this is Drew, I'll take the ﬁrst piece on the load growth and I'll let Ron talk about the green tariﬀ. So I mean overall, our load growth for the industrial site continues to be robust, and went through some of the drivers of our main industries in my prepared remarks. Those are in really good places. Then we do with the announcements that we talked about with U.S. Steel and Sempra and we are continuing to see demand, but the nature of it is evolving and you see that in what's happened there. I mean, they're -- those customers are looking for clean green options at low cost and we are well situated for that. And as a result, that's sort of our opportunity from a generation perspective.  A lot of the other fundamentals that we've had a longer still there proximity to Gulf Coast, proximity to Mississippi River available workforce support of communities all that is still there. It continues to attract investment from our customers and from     others, from outside the area today. So, relative to the pre-pandemic, I would say, that's pretty good. That post pandemic we're seeing that shift to wanting that clean electriﬁcation opportunity. And that is what we are seeing this year as you go into 2022, it's little bit lower but as you look out to 24 and be gone, we certainly expect it to continue to ramp up on that clean electriﬁcation opportunity.    And I'll simply add, as Leo alluded to the 30 kilowatt hours of an addressable market through 2030. And the eﬀorts that we take internally to engage diﬀerently with those customers to kind of identify how this demand might play out. What we saw with U.S. Steel and Sempra, we think underscores the thesis that the opportunity for growth is there. We'll share far more details about how we see the next ﬁve years playing out at Analyst Day, but the early indicators are that, that we're pretty conﬁdent that our industrial customers in particular. And it's, and we're seeing it kind of looked down into the smaller commercial sector.  There they've already made public their plans to reduce their carbon emissions and we think we have a unique opportunity to play a role in helping them get there. And that does foreshadow for us a greater demand for our green products, also underscoring as Leo alluded to in his comments, the signiﬁcance of our low emitting and eﬃcient gas generation as well as our nuclear ﬂeet. Not to mention up to 11 gigs through 2034 or so, but more to come at Analyst Day. But so far early indications are looking really good for our ability to help our customers meet their sustainability objectives."
"That's helpful. Thanks for that and maybe picking up at that point there without front- running the Analyst Day, are there any broad strokes that you can provide for us as far as themes or other topics that we might expect at the Analyst Day update wise?","I think, as I mentioned Jeremy, we're going to go out couple extra years as we always do in Analyst Day and those opportunities that Rod talked about, even if you think about U.S. Steel and Sempra for example, those are 2024 and 2027 in service dates. So this acceleration really picks up as you get out kind of the 2024 and beyond time frame, so I think that'll be the as far as the major theme, we'll talk a little bit about what we may be seeing in that regard. So more detail --"
"Hello.  Operator   One moment, please. We ask that you please remain on the line, the conference will resume shortly. We apologize. The speakers have returned.","All right. So, Leo if you want to respond to.      I don't know, we got the line disconnected, and Jeremy, you'd asked about Analyst Day and I was mentioning that will go a couple of years out farther than 2024 current outlook and that'll be interesting because what we're starting to see from this electriﬁcation opportunities, these growth opportunities, if that that's about the time things can start to show up is 2024 and beyond. You can think about U.S. Steel and Sempra, those two announcements, those are 2024 and 2027 in service dates for those facilities. So, the opportunity that we're talking about that start show really outside balance of current capital plan. So, that'll be the probably the biggest pieces that we'll be talking about."
"Got it. That's helpful. And just one more if I could. With regards to Grand Gulf, given stronger operations in 2021, just wondering if you could update us, I guess how things are looking right now operations wise in 2022 expectations. And has this kind of improved performance in really kind of coming through when needed improved stakeholder conversations. Just wondering if you can provide any update there.","Well, Grand Gulf has improved operations as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks at its highest generation output ever in 2021 and it's our expectation to continue to have that performance going into a future only better as we continue to through outages upgrade the equipment associated with facility. Our nuclear plants are going to be very, very important to the economic development of our jurisdiction. And as we talk about electriﬁcation, I think one thing that goes unnoticed is the already clean nature of our ﬂeet. That's one of the cleanest generating ﬂeets in the countries with some of the lowest rates in the country.  Some of these decarbonization objectives can be met by electrifying processes just using the grid power that we have today. Even before we build out the renewables. Because it already meets state scope too needs that some of our customers have. The objectives of the majority of our customers are decarbonization. So we have a lot of dialogue with them about the nuclear ﬂeet being an important part of that decarbonization. So I think it's -- the dialogue around nuclear has changed signiﬁcantly in terms of its importance in the future of the economy of the states in which we operate. So, it's a holistic approach to an important part of not only     reliability of the system but the sustainability of the system. And as more and more customers demand carbon-free energy that follows their load. We're going to be in advantage in the jurisdictions that have nuclear power."
"Got it actually one last one, if I could just any updated thoughts that you have on advanced nuclear, small modular reactors in, if you think that this could start to enter the Entergy plans towards the end of the decade here?","Well, certainly we have folks who're following the development of all diﬀerent kinds of technologies in the nuclear space, and should we get to a point where some form of SMR is economically viable, we'd certainly make it part of the mix because as I mentioned the nuclear, the decarbonization is what everybody's after. And today, most reliable way to make a lot of energy without -- any carbon is through nuclear power. So, we're following those developments across the board to extend to become economically viable, we would certainly pursue it. And as history has proven, our jurisdictions are typically open to the development of new assets that create jobs, high energy intensity and really beneﬁting economic development.  So, too early to say how quickly those will become part of the resource mix. Certainly, there's a lot of development left to be done. But given the focus on carbon reduction, people are spending a lot of time and eﬀort as if federal government now making sure that we're supporting that sort of R&D."
Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Thank you.,Thank you. Jeremy.    Operator  Thank you. And next we have on the line Michael of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
"Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. I actually have a couple and they're kind of unrelated to each other. First of all on the Orange County project, seems like it's a long construction time frame four years, right? If you get approval in May, June time frame, but in service, not till May of 26, is that due to the hydrogen capability being added or is there some other driver normally combined cycles a little bit quicker than that?","No, there's nothing really, I mean by the time we get to regulatory approval, get into the process, there is a little bit more work done at this stage on the hydrogen side, but it's not a signiﬁcant cost driver or anything like that at these early stages we get to the 30% blend capability. So nothing out of the ordinary. It's big. It's big plan.    Got to say that Michael that given our history of construction would come in underneath the expected time line in pretty much every instance. So I wasn't expected we would end up in June 2026 unless there was some other kind of weather related issue or something else going on."
"Got it. Okay, and then an unrelated topic, the FERC put out its policy statement about gas infrastructure, projects and GHG emissions and then obviously matters to you, you're not building pipelines of material size at all or anything, but there are lots of companies in your service territory, who are major customers, who either are trying to build new pipelines, who're trying to build new LNG facilities, or other petchem, energy-related infrastructure. Just curious how you see this process changing the permitting for new gas infrastructure and what that means for your Louisiana and Texas service territories longer-term?","Yeah, Michael, it's Rod, as you might imagine we are closely aligned with our industrial customer base as you alluded to in terms of what it might have been for the future, it ﬁts into our point of view that perhaps this might be a catalyst for the acceleration of decarbonization eﬀorts. All of which fuels our point of view around our ability to help them achieve their objectives, whether it's through the scope to resources from our electrical supply or any opportunity we have to electrify sort of their scope one processes, but just extrapolating from that FERC ruling for us, we're viewing it through the lens of what the implication for the customers then moving faster as a condition of permitting to take advantage of the other marketing advantages of locating, expanding in our service territory. So it is unclear how it will ultimately play out. But as you might imagine, we are giving thought to how that applies to other potential customers like Sempra most recently as they're working through their permitting process. And we are stakeholders in those FERC proceedings for that very reason."
"Just a quick one on longer term ﬁnancing, Drew, I think you sort of talked about being done. Once you've done the 2022 to 2024 reduced equity raise, is how do you think about that sort of post 2024 period is something sort of similar to the run rate, you've eﬀectively been doing here, sensible assumption or could you be sort of out of the capital raise business for a few years that you've been in the past in the past?","That's a good question, Jonathan. Obviously, we talked a lot about the types of ﬁnancing that are available to us. And what would be good in certain situations? The ﬁnancing with the equity capital markets is useful because it gives you a ﬁrm idea what you're going to get and it's a liquid market and you can close quickly. And so that's what we've been doing here recently, because we have very near-term need. If you're talking about needs out beyond 2024, there are diﬀerent options that become available because it is such long-term thinking and so yeah, it's not just capital markets, some of the other things that are out there that we've talked about before might be available to you from a type of strategic perspective, rather than capital markets perspective. But that's longer-term, that's not anything that we would be thinking about necessarily, right this minute. But as you look out beyond our horizon period, there are other options available to you."
"Okay, thank you. And then just one other thing, just can you remind us. Maybe tell us what went on with the Liberty County solar project and what or any lessons learned around that better outcome next time around or just some reﬂection there?","Yeah. This is Rod. The Liberty County project was pulled, not because the commission didn't recognize the beneﬁts of the actual project. That particular one and again it was unique to Liberty County had more to do with where the Texas commission was in terms of how they use the Liberty County project and it's implication inside of (inaudible).  And so I don't want to send a signal that there was anything necessarily untoward with the project, we pulled it because we wanted to come back to the commission, one when they actually had a full commission and I will share with you the lack of a full commission with also inﬂuential in their reticence to approve the deal. And so it's a short -- it was a short-time timing play for us. We had greater needs for capital and we were also recognizing that there was a robust response to additional RFPs and decided to pull it. But it does not in any way forward, our belief or in our view, the Texas staﬀ believe in the Vandalia's project. So we expect to come back with more, but I didn't want -- don't want you to over-read anything."
Do you expect to come back with that particular project? Is that will just with other things?,"No, the timing of that particular one, there's going to be -- there might be more to come there, but there's a there's more than a robust opportunity for us to ﬁll our needs with the other projects. So I won't give any signal into that speciﬁc one, but the pipeline is quite robust."
"Hi, good morning. I want to follow up on some of the potential storm hardening acceleration. We talked about some of those data points leading up to the Analyst Day. Should we think of that is purely incremental capital or could that's kind of mitigate some of the capital already in the plan as you don't need to do some other work around storm hardening?","It's really an acceleration of things that we identiﬁed could be done. So, for example, in our current three-year outlook, there's around $2.7 billion of T&D investments than       you could considering -- could consider resilience investments, about $1.7 billion of that to the T space, and $1 billion in the D space. We've been doing resilience spending in a combination of new projects that we do. And then we do storm hardening after-the-fact note, when we're repairing after a storm as well, built the new standards. What we'd be looking at with the resilience spend that we would put out is are there things we could do faster than they would have otherwise been on the schedule. So it would be incremental in the time frames that would be proposed. If that makes sense as opposed to being done ﬁve years later or something like that. Does that makes sense, Paul?"
"Yes, it does. That's clear. Thank you. And then the other question I had was just given some of the broad inﬂationary pressures, how you -- how are you thinking and comfort level about ability to execute in Arkansas relative to the 4% rate cap?","This is Drew, I'll start and Rod can add to it. Obviously and we're not immune from whatever inﬂation issues that are out there. And so we're monitoring it closely. Yeah, there's diﬀerent pieces to it. There's the fuel piece which gets collected through a separate fuel rider in Arkansas. And that might move the 4% cap up a little bit but it's not going to hinder our investment there.  On the O&M side, we haven't seen the kind of pressures that we've been hearing about seeing in other sectors, that doesn't mean that we haven't had some. We have had some dealing with it on more of a spot basis and ramping up our continuous improvement to help manage against the potential for acceleration of inﬂation more broadly in our business.  And then on the capital side, we are seeing some pressure on the capital side, particularly, we wouldn't talk about some of these solar projects. But in the RFPs that we've been conducting recently and we expect to conduct, we're still in the very early innings of our renewable investments. And while we've seen some pressure on some of the projects that we've already have sort of underway, the bulk of it is to come and all those expectations already have built in understanding of the inﬂation environment we have and the supply chain that we're dealing with, and everything else.  And those projects are still very robust. Now they have strong NPVs for the customer. And so we'd expect them to get support from the retail regulators as well. And yeah, that kind of oﬀset with fuel costs and other things we think will ﬁt into the caps in Arkansas in particular. So right now, we don't see any real challenges. We're obviously monitoring inﬂation very closely and adjusting our business and ramping up continuous improvement in order to manage it, but we don't see anything immediately in our way."
"I wanted to follow up on Jeremy's question, just on nuclear operations, and looks like there's been a good improvement there. And just wonder if you could speak to just dialogue with the NRC, you're not on account for and looks like operations are improving, but is there any additional color you can give in terms of the dialogue with the NRC on nuclear operations?","Continue to have a lot of dialogue at all levels from the resident inspector to the regions to the headquarters in Washington, certainly around not only operations, but license transfers et cetera. So that's our relationship with NRC is strong and it's open. I mean with resident inspectors when I'm on site. I meet with the region on a regular basis and I meet all the commissioners when I can. We had to do a lot of it virtually over the course of the last couple of years, but we continue to have a very robust and open dialogue with NRC and it's very constructive relationship."
"Okay. Great. And then just one last one for me. This is a common question, kind of across many utilities. But just given the commodity cost outlook. Could you just speak a bit to the, the outlook for customer bill increase, especially residential customer bill increases across your footprint. I know residential is a smaller percentage for you all then some utilities, but I am just curious given the commodity outlook what the sort of bill increase outlook is for you all?","Yeah, Steve, thanks, it's Drew. So there's a couple of things going on in our bills and it depends on the jurisdiction in particular. Yeah. I already talked about inﬂation and what that means going back to the fuel piece of that. Yeah, when you talk about our Louisiana and Texas winter storm Yuri 2021 raised fuel cost quite a bit in those two jurisdictions for 2021. So now it's the fuel curve has come up a bit. It's not as much of an impact frankly on customers and in those jurisdictions, because we already had some high fuel prices because of the winter storm Yuri.  And then as you look forward, the fuel curve is, of course, a bit backward dated and our expectations are typically above the forward curve once you get out a few years and that's still the case. Obviously, there's a lot of other things besides inﬂation going on in price of natural gas today but we think we're pretty well situated from a customer perspective there.  And then also in Louisiana and Texas, you have the securitization pieces coming on in the next probably 18 months, well, hopefully by the end of the year, frankly, to get all the securitization done in Louisiana, but I would probably be by the beginning of next year you see the full eﬀect of those that's a pretty big step up particularly in Louisiana. The once we get past that, I think the growth rate in the bills should be fairly reasonable. And we've historically, said had a low inﬂation, obviously, that means something diﬀerent today, but (inaudible) inﬂation is probably going to still be true based on historical expectation for inﬂation less than 3%. So that's what we expect to see. Once we got past sort of the securitization and the current higher costs associated to the fuel."
Thank you. Assuming all goes well to Louisiana Public Service Commission. What are the steps for getting storm recovery that you'll have? There's the securitization that you touched on just a minute ago. Can you walk through the steps and the amounts that you expect to be coming in?,"Sure. So, in Texas, we've already got the orders and so we're in the process of setting up the actual forcing of the securitization funds, which take place in March or April that I think in the neighborhood of $290 million is the expectations for that. And then     assuming we get the outcome -- the outcome in Louisiana today, there's approval by the LPSC in the next few months, we would set up the transaction for that, that would be around $3.2-ish billion including the $1 billion of Ida funds.  Yeah, that's going to be a little bit diﬀerent than the Texas transaction that's going through the state is like so we have already approval from the state on commission to get that done on the ﬁrst piece that will be setting that up here hopefully very soon. And then, of course, the remainder of the Ida costs would be hopefully by the end of the year and it's in the process."
