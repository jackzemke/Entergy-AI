Question,Answer
"Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter. You talked about some of these innovative capital deployment programs that, kind of, you're putting in place and just wanted to kind of get a little bit of an idea for how big do you see the opportunities for all of the electriﬁcation and kind of customer solutions? And how does that ﬁt within the plan that was presented at EEI?","As far as the plan, there is very little in there. We have added some dollars when we went through the process at the end of the second quarter where we had some continuous improvement opportunities and then we put money back into the business for all of our stakeholders. There were some level of that from the KeyString Labs sort of initiatives, but there is very little in the plan really at this point for those opportunities.  It's a little early for us to start to size it up, as the year goes on, and we start to develop more, we will, but our view is that at the end of the day, the distribution side of the business and these customer solutions will be the fastest growing part of our business. Customer solutions could include all kinds of electriﬁcation. If you look at, for example, Louisiana, industry is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind transportation with utilities third, which is a little bit diﬀerent than it is in the rest of the country, given the nature and the size of the industrial complex in Louisiana.  So across all of our footprint, we see a signiﬁcant amount of opportunity in the electriﬁcation space, once we work the shore power and into manufacturing processes and even transportation sector. So that could get signiﬁcant over time as we go forward. And there is a lot of other things that they're going to be able to do in addition to what we've already done in solar, in addition to what we're already doing in backup generators. As I mentioned, while we put the footprint of AMI, EAM, customer digital, and all of those other technological improvements that we do on the system, we get signiﬁcant amounts of data that will allow KeyString Labs and the rest of the company to actually create products and services based on that. So it's too early to size what it -- to size it up and give you any numbers. But if you go ﬁve, 10 years down the road, we think that it's going to be pretty signiﬁcant."
Wonderful. Thanks. Just one quick follow up is on the numbers for kind of sales volume in 2019 seem a little bit weaker and a little bit weak on the industrial sales and just the customer count. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of just economic activity and kind of how does that play into -- going into 2020?,"Sure. This is Drew. The fundamental strength that we have that are sort of built into our service area are still in place in terms of the low costs down here from an energy perspective are low rates, the welcoming communities for industrial growth, the access to the river and the infrastructure and the labor and everything else. So all those things are still in place. And so we continue to see opportunity going forward that would allow us to continue to grow on the industrial base.  Talking about 2019 versus 2020, we've talked about, over the course of 2019, how some of our key customers that we were expecting to ramp up, were not able to ramp up as fast as we anticipated, but we still expect them to be there and so that's contributing to kind of the year-over-year expectations for 2020, as well as on the     smaller industrial customer size base, there was quite a bit of rain in Arkansas. So a number of our customers in that normally do pumping for agricultural use on an industrial scale weren't there, but we expect them to be back in 2020 barring -- assuming a normal weather condition up in Arkansas. So that's really what's driving kind of the change year-over-year and kind of the softness in 2019. And I'll let, Rod, talk a little bit about sort of the where we actually see customers going forward.    Good morning. I think we commented during the last quarter that our conﬁdence in the outlook comes from the fact that our growth expectations stem from our ability to actually identify speciﬁc projects and we know exactly who those customers are. Over the last several years, we've improved our capacity to engage those customers, giving us greater visibility and insight through various aspects of their project development cycle from concept to ﬁnancial investment decisions. And so when we give you our outlook, it's a probability weighted assessment of the timing of those projects coming online and the associated load and ﬁnancial implication.  So our outlook is still strong and we can tie our expectations in the near term to speciﬁc ﬁrms within a diﬀerent industrial segment. So we still have clarity admittedly they sometimes come in lumpy over the course of quarter-over-quarter, but our conﬁdence is still high in the industry outlooks driving our growth."
"Perfect. That's really helpful. Congrats on good quarter. Thanks, guys.",Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey. So perhaps to tick up on some of the commentary, Leo, can you elaborate a little bit more on some of the customer-centric angles? And speciﬁcally what I'm getting at is, I think some of your commissioners in Louisiana speciﬁcally have talked about some more direct access and I don't mean direct access in the competitive sense, but more in terms of procurement choices. I'm just curious, should we expect something along the lines of green tariﬀs or something like that to sort of enable another angle here? I don't want to leave the witness too much, but I'm just curious on that angle. And then separately, Leo, you also talked about the resource portfolio at large from what I understand, I think there is a retirement study ongoing, and I just wanted to understand a little bit as to how that might play out more speciﬁcally in terms of dockets, and how we see sort of the planning process play, more speciﬁcally, out in the near to medium term rather?","Let me try and keep up with that question or that series of questions. The -- as far as the customer solutions area goes, it's wide-ranging across all of our customer segments. So we've done low income rooftop solar in out of KeyString Labs. We've done backup generation for small industrial and commercial. At the Utility level, we're engaging with our larger industrial customers across a variety of diﬀerent ways to interact with them to help them do business better. We have been investigating green tariﬀs. We have been investigating community solar. We are looking at a whole host of other types of products and services that provide us the opportunity to give our customers the outcomes they desire. If you think about a customer utility function, it goes beyond just, and I don't mean electric utility, but from an economic standpoint, it goes beyond just the low cost provision of highly reliable power. It goes beyond that in terms of what their objectives are, in terms of what they want to do with that consumption. So if they have a sustainability objective in addition to just selling them electricity, we want to help our customers with that sustainability objective. So, hence, that's where you get into a position where you electrify a sector.  In the shore power arena, as I mentioned, just there we help those customers meet their sustainability objectives in, quite honestly, a way that meets their needs at a lower cost. And so that's a very, very important way for us to serve the customer, while we serve the communities, while we enhance our sustainability footprint and theirs and make them more competitive in their businesses. So I -- in terms of speciﬁcs, Julien, across that products and services will be developed out of innovation by working with our customers in a diﬀerent way than we have before because technology, data, information, analytics allow us that capability in ways that weren't available. And the more technologies we put on the system, the more availability we'll have that data and that information and our ability to actually make that happen.  So the reason we're so excited about it is it's pretty wide-ranging in terms of what we're going to do for diﬀerent segments of the residential class versus diﬀerent segments of the commercial class versus diﬀerent in speciﬁc customers in the industrial space. So that's about as speciﬁc as I really want to get at the moment on that. I mean, as far as the resource plan goes, we're obviously constantly in the mode of evaluating what the resource plan looks like going forward in all of our jurisdictions. And as we see technologies change, our view of what those resources     could be broadens. And so from the standpoint of say what type of technology choices we make, whether they'd be on the energy eﬃciency side, on the side of renewables, gas or what have you, we have the opportunity to expand that footprint. And as technology improves and renewables and battery and other storage technologies become more economic and more operable, we'll see more of those show up in the system.  And it's our anticipation that we will continue to provide three things for our customers through the resource plan. One is operability, when they turn on the lights, they come on, that's obviously a ticket to play. We continue to want to be one of the lowest cost providers in the United States that helps our competitive position and helps the economic development of the service territory, which obviously creates a good business cycle for us and that we want to help ourselves, our communities and our customers meet their sustainability objectives. We're going to do all three of those and we're going to optimize those to the extent practical. So that means taking advantage of all the technologies out there in the most eﬃcient way we can. I don't know if Rod wants to add anything to that, I hope I...    Yes. I mean, I would only add that in Louisiana, we'll be making ﬁlings with the commission relative to green tariﬀ options that we want the commission to consider in response to some of the sustainability objectives of our industrial customers. But that's an ongoing conversation that falls right in line with the comments you just made, Leo.  And we have a retirement study due after the St. Charles project goes in service that will address some of the things that Leo has talked about.    Forgot about that one."
"Good morning. So, Leo on the generation side, you had mentioned that you have opportunities for more generation projects going forward. Just wanted to understand is that from low growth driven or the 5%, 6% coal that you have currently, that you plan to retire. What's kind of driving the new generation opportunities? And what kind of fuel mix are you looking for as you go forward in the new generation?","The generation opportunities are similar to what we've discussed in the past. We still see a need to transform our ﬂeet from the older, less eﬃcient generation to new cleaner, more eﬃcient way to provide power. And our perspective on the mix hasn't changed from where we were at EEI, that if we look 22 to 30, in that 7,000 to 8,000 megawatt range and we think that based on where technology is going and what we could foresee that roughly half of that could be renewables.  The way we're going to ﬁll that out is going to be speciﬁc to those three points that I made a minute ago, has to be the right operational characteristics at the right cost with the right sustainability footprint. Our objective is to optimize that as much as possible. And so, as we've discussed before, as we get closer to each one of those resource choices, to the extent renewables, storage, technologies and other factors have made those more operable and cost eﬀective, they become a bigger part of the resource mix. That doesn't change how much capacity we need, because we need to provide service, we need to provide, and the age of the ﬂeet is what it is. And as I mentioned, we have plans for retirement of majority of the coal resources that are out there and we're looking at what to do with the others. So that plus old gas ﬂeet that still needs to be refreshed. All go into the mix."
"Got it. Thanks for that. Second question or the follow-up on the equity needs point, Drew, I think you mentioned or at least at EEI you had a range of 5% to 10%. Now you're saying you're at the upper end of that, so closer to the 10%. Just wanted to understand, what's driving that equity need going up a little bit and is that a little bit of managing the credit as well. Just want to understand that driver?","Sure, Praful. So I think that's probably in part of what it is, and nothing has changed relative to where we said in 2018 from our plan and I think there is some credit considerations, there is our earnings considerations all those are part of what we are working through. And also the capital plan itself has grown over the -- it has grown     since EEI grew last summer, so it's been growing as well. And as we always been -- has been talking about, there is the potential for considerably more equity needs out -- or capital needs out in the future. So I think all those things are factoring into how we're thinking about, where the equity might land, when we go to ﬁll that need in 2021."
"Got it. And ﬁnally, any performance -- the outperformance that you had in your decommissioning trust, especially on Indian Point. I'm assuming that doesn't accrue to Entergy because that was part of like the deal that was struck in terms of the sale of Indian Point, correct?",That's correct. So the trust fund at Indian Point is Holtec's responsibility in terms of the level that it's at and that will all be part of the NRC proceeding that is underway right now.
"Got it. Really appreciate it, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks.","Thanks you.    Thanks, Praful.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets."
"Just wanted to talk a little bit more about cash ﬂows and balance sheet, obviously the OCF metric and leverage metrics are improving and that's very encouraging.       Where might we see, may be positive surprise there or where is the room for a change versus your? What you are anticipating right now, maybe it's a pension as it relates to performance of the pension assets or may be a surprise to load growth. Can you just walk us a little bit more, some of the puts and takes and what might aﬀect the trajectory of the improvement here either way?","Yes, so there is a couple of drivers out there that have been helpful in 2019, one was at EWC, our cash ﬂows came in little bit better than we anticipated. The team there has done a great job, managing costs and identifying ways to reduce capital needs as we transition towards shutting down those plants. So that's been very positive. We had some very positive working capital developments in utility and we may see some more of that this year because of lower fuel prices. So that's been helpful, of course, the performance of the pension trust has been good, but at the same time, interest rates have been coming down and raising the liability.  And so we actually -- our liability went up about $1 billion from $7.4 billion to $8.4 billion, last year, solely because of interest rates dropping over 100 basis points. Our delta between our assets and -- our assets went up as well, our delta stayed about the same, around $2 billion year-over-year. So we weren't able to make up as much ground as we were hoping, given the positive performance. But we did, we were able, because of some of the positive cash ﬂows as I mentioned in my remarks, able to put some incremental cash into the pension trust about $200 million more than we planned at the beginning of the year. We did that at the end of the year. So that will help continue to de-risk that pension liability.  So those are kind of some of the drivers, and some of those where I would expect to continue to be opportunities going forward in terms of the potential for lower fuel prices, helping our working capital and then potentially some incremental room and EWC, as well. And none of that takes into consideration some of the things that, Leo, was talking about around continuous improvement. If we can ﬁnd incremental headroom through continuous improvement on our cash ﬂows, then we can put that to work either with incremental investments to beneﬁt our customers or other investments to create value for all our stakeholders."
"Got it. Thank you. And a follow up I had is on Indian Point. So we've seen objection ﬁlings by the New York Attorney General. Can you just walk us through how these proceedings typically kind of go? And how much weight would be aﬀorded to a party like that, I guess, in this proceeding and should we be worried about this?","Yes, so the questions that the New York Attorney General are asking are the same ones that we have addressed in the proceedings at the NRC for both Vermont Yankee and for Pilgrim and namely they are around the ﬁnancial and technical capabilities of Holtec to -- in this case to do the work of decommissioning. And that's really -- that is what the NRC is addressing, that is there -- what they're accountable for ﬁguring out in the proceeding. And so, I think, that'll be a good forum to address     those questions. And we are conﬁdent -- I'll add, we're conﬁdent that Holtec will be able to answer those, they've already answered them successfully in two other proceedings, one, with us around Pilgrim and then, of course, Oyster Creek."
"Thanks. I feel like you may have indirectly answered most of this, but when I look at the slide deck from EEI, and just compared it to the slide deck now as you've reﬁned your guidance the -- in particular O&M costs I think, were only expected to be up $0.10 more or less at EEI, now they're up $0.25 and I think that's in part due to a lower pension discount rate used 4% as a placeholder and the last deck you're using just under 3.4% now. And I also -- you've pointed out that a lot of those increased costs were probably oﬀset by increased revenues, so can you -- am I capturing all of that or am I missing something?","I think, you're on the right track, Greg, it's Drew. The pension discount rate did come down lower than what we were anticipating when we were talking at EEI. And so that was of the incremental O&M that was probably 40% of the delta. Also there is another 40% is associated with things that are oﬀset in the top-line, energy eﬃciency, storm reserve changes that at the bottom line will be a net zero. And then, of course, there are a little -- there are a few odds and ins, but those dollars add up to something really small.  So I think all-in-all and actually I would say we are overall we're in line with what we are expecting $2.6 billion in the utility, and we've talked about trying to keep it ﬂat at around $2.65 billion going forward is what we discussed last summer. So we've managed to work against all of those things that move the O&M up a little bit, but it's still within the expectations that we had overall."
"Yes, that's a good answer. And then, as I compare the expected rate actions from the fall till now it looks like on the margin you're -- maybe I missed it, but the the DCRF       and TCRF ﬁling and the AMI riders ﬁling those weren't explicitly included in the retail price actions in the fall deck and they're included now. So those are modest increase in regulatory activity versus the fall plan or would those always anticipated but just maybe not called out explicitly?","Yes, I think we were anticipating that we were going to do those things, but we hadn't explicitly called them out."
"Okay, great. And then in terms of the capex plan, obviously, it's up modestly for '22 but 2 gigawatts of potential incremental opportunities. I mean, look, I'm just going to spitball at a $1,000 a kilowatt. I mean, is it right to think about that as long as you can -- most importantly, as long as you can sort of pencil out that those incremental capital expenditures drive customer beneﬁts is that -- am I right that that could be up to a $2 billion increase in capex? And over what timeframe might that be?","Absolutely. It's a big opportunity for us. We talked about the capital plan is inching towards a $4 billion average at this point. If we look beyond our capital horizon 2022, I would expect that it would be up above $4 billion. And all the things that you're talking about are going to be a piece of that opportunity. That's on the generation side, I mean, Leo, was saying that the biggest opportunity is on the other end of the value chain at the distribution end and the customer services, that's where the biggest growth opportunity we think will ultimately be.  So there is signiﬁcant capital opportunity out there for us. But the thing that you said is really what we are working through, which is how do we make sure that we can create value for our customers and really all of our stakeholders. While we put this capital to work and do it with a way that allows our customers to manage this through their bills. And that's -- that's kind of the key to this whole thing and all the continuous improvement and the innovation in the new products and services, the leveraging of technology, creating headroom in those bills that's what we are -- that's what we're after and we see opportunities for that in a signiﬁcant way down the road."
"Hey, Leo, I've got a question for you that you're probably not going to want to answer, but I'll ask it anyway. There is -- with the opportunities you have in hand just organically it would seem to me that you guys control your own destiny, but you've always said that you've been open to better ideas about the strategic direction of the company, is that just frame damage at this point, because you've got so much opportunity organically or with the rate -- what would the set of circumstances have to be for you to want to be distracted enough by a strategic oﬀer to consider it?","I think, the criteria are the same. Certainly, we as management team and the Board are open to -- and I think you characterized it correctly, better ideas. So if there is a way to advance them all beyond what we think we can do the way we are conﬁgured today, we will investigate it. In addition to it having to be something that does advance the ball it has to be transactable both with the counterparty and through the regulatory process because there's no point going forward if you can't get along well enough to go through the process. And if you can't get the process completed there is obviously that's -- it doesn't matter how good the idea is if we can't get it done, it doesn't matter.  And then you did also bring up the third thing that we always discuss and that's distraction is in our industry because of the way the process works. It takes 18 to 24 months to get something done. Are you distracted during that timeframe from doing the things that got you to the point where we are today in such a way that, if you don't get across the goal line or even if you do, you've lost so much ground that it doesn't make it worth it.  If you can solve that puzzle then our stance would continue to be that is worthwhile. We do have in my opinion the most attractive standalone plan that we've ever had for all four of our stakeholders. We have signiﬁcant amount of opportunity to improve the level of service and the way we serve our customers. We had the signiﬁcant opportunity to continue sustainability objectives and our community building across the environmental, the education, workforce training, eradication of property space starting to provide value for our communities. We continue to have an opportunity to expand our culture in a way that engages our employees the way they've never been before. And certainly, all of that results in the investment proﬁle that grows the business for certainly our shareholders.  So it's a pretty high bar in that ﬁrst part about, can you actually have a better idea that advances the ball enough to make it worth doing. That doesn't mean, we don't look at it, it doesn't mean, we wouldn't be open to it, it just means that I think now, the bar is as high as it's been in that front."
"Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Real quickly, can you remind us what the stated retirement dates are for some of your coal units? I'm taking larger ones like White Bluﬀs and then some of the smaller ones Independence, Nelson, etc.?","Yes. The Arkansas units, Michael, are part of that settlement that gets us to the -- by the end of 2030. Yes."
"Okay. Is there a scenario where especially given the economics of coal versus gas versus solar where you would fast forward or move up the retirement dates, which might create a little bit of a capacity need, but also may potentially create customer savings?","There is -- I mentioned in my scripts that in addition to what we are doing, we are looking at what to do with the rest of that ﬂeet. There is that kind of analysis going on a regular basis. We look at all of the resources we have and what's the right balance between spending the money required to keep them operating versus replacement. And so that's on the table at this point in time, we haven't made that call."
"Got it. My other question is on the nuclear side. And can you talk a little bit about the dispatch economics, all-in economics for your nuclear ﬂeet in the southeast? And just how you're thinking about those plants and kind of where they sit economically on the dispatch or as we've seen in other parts of the country, both regulated and non-regulated, we've seen some nuclear retirements and trying to just think about the is it even the nuclear units that we should be thinking about as ﬂeet transformation over time?","Hey, Michael, this is Drew. And so, in regards of where it sits in the dispatch stack, it sits low, right. It run -- those run all the time, they have low variable costs, and so they are going to run all the time. We do know about the economics and we've talked about that in the northeast obviously with the shutdown of our EWC ﬂeet. But there are many reasons why you might want to continue to operate your nuclear ﬂeet that are very, very important from a policy perspective, and you can evaluate those more eﬀectively in the utility setting than you can in a merchant power market where all that matters is that marginal electron's price.  So when you talk about -- and you see folks supporting nuclear plants in those unregulated power markets for these same reasons, right. You're talking about clean generation that supports the grid, it's always available, it diversiﬁes the portfolio, it provides good tax base. And so there's a lot of jobs in communities, and a lot of     active volunteering coming out of these plants that have a lot of employees. And so there's a lot of policy reasons why you want to keep a nuclear plant around, but it's hard to evaluate those in a merchant setting, and you see people doing that already in those -- in Illinois and in parts of New York and other places. You can do that more easily in a rate regulated framework evaluate those characteristics."
"Understood. And then last question, where do you think you could stand when you benchmark yourselves on T&D costs either on a per line mile or per customer whatever you all think the most appropriate metric is. Kind of where do you think you stand versus the peer group? And how do you think about the path to kind of getting the top decile?","The -- it's a tricky metric to be making broad generalizations about the peer group, because the peer group would have to be somebody who's service territory characteristics mirror ours. So there is a big diﬀerence between people who are in urban dense versus rural versus mountainous versus lumpy versus all of the other things that makes that up, doesn't mean we don't do it and doesn't mean we don't compare favorably in a lot of respects. But we need to go beyond just those benchmarks, Michael, and get into what can we do to continuously improve ourselves once we get outside of the plant level because there's too many variables to just make broad generalizations. I wouldn't think even if we are a top decile that we wouldn't be able to ﬁnd ways to improve."
"Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just -- can you give us a little preview of what kinds of things we might expect you to do at the Analyst Day? I mean, obviously, you've talked about a lot of evolving opportunities at the margin, but as more speciﬁcally, do you think you'll roll forward your outlook to '23? Are you going to continue giving these multi-year outlooks, is that the plan? Or just a sense of what we should be practical in June?","Yes. I think, Jonathan, as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll go out typically the way, the process has worked for us. We've historically done in Analyst Day every other year. And when we do it, we roll out kind of a ﬁve-year look versus the every odd year roll out three-year look, I guess. And so, I would anticipate that we would do that. Obviously, give a little bit more ability to dive into what we're doing in terms of all the things that we've been talking about here, maybe turn more cards on what those opportunities look like and what they might be gives us a little more time to get into a little bit more detail that way.  But I think kind of just more discussion around the opportunity set in front of us, which again, we -- I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, we have a pretty good base here with some of the lowest rates in the country, one of the cleanest ﬂeets in the country, some of the only industrial growth in the country, some of the best regulatory mechanisms in the country, and a -- no shortage of opportunities to invest on behalf of our customers to increase the level of service that they get, while we manage the bill path to be at or below the level of inﬂation.  And so just looking at the outlooks that we provided you here that's a -- again in my estimation is one of the best positions we've been in as a company, but it doesn't mean we are not looking for ways to do better because our team keeps coming up with more investment opportunities for us to make on behalf of our customers that could improve that level of service more, whether it's in the traditional things about sustainability and reliability or whether it's in some of these newer areas where we start to talk about customer solutions, where we're getting closer and closer and closer to providing them outcomes rather than just inputs.  So the idea of continuous improvement to provide the headroom that allows us to get there and improve things, I think is a great challenge for us and continuous improvement takes many forms, whether it's continuous improvement through RPA and utilization of our supply chain shared service and IT functions to actually drive costs out of the business, while we up scale actually the level of performance or whether it's in economic development and new load growth that isn't in the plan today that helps drive cost down for the rest of the customers or just the fact that gas prices continue to be lower than what we typically project them to be. I think, if you     look at the forward curve, you're out four, ﬁve years, you're still in sub-250 gas, and that's a great opportunity for us to beneﬁt our customers."
"Great. Keep up the great execution and look forward to hearing more about it in June. Thank you, Leo.","Thank you, Jonathan.    Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Management for any further remarks.    Thank you, Sherry, and thanks to everyone for participating this morning.
