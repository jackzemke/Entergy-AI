Question,Answer
"Just to sort of follow up on the EEI preview with the Vermont Yankee decommissioning, how should we think about the ongoing expense item associated with that? Can you give us a little bit more before EEI?","Yeah. For the next couple years, we expect it to be about a negative $0.20 to $0.25 (sic) [$20 million to $25 million], and then after that it would trail oﬀ to about – or excuse me, millions, sorry. $20 million to $25 million of net income impact, and that trails oﬀ to about $12 million."
Okay. And then does the change in the Vermont Yankee decommissioning cost in total have any impact on what you guys are thinking about with your other plants? And I recall you guys taking some signiﬁcant tax positions associated with that. Could those change as well as a result of your updated Vermont Yankee decommissioning study?,"I'll answer the second question ﬁrst. No, it doesn't aﬀect our tax positions. And on the ﬁrst question, we did learn quite a bit because we did the detailed study at Vermont Yankee, but it doesn't change our current expectations for funding or expense at any of our remaining nuclear facilities."
"So quick question here. As you're thinking about New England and all the latest developments, what's your fundamental view of 2015 through 2017 on the forward curve? Do you think or is it your expectation to continue to use options to leave some upside there?","Bill?      Yes, Julien. We can plan to continue to use the same hedging strategy we have in the past, keeping in mind that there are certain limitations depending on what the market oﬀers. But – so we continue to use a number of structured products. Those structured products change; the number of counterparties change. But we're still working to maintain that optionality in the book."
"Great. And then looking at the capacity side of the equation there. Obviously, we've seen a few new new-build or potential new-build announcements in the last few months. How has that, if at all, changed your expectations for pricing in the subsequent auction? And then speciﬁcally, are you expecting the SEMA region to break out separately, and do you have any price expectations therein?","Yeah. So we have seen a lot more activity in terms of proposed projects. Our expectations on pricing associated with capacity really haven't changed. We think that for the Rest-of-Pool in New England that still is somewhere around an $11 CONE. We do expect ISO New England to put in place the SEMA pricing zone that has – will hopefully be resolved by the end of this year. As it relates to pricing in that speciﬁc zone, where Rise (28:16) and Pilgrim reside, that will depend on the amount of capacity that's actually bid. I think you're familiar with the rules up there in terms of limitations on capacity pricing for insuﬃcient oﬀers, that type of thing. But we are somewhat bullish in that area, but it's going to – ﬁnal pricing will depend on the amount of capacity actually bid in FCA 9."
"Great. Just to make sure I heard you correctly, there's the potential for an insuﬃcient capacity in SEMA?","Yes. So, with Rest-of-Pool, there's a sloped demand curve. I don't believe that sloped demand curve has been implemented in SEMA. So we would revert back to the insuﬃcient competition, which would go back to net CONE."
"I had a question on the New England capacity market as well. Obviously, you have the Winter Reliability Program, which is kind of a temporary ﬁx. Do you see anything progressing going forward similar to what PJM is doing with the capacity performance proposal to make sure that there's adequate fuel for the plants in that region during the winter?","Well, Neel, I think we were hopeful to see that actually change for this winter. Frankly, we were disappointed with the fact that they rolled the existing plan forward a year. But I believe FERC gave some pretty clear guidance on – that that issue for the 2015- 2016 winter timeframe needs to be addressed. So we are hopeful that we see some     progress there, that we move beyond something such as the oil backup reliability to a more market-based approach, which properly values all resources that have adequate fuel supply."
"Okay, great. And then at your Analyst Day, you laid out kind of the lack of pipeline capacity going into New England. Has your view changed with maybe some of the bigger projects that are being proposed out that would come on late 2018, early 2019, or do you think that there's still a long shot for a lot of projects that would actually bring gas into New England?","I don't think our overall point of view has changed. You've got the Spectra/Northeast Utilities JV, you've got the Northeast Energy Direct. You have to keep in mind that those have not been subscribed. So we believe that that could be a challenge just given overall economics. So we believe, at least in the foreseeable future, nothing's going to change signiﬁcantly. We'll continue to see a lot of volatility up in those markets. And at this point, those projects that have been proposed are very questionable from our perspective."
"I wanted to discuss transmission growth as you join MISO. I wonder if you could just talk at a high level. I know this is an evolving situation, but are there certain signposts or upcoming things we should be looking for to get a better sense of what's really going to be required to integrate your system into MISO?","Stephen, I'll start, and then I'll let Theo kind of jump in with the details. From a transmission standpoint, we've – and obviously, we'll be giving updated investment opportunities and everything when we get out next week. But we still see, based on our internal business, which is from all the reliability projects, projects associated with the industrial growth, and demand that we see down here, projects that will be required when we build or acquire new generating capacity and everything, obviously we've had a signiﬁcant uptick over the last several years on our transmission investment, and we would think that continues.  And that is before you get into the idea of what we've got now that we're in MISO. And there's really two broad areas where – at least where we see things. We're already seeing some things that are there because now we've got a bigger footprint and more generating capacity we have access to, that we can count on, given the way it's dispatched in MISO. Plus then there'll be the Order 1000 issues and then even things that show up to integrate us with or MISO with the region.  As far as – so we do see that there's some opportunities out there that we're already looking at, but more to come on that front. Obviously, some of those are farther out in the picture than the near-term investments we have in our own system, which are pretty substantial. Theo, I don't know if you want to add to that.    Well, I mean – yeah, I'll add a little bit to that, Leo. I mean, you made a comment in terms of the path of our transmission spending. I mean, if you look back in 2010, we were probably spending somewhere around $280 million or so on transmission. I think if you go forward, we're going to more than double that. So, obviously, our level of transmission spending is increasing as it relates to MISO. MISO does have the study out around their voltage and local reliability mitigation that could potentially drive transmission investment as well.  We've gone through the MTEP process for 2014. There were some projects that were identiﬁed within that process. That process will also occur in 2015, and you could see some projects that were proposed in 2014 become part of the 2015 MTEP process as well. But I think one of the major drivers for us may not be so much MISO but, as Leo mentioned, just the transmission associated with the economic development opportunities that we have. If you look at our EGSL/ELL business combination ﬁling, in some of the details in there, we talk about some of the opportunities that might require transmission investment within the context of that. So, while there could be opportunities relative to MISO, I think we see our transmission opportunity as somewhat broader than that."
"That's very helpful. And I wanted to shift gears to Indian Point. Of late, has there been a dialogue between Entergy and the state over approaches that can be taken, compromises et cetera, or is this playing out primarily in the legal arena?","Stephen, we've had a number of discussions with various representatives of the state, but obviously we continue to aggressively pursue our legal paths. But I think that's all I can say at this point in time."
"Hey, just another really good quarter on the industrial demand side, even relative to probably expectations this spring. How much of that is kind of maybe situational timing relative to what you would have expected? And what point in time are you guys going to be in a spot to reconsider that underlying growth trend?","Theo.      Dan, I'm not – this is Theo. I'm not sure I understood your question in terms of situational. But I think when we look at where we are from an industrial growth perspective in the quarter, I think it's coming from where we would somewhat expect it to. It's primarily coming from expansions in the kind of petrochemical reﬁnery area, and that's where we really expected to be at this point in time. If you look at one of the slides – I'm not sure exactly which number it is – on the 1,700 megawatts we laid out at Analyst Day, I think in terms of completed and signed projects we're at about 300 megawatts, and so we're really just getting started in that regard.  As it relates maybe to the second part of your question in terms of maybe changing expectations, I think we – right now we still feel good about the 3.5% to 3.75%     earnings growth through 2016. And while we continue to ﬁrm that up in terms of what we see, as relates to the 1,700 megawatts, obviously we see movements in; we see movements out. We're still comfortable with that. The question of multiplier eﬀect, the issue of potential energy eﬃciency impacts on the underlying intrinsic growth, we still think about. But with the puts and takes and ins and outs, I mean, I think from our perspective, we're still comfortable with the 3.5% to 3.75% at this point in time."
"Theo, I guess the corollary to that is the residential load hasn't been nearly as impactful, right? And when do you guys see – or do you see the prospects for kind of the multiplier eﬀect starting to show up in numbers as these projects get done, and what should we be watching from the outside to see more uptake on that side?","I don't think we're really seeing the impacts of the multiplier eﬀect at this point. Again, I mean, if you look at the slide, we've only got 300 or 1,700 megawatts that are signed and completed. I think if you look at historically other areas, what they've experienced, I wouldn't say this type of industrial growth because I'm not sure anybody's experienced it in recent history, but some type of industrial growth. Generally, the lag that you see in terms of the multiplier eﬀect happens maybe within a year or a couple years, year and a half after you really start to see the impact of the industrial growth. So we're not quite there yet. And I think that's still to come. We'll see more signed and completed projects as we move forward into 2015 and 2016. And so I think you will start to see the impacts of kind of the trickle-down of multiplier aﬀect more so 2015-2016 timeframe. But, again, we're also going to continue to see impacts of our energy-eﬃciency programs as those are broadened within our service area."
"Question just on – in thinking about the huge industrial growth, when you're signing contracts up with Cameron or Sasol or these diﬀerent large customers, are you – is it mainly a demand-ﬁxed payment no matter how much the facility runs? Just thinking about – we don't know if one day these plants – if conditions could change, they may not run as much, or less. Just how are you kind of locking in the risk of that?","Theo?      This is Theo. I mean, clearly there is a demand element to most of our larger industrial contracts. And that's probably about as far as I'll go, as it relates to that. A lot of those contractual arrangements diﬀer from customer to customer. There are rate tariﬀs that are in eﬀect for some of those service contracts. We also, in some cases, we get facilities charges relative to the particular customer. But clearly there's more of a demand-based type element to rate structures when you talk about those types of customers."
"Okay. Okay. And switching gears, and one thing we've started hearing from a couple companies is some interest in looking at E&P reserves as something to put in rate base, and maybe as like a hedge for customers relative to gas prices, as they're very low right now. Given that you guys have a pretty heavy gas ﬂeet, is that something you've considered and something that you might have interest in?","Yeah. This is Theo again, Dan (sic) [Steve]. It's something that our regulators have historically looked at ways to hedge volatility of gas, I'm sorry – Dan, I meant Steve, I'm sorry. I still had Dan Eggers on my mind for some reason. And as a matter of fact, the LPSC has an open docket right now to look at long-term gas hedging opportunities. And one such opportunity might be to invest in gas in ground, and that could provide an economic long-term physical hedge for our customers. So, yeah, it is something that historically we've had discussions with regulators about and I think we'll continue to have discussions around."
"Thank you. So I had a question about the growth in regulated earnings, and I understand that you're going to be providing us updates during the EEI. But I was just wondering, this write-down of expenses associated with the new nuclear plant, does it have any impact on the rate base, and should we have any worries that your former or current growth trajectory for regulated earnings is going to be lowered?","I guess, Angie, I'll answer the question in terms of impacts on rate base. The asset that was written oﬀ was not in rate base in the Mississippi jurisdiction. So, no, it would not have any impact on our views of rate base going forward. It really wasn't – I think you used the term ""plant."" I wouldn't describe it as a plant. I would really describe it as more of some additional – some early stage cost associating with permitting and licensing processes as we were looking at new nuclear opportunities in earlier years. So clearly not a plant that was in service per se and not an element of rate base. So I would not expect it to have an impact on our views of our rate base growth.  Angie -"
"The reason I'm – yeah, I'm asking because we're missing the slide that you guys usually have with the earnings growth for the regulated utilities.","I'm not sure which slide that is, Angie, but we'll certainly have that for you at EEI."
"Okay. Okay. And then my other question is, so there's been clearly a movement – a downward movement in forward power curves. Could you give us roughly a sense, if we were to mark to market the EWC's earnings power, how much of a change would we see on these bars that you're showing for 2015 and 2016, EBITDA for EWC?","Angie, I don't know if I can comment speciﬁcally on the dollar value. I think from our perspective what we see is that for 2015, it's in line with our POV; 2016 may be slightly lower than our POV, and that widens as you move further out in the curve. So essentially I don't think our point of view has changed much from what we provided to you earlier in the year."
"Hey, guys, couple of questions. First of all, tax rate going forward, you talked about the 32% to 34% for 2015. Do you view that as a normal number, or do you see kind of taxes migrating back towards the higher historical level over time?","This is Drew. So we see it – as we've talked about in the past, we have a portfolio of activities going on with the IRS and at the state levels, and it depends on the timing of audits and things like that. So next year we see 32% to 34%. Beyond that, I think we are still talking about a statutory tax rate in our guidance and our aspirations and outlooks and those types of things. So that's where we are for now."
"Got it. And on the regulated side, two questions. One, with Ninemile, how signiﬁcant – what's the best way to think about what that level of rate increase would be, and when is the earliest you could see that actually go into eﬀect?","Michael, this is Theo. Right oﬀ the top of my head, I don't have a speciﬁc number as it relates to revenue requirements around Ninemile. Probably have to get that for you later, but clearly we would expect that any rate change relative to that would go in eﬀect at the time we see the plant coming online."
"Got it. And last question. Mississippi – as part of the rate deal and some of the other negotiations with staﬀ in the Public Service Commission, are you moving to more of a forward-looking formula rate plan, kind of similar to what one of your large neighbors in the state has, or is that formula rate plan some kind of hybrid or still historical looking?","No, I think, again, Michael – this is Theo – what we have arrived at in agreement in the stipulation is an FRP with what we call forward-looking features, which does allow us to look forward to some extent to kind of calculate and set what we would view as revenue requirements associated with a period of time in the future."
And then are there any restrictions on when you can next ﬁle to get an FRP-related revenue increase?,"Not certain. I'll have to get back with you on that. I don't – obviously, we're going to operate within the formula rate plan constructs that have been in place in Mississippi for years. I mean, that's what we would expect. And my recollection is they don't necessarily have speciﬁcity as to whether you can get a rate increase, by the same token, that formula rate plan has – obviously, it goes both ways. You could see rate decreases. So I'll have to verify that. But just oﬀ the top of my head, I don't believe there's any speciﬁcity, any stipulation around not being able to obtain a rate increase or on the contrary not necessarily experiencing a rate decrease."
"Got it. And my apologies, one last one. Cash levels at the end of the quarter were actually pretty high. I mean, roughly $1 billion if you assume short-term investments as well. Is that just a timing issue in terms of timeline of CapEx, or do you have a greater than expected cash balance that you can deploy to either the balance sheet or investment opportunities?",This is Drew. So it was a little bit elevated. We have a couple big tax payments coming up. I think that's probably part of it.
"Just picking up on something you just said. Are you saying that, when you do your guidance, you're going to guide to a normal tax rate and you were just sort of mentioning the lower tax number, or is that sort of going to be part of the 2015 number you guide to?","No, what I was referring to was for 2015 when we provide that guidance on the fourth quarter call, we would expect – at least as we look at it right now, we'd expect the eﬀective tax rate reﬂected in that to be in the 32% to 34%. As we talked about 2016 as an outlook, we've been talking – we've been using a normalized tax rate for that timeframe."
"Okay. And, secondly, you gave a number of $70 million on pension, and you mentioned the updated actuarial, I guess mortality studies, and then the discount rate. How much of the $70 million, if you can say, has do with the new actuarial study?","It's probably – I can't remember the exact number, but it's around half, I think."
"Thanks. I'm looking, I guess, at your slide 24, which is the EWC EBITDA outlook, and it's very close or right on top of the numbers I think that you provided on the second quarter conference call. But at the time of your second quarter conference call, when you were talking about LHV capacity prices, you were sort of showing a ﬂattish outlook going into the fall. This time you're showing a fairly signiﬁcant decrement. Is there something to oﬀset the decrement that we should be assuming that are keeping sort of these numbers equal to where they were on the second quarter conference call? And if so, what would that oﬀset be?","I think we'll have to get back to you. I don't have that – honestly, I don't have that in my head, Paul, in terms of what that reconciliation would be. But we can follow up with you on that."
I'm all right. Just two clarifying questions. Just on Vermont Yankee on the $25 million. So that we should consider operating earnings?,"Yes. Yes. We're going to call that operational earnings next year. There will be some special items associated with Vermont Yankee next year, and – that related to the decommissioning activities themselves, but it'll be a small amount, and we'll highlight it. But on an ongoing basis, we will be living with the decommissioned facility, and so we're going to switch that to operational."
"Okay. And then also around Vermont Yankee, you mentioned I guess in prepared – I don't know if it's prepared statements, but you said that at this point, I think, you didn't expect any escalation in prices, and I just want to understand what that meant.",Escalation of contributions to the trust fund – is that what you're referring to? Or – ?
"And what's the deﬁnition of that, at this point? Meaning is that – at this point the next 10 years, or at this point – ?","Well, as we look at where we sit with the trust and the expenses and our ﬁnancing strategy associated with all of that, we believe that we won't need to contribute anything to the trust. But that is – we have to still submit here at the end of the year a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report to the NRC, and then they have to sign oﬀ on it. So as we look at it today, we think that we're going to be just ﬁne, but we still had to go through that process."
"Okay. And one last question just on the pensions, on the $70 million. And I would, I guess, put the $25 million on Vermont Yankee in that, too. When you did your Analyst Day earlier in the year, were these expenses contemplated when you kind of talked about your longer-term outlook?","I think the Vermont Yankee mostly was, and some of the pension piece was, but interest rates have fallen further since then. And so I think the pension expense is probably up a bit since then."
Great. Thank you very much. I'll see you for a beer down in Dallas.,"Thanks, Andy.    Operator  And we will take our ﬁnal question from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morning Star."
