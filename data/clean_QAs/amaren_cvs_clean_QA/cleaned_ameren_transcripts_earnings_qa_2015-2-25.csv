"All right. Indeed. Excellent. So perhaps the ﬁrst quick question on the CAGR, if you will, just – why not roll forward and have a consistent rate base EPS CAGR? Anything in particular, particularly as you think about earnings in 2019, or was this just kind of a ﬂuke?","Well, I would not call it a ﬂuke. No, look, we felt that it would be good to continue to provide updates to the guidance that we provided last year. We put a stake in the ground that we expected to grow earnings 7% to 10% from 2013 to 2018. And I think it's certainly important that we continue to let you know where we track against that. As I said on the call, longer term, we really believe that growth in this business is driven by our rate base growth, and longer term certainly plan to provide the rate base growth outlook that we've provided. So we think that's a good basis going forward to continue to provide the longer term outlook."
"Okay. Fair enough. Moving into some of the details here, as you think about gas and speciﬁcally the new rider, is there kind of a full-year contribution here in 2015, or should we think about it as somewhat lagged into 2016 as kind of the beneﬁts fully accrue?","Again, you're talking about the gas business in Illinois, the rider we're using there?"
"Great. And then, a little nitpicky here, but why the reserve now on the ROE for the transmission side? What triggered that, I suppose, if I can ask?","Yeah. What really triggered that is, as we looked at it – we certainly study the orders that FERC's given, not only in ISO New England but with other companies that come before them. There was a December order that FERC issued relative to another company, which we believe gave better clariﬁcation as to how the FERC's going to think about computing the ROEs for the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   various refund periods that exist with respect to these complaint ﬁlings. So using the ISO New England, as well as the guidance provided in that other FERC order, we felt that we could reasonably estimate a reserve to book, thought it was prudent to do so, prudent to get that reserve booked and behind us. And so, therefore, we've done that. You didn't ask speciﬁcally about the amount, but I can tell you that the reserve that we recorded gets you to an ROE about at the same place that the FERC landed in the ISO New England order."
"Wanted to just talk about the resource plan and EPA regulation. Assuming that later this year we do receive a plan that looks a lot like the draft plan that we received, could you talk a little bit about, I guess, how you think and your constituents think about the timing for actually executing the plan? There's always litigation around big, big plans such as this from the EPA. But curious, in the face of that, do you see a need and a desire to try to at least start to move forward with your plan to move towards compliance, or would there be a delay before moving forward, given the litigation? How do you think about that?","Yeah Stephen, this is Warner. Of course, if the EPA issues a Clean Power Plan which is very identical to what the rules are as they've been proposed today, of course, we will move forward to be in compliance with that plan, recognizing, as you rightfully point out, there will be litigation, we believe, surrounding this plan for several years, which is, as you probably know, one of the issues that not just we but many in the industry have raised. But we will do our best to operate under that, but as we've raised to others, we have concerns with not just the economic impacts, but I think what you're starting to see in these hearings that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are conducting are that there are real concerns about reliability   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   risk, signiﬁcant concerns. And so we're hopeful that the EPA is listening very carefully to the concerns that we're raising, those concerns that are being raised in the industry, but also by those that are experts in the industry, to ensure reliability and, frankly, those outside of the industry. So we're hopeful that the EPA, in listening to that, will make modiﬁcations to that rule to make it acceptable, if that rule ultimately withstands the legal challenges."
"Great. That's helpful. And just switching over to transmission, just curious as you think about integrating other utilities in, I'm thinking about Entergy, but more broadly additional transmission planning, it looks like you're prosecuting well on existing projects. But maybe just at a high level, if you could speak to potential for additional transmission spend.","As we pointed out during the call – this is Warner again – we think that the opportunities are really twofold. Number one, while we've talked a lot about the FERC 1000 projects, we sit there – we sit among the seams of SPP, certainly, we have opportunities within MISO, especially with the addition of Entergy, and of course within the seams of PJM. And because of all those things, we believe that there continue to be robust opportunities for us to make proposals, and combine that with our operating experience and our knowledge of the system, we believe we have a very good opportunity to enhance our transmission spend and investment because of those.  But I wouldn't stop there. We've taken a hard look, and continue to do so, in terms of just local reliability projects to continue to improve the system for our customers here within both Missouri and Illinois, as well as in opportunities that would enhance just within MISO. And so, Stephen, I see that with – putting those two things combined, we see meaningful investment opportunities in the transmission business, and especially that's fruitful when you have a framework which is supportive investment in transmission."
"Had a couple kind of speciﬁc questions related to your ROE and interest rate assumptions. So ﬁrst on the Illinois business, it looks like in 2015, you're using a 3% 30-year. So, if you assumed it stayed ﬂat through 2018, I assume your core base is oﬀ like the forward curves for the 30-year or something. Is that how you – ?","Yeah. When we do our planning, certainly, we look to blue-chip estimates of economists that are out there in terms of where they see the interest rates going and – which is where we get the 3%, honestly, is looking at consensus forecast for interest rates for 2015, and then they obviously project out beyond that."
"But if you stayed at 3% over your ﬁve-year growth period, you'd still be within your range but at the lower end maybe or lower half? Is that what you're saying?","Fair question, Steve, and the answer to that is yes. I mean, if you took the ROEs that are embedded in our guidance this year for 2015 and you held those constant out through 2018, we project that we would be within that 7% to 10% range, as you mentioned, albeit at the lower end of the range, perhaps, but clearly within the range."
"Okay. And then a little more explicitly on the FERC transmission ROE aspect and the reserve you're taking and assumptions. So you mentioned you're using the FERC New England methodology, and it happens to come up with kind of roughly similar actual number range. Is that what – to clarify, is that what you said?","Yeah, Steve, that's right. I think that – obviously, we've got an ongoing case. We don't think that we want to get into the details of the computation, and we'll let our testimony in that case speak for itself over time. But I did want to give some sense for the accounting reserve that we booked, and I would tell you that the reserve we booked reﬂects an ROE similar to the outcome of that ISO New England case."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. And then how about in terms of the incentive aspect? So you're adding the 50 bps adder, but you're also including a similar kind of incentive cap that was in that case?","I would say that, Steve, so for the historical period, 2014 back to late 2013, we didn't reﬂect any kind of an adder, any kind of 50-basis-point adder. Going forward, however, in 2015, what has been embedded in our guidance is – I would say, take that – approximately take that ISO New England outcome, add 50-basis-point adder, and that's about what we've got reﬂected in our guidance for 2015."
"Okay. And just to sum up on all this, if you on the FERC transmission business and ROEs, as you go through the period, if you're assuming higher interest rate as you are in Illinois, do you assume you go back into FERC and seek higher ROEs, or do you assume it stays at this reduced level that you're reserving at?","I think, Steve, over time we'll have to assess that. We'll have to see how these cases come out and then assess through time how we'll go about updating FERC ROEs through time. So I don't want to get into exactly what we've got embedded in our 7% to 10% growth in our own plan going forward for FERC. As I mentioned, if you took the current ROEs embedded in our 2015 guidance and held them constant through 2018 without any change, you'd stay within that 7% to 10%. You would have to believe – I guess what I would agree with you on is that, over time, if we see cost of capital rising, if we believe it's prudent to adjust the ROEs upward, we'd certainly take action and pursue that with the FERC."
Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Just wanted to make sure I understood those aspects. So I appreciate going through all of it.,"Absolutely.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Go ahead with your question, please."
"Hi. Just wanted to touch base with you on – just to clarify exactly what was sort of settled on Monday in Missouri and what was left out. So you guys are asking for $190 million. You broke out the components of that pretty well. I'm just sort of trying to getting a sense as to what was   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   settled and what wasn't settled, I guess, in the case, if you could just elaborate a little further on that, on Monday, the non-unanimous settlement that you guys ﬁled.","Sure. Paul, this is Michael Moehn. In terms of what was settled – and it is public and so you can get the stipulation and agreement – it was a lot of issues, our payroll, incentive compensation, advertising, board fees and -"
"I guess what I was wondering is what's not settled, I guess, or what's – do you follow what I'm saying? I mean, what's still contested that you guys have left open? Do you follow me?","Yeah. So the large issues that are open were obviously return on equity. We have some tax issues that are open today. Obviously, the trackers, the FAC, the Oﬃce of the Public Counsel is proposing to remove that tracker or change the sharing percentage. Staﬀ is proposing to remove the storm tracker. There's some meaningful depreciation issues that are still open today, and there are a few amortization issues that are at risk as well."
"So the bid and the ask, I guess, between staﬀ and you? Do we have an updated number on that?","No. Steve – sorry, Paul. No. We don't have, really, I can't say, a good point estimate for where the staﬀ is today. We did put sort of a stake in the ground here in terms of our own position, which is – obviously, we know our own position, which is in the back, you'll see $190 million. $100 million of that's net energy costs. About $90 million of it's other costs.  I can tell you that in terms of – from the original case that we ﬁled to the case that we have today, our non-fuel ask is down about $45 million. That's probably $25 million to $30 million due to lower rate base, primarily bonus depreciation. The other $15 million to $20 million is due to updates of pension, post-retirement medical, and active medical. So a lot of those costs are – actually go through riders and trackers, but gives you a little bit of a sense for how our position moved from the original position to where we are today. Michael provided you some of the color on some of the positions that the other parties have taken; we've provided an overview or summary of that in our materials as well in the appendix, but can't give you, as I sit here today, an exact bid-ask spread."
"Okay. And then you mentioned the seams opportunity that you guys have, which makes a lot of sense. But, as you know, there's also a proceeding or a couple – well I guess sort of a   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   generalized, generic proceeding with respect to MISO PJM on capacity transfer and day-ahead and a whole variety of other things. And although it's been moving slowly in some respects, it's moving. It appears to be, at least. And FERC has recently put out an order and stuﬀ on it. I'm just wondering, do you have any perspective on that, and could that impact your transmission opportunities depending on how that unfolds, or are those transmission opportunities there pretty much regardless of what happens with this generic PJM-MISO seems -","Yeah, Paul. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, Paul. Anything else?"
"Okay. And then just on the Missouri legislation, where do we sort of stand on that, and how does it look vis-à-vis last year's eﬀorts?","Yeah. Again, Paul, this is Michael Moehn. And as Warner said, I mean, it is similar legislation, the Senate Bill 310, House Bill 925 is very similar to last year. I think we're early in the session. So it's diﬃcult to speculate sort of the outcome. I mean, we're spending a lot of time with various stakeholders, again, explaining – there's a lot of freshman legislators there – explaining to them the importance of this legislation, the need to modernize the regulatory framework, to get working on the aging infrastructure issue. We're certainly mindful that all of the utilities in Missouri are in for rate cases, and so that's just a factor that we have to be aware of. But as we've said in the past, I mean, we're going to continue to pursue this and be relentless about trying to get it across the ﬁnish line. But I think it's probably a bit premature to speculate the outcome.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Anything speciﬁcally diﬀerent than the last couple – I mean, you guys have made these eﬀorts before. Is there anything in the environment that you might want to point to as being perhaps more constructive for you to get this (55:44)?","I think the environment is really about the same at this point. I think there's probably better understanding of the issue today as we continue to spend more and more time with folks about how serious the aging infrastructure issue is and trying to address it. But beyond that, the environment is very similar."
"You mentioned the 3% 30-year Treasury rate assumption in the 2015 guidance. Could you just remind us – I assume that's at the midpoint of your guidance. But if interest rates sort of change say 25 basis points relative to that 3% assumption, what's the EPS impact?","Sure. At 25 basis points, it's probably a penny to a penny and a half. We actually did provide a sensitivity, when you take a look at slide 13 – it's in kind of small print, I recognize – but in the Ameren Illinois electric delivery section we note that a 50-basis-point move in ROE would change the EPS about $0.025. So obviously 25 basis points would be about half of that."
"Right. And if we were to use 2014 actual EPS – or weather-normalized EPS – as a base, would your kind of EPS CAGR be more like 6% to 9.5% versus the 7% to 10% oﬀ the 2013 base?","Oh, you're talking about the – what year do you want to measure if oﬀ of? 2014 looking out to 2018?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay. Great. And it seems like you mentioned the $300 million less rate base in the Missouri operations, but it looks like your CapEx in 2015 is higher. It's kind of like the – and you reiterated the 6% rate base CAGR. So when we look to 2018 and 2019, do you still kind of fall in the same spot you previously were?","Well, you raise a good point. When you look at our CapEx for this past year, we really came in right where we said we would. We'd forecasted to be at about $1.850 billion, and we ﬁnished the year nearly $1.8 billion, so pretty much on top of where we'd expected. We are expecting a little bit of an uptick in 2015 in terms of capital expenditures, up about another $175 million, as we reported on the call, to about $1.960 billion. And that level is a little bit of an uptick, mainly due to the timing of our projects.  But if also you take a look at the slide 16 that we provided, where we lay out our expected capital expenditures over the ﬁve-year period, we're projecting $8.9 billion of regulated infrastructure investment over this period, and that's actually up over the prior-year ﬁve-year period. So we'd – back in last year, we'd said 2014 through 2018 was going to be about $8.3 billion. Now, we've moved up to $8.9 billion. So we've added about $600 million of overall capital expenditures to this ﬁve-year plan as compared to the old one. So we've added expenditures. We've added expenditures that will translate into rate base growth an amount that is roughly double what we see as the negative impact of bonus depreciation. So we've more than oﬀset the impact of bonus depreciation with identiﬁed additional projects to invest in for the beneﬁt of our customers.  And when you look on slide 9, that's where we actually show then our expected rate base growth. And basically, we're expecting to grow rate base 6% from 2014 to 2019. That's a very similar rate to what we'd had before for 2013 to 2018. But you can see, because of that added capital expenditures over the ﬁve-year period, that the ending rate base of – projected rate base of $15.5 billion is about 9% more than what we had last year projected at the end of 2018. And so one should not assume either that the CapEx that we added is back-end loaded. It's really been added throughout the period, but ultimately leads to a rate base number at the end of 2019 which is about 9% higher than what we had been projecting for 2018.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, you mentioned reg lag in Missouri impacted 2014 results in that jurisdiction. Is it possible to quantify what your earned ROE was in Missouri in 2014?","When you get the 10-K, I think you can calculate it. You may be able to calculate it oﬀ the stats page. We earned pretty close but slightly below the allowed ROE in Missouri. What we're really talking about, about lag on the call, though, was more about 2015. We put a number of projects into service at the end of 2014. Those begin to be depreciated, and we're no longer capitalizing return on those. So, as we roll into early 2015, we do experience some lag until we can get the rates reset to reﬂect recovery of those costs and rates that reﬂect an appropriate return on those investments. So that's the lag, I think, we were really pointing to on the call."
Is it possible to quantify that lag in terms of basis points oﬀ the allowed?,"No. I don't have that for you. It's basically, we'll have that lag for the ﬁrst ﬁve or so months of the year, but don't have an exact quantiﬁcation of that."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, guys. Congrats on a good 2014, and thank you for taking my questions. One small one. What do you assume in guidance for costs at the holding company or parent level?","Yeah, sure. Michael, good morning, by the way. This is Marty. Good question. So last year we had guided that – I guess in 2013, we'd had about $0.18 or so of parent and other costs. We had projected to drive those down in 2014, which we were successful at doing. We said to $0.10 (1:04:05) which is where we ended up. Including, I would say, the eﬀects of dilution, we're probably at about $0.09 of drag, and we expect that we'll be able to reduce that further in 2015. Of course, you know that we get the full-year beneﬁt of that maturity at the parent company where we have the high-cost debt. So we do expect another $0.04 or so of interest savings. So expect to drive that number down to maybe about $0.05. And depending upon taxes or things like that, maybe even a hair lower, but we're expecting $0.05 or a little bit under in terms of parent company drag in 2015."
"Got it. And when thinking longer term in Illinois. Do you think there is a – whether it's legislative or whether it's done via the regulatory process – there is a transformative-like investment opportunity on the gas delivery side like what's happened on the electric delivery side for both you and Commonwealth Edison in Illinois in terms of the legislation that was passed a few years ago and what it did to both capital spending, rate base growth, investment in the system, employment, et cetera?","I don't know, Michael, whether there is anything more transformative. I think when you look at the gas business in Illinois, we've already, I'd say, ramped up some investment (1:05:42) there because we do see that as a constructive environment as it exists today. As you know, we have the ability to use forward-looking test years for our gas rates. And the rate case that we have pending today, as we mentioned on the call, looks out to 2016 and uses 2016 projected costs and rate base. We think that's constructive. And then we've begun to be able to use basically a rider for our qualifying infrastructure projects so that we can actually adjust rates monthly between rate cases to reﬂect the return of and return on those qualifying projects.  So we believe there's been enhancement made to the framework which is actually allowing us to step up investments, and we are replacing meter modules in the gas business alongside the meter replacement program that we've got going on the electric portion of the business. And it's allowing us also to make some necessary investments in that business to ensure the safety as well as reliability of the gas business. I think, moreover, Michael, what we may see that may reﬂect or spur investment over time, we think, again, the framework is good, but it will be whether we see some additional safety rules that come out at the national level or (1:07:08) that may drive actually investment and spending. But we do believe we have the framework in place that if we are required to make those investments, that we'll be treated absolutely fairly in terms of the regulatory processes."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Thank you, Marty. One last one, and little bit of a housekeeping item here. Can you break up – the slide's confusing a little bit – what the ATXI transmission rate base is at the end of 2014 or the average rate base versus the Ameren Illinois transmission rate base, and then that same question but on the CapEx side for 2015?","Yeah. Doug's going to see if he can pull that out. If he can't pull it – I don't have that in front me. If he can't pull it out readily, Michael, that's certainly something we can follow up and provide to you. I will tell you that just in terms of the earnings for 2015, I think we're looking at maybe about $0.05 or so of earnings from ATXI in 2015. So that's sort of embedded in our guidance, and we can pull that out. (1:08:28)     Michael, I don't have it at my ﬁngertips, but we did give you some websites at the back of the presentation that show our Attachment O ﬁlings for 2015. The total is about $1.4 billion average rate base for 2015, but the breakout is public, and it's in there. I apologize that I don't have that right in front of me."
