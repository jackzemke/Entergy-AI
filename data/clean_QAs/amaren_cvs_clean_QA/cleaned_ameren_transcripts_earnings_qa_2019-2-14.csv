Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien.","Good morning, Julien.     No worries. How are you doing this morning?"
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I just wanted to start quickly on the incremental equity funding for the wind, this is what's in excess of the DRIP. Can you just expand at all on in terms of the magnitude of the funding needed there or how we should think about quantifying that whether it's from solving for an FFO to debt metric or just in terms of how you plan to ﬁnance it?","Yeah. Good morning, Nick. This is Marty. I think it's probably good to step back and look at the totality of what we said and what we've said on prior calls. We feel very good about the capitalization levels that we have today, meaning the debt to equity ratios, and that's both at the parent, as well as the various legal entities that we have. And we're going to seek to keep levels in line with those or approximating those levels over the ﬁve-year guidance period. We believe we can do that given the retained earnings associated with our ongoing operations and some equity ﬁnancing as we noted on the call.  So the equity ﬁnancing, as you know, comes in two parts. I mean, one of it that we noted is through the dividend reinvestment, employee beneﬁt programs. There, we think we can generate about $100 million a year of equity proceeds or about $500 million over the period. And then, we expect to issue some additional equity in an amount which equates to a portion of our ultimate wind investment as we mentioned on the call, that amount being sized to achieve the capital structure objectives that we talked about earlier.  So, look, I recognize you're maybe looking for a little bit more speciﬁcity. But as we think about what we've said and we think about the wind, I'd also ask you to think about how Ameren Missouri is ﬁnanced overall today which is about 52% equity knowing that the wind ultimately is going to end up in that legal entity."
"Appreciate that. And then just like the timing of the wind CapEx, that should all be realized in one year roughly. Is that correct?","Nick, I think it's a good way to think about it. The 557 megawatts that we've announced today, we're going to acquire through build-transfer agreements. So there, again, we look for those deals to close between the middle of 2020 and end of 2020. And so, I would be thinking about the cash ﬂows occurring during that period of time."
"Great. And then, my last question just on the – sticking with Missouri, I think you had a net $1.5 billion increase in the ﬁve-year program, I saw that you ﬁled, I think, your grid mod plan, and can you just kind of talk about your expectations for grid mod versus the your previous expectation sort of $1 billion and if that had shifted at all?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Maybe I could talk a little bit about the overall investment picture which is on the slide 15 and then see if you have some follow-up questions or we can elaborate in some way. I mean, overall, we had a – previously, a plan of 2018 to 2022. Obviously, when you roll forward, you're not only just spending within those periods, but also we're looking out to 2023. And so, overall, it's a $13.3 billion plan for the ﬁve-year period looking ahead.  If you compare to the prior plan, I think what you'd ﬁnd is, as we've said, we have a strong pipeline of growth in each of our segments. And so, as you look at the capital spend and the updated four to ﬁve-year period for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas and Transmission, those are all pretty consistent with the levels of investment that we made over the – we're planning for the prior ﬁve-year plan that we'd given.  The real updates here and I think long – should meet with, generally, expectations as we've added $1 billion for Ameren Missouri wind generation investment, this $1 billion is really associated with the 557 megawatts that we've announced to date. And then getting to your point, the capital expenditure plan outside of that wind for Missouri is $5.8 billion which compares favorably to the plan we had before which was $4.3 billion over ﬁve years.  So, again, it is up $1.5 billion over the ﬁve-year period. As you mentioned, of course, we're rolling forward to a future period and, so in any event, I think you're absolutely right as you would have expected given Senate Bill 564 in the wind generation investment, the investment in Missouri overall is up in the plan."
"Good morning. First question and I just wanted to clarify the – one of the remarks I think you had made in your opening comments in regards to the 6% to 8% EPS CAGR that you have over the next ﬁve years. And correct me if I'm wrong, but did I hear it right that the 8% CAGR would normalize for the Callaway outage and exclude that whereas the 6% would include that? Did I hear that right or does the 8% also contemplate including the Callaway outage?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah. Ali, good morning. This is Marty, let me answer that. No, I think what we meant to say there, what Warner was saying is that 6% to 8% range, if you will, would accommodate either inclusion or exclusion of the costs of the Callaway outage in 2023. Clearly, we are planning for an outage in 2023, we had none in 2018. We think the best way to look at our earnings growth proﬁle over time is to normalize for things like the Callaway outage timing and weather, but we wanted folks to know that whether you were thinking about earnings in 2023 including or excluding those costs that we believe that our earnings guidance range was such that it'd accommodate either."
"I see. But, Marty, just to be clear, so including – if we include those costs and keep them in there, that could still get us to an 8% CAGR?","Well, it would depend on other things. Again, it's a range. So, what I'm saying is, if you include the costs, it still gets you into that range. If you exclude the costs, you're within the range, but wasn't really commenting on whether you would get to the 8% or not.  Ali, I think the way to think about it is the range accommodates a number of things. I mean, it accommodates a range of Treasury rates, allowed ROEs, earned ROEs, various spending levels, regulatory decisions, sales levels, economic conditions, ﬁnancing plans, all of those things. So, when we give out the range, the range accommodates all of those variables that may occur."
"Okay. And second clariﬁcation as well, Marty. So, I think as you mentioned for the wind investments, you're looking at completing those acquisitions mid to late 2020. And I'm assuming that to the extent there's additional wind that comes in that's also a 2020 timeframe period. So, when we think about additional equity, should we think all of that, if required, will be a 2020 event and all the other years, we should model out $100 million a year or should we think diﬀerently? And also for modeling purposes, should we assume wind will be an earnings contributor, the incremental wind will be an earnings contributor in 2020?","Sure. Ali, let me take those a little bit in reverse order. In terms of the wind, as I mentioned, one of the things we want to get done is to get those in, in 2020 working with the developers to make sure we take maximum advantage of the production tax credit. So, with respect to the projects that we've announced to date the 557 megawatts, as well as additional wind investments that we're pursuing that are not embedded in the current plans, in both cases, we're seeking to work with the developers to acquire projects that will get completed, as I mentioned earlier, in the second half of 2020. So, as you think about that, there would be some earnings impact in 2020, but it really would depend on when those projects went into service or when they get into rate base in 2020, and you really get to, I think, a more full annualized   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   beneﬁt of the wind when you get into 2021. And as you get through the rate cases associated with those even into 2022, but you're really going to get to a more full annualized beneﬁt again in that 2021 timeframe.  Now, as it relates to the equity, we talked about today that we do expect incremental equity to fund a portion of the wind investment. And so, again, those cash ﬂows, you're right, occur in the 2020 timeframe. So, that's a consideration. And then, I would also say that, again, we have not announced the – we aspire to acquire additional wind beyond the 557 megawatt. And so, as we complete those negotiations, we'll be certainly thinking about ﬁnancing that in addition to what we've talked about, the wind we've announced to date, and we'll be thinking about the sizing in a way that's consistent with what we've discussed today and on prior calls."
"Okay. And last question, I know in the past when you talked about the SB 564 related CapEx, you had mentioned, at a minimum, $1 billion over ﬁve years, and I guess based on your commentary today, it looks like it's more than $1 billion at least embedded in this ﬁve-year plan. Does that still leave you room for even additional upside to that CapEx as we think about these ﬁve years or do you think this is pretty much what you expect to spend now going forward?","Ali, this is Warner. Thanks for the question. I'll let Michael comment a little bit further because he just ﬁled the Smart Energy Plan. I'll just start with this saying that the robust infrastructure plan that we talked about over 5 years and 10 years in Missouri, as I sit here today, it still remains robust beyond just the ﬁve years and frankly continues to grow with various needs. But, Michael, you can talk a little bit about what you've incorporated in the ﬁve-year plan and certainly some opportunities that you continue to see from Missouri.     Well, I mean – I think, Warner, just adding a little bit to that. I mean, obviously, we have the $5.3 billion that we ﬁled today on the electric side. As we get in and develop this plan and be able to show all the customer beneﬁts, it's obvious that we're ﬁnding just more opportunities, and I think, you described it as a robust plan. I would say that that is absolutely the case and we look forward to continuing to work through time and looking for projects that can provide meaningful beneﬁts to customers.     And so, the bottom line, when you look back, three years ago, when we talked about that plan that was ﬁled, we look at the grid modernization opportunities, every bit as robust today as we looked at them back then three years ago."
"Good morning. Maybe starting on the wind side, just to clarify, by 2020, the 700 megawatts that you guys are targeting or at least the 700 megawatts, that imply that, I guess, versus the current plan that you have today, you'll have another around 150 megawatts at least announced and built and transferred by 2020, or are you – when you're talking about negotiating with multiple developers, are there opportunities beyond that 700 megawatts that you're talking about or is that largely it?","Hi. This is Michael Moehn. As we think about it today, I mean, we're obviously very focused on that 700 megawatts for that Missouri renewable standard, having that 15% by 2021. Obviously, we're keeping our mind and options open as we move through time in terms of other oﬀerings that we have out there, but we're really focused on ﬁlling out that 700 megawatts at this point."
"Understood. And then, on the costs side, I think in the past you've targeted maybe not a formal guidance, but trying to keep O&M growth ﬂat on a year-over-year basis. Is that still part of your plan?","Yeah. Insoo...     Never mind, Marty please.     Yeah. Insoo, this is Marty. Yeah, as we look ahead, I mean, that continues to be our goal. I mean, we recognize that one of our objectives is to make sure that we can carry out this $13.3 billion infrastructure plan for the beneﬁt of our customers, and keep rates aﬀordable along the way. So, we will look to keep tight control on our O&M costs as we look ahead."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Understood. And then maybe just one more, if I could. The recent electric vehicle decision, I know it's a fairly small part of your investment opportunity, but that decision for the ﬁve year, $4 million or so, does that basically cap how much you're going to be spending in that arena at least for the medium term?","Yeah. Again, this is Michael. Yeah, I would say, it's a start with respect to what we're trying to do from a transportation perspective. We're excited about having the opportunity to build out this corridor. I think we will continue to evaluate over time. I think the Commission has actually opened up a workshop to have some further conversations beyond just the charging corridor that they approved. So, that could ultimately end up including other types of charging as well. So, we look forward to engaging in that discussion and see if we can move this discussion forward.     Kim, I thought I'd just add, look, I think this is clearly a step forward. And importantly, I think what Mike and his team have been able to do is just raise the level of awareness and the conversation in the State of Missouri on this. And so, this is what we have today, but dialogue is – it will be ongoing here in the relative near future and we look forward to continue to lean further forward in the electriﬁcation because we think there are real opportunities and beneﬁts for our customers in the State of Missouri. And we will be looking at similar types of things, frankly, in the State of Illinois, too, because we see similar beneﬁts over there as well."
"So, I just wanted to discuss the Smart Energy Plan ﬁled in Missouri and just better understand the regulatory process and just how we think about where procedurally it goes from here. It's obviously great that the customer bills or the bill impact is capped. It seems to all make sense, but I just wanted to understand a little bit more about what we should be looking for now that you've made that ﬁling.","Sure. Michael, why don't you talk about that because I know that some of this is embedded in Senate Bill 564, so why don't you give an update there?     Perfect. Thanks for the question. Look, it obviously was an important ﬁling that we did today with the Commission. We're required to lay out in quite a bit of detail for 2019 where our investments are going to go and then a little less detail for the next step for years through 2023. What else is contemplated is a public meeting that's scheduled for March 4, we'll again lay out the customer beneﬁts associated with this, where our investments are going, et cetera and get some feedback from that.  And then, obviously, Senate bill 564 didn't change the Commission's authority anyway. So, they'll have a chance to weigh in as we go through regular rate reviews and have an opportunity to look at where we're making investments, et cetera. So, we look forward to engaging with them around this and getting feedback along the way.     And I would just add, Steve, when you look at the details of the plan, I think these are the things that we have been talking about as needed in the State of Missouri, frankly, for many years. And so, I think what we've now provided is just greater levels of detail and, as we referred to a little bit earlier, Mike and his team had put together a plan three years ago almost now that highlighted some of these things. So, a lot of the dialogue and conversations around these have been discussed before, now we're giving a lot more detail which I think is certainly appropriate at this time.     Yeah, that's right. I mean, I think the other thing just to note is that we have been operating under this Senate Bill 564 really since September 1, and next thing you noted the 6% rate reduction that occurred as part of the tax refund, we obviously had some solar rebates that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   we're required to do, all of that has been taken care of. We got recently an Economic Development Rider approved. And so, I give you that just because there are a number of aspects that we have been executing underneath the Senate Bill 564 for some time."
"And that all makes sense, it does seem consistent with what you've talked about before. And just shifting over to Illinois, I guess, there's some discussion of a potential movement towards greater levels of clean energy in the state. I'm just curious from your system perspective or just more broadly investment opportunities, changes to the grid, anything else that you would foresee if the state did in fact move towards greater levels of clean energy.","Yeah, sure. Stephen, this is Warner. And then Richard, feel free to jump in. Look, big picture, when you think about renewable generation, we're not allowed to own renewable generation in the State of Illinois. And so, we stay very mindful of the activities there because certainly since we purchase energy on behalf of our customers, we want to make sure that that rates continue to be good, as well as making sure that the reliability is thought through.  Having said that, Richard was at the table with key stakeholders during the Governor's transition period and they talked about the transition plan around energy policy. And one of the things that we pointed out very clearly is that the energy policy in the State of Illinois is working quite well, the formula rates is working quite well. And so, when we see that if there're investment opportunities associated with that and for our distribution business to make sure we can continue to deliver the safe, reliable service for our customers, we will do so.  If we become more broadly in terms of a renewable generation, certainly, we will be thoughtful about transmission opportunities. Because we've said this before and will say it again, when you look at the MISO footprint, there are a lot of wind and solar projects going on in the MISO footprint and we stand ready and are able to help implement those with not just interconnection agreements, but perhaps sometime down the road, there'll be an opportunity for multi-value projects. Early innings, but we could see that as a potential opportunity.  And so, Richard, I know that you've been working with your team over there. Anything that you would add to what I said?     I think you covered it perfectly. I think that's really a good observation of how it's going to work in Illinois.     Great. Thank you."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Thank you very much.,"Sure. Thanks, Stephen.  Operator  Our next question comes from Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Kevin."
"I'm good. Thank you. Just to clarify, is the implied cost per kw on the 557 megawatts of wind you guys have right now a reasonable proxy for what it'd cost to get you up to the 700 megawatts?","Yeah, this is Michael Moehn. I think it's diﬃcult. You got to be a little careful with it just because so many diﬀerent factors apply here in terms of there's some beneﬁts associated with doing projects in state, there's a 1.25% credit versus out-state. There's capacity factor issues. So, you can probably draw some conclusions, but you got to be a little careful with it just in terms of some of the speciﬁcs."
"Okay. Fair enough. But the actual target amount is the 700 megawatts, correct?","That is what we are focused on.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   That is where we're focusing. Kevin, maybe I'll add to that though and build oﬀ of what Michael said to Insoo earlier. I mean, hitting 700 megawatts neatly is a diﬃcult thing to do. These projects are varying sizes. So, one of the things we said – if you look closely at the wording we used, we said at least 700 megawatts. It could be that the ultimate project that's selected and picked would actually be get us to a number that was above 700 megawatts, because again it's diﬃcult to ﬁnd a site that neatly gets you to 700 megawatts. So, we think it's going to be at least 700 megawatts. But the target again is to fulﬁll the requirements under the Renewable Energy Standard which we believe is put approximate about 700 megawatts."
"Okay. That's helpful. And the other thing is I think a securitization bill has been introduced in the Missouri legislature. I know you guys have said in the past you have very low dispatch costs on your coal ﬂeet. But if the securitization was passed, would that change the dynamic there and kind of a steel for fuel type of outlook?","You're right. There are a couple of securitization bills fooling around. Look, I would just say at a very high level and, Marty, you can certainly add to this as well. I mean, we're having some conversations with those stakeholders and none of those bills have been assigned a committee yet, so that they haven't had a hearing at this point. But we look forward to continue to have some conversations around the details of these bills and what beneﬁt there may or may not be there for us."
