Question,Answer
Just wanted to touch on the FERC order regarding the dispute of power purchase agreement. Are there any ongoing impacts to earnings that we should be thinking about or is this more of a one time item for this quarter?,"Yes, Steven. There aren't any ongoing impacts associated with that. The $0.07 gain we had is a reversal of some negative impacts that we had in prior years as a result of the Entergy charges, those negative impacts had been included in core earnings in the past which is why we reﬂected this gain in core earnings. That said, we now have a fuel adjustment clause in place in Missouri and there are no ongoing impacts from this settlement."
"Okay. Understood. And then switching gears to MISO capacity, what are the next steps that we should be thinking about or further steps to come post the FERC order?","I think the thing we are really focused on is this capacity portability issue. And I think the next steps are for in accordance with the FERC's ruling for MISO and PJM to hold discussions about some of the barriers to portability as well as other issues that they have. And then we and other parties will be ﬁling comments with FERC regarding the portability issues. So, those are the ongoing things to watch for."
"The Illinois pollution deferral -- regulatory deferral that you are asking for in terms of implementation, how should we think about the impact of that on your plans where they stand now, I guess, vis-à-vis this issue. There was a press report yesterday that there was a potential plant closures et cetera if this wasn't deferred and I wanted to get some sense as to where things stand?","Sure, Paul. I think what you would be seeing in the press reports would be consistent with things we've talked about on our past couple of calls. Obviously, earlier this year as a result of the drop   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   in power prices amongst other things, we decelerated construction of the Newton Scrubber Project. We talked about the fact that one of the obstacles we had was the Illinois multi- pollutant standard and the ratchet down in terms of SO2 emissions in the 2015 timeframe."
"I understand. I don't mean to make you go over that, I apologize. What I was trying to ﬁgure out was, if current -- if you were to get this will this make things -- I mean in other words, we should be under the operate, the guidance and your forecast and everything are under the expectation that we don't have a change. Is that correct? And if you did get the change, how might that change things? Do you follow what I'm saying? Am I understanding that correctly?","I guess so. But there is not, I would say an immediate near term impact as we look out, we are concerned about that ratchet down out in 2015. And to the extent that relief isn't granted from the -- by the pollution control board in the Newton Scrubber is not reaccelerated, then we do face the prospect of plant closures as discussed in our prepared remarks. This is really an impact when we look out to that 2015 timeframe."
"Okay. And then with respect to guidance, I gather if I understand this correctly it is because of the FERC order and because of better than normal weather in the Second Quarter that you guys are raising the guidance, is that correct?","Yes, those were some of the things that we had. You may recall, Paul that after the First Quarter we'd actually lowered our guidance from our regulated entities by about $0.05 on either end of the range. And that's because in the First Quarter we had about $0.10 of negative impact from weather, and so we lowered the guidance $0.05. We've seen an improvement in the weather situation. We are still down year-to-date by about $0.03 on a net basis versus normal. But we did see some positive impact in the Second Quarter from weather. And, we also had the, as you noted, in the positive FERC ruling. Those things allowed us to move the guidance back up $0.05 to where we started the year for the regulated entities.  Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS."
"First on the treasuries and the Illinois formula [ph] rates, I noticed that you mentioned 3% here. Is that still using the blue chip average? And then, secondly, did that have sort of a mark-to- market impact in the Second Quarter and what was that? I apologize if I missed that in your prepared remarks.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","That's ﬁne Julien, the 3% reﬂects the actual experience in terms of 30 year treasuries for the ﬁrst half of the year as well as blue chip forecast as of July. So it's really the average for the year which is what's included in the ROE. So that 3% is what's baked into the guidance. In terms of the way to think about that, about every 10 basis points or so is about $0.005 per share. About a 30 basis point move is a $0.015 to $0.02 when you're thinking about the impact of something like that. Overall, I wouldn't say there was a mark-to-market. The regulatory asset that we recorded at the end of the First Quarter was unchanged at the end of the Second Quarter as it related to that business.  Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs."
"On Illinois Marty, just want to make sure I follow. The rate base level declined from 2012 in your ﬁling the 2013 little bit over right around $100 million to $120 million some odd. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes? Meaning, net capital additions minus normal course depreciation and then minus bonus depreciation just so we can think through the give and take and then think about how this impacts post 2013?","Michael, I don't have a full reconciliation to walk you though. Maybe something you can follow up with Doug after the call. You highlighted one of the drivers for that decrease, the biggest is really that bonus depreciation which has been included. Of course, that's been reﬂected in the guidance. I think what you have seen in some of these cases that we have pending, is folks arguing that the cumulated depreciation should be included in the rate base. And certainly for this year in terms of the way we have been forecasting our earnings and forecasting our rate base, we have included the deferred tax update from bonus depreciation in there, so that's a big driver."
I have a clariﬁcation question on the FAC order. If I understand it correctly you took a $18 million charge in 2011. No charge in 2011 and then you'd reversed the charge in 2013 pending the favorable opinion. Is that correct?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"That could be. Don't want to speculate on the outcome in '13. But yes we took a charge last year of about $0.05 as noted on the call there is still about $25 million or $26 million pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission that we expect them to rule on later this year. And then we will see how these court appeals play out. Obviously we took a charge because of the last year because of the commission's decision and of course we ﬂowed those moneys back through the FAC. If at some point that commission decision is reversed one way or another, and ultimately we are able to collect those moneys, at that point it would become a gain."
"Within your 2012 core earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.55, what is the amount of parent company drag when you are not allocating nonrecourse debt interest expense related to that?","I don't know that what the parent company drag is typically what we've done with our debt for the most part is allocated those costs out. The parent company debt that exists, the $425 million of debt, you know for the most part those interest charges actually get allocated out to the merchant segment and a senior [ph] supporting that merchant segment. So while there the $425 million is an obligation of Ameren Corporation, the debt is being seen as supporting capital expenditures made at the merchant segment over time. Primarily, well I shouldn't say primarily, really at AERG which is a non-registrant so we allocate those interest costs out to that segment."
"There is a much larger component of nonrecourse debt that you also book within the merchant generation section that would go away if you walked away from those businesses. Just trying to understand if you separated from the merchant generation businesses, what are the ongoing expense that you would have at the holding company level to oﬀset against the regulated utilities?","In terms of the debt, there is $825 million or so of debt at Ameren Energy Generating that is nonrecourse debt. That interest expense is allocated to Ameren Energy Generating and AER and then there's the other $425 million up at Ameren Corp. And again, that's an Ameren Corp   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   obligation and the interest expense is allocated down to that segment, Ameren Energy Resources.  Operator  David Paz, Bank of America."
"I was wondering, following the agreement on MEEIA, what are the prospects of settlement in your ending Missouri rate case?","David, I think maybe I will let Warner Baxter take that one.     David, how are you doing?"
"Great. And just one question regarding your merchant segment. What price level, Marty, are you looking for or you would need to avoid moth balling the two of the three unscrubbed coal plants?","David, there's not I'd say, a speciﬁc price level that I'd point to that would cause us to avoid that. I think what you are really asking is there a certain price level at which the Newton Scrubber would be reaccelerated. And consistent with what we said on prior calls, I think that we've   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   estimated that if we reaccelerated we'd probably need something like 20 months or 24 months of construction time to have that scrubber in service. So we continue to have some time to watch how things develop. But it's not just power prices, certainly we watch power prices, when I think of power, I guess I should say, I think of energy and I think of capacities. We are watching energy prices, capacity prices, developments in terms of federal environmental regulations and the like. So, there will be a host of factors but I can't point to a speciﬁc price that would be sort of a threshold.  Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates."
"I just wanted to follow up so I understood the guidance. It looks like there is about $0.07 of extra weather in the Second Quarter and $0.07 associated with the -- $0.07 for the weather and $0.07 of FERC, which is about $0.14. And you mentioned how you had re-adjusted your numbers previously. Is there anything that we should think about that would lower the number, so that we only have the $0.05 increase in guidance, or is there something -- or are you guys just being conservative?","Yes. So you are right. The numbers you gave out are right. The Q2 weather versus normal was about a plus $0.07. Then the FERC agreement was another $0.07 that you are absolutely right. I think in terms of again why $0.05? I think that again, we are still down weather wise because we had a $0.10 drag in the First Quarter. We only reduced the regulated guidance by about $0.05. We have picked up $0.07 of that, yes in the Second Quarter, but are still down net $0.03 year- to-date due to weather. As asked on a prior call we've had about a 30 basis point drop in the ROE's in Illinois. Which again as I said earlier, is probably a $0.015 to $0.02 of earnings. And then I think one other thing, Paul, that we mentioned on the call is when we strip out weather, we are seeing pretty ﬂat load growth in terms of residential commercial year-to-date. We did at the beginning of the year and frankly continue to expect as we look to the second half of the year, to see some growth in those categories. Year-to-date we haven't seen any, now weather normalization obviously is not an exact science. We've had pretty good extremes both in terms of the winter months and the spring, summer months year-to-date. Sometimes those can cause variations, but we are seeing things pretty ﬂat year-to-date. Those are some of the factors. The other thing I would say though Paul, that we mentioned, is that the July weather has been extremely warm and continues to be extremely warm, even this week. None of the impacts of that favorable weather in July have been reﬂected in the guidance that we've provided."
"That's great. Just one other that leads me to my second question which is have you guys had any new peaks? Have you found any change in peak demand? You mentioned the sales growth being kind of ﬂattish and I think that's what a lot of people have seen -- or even actually down weather normalized. Just in terms of you had amazingly hot weather I think in the midwest, at least it looked like it was from reports. What are you guys seeing in terms of peak demand?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yes, I should have brought some exact data so I don't. I can tell you that while we had some very strong demands, I think we are still down from some of the peaks we saw a couple years ago. Maybe I will ask somebody else to comment on that quickly.     This is Maureen Borkowski. On a transmission system basis, we did set a new all time peak on July the 25 of, I forget the exact number, I think it was 18,588 megawatt's. Based on the two individual Companies, Ameren Illinois did set a new all time peak on that same day. Ameren Missouri has not yet exceeded its all time peak which was in 2007.  Operator  Brian Taddeo, Gleacher and Company."
"First question is with regards to your request for environmental variance in Illinois with the hearing having taken place yesterday, you -- what's the next step here? Is there another hearing date or is the next thing we will hear is a ruling coming out of the board?","There won't be another hearing set, and we basically would expect to see a decision by the Pollution Control Board deadline September the 20."
"Have they given you any -- have you gotten any guidance or input in what their major focus is? You mentioned all the diﬀerent parties and their diﬀerent views, but have they given you any idea what of what they are focused on in terms of making their decision?","No. Yesterday I think the public hearing was well attended. All ﬁve of the members of the Pollution Control Board were in attendance. I think they were very attentive and I think they heard from folks that spoke, I would say on behalf of our petition, folks that are located in our service territories that would -- that spoke of the potential economic and personal impact of the variance. And of course there were citizens group there who spoke in opposition. So, what the pollution control board there to do again is to balance both environmental concerns with economic concerns. And they heard testimony on both sides. Ultimately, really the only parties to this proceeding are ourselves and the IEPA. As noted on our call, the IEPA has taken a neutral stance on this and sees our petition as being environmentally beneﬁcial. And that's our view as well. So we looked to the Pollution Control Board again to balance the economics with the environmental mandate.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS."
"All right. And then secondly on capacity portability, what could this eventually mean? Just trying to think about an ideal scenario. This is all of your capacity, partial, is this just about getting some transfer rights recognized? There are a number of diﬀerent iterations I could see coming out of this. I want to get your say.","I think that's probably true. There probably are a number of diﬀerent iterations that could come out of it. But certainly I think to the extent that we have capacity and we have got -- there's available transmission to get out of MISO and into PJM. We think we ought to be able to sell that capacity into PJM. Whether that's a percent of our ﬂeet ultimately would be available to do that. I don't know oﬀ hand. But I think it could be a number, as you said, a number of outcomes there.     Operator, this is Doug Fischer, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs."
"Marty, easy one here, can you just walk us through in the ﬁrst half of 2012, what are items that are still included in ongoing EPS, but may not actually happen next year? Meaning kind of like the FERC item, the $0.07 beneﬁt from the FERC item that's in ongoing EPS. I'm just trying to think about whether it's storm related or anything else, but is left for accounting reasons and ongoing EPS but may not actually be recurring 12 months from now.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Sure, Michael. I think that we've tried to list the major ones on slide 3. I guess those are mostly related to Q2 and maybe I'd focus you back on our Q1 slides as well. We had a similar slide for Q1. But you do see the FERC order there. We had the absence of the fact [ph] charge from last year. And the storm costs from last year. As I recall from the First Quarter, too though, we picked up I think a couple of cents of impact in Ameren Illinois because of contributions that we made at the start of the Illinois rate ﬁling. So, again I'd point you back to those First Quarter slides. I think we had a negative in the First Quarter that would not be repeating again next year. And then, I think as you look to next year, I think some of the things to think about are just the resolution of the Missouri rate case later this year. Next year we will have a Calloway outage where there was no Calloway outage this year. And those will be some of the drivers as well as what happens with 30 year treasuries. And it aﬀects Illinois. And our continuing due to deploy capital as we've laid out. Those are some of the impacts to be thinking about."
