Question,Answer
"Absolutely. Yes. So, I guess just on the Missouri rate case you did have some diﬀerences here rate base for staﬀ. But, Just wanted to get a sense of your overall appetite to settle this case if that's still a possibility just thinking back to how prior cases have gone. Thank you.","Yes Nichol. This is Marty Lyons. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Yes, look, as we go into each case we certainly are hopeful of being able to reach a constructive settlement and as we talked about many times, we have a good history of working with stakeholders in Missouri and reaching constructive settlements. We outlined where we are in the case today in our prepared materials you saw in the slide deck and we outlined some of the issues that. Divide us today. Mainly, and some of the traditional areas like ROE, but also on a couple of issues like High Prairie and Rush Island energy centers where there are some diﬀerences between us and the staﬀ in particular. Importantly, all of us will be updating our cases based on year end rate base as well as other true-up items that go through December 31. So you mentioned some of the diﬀerences in rate base, really those are just timing diﬀerences between the staﬀs rate base, which was as of June 30 in the company ﬁled position, which projected through December 31. But all of those things are going to be trued up here in the coming days up through December 31. So importantly some dates that we highlighted ﬁnal reconciliation of the parties positions will be due March 30 that comes after surrebuttal testimony, which is ﬁled March 13, and then evidentiary hearings if those are needed would start on April 3. So, traditionally the best time to be able to reach a constructive settlement given where this rate case is this rate review would be end of March or April in terms of when you might be able to really reach a constructive settlement with the parties."
"That's helpful. I appreciate that and then just on the equity ﬁnancing, recognizing that you did raise CapEx in this new ﬁve year plan, you do have some sizable needs here in the out years and I know you recently last quarter also said that you're increasing the ATM to $1 billion for 2024 and beyond. But can you just help us understand, with the equity in the plan. Just your preferred source of funding that or sourcing it rather..","Yes you bet Nick, good morning. This is Michael a couple of things I'll get speciﬁc question. I mean again, I think as we've talked over-time in. We do believe our balance sheet really provide us a position of strength here, we worked hard to continue to conservatively manage it. I think we like our ratings, where they are BAA1, BBB plus. We obviously have more margin S&P than we do and these we've talked about that from time-to-time. We continue to target this   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   capitalization ratio of close to 45%, which I think again it served us well in these various regulatory proceedings and making sure remain-- maintain these balance sheets appropriately the subsidiaries. In terms of what we need here, you're right, I mean, $2.4 billion of incremental capital I think what we continued message along the year, as we thought about any increases in capital associated with these opportunities around ORTP or the renewables that we should continue to think about our balance sheet in a similar fashion. I think that's what we're doing here, we're laying out this incremental really $800 million of equity. There's some obviously retained earnings and there as well, kind of get kind of get you back to that same sort of capitalization ratio. The ATM has served us well. Up to this point, I mean we're taking care of all of our needs for '23 net we're sold forward in '23, so we're really ﬁnished with that $300 million we started to sell forward into '24. You're right, we did increase beyond the capacity of the ATM, we'll have to continue to evaluate that over-time as we would run into any limits there, but again, it's a really eﬃcient way for us to issue capita. We think it's a manageable amount. If you look at it relative to our total market capitalization. So we feel comfortable with it and again I think that it provides us quite a bit of strength here as we just think about the overall funding that we need over the course of the next ﬁve years."
"Just wanted to start-oﬀ with I guess rate base CAGR as it is the 8% as you laid out there and the $2.5 billion ﬁgure. Just wondering what are the IRP assumptions, your CapEx plan update that underpin the $2.5 billion there in. What does this imply for company ownership of resources versus PPA and how do you think --how do you view the overall line of sight here and when do you expect to kind of get ﬁnal, the commission decisions on all resources.","Yes, good morning Jeremy, this is Marty. There is a few questions I think embedded in that question, so I'll I'll start and perhaps Michael would want to add-on. First of all the capital expenditures that we've put into the plan in Missouri for the IRP really tied to the plan that we laid out in the IRP. So if you go back and you look at that overall timeline. We plan to add 800   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   MW through 2025 and then another 2000 MW of renewables between 2026 and 2030 and if you just do some simple math there, it's about 400 MW Per year. So you end-up with about 1,600 MW overall over a ﬁve year period.  And again, we've put in about $2.5 billion as an estimate for that. So that's how it lines up. We were pleased to have the commission, Missouri Public Service Commission approved the Huxian project, which was a 200 MW solar project we proposed. They approved that one recently as CCN and of course we've got the Boomtown project, which was 150 MW solar project before them now and awaiting the decision and we continue to work with developers on additional renewable projects to really ﬁll out that plan that we have under the IRP, which we think is absolutely the most prudent way to move forward to provide our customers that reliable, aﬀordable and cleaner energy that they're seeking. Now back to the overall CapEx plan. What you'll notice is we've got a $19.7 billion overall capital expenditure plan for '23 to '27. That compares to the one we had previously, which was '22, '26, we had $17.3 billion, so we've added about $2.4 billion overall, as we move from our prior plan to this one.  In a Missouri in particular I'd point out that we previously had $8.9 billion of planned expenditures moving now to $10.4 billion, which is about a $1.5 billion overall addition. So, we've embedded the expectation of those renewable projects getting done in the overall $10.4 billion. But, I would say we've taken at a measured approach to opening our overall capital expenditure plan, which gives us great conﬁdence in our ability to achieve it. Again, we've already had one renewable project to prove. We've got a strong pipeline of capital expenditure opportunity over the next 10 years as we've talked about $48 billion. You have a lot of conﬁdence in our ability to execute not only the $10.4 billion plan for Missouri, but the overall $19.7 billion plan we've laid out today.     The only thing Jeremy I might add to that. Marty just gave a really comprehensive answer is, just speciﬁcally the pipeline to renewables itself and I love the team continues to do a lot of really hard work, there's some active RFPs, they continue to have open and continue to have a lot of conversations with developers about these projects. I think you had something embedded in there about how do we think about maybe PPAs versus ownership. Again, we believe that ownership is in the best interest of our customers for the long-term, and that's really where our focus has been it's certainly evidenced by what we did with wind projects certainly proposing with the two renewable solar projects that Marty spoke about.  So I'd say, an active pipeline and I think obviously the supply-chain issues, have been well- publicized. I think we continue to work through those and feel good about the projects we have out there and it's going to continue to be a lot of focus and eﬀort over the coming years."
"Got it, that's very helpful there. Thanks. And then moving I guess to MISO here, what are your current thoughts on potential MISO long-range transmission planning Tranche to spend given MISO seems to be modeling more aggressive assumptions in light of IRA. So, wondering your thoughts on the outlook there.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yes. I would say with respect to Tranche 2 were certainly actively engaged with other stakeholders with MISO and modeling out. The beneﬁts of potential projects that would come out of Tranche 2, our overall expectation as we sit here today, is that the overall portfolio of projects that MISO would approve as part of Tranche 2, will be larger than the overall size of the projects that were approved as part of Tranche1. But I think it'd be premature to comment on speciﬁcally which projects might land in our service territory or be assigned speciﬁcally to us. But rest assured, we'll be working with other stakeholders to model the the transmission projects that we think would be best for customers and the reliability of the system overall. And two obviously eﬀectuate the clean-energy transition, and we do expect that as we said in our prepared remarks, MISO to make some ﬁnal determination early next year."
"Got it. Very helpful. And then just kind of tying this together. You've raised CapEx you raised rate base growth a little bit here, I'm just wondering what you think this could mean for EPS, you don't have the 30year. I guess bringing ﬂuctuations in the way that it was in the past though as you kind of look at your EPS CAGR outlook, do you see any bias within the range towards higher parts given. This step-up in CapEx and rate base here, rate base growth.","Yes, Jeremy. I mean I think as you know. I mean our past practice, really has not been to sort of speculate where will be within that range. I think, I'll point to where we have achieved results. Obviously, historically we've been close to 7.5% CAGR since about 2013. So that sort of speak by itself, obviously, we did raise the rate base growth from 7% to 8%. I mean, and again, as you think about that range over time. It drives about a 45% range, that's 6% to 8% over that kind of ﬁve year period. And obviously there are some drivers as you pointed out in terms of just outcomes in the multi year rate plan earn versus allowed ROEs ﬁnancing assumptions, et-cetera. But again, what sort of a past speak for itself. at the moment. And Jeremy, I just I'd just reiterate what I said, we feel very conﬁdent in our ability to be able to execute that $19.7 billion CapEx plan, which gives us conﬁdence in our ability to execute that 8% rate base growth plan and that underscores our conﬁdence in the 6% to 8% EPS CAGR that we've outlined today."
"Got it that's helpful. I'll leave it there. And Andrew, really great to hear you on the call. Thanks.","Thanks, Jeremy. I appreciate, Glenn. Glad to hear you too.  Operator  (Operator Instruction). Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. I appreciate the comments as far, maybe to follow-up on next question earlier. Just with respect to Illinois and prospects for settling here and any further elaboration around the new contact there, just as you step into this. I just want to understand, does this need to be sort of fully litigated and fully ﬂeshed out to establish more of a record given the context of some shift in the compact here. And again, that's a question speciﬁcally directed at both the electric and the gas.","Yes, Julien, this is Marty. Hey, great to hear from you. Yes. I think your intuition is probably right there, especially as it relates to the multi year rate plan. No, I think it's hard to speculate if ever we have the opportunity to really enter into constructive settlement with stakeholders we're certainly going to be interested in having that dialog with stakeholders. I think it's just very early in this multi year rate plan ﬁling. Obviously, we haven't seen any staﬀ or intervener direct testimony, we won't see that till May and really premature to know whether it's something that could be constructively settled or not. I will note that in Illinois, there hasn't been that history of overall global settlements that we've had in Missouri. But we'll certainly be looking at after we get testimony to work with stakeholders to resolve diﬀerences narrowed the issues. And if we can constructively settled and that would hold true for the gas case as well."
"Well, hope through as and you probably want to worked through a fully litigated case here.","No. I guess what I was saying there is, we're always going to be wanting to work with stakeholders once we see the diﬀerences to narrow those diﬀerences certainly correct any errors and really narrowed the issues. And if we can reach a global settlement and put that before the commission will seek to do that. Yes, I was just saying with respect to the electric distribution part of the business given the newness of this framework. And in fact, we haven't seen any testimony really premature to say whether that's something that has a high degree of probability."
"Yes. All right, thank you for clarifying that. It actually as it pertains the QIP here, just new framework on the electric side and that's largely established at this point, pending implementation. But a QIP and its subsequent forms or iterations remains a little bit outstanding. Can you elaborate what your thoughts are and perhaps going back weather it legislatively or otherwise at this point to get something new. Again, I'll leave it open-ended on what that might look like, I know we've talked about this in the past at times, but is there a window today to revisit that conversation, perhaps in the slide form.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. Julien, this is Marty. Again, look we haven't given up on some sort of replacement for QIP and really because the QIP is in our (inaudible ) a really great rider for our customers really allowed us to make some investments to bolster the safety and reliability of the gas system and I would say our focus right now is really though on the gas case that you and I just discussed and really looking to get a constructive resolution of that case. As the overall gas regulatory environment, even without QIP is solid with forward test years revenue decoupling, bad debt riders et-cetera. So we believe that going forward without the QIP, we'd need to be thoughtful about the timing of rate reviews, but they do use forward test years, which I think is very important to think about and you would be thoughtful about the timing of capital expenditures to replace aging equipment, et-cetera.  So we do think the regulatory environment without QIP is something we can manage around, we can still invest, we can earn good returns, but we will look for windows of opportunity to look for something to replace the QIP, I'll leave the door open, like you did in terms of what form that may take. But right now our focus is on that gas case."
"Yes. Thanks. And then sorry, quick clariﬁcation from earlier Boomtown just is there any diﬀerent about this, let's say, relative (inaudible) or something like that might standout in terms of that approval process. Obviously the timing here being a little diﬀerent in terms of the duration to the CCF.","Yes. I think one of the diﬀerences, Julien is the Huxian project was proposed to be for compliance with the renewable energy standard that we have in Missouri. And it was approved as such the Boomtown project is really being proposed twofold one for customers, especially large industrial commercial customers that are looking for renewable energy as part of consumer program for them and as well as part of our transition under the IRP, but it's not being proposed for speciﬁc compliance with the renewable energy standard. And so that's a distinguishing fact between the two."
