Question,Answer
"Good morning. My ﬁrst question, as you mentioned with your year-end results you'll update your long term growth forecast as well. I just wanted to get some clarity. What's the base year you're going to use? And are you going to extend it to '23? How are you going to deal with the weather impact? Just curious how you're thinking about long term growth as you look to update that for us.","Good morning.     Sure. Again, good morning, Ali. Look, we're giving that consideration at this point in terms of what would be the best approach. As I mentioned last call, one logical approach would be to utilize the 2018 base. But as you noted we have to consider and be mindful of sort of the non- core item, the weather impacts, the timing of Callaway outages and the likes. So, in using that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   2018 as an alternative, but there are other alternatives as well that we'll be thinking through. To your point, with respect to CapEx and rate base, we certainly do expect to roll forward our outlook for CapEx and rate base out through 2023 and then we'll step back and think about what's the best approach in terms of providing the related earnings per share guidance."
"Okay. And second question, Marty, as you're thinking about incorporating that incremental CapEx from Missouri Senate Bill 564 and the wind into your planning, can you remind us how much capacity do you have right now in your mind to increase holding company debt beyond current levels? Or should we be thinking that any external funding at the parent likely will be coming from equity? Just to get some framework on how that funding plays out.","Sure, Ali. Yeah, as we think about, back to the earnings per share guidance that we gave long term obviously we've not only incorporated the additions associated with the capital expenditures for 564, wind related investments and other investments. And we'd certainly step back also and think about what's the right ﬁnancing plan for all of that. As I said before on prior calls and conversations, we will take into consideration a number of things as we think about how best to ﬁnance the plan. We're thinking about maintaining the strong balance sheet. That's sort of been hallmark of our operations over time. We're very happy with the credit ratings that we have today. We've worked hard over time to improve our business risks and achieve those credit ratings, so we'll be mindful also of the credit metrics that relate to those ratings.  We'll also be thinking of course about these investments and positioning these for success as we go through the regulatory processes. All of that with the backdrop of a certainly thinking about how to maximize shareholder value. So can't tell you exactly or give you a number in terms of exactly how much balance sheet capacity we think about in terms of additional holding company debt, but I think those other considerations that I laid out are the primary ones that we think about."
"Got it. Last question. Just as you think about this potential billion dollars of additional CapEx over ﬁve years in Missouri, can you remind us how much capacity do you have to potentially increase that, because I know there's a rate cap test, another test that come into play as well. But theoretically, how much more capacity would you have if you had opportunities to go above the billion dollars?","Yeah. In terms of the rate cap you're absolutely right. I mean what we have in Missouri is under the new 564 regime that we embarked upon on September 1st is that we need to stay under a 2.85% compound annual growth rate through 2023 with the beginning of that growth rate, reﬂecting the rate case outcome we had last spring. Of course as we relate to that base we get to take into account half of the savings from the federal tax beneﬁt.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   But look Ali, I think as we go ahead, as we've said, we expected that adoption of 564 will allow us to invest that incremental billion dollars. Going back a couple of years, we've laid out under over a 10-year period, the opportunity to invest an additional $4 billion of capital over a 10-year period. So clearly as we look out there are other investments that we think that we could make over time for the beneﬁt of our customers. And we'll be considering which of those investments we think are prudent to make over time, and at what time as we think about planning that, planning out our projects and executing them well.  So look, I think our goal over time is to deploy capital in a prudent way to improve service to our customers. As Warner said earlier, to beneﬁt our communities to add jobs and we'll be thinking about how best to do that and stay under the -- that cap. I will tell you as it relates to the cap, we've said this before, some of the things that we do see as opportunities to help us in terms of the areas of cost are not only are the savings from the federal taxes which we were able to utilize just here earlier this year to reduce customer rates 6%, but we also see continuing opportunities from reﬁnancings of higher cost debt.  We've got about $650 million of maturities between now and 2020 at higher rates than exist today. We see an opportunity to lower ﬁnancing costs for our customers. We also see the opportunity to realize beneﬁts from lower delivered fuel cost which we'll begin to see the savings from that this year and into next year. And over time also we'll look to keep tight controls on our O&M expenses and certainly as we roll out some of the grid modernization beneﬁts or grid modernization investments, certainly look for opportunities to utilize those also to keep tight control on our O&M.     Ali, this is Warner. I think that Marty did a great job summarizing it. I think to summarize it, we have a deep pipeline of investments that can bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts to our customers, not just in Missouri, but frankly across the Board. And secondly Marty outlined the host of cost opportunities for aﬀordability to keep our customers rates low, not just in Missouri, but across the Board. So, we look at the pipeline plus aﬀordability is going to continue to have a smooth forward [ph] with a strong sustainable growth plan."
"Excellent. So, perhaps just to clarify the last question a little bit further. Where do you sit with respect to your estimated [ph] debt targets with the agencies? And how much latitude do you have with that respect just to ask it in a slightly diﬀerent way.","Yeah, sure. Julien, this is Marty, again. In our credit rating, the issuer ratings, and we list these in the appendix to our slides, at S&P we've got a BBB+ with a positive outlook. The FFO-to-debt threshold, they set for us there is 13%. As it relates to Moody's, the parent issuer ratings, Baa1 and the threshold they set there for us on FFO-to-debt is 19%. So those are the benchmarks that we have today. That 19% also by the way is what they use. Moody's uses, both at Missouri and Illinois relative to their existing ratings. So those are the thresholds that we've set. We've not articulated, I'd say exactly where we are relative to those, but as you can tell us from the positive outlook at S&P and the fact that we've got a stable rating at Moody's should tell you something about where we sit relative to those metrics."
"Got it. Excellent. And then just understanding a little more about the capital opportunity plan here, perhaps leaving behind Missouri but focusing elsewhere, looks like transition spend in the end tap [ph] looks up in the draft. Also curious on any thought process of any potential legislation in Illinois next year. How are you thinking about the various pieces that may or may not already be reﬂected in your existing capital plan aside for the roughly $2 billion between wind and grid mod that you've already articulated here. Just want to make sure we're fully inclusive here of some of the other potential factors.","Yeah. Sure, Julien. This is Warner. Look, I would say this, obviously we have a very robust ﬁve- year plan and we've identiﬁed in that plan, the opportunity for an incremental $2 billion, one for grid mod and another for wind investment in Missouri. But, as I've said before, our plan isn't just a ﬁve-year plan. Our team is focused on creating an infrastructure pipeline to bring beneﬁts for our customers for years, six through 10 and then go out to 15.  And so as we look at in Illinois, we believe that the map program was certainly a 10-year program, but I know Richard and his team continue to believe that, that they have robust distribution projects to continue to enhance service for our customers, whether it's in sub- stations, whether it's continue to automate the grid. Obviously, what the smart meter has done, but we continue to see opportunities there. And then our gas business as well.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   We're investing more money in the gas business for that constructive framework. We believe there could be some new regulations coming down the pipe that will ultimately require additional investments there, but we will -- we believe too that there are opportunities. As you think about transmission, we obviously have outlined the investments that we're making there, both in multi-value and reliability projects. But you step back and you look at what's going on in MISO with all the renewable energy projects that are coming online and a lot of interconnection agreements are being put in there. There could be an opportunity down the road to have more robust transmission planning and investments.  I can't predict whether there'll be another round of multi-value projects, but when you look at the level of renewables coming into that space, now that's something to step back and think about beyond the ﬁve-year horizon. And so -- so, I would say that we feel very strong. We're not just focused on ﬁve-year, we're focused on year six through 15.  You made a passing comment about Illinois legislation. Look we're focused on executing the plan. This is not something that is at the top of our list of things to focus on in Illinois, but of course we're always engaged in the framework and the policy discussions in Illinois just like we are in Missouri and at the federal level. So hopefully that gives you a good insight in terms of how we think about the business."
"Good, good. Just maybe focusing on the '18 guidance raised this quarter. The $0.15 at the mid- point, I know a part of that was due to better-than-normal weather for the quarter, but are there -- what are -- what's making up some of the other items that contribute to that increase? And is that more timing related or something more sustainable that could help in 2019 and beyond?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah. Insoo, this is Marty. The timing item we noted is really intra-year I would say. So, it's important to understand that year-to-date we have had a $0.12 beneﬁt from the timing of income tax expense reductions versus income tax related revenue reductions associated with federal tax reform. So I think it's important to note that $0.12 beneﬁt will reverse in the fourth quarter. So I want to say that it will be earnings neutral for the year.  Back to your question though, at the mid-point of our guidance, our core guidance which is $3.40, if you back out, the beneﬁt we have of weather year-to-date which is $0.27, the net of that is about $3.13 again at mid-point on the weather-normalized basis, which does compare favorably to the mid-point of the guidance we gave out at the beginning of the year at $3.05, about $0.08.  And I think where you really see that is when you look at our slides and you look at the beneﬁt that we've had year-to-date of sales on the nine months to date basis versus the impact of weather which you ﬁnd there is an incremental beneﬁt from sales of about $0.05. So I talked about some of the positive sales trends on our call and in our prepared remarks, but those positive sales trends are helping this year. And I'd say, that's the bulk of the driver of the guidance range when you back out weather."
"Got it. And do you, what is your -- do you provide a longer term, low growth excluding EE type of growth rate?","What we typically talk about is, including EE, I mean we're seeing today what we gave out similar growth we're seeing year-to-date. Again, in Illinois where we're seeing some growth which is positive and we're decoupled there. So I'd focus on the Missouri growth. There, we're seeing residential and commercial growth, excluding energy eﬃciency, a little over 1% and industrial growth too of a little over 1%. So, those are positive trends. And as I remarked on our last call, I mean that's underpinned by some strong, I think economic data.  We're seeing job growth. We're seeing unemployment down in Missouri at about 3.7%, so below the national average. And importantly, we're seeing residential and commercial customer counts increasing in each of those more than 0.5% in terms of incremental customer count. So I think those are some positive trends. Longer term we're still thinking that inclusive of the impacts of energy eﬃciency, we're going to expect to see about ﬂattish growth.  And as we move through time and we assess the results giving thought to the positive economic signs we're seeing in weather, there should be any change in our guidance longer term. But like I said, for now, we're thinking that inclusive of the energy eﬃciency which is both the energy eﬃciency that we promote but also sort of just natural energy eﬃciency that's coming through national standards, again, we're expecting about ﬂattish over time."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Understood. And then, maybe just one more question. On the dividend, I know the payout of 55% to 70% target, you guys are currently at the lower end of that, given the potential upside to capital and rate base growth that you could see in the various jurisdictions with the assumption be that, the payout will remain sort of in the lower half of that range for the foreseeable future?","Yeah. Insoo, this is Warner. Look, I think big picture we targeted between 55% and 70%, and so we're not saying whether going to -- where we're going to be in that picture, but as I said earlier, look I'm pleased that the Board raised the dividend for the ﬁfth consecutive year, and I think it clearly reﬂects their conﬁdence in terms of -- with our long term growth plan. And so yeah, we continue to be very comfortable with expressing our dividend in terms of the payout range. And then that coupled with a very strong rate base growth plan we think is delivering very strong total shareholder returns."
"Pretty thorough Q&A already, so just some quick cleanup on page 8 of the handout. The potential wind generation investment in Missouri, the $1 billion, I think you lay out on another slide that those would be built on transfer projects, is that correct, is that deductible?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. They're both transfer agreements. Greg, I'm sorry, this is Warner. That's correct. The two --"
"They would impact earnings when acquired. There would be no build up of AFEDC [ph] or capitalized interest, et cetera, because you would simply transact upon close. So, A, is that correct? And B, what's your best guesstimate as to when, I know there's probably a range of outcomes as to when they're delivered, but one would be a good placeholder for our modeling assumptions.","Sure. Greg, this is Marty. Yes, ﬁrst you're correct, in terms of your assumption around AFEDC ﬁnancing. I mean the characteristic of the build, the transfer agreement is that the developers will ﬁnance during construction and we'll take ownership when the projects are complete. And it's at that point that we would have ﬁnancing cost and revenues associated with those projects. So, you're absolutely right in your thinking of those. In terms of progress on the projects, I mean we were pleased to, for example on the Terra-Gen project, the ﬁrst 400 megawatts to be able to get a settlement with parties to that case and just recently here get a Certiﬁcate of Convenience and need from the commission in a ﬁve month time frame.  So I think that's a good step forward and bodes well, we believe for approvals in future projects. That said another hurdle we have to get through is to get through the MISO interconnection process and get those approvals and certiﬁcates to move forward. So ultimately we believe that these projects will go into service in 2020. That is our goal, because that's when the PTC maximum value is realized. And then, when in 2020? It's hard to say, Greg. It will really depend on how we get through some of these MISO interconnection process, how construction goes, but ultimately the goal is to get these in service by the end of 2020."
"Okay. So they may have a material impact on 2020 earnings, but they'll deﬁnitely be fully loaded so to speak in 2021?","Yeah, I think that's the right way to think about it Greg."
"Perfect. One follow-up on the grid mod investments through 2023, the $1 billion, when would they -- is that going to be sort of a ratable spend over a period of years? Do you expect that to be back-end loaded? How should we think about that feathering in to the plans?","Greg, it's Michael Moehn. I think previously we said that it's going to fairly ratable at this point. So, and that going to get by the work right way to look at it, beginning in '19.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Beginning in '19. Great, great. Okay. Thank you, guys very much. Have a great day.","Thank you, Greg.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning."
"So, I just wanted to talk about the wind program that you have, the 700 megawatts or the up to 700 megawatts. If you did ﬁnd that there were more opportunities that were beneﬁcial to customers, because when the economics continue to get better, could you remind us of just the regulatory process you would go through if you wanted to go back and suggest that, hey, we should actually up-size this to above 700 megawatts, how would that sort of work out in the regulatory arena?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","So, Stephen I'll kick it oﬀ and then I'll turn it over to Mike. I want to make sure, we have the regulatory process nailed down. But look, the bottom line, if we see opportunities in renewable generation, and here we're talking about when that are beneﬁcial for customers, we will lean forward and move forward with those projects. Even when we announced this with the Integrated Resource Plan at some time, gosh, I guess it was last year. We said that they're not only just to meet the renewable energy standard opportunities, but also opportunities to invest more in wind or solar, should the economics continue to come down. So we will look at that. And so Michael, why don't you talk about the speciﬁc process, should we choose to do that in the future what that would look like.     Yeah. I mean, again the 700 megawatts is obviously to comply with the renewable standard within the state. I mean it would really take a very similar process. Honestly if we identify other projects, that -- for the beneﬁt of our customers, going through and applying for that CCN and going through that stakeholder process and going through in getting those interconnection agreements done. All of these things that we're doing is part of the 700 megawatts today."
"Understood. Okay. So, very much similar to how you had approached it so far. And then, just I wanted to make sure I was thinking about the cap on customer bills, the 2.85% compound impact. Given the beneﬁts that you've had from tax reform and other dynamics, but also factoring in the spending plans you have, how much additional headroom do you have over and above factoring in everything that you sort of announced today in terms of additional headroom over the period?","Yeah. Stephen, this is Marty. In terms of that, I'd say we wouldn't -- haven't really talked about a headroom if you will. I mean, what we've said is that we do feel very comfortable that the $2 billion of additional spending that we've been talking about which we've said numerous times, we think it would be largely additive to our capital expenditure plan that we can fully achieve that and stay under that cap with some margin. I haven't speciﬁed what that margin is, but have talked a lot about in detail earlier on this call, the various beneﬁts that we see in terms of helping to keep rate growth low, part of it is the federal taxes. Part of it's, the delivered fuel that we talked about, part of it is the reﬁnancings and part of it is the continued discipline around O&M including beneﬁts that we expect will come with some of the grid modernization investments we're making."
"All right. So, just, I know you guys don't want to predict the ISO New England impact on the MISO complaint case. However, I'm sure you guys have been doing some number crunching on what you guys sort of might, what -- if the proposed methodology that FERC is employing there or to be employed in MISO's case, could you give us a little bit of a sense as to what you think it would come up within in the base ROE complaint case?","Yeah, Paul, your instincts were correct. I think we're -- look we think it's premature really to estimate the impact, our potential impact on the MISO complaints. Look, I'll say this. We do think it's positive that the FERC is taking steps to address the ROE uncertainty. We think that's positive. We also think that, the proposal what they have made is a step in the right direction. But, we said it's premature, because as you well know, it's really a proposal of requesting comments if you will, briefs from parties in the New England case. And things could change over time.  So we think it's a positive step, but there is still ways to go, of course as you know, the FERC is really under no timeline to rule here. They've got briefs that are due in mid-January. So we do think -- we do think that FERC will take action in 2019 and we'll stay closely posted. And over time, I think as they work through the methodology, we will have to take a look at our cases. Each case as you know it has somewhat diﬀerent facts and data things are subject to interpretation. So, we'll be assessing all of that, but we think as we sit here today it's really premature to comment on your speciﬁc question."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay, fair enough. Then on the -- can you just remind, in terms of the current growth rate that you guys have, what the forecast for the 30-year treasury is in terms of that?","Yeah. In terms of the guidance we've given today, and I think what you're talking about is our current guidance of 5% to 7%, compound EPS growth out through 2022 and really that accommodates a range of interest rates and ROEs as well as other things like capital spending levels, rate case outcomes, economic conditions. But speciﬁcally on your question, we've said over time it really accommodates a range of treasury rates and ROE levels. There's not a speciﬁc --"
You're not using that blue chip thing as you guys were using before?,"No. You have a good long memory though going back probably, ﬁve years ago or so we did use that as a -- an anchor on our guidance, but now we've gotten away from that over time."
"Okay. And then just ﬁnally on the one time impact that $0.05, what caused the tax valuation to happen this quarter I guess? Do you follow what I'm saying regarding the TCGA?","Yeah, I do Paul. When they put out their rules last year, they -- everybody made their best assessment with respect to certain transition provisions that we all had to make a good faith estimate, but understanding that as rules and regulations were clariﬁed that there would be some updates. In this particular case, the primary driver was that, we got some guidance from IRS with respect to how to provide or how to deal with the transition of bonus depreciation as it related to 2017. So, we received that guidance, and as we ﬁled our tax return here in the third quarter for 2017 that caused us, then to go ahead and true-up the revaluation that we did at the end of last year. So that's in a nutshell what happened."
"Good morning. I think, I'm maybe just beating a dead horse here. I just wanted to go through a quick housekeeping. The end of the second quarter guidance was $3.15 to $3.35. You've raised the mid-point now, I believe $0.15, but whether you are saying $0.06, is the remainder $0.09, the timing of the tax item?","No, it's not. No, the tax item is really excluded. So, if you look at -- in particular if you look at slide 12 that we gave out, we talked about what the GAAP EPS raise was and then the core EPS. So when you look at the core EPS range of $3.35 to $3.45 that excludes the impact of that $0.05. So the mid-point there of the $3.35 to $3.45 is of course $3.40. If you compare that back to the beginning of year mid-point, the beginning of the year mid-point was $3.05. So you can see the delta then.  Of that $0.27 is weather, okay. So if you back out weather from the $3.40 you get to $3.13, and that is indeed about $0.08 higher than the mid-point of our beginning of your guidance. And so the big driver of that when you look through the slides, and you look -- have a chance through the detail, is that we have seen sales growth that is contributing more than the $0.27 of weather. And in fact if you do the math, that sales growth is about $0.05. So, when you think about why is the guidance going up? Part of it is weather, a large part of it is weather. There's also about $0.08 of other stuﬀ and the primary driver of that is incremental sales not associated with weather which is we estimate to be about $0.05."
"So, I follow that, but I can't do the same for what happened after the second quarter to the fourth quarter, just going by the -- because you seem to keep ﬂoating back to the original core EPS. Can I do the same with what you updated at the second quarter to now?","Yes you can. Yes you can. And the answer will be the same, that it's really sales growth over the course of the year that's allowing us to amongst other things to raise the guidance, but you can absolutely do the same thing rolling forward from the guidance we had last quarter."
Great. Thanks for taking my question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),You're absolutely welcome.  Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed with your question.
"Just going on the 2019 consideration slide, this year, you were banking up O&M to be higher, if I memory is correct by about $0.14, can we assume that the decrement could be of a similar amount next year or could you provide a little bit, kind of a little bit, with same, less or more or I'm just trying to get a better sense to gauge that factor as we look into next year.","Yeah, no, Ashar, you're absolutely right. The -- we had suggest at the beginning of the year that the O&M would be up about $0.14 year-over-year excluding Callaway. And if you look through the year-to-date considerations and you look at our guidance for the balance of the year, I think what you'd ﬁnd is, it will be about $0.16 up year-over-year. But we do not expect that all of that would be raised next year. We do as we suggest on the slide, the slide you point to, slide 16, we do expect O&M, non-Callaway related O&M in Missouri to be down next year, but not that entire $0.16. So, expect it to be down to some extent, but not the full amount."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Okay. Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.
