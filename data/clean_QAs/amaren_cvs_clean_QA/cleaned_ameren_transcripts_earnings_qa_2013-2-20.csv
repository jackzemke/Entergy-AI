Question,Answer
"I wanted to just touch on the disclosure and thank you for the additional disclosure on the merchant business as well as the increased spending on -- at the utility. Regarding the merchant business, can you just discuss a little bit further whether you're taking action to actively evaluate strategic alternatives for the business or are you still more in the assessment phase? Is this something that is taking time of management? Is this something that you're actively pursuing at this time?","Sure, Stephen. I'll see if I can expand a little bit. Obviously, we put out the 8-K, suggesting that we expected to exit from the business. I think one of the things we tried today was to provide clarity that, that exit could take the form of either sale or restructuring. As you would expect, management is spending time and attention with respect to those exit strategies and exit possibilities.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay, understood. Just as a follow-up, you laid out shared services which was helpful. Presuming that you did have a complete exit for merchant generation, should we assume that, that $30 million would not eﬀectively be transferred back to the parent, but would eﬀectively no longer be an expense for the parent because those services are truly allocated and dedicated to the merchant business?","Yes, Stephen. We would expect that in the event of a merchant exit that, that cost, that $30 million could be substantially eliminated."
"Okay, substantially eliminated, so does that mean when you look at that $30 million, that it is, that truly is allocated and you wouldn't see a substantial portion coming back to the parent?","Yes, what I'm saying is a large part of that is dedicated speciﬁcally to support of the merchant business and so in the event of the exit, much of that cost could be eliminated. So yes, that is what I'm saying is that we would work to eliminate, reduce and eliminate those costs.  Operator  Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates."
"Good morning. Listen, on the guarantees and credit support for the coal contracts and for the Ameren Energy Marketing energy contracts, you mentioned that there's going to be some disclosure in the 10-K. Could you give us a general sense as to what the level of those obligations might be?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes, sure, Paul. I think that and we did list it in the script the way you said it, but I would say that these guarantees are actually primarily on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing. The extent of those right now, I'd say, is about $200 million of guarantees and like I said, it's primarily for power transactions. The actual mark-to-market exposure under those is only about $25 million, but that's the -- I think that gives you a general sense of the scope and again, there will be more details in the 10-K."
"Okay, and then with respect to the CapEx numbers that you're mentioning at the utility and the fact that you're negative free cash ﬂow there, how should we think about the ﬁnancing going forward? Because it looks like you guys have a lot of CapEx forecasted if you're having your rate base slow that much. How should we think about the ﬁnancing and speciﬁcally, the potential for equity or equity-like ﬁnancing in the next couple of years?","Sure. Well when you look at that ﬁnancing, a couple of things. One of the things we've talked about over time is looking to keep the cap structures of our regulated entities in that range of, say, 50% to 53% equity, which is something that we would work to do over time. As you look at this next year and the negative $435 million, a couple things to look at. One, we did ﬁnish the year with no borrowings under our credit facilities, $200 million of cash on hand as we go into next year. We would also look over time, as we have in the past, we have the earnings in the regulated businesses that produced retained earnings which are in excess of the dividends that we pay out. So there's those retained earnings are there to, again, build equity in the regulated businesses such that then we can also do some debt ﬁnancing to cover this, some of this cash ﬂow shortfall. That said, as we move through time, like I said, we will look to keep those cap structures in the 50% to 53% range in terms of equity. Right now, we're not issuing shares under the DRiP or 401k, as we mentioned on the call. We don't anticipate doing that in 2013 but as we move into 2014 and beyond, it certainly is a possibility that we would begin again issuing stock associated with those DRiP and 401k programs in order to keep the equity content within the regulated entities in that 50% to 53% range."
"First of all, I just want to congratulate the senior management and Tom. I've known the Company for quite a long period of time. Ameren used to be premium-regulated utility and was one of the highest P/E multiple in the sector 20 years back. I really appreciate you going through the strategy and returning it to its roots. I would just hope the process is quick and fast because you deserve to be back to a premium-regulated utility, and I just wanted to thank you.",Thank you. Thanks for your comments.  Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
"Excellent. First, following up on some of the Genco discussion here, given the potential to sell the assets here, how do you think about some of the eventual tax beneﬁts akin to some of your other neighboring peers they've discussed? Is there some NOL beneﬁt here we could be looking at?","Well Julien, I can't comment on akin to our neighbors, but I think that there has been some written about it. I think some have tried to take a look at, say, the deferred taxes overall at Ameren and then subtract out the regulated utility balances. I would just caution that I think when you do that, you end up with, I'd say, too large of a number. There are certain deferred tax balances up at the Ameren Corp. level related to Ameren-speciﬁc things like employee beneﬁt plans, whether they be deferred comp or share plans as well as deferred taxes on NOLs and tax credit carry-forwards and things like that. There are also, in terms of if you start thinking about an exit of the business, there are also certain deferred intercompany gains that would be triggered as a result of the historical transfer of these assets out of the utilities. So there are a number of things that I would say make it diﬃcult to get one's arms around what a potential tax   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   loss would be associated with an exit of the business. The other thing, Julien, is, I think the -- as you go through time, the tax basis and the assets change. So depending upon the timing of the exit, the form of an exit, whether it be sale of the assets, sale of the equity or restructuring, all of those things could result in diﬀerent tax answers in terms of the potential tax law. So we're certainly hesitant to try to put a precise value on that."
"Great. Another quick Genco follow-up here. Noticed recently PJM's website seems to suggest that you've been successful in transacting on power and capacity. I'd be curious just to get a holistic sense, how much are you able to transact into PJM oﬀ of your portfolio?","Yes, so Julien. With respect to the merchant segment, they have about 117 megawatts of approved transmission from MISO into PJM for the planning years, 2012, 2013, and beyond. They've also been able to get an additional 530 megawatts of approved transmission for MISO into PJM starting in 2015. So that's been approved and there are also some other requests in the queue, but that's what's been approved at this point."
"So when we're thinking about modeling Genco, for the 2015, '16 auction year, we should expect you to be able to clear at least in some of these incrementals; is that the way to think about it?","Yes, that would be to think about it, although you used the term, Genco. I don't have the breakdown but I think this -- I'm pretty sure that this transmission is unit speciﬁc and so some of it relates to AERG, and some of it relates to Genco."
"Great. Fantastic. Just quick, quick follow-up on the put option. Under what scenarios, if you can refresh our memories, when would you execute it, how do you think about executing it, just given the developments?","So the execution of -- or the put option is really a Genco decision, a Genco Board/management decision. The put option expires March 31, 2014. As we said on the call, we do not expect that Ameren and AERG would extend that put option beyond its current date but it does go through the end of March of 2014.  Operator  Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Just wanted to ask on the regulated side of the house. Just can you talk a little bit about the transmission investment both at Ameren Illinois and at ATXI, just in terms of which one might be more front-end loaded, which one might be more back-end loaded? If I look just at slide 20, your transmission CapEx, roughly, I think it's $340 million for 2013. It almost implies that both are pretty back-end loaded but would love your comments.","No, Michael, I appreciate the question, on slide 20 though and then as you look to slide 21 in terms of the rate-based growth. I think overall, the CapEx investment at the Ameren Illinois utilities, I wouldn't say is really front-end loaded, but as we've talked before, is more ratable over that ﬁve-year period. Whereas the ATXI Transmission investment does become more back- end loaded, so starts a little bit slower, particularly in 2013, but by the time you get to 2014, 2015, it starts to ramp up. But it gets to more peak levels out in the 2016, 2017 time frame, but again, the Ameren Illinois Transmission spending is expected to be more ratable over that period of time."
"Got it. On Ameren Illinois, the distribution side, I want to make sure I understand, in your guidance, are you assuming you earn on a year-end rate base and not the weighted average rate base? I know that's been a little bit of a disputed point between companies there and the Commission and legislature, just trying to make sure I understand what's in guidance versus what you think the regulation and the legislation supposes currently?","Michael, it's a good observation. You're right. We have baked in the year-end rate base. So we are operating with the expectation that the legislation as we understand it, it should work, will work that way in 2013. So we have reﬂected in there the year-end rate base."
Got it. Last item on the non-regulated side. I noticed you didn't provide hedging details.,"I didn't provide hedging details, given our intent to exit that business. I thought that providing those disclosures with long -- basically get to longer term earnings and cash ﬂow drivers were less relevant and wanted to full focus more on the exit. That said, Michael, all of the data that traditionally we've provided in those slides will be provided in the 10-K, so you'll certainly have access to that information.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Scott Senchak with Decade Capital."
"Just a couple questions. Do you expect the level of the parent long-term debt to grow over the next couple years? In other words, will you be issuing any parent long-term debt?","We would expect, Scott, that over if you look at where our investments are being made over time, really being made at the regulated utilities and therefore, would expect consistent with past practice that those investments would be ﬁnanced at those regulated utility subsidiaries."
"Okay, thanks, and the parent currently does have some debt, I think. In your '13 guidance, where is that interest expense allocated?","In the 2013 guidance, consistent with past practice, the interest expense is allocated to the merchant and other."
"Okay, got you, and then is there an overall equity ratio that we should think about going forward to keep the overall business at? I noticed you mentioned the utilities are going to be 50% to 53%, but just wondering, as we model this to plan out, what should we do for the overall Company?","Overall as well, we've talked about over time at about that 50/50 level. I think as you probably saw in the stats that were attached to the press release, I think after the impairment charge, we stand right around 49% and we would expect to be right around that 50/50 over time.  Operator  Joe DeSapri with Morningstar."
"Can you talk a little bit about the thought process or considerations around pursuing the Illinois variance at Genco and then soon thereafter, deciding that the business still isn't economic, despite receiving a desired variance outcome? What changed there?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, I'm not sure that anything really changed there. When you look back at the reason for pursuing the variance, certainly the power prices are very low, the ﬁnancial situation and condition, with respect to Genco and the merchant business, suggested that variance was really needed, that ﬁnancially we're just really unable to put money forward to complete the scrubber in the near term. Of course we provided, I think, a proposal that was, overall, environmentally beneﬁcial in putting that forward. I think what's transpired is, or what's happened is that it's simply a continuation of the same situation that ﬁnancial -- excuse me, power markets continue to be very diﬃcult. We saw over the course of 2012 not only decline in near term power prices, but also a ﬂattening of the forward curve and which made the outlook for the business even more challenging. So I wouldn't really say any diﬀerence. I would say it's just both a reﬂection of the same diﬃcult conditions."
"Okay, thanks and a follow-up. Will those, will that beneﬁt of that variance allowance, could that potentially transfer to new potential owner if the assets were sold?","Yes, that's a variance that is a variance was granted to Ameren Energy Resources.  Operator  Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board."
"First of all, I was wondering if you could give a little more clarity regarding 2013 debt ﬁnancing plans? You mentioned you don't expect any equity issuance and that you're going to have negative free cash ﬂow, so if you could just give us a sense of the size of the debt issuance? I know you have $350 million that matures late in the year but just overall.","Sure, Dan. I think, yes, you're on the right track there, obviously. The -- we have a $200 million maturity in Missouri in July and $150 million maturity in Illinois later in the year in December. As we think about it, so I think those would be likely potential candidates for reﬁnancing. As I mentioned earlier on the call, at year-end, we also, Ameren-wide, had about $200 million of cash on hand and no credit facility borrowings. As we go into next year, we do expect that we are going to have these negative free cash ﬂows at the utility businesses, so we'll be thinking about, Dan, the $200 million maturity in July at Missouri. But we'll be taking a look at what cash they have on hand as well as what happens between now and July in terms of capital expenditures and free cash ﬂows. And then making the determination about the timing and the size of a debt oﬀering with respect to Missouri, and similar in Illinois. We are investing in Illinois both in the distribution business as well as the transmission infrastructure, expecting to have negative free cash ﬂows there. Again, we'll be taking a look at that as well as in conjunction with that $150 million maturity, and assessing, again, the timing and size of a debt oﬀering there. But you're on the right track in thinking about those maturities coupled with the negative free cash ﬂows associated with those businesses.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Operator, this is Doug Fischer. I think we have time for two more questions.  Operator  Certainly. Terran Miller with Cantor Fitzgerald."
"Just in terms of the generation business, I know you said that the timing was uncertain but would you be disappointed if we got to year-end 2013 and this had not been resolved?","Terran, this is Marty. No, I wouldn't say disappointed if we got to the end of 2013 and it wasn't resolved. I think, as I said before, we're going to do what we believe is in the greatest overall beneﬁt for Ameren. We're certainly looking to approach this exit in whatever form it takes in an orderly fashion."
"Okay, and just to follow-up on the variance question. The variance was granted to, I believe, Ameren Energy Resources. If that portfolio is split, what happens to the beneﬁts and the variances? i.e., if Gen ﬁles or is -- if it has to go to one buyer and the other assets go to another?","Yes, Terran, I -- it's a legal question that I'm not really prepared to speak to at the moment. I'm not sure whether each entity would individually need to comply with the emissions limitations of the variance or whether there would be a requirement to go back to the Pollution Control Board. So I wouldn't want to speculate at this point on how that might have to be handled.  Operator  Andy Levi with Avon Capital."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. Just a quick one going back to the Innerconnect question with regard to PJM and MISO. I know that there is some going back and forthright now between the two MISOs. I was wondering, do you have any comments in terms of how you expect that to work out? Obviously with, I believe it's Elgin [ph] is the only plant that's got any capacity payments that it's receiving now through PJM and you mentioned that it was going up to, like, 500 megawatts or whatever in 2015. Are the other gas plants that are currently in the area going to receive any of that as potential capacity payments?","Yes, let me see if I can expand a little bit. First of all, Elgin is actually in PJM, and so it is receiving capacity payments. But that would be in addition to what I noted earlier on the call, the $117 million of approved transmission from MISO into PJM for 2012, 2013 is incremental to Elgin, as is the $530 million of approved transmission starting in 2015. Again, I believe that transmission that's been approved from MISO into PJM is a power plant unit-speciﬁc. I don't recall whether the other gas-ﬁred units actually would beneﬁt from that transmission, those transmission paths. The megawatts I just talked about in terms of approved transmission is really obtained through normal processes of working with PJM to get that transmission into from MISO into PJM, so it's part of the normal processes that we've been working through. In terms of the broader discussions between PJM and MISO, we're certainly hopeful that we can get to a point where we have more complete capacity portability between MISO and PJM. But when and how those discussions may come to that end is diﬃcult to predict. We're certainly hopeful that the conversations will be fruitful and substantial progress can be made in 2013."
"Okay, obviously, what PJM came back with last was not constructive but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Finally, you mentioned that moving forward with the unregulated business spin-oﬀ or restructuring or whatever happens would be done within the context of your legal responsibilities. What are you referring to with regard to your legal responsibilities?","Certainly, as we think about the exit for the merchant business, we're certainly mindful of not only ﬁduciary duties to the Ameren shareholders, but also obligations that we have to the noteholders at Genco, and that's what we meant by that."
