Question,Answer
"The $0.5 billion to $1 billion of CapEx investment upside, when might we get an update on that and are there drivers or regulatory hurdles that you have to navigate through in order to feel comfortable increasing the existing CapEx budget?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think, really, it's going to be a matter of – we've talked before about our annual planning cycles and certainly wanted to provide greater clarity on some of the growth pipeline that we've been communicating about in the past. But we'll be evaluating that potential CapEx over the remainder of the year taking into consideration multiple factors which is really about customer needs, balancing that with rate impacts, coordinating these projects and the timing of these projects with other projects that we've got ongoing over the next ﬁve years, making sure we've got the labor, vendor support, et cetera, available to complete all those projects. So there are a number of things that go into the assessment, but we would expect to complete that over the remainder of this year and certainly have concluded on the exact amount by the time we give guidance next February."
"Okay. Great. And I would imagine that would be upside to the 6% rate base CAGR. And correct me if I'm wrong, but probably put you at the higher end of your EPS CAGR.","Well, we're certainly, as we've discussed on the call, not updating our EPS CAGR. This added CapEx would certainly be incremental to the rate base growth that we've provided in the slide that we have. And, as we mentioned on the call, certainly, this added CapEx bolsters our conﬁdence in our ability to achieve the earnings growth within the previously communicated expectations."
"Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you will not be paying cash taxes through 2016. Is that accurate?","Yes, through 2016. So, as it stands right now, we'd be again paying taxes again sometime in 2017."
"Okay. Great. And then, forgive me that I haven't read through the gas stipulation yet. But what drove the higher ROE in this case versus your previously allowed ROE?","I can't really recollect, going back to the last case, the factors that got to that. But certainly here, we were successfully able to reach a compromise and accord with the other parties in the case. And the 9.6% is the outcome of those conversations, and will be the ROE pending ﬁnal decision by the ICC later this year.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Just remind me, the previous gas rate case outcome, was that a stipulation or did that go to hearing?","No, it wasn't. It went to hearings and so that 9.08% from the ﬁnal – for the previous case was the result of an ICC decision."
"Just for clariﬁcation. Your statement that there will be no equity needs, does that include DRP type programs?","Yes. Glen, thanks. Yes. If we weren't clear, that is correct. As we talked about on the call, we're able to reach a settlement of our 2013 tax return with the IRS, which not only gave us the ability to book the gain we booked in discontinued operations, but also, it took away uncertainty relative to the overall tax beneﬁts that we have at Ameren Corp., which we reiterated on the call today was about $454 million of accumulated tax beneﬁt at Ameren Corp. So, with that added certainty, as we look at the CapEx investment plans that we've got, as we look at our overall ﬁnancial plans looking out over the next ﬁve years, we really don't see the need for any equity, including from the DRP and 401(k).   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Just on the incremental investment opportunities, could you just roughly breakdown, at least like you see it today, how much of that would go toward FERC-regulated transmission?","Yeah. Sure. David, this is Marty again. That $500 million to $1 billion really breaks down about a third, a third, a third between Illinois electric distribution, Illinois gas distribution, and FERC- regulated transmission."
"Okay. Great. And second question. In your 7% to 10% EPS target for outlook, are you still assuming rising ROEs in Missouri and Illinois?","Yeah, David, sure. Just going back to the guidance we've given there, that growth has always been driven by the transparent rate base growth plans that we've got, the reduction of parent   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   and other costs, monetization and reinvestment of the tax assets, and certainly the expectation of rising interest rates and ROEs over time."
Okay. How about the assumed sales growth in that outlook?,"The assumed sales growth in that outlook, David, has been about ﬂattish, is what our projection is, really, out through time. That's about what we've been seeing this year, frankly. In terms of the overall sales growth, when you take into consideration the energy eﬃciency programs that we've got, it's about ﬂat year-to-date. And we expect residential and commercial sales this year, again, excluding the impacts of our energy eﬃciency programs in Missouri, to be about ﬂat. So that's the expectation embedded in those longer term plans."
"Okay. Great. Because I had built in a little bit. Okay. Otherwise, I think, everything else was pretty clear. When do you typically update your CapEx forecast? And with the $500 million to $1 billion or whatever else you may come up with, when could we possibly – will that be at EEI or will that be next year?","Andy, as I said in a response to a question a little while ago, we'll continue to evaluate that over the remainder of this year. Most likely, I'd say, we'd give an update in February. If we have greater clarity to provide before that, we would do so. But as we go through our annual planning process, it generally lines up that we'd be able to give a comprehensive update on CapEx and rate case growth plans in February."
Okay. And I thought you and Warner gave a really good rundown today. So good job.,"Thanks, Andy.     Thank you, Andy.  Operator  Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management (46:09). Please go ahead with your questions.  Hi. I'm sorry if you already walked through this and I missed it. But, on the incremental $500 million to $1 billion of CapEx, I thought you said it was like a third each among the diﬀerent   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   buckets you highlighted. Can you walk through the thresholds of what you need to do to get approval to do that? Is it purely formula rate, so you won't need to get approval from the ICC or the FERC or will they have to sign oﬀ on the spending?     No real sign oﬀ on the spending. I mean, if you go back after the call and read through the transcript, I think, we gave some pretty good description of the types of projects that we're looking at, which, in a lot of cases, is replacement of aging infrastructure, putting new servicing where needed based on certain changes in growth in customer usage, as well as certain expenditures that we believe we're going to need to make to meet the safety code requirement and otherwise improve the safety and reliability of our system. So, all of these expenditures look like they are needed for customer service and don't look to require any speciﬁc regulatory approvals."
"So just to clarify there. Eﬀectively, as long as you guys, you being Ameren, deem that they are required and needed that it's basically ﬁle and implement? I just wanted to get a sense.","Yeah, absolutely. And, as I said earlier in response to a question, obviously, we have to weigh all this with the timing of other projects we've got in our pipeline, make sure that we can execute this well for the beneﬁt of our customers and certainly need to weigh these customer needs and these projects again with other projects in our system and with the rate impacts."
