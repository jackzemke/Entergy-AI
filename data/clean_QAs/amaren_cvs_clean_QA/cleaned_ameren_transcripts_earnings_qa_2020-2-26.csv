Question,Answer
"Absolutely, well so perhaps just to kick it oﬀ your ﬁrst, I want to turn it back to Illinois and some of the legislative eﬀorts you described here. Can you perhaps please begin to allude to what the opportunity would be under the Downstate element here, speciﬁcally, I think you highlighted in the transcript Solar EV and further distribution investments, but I just want to try to put of at least an initial number around what that totality could be and I presume that's largely not reﬂected in your outlook as you just updated and I got a follow-up as well.","Yeah. So, thanks to a, you know, look, a couple of things. Number one, we're excited about this legislation, we think it really has some really important elements in terms of trying to move Illinois to the Clean Energy Future that they've been talking about, but also doing the things that we have been doing for the past 8 years and that's modernizing the grid.  So number one, one of the things in terms of trying to put some perspective on it. Clearly the grid modernization eﬀorts, we talk a lot about those, and those are in some respects reﬂected back in the slide that we showed in terms of our 10-year outlook. Some of those dollars are certainly --. I think right now it's premature for us to put a speciﬁc number on the solar and energy storage opportunities or electriﬁcation.  I think clearly, as you've seen us do in Missouri. We see the solar plus battery storage projects and they've been really important to help reliability, Richard and his team in Illinois, certainly see those same types of opportunities and look electriﬁcation I think across the country, we're just scratching the surface in terms of what those opportunities can be. So I'd like to put something around that for you, but I think it's a slow early for us to do that. But, clearly, we see this is an important opportunity for the state of Illinois and especially Downstate Illinois."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Excellent. And just wanted to clarify a little bit more on your ﬁnancing plan here, two further points, one you talk, and perhaps emphasized the points throughout the transcript dividend growth and obviously you're broadly at the lower end of your contemplated payout ratio. You also increased a little bit the equity funding plan through the outlook. How do you think about dividend growth given the pace of CapEx that you have, do you think that ultimately, we're still trending towards the lower end of that payout, just through at least the bulk of this high growth period. I'll leave it there.","Thanks, Julien. It's a great question. So you know, look, we've talked a lot about the dividend and no doubt, it's an important area of focus for our Board of Directors. I think what we did today we pointed out, the obvious. Our execution of our strategy over the last several years has driven our dividend payout ratio down meaningfully to the lower end of our 55% to 70%. And so as a result as you look ahead, there is no doubt that we have been allocating a great deal of capital to rate base growth and as you see in this plan we continue to do that and we've had a solid dividend.  And so as we look ahead, I think the fact that we've been able to bring the dividend payout ratio outages. It gives us greater ﬂexibility with respect to capital allocation including from my perspective, position us well for future dividend growth."
"Hey, good morning Warner. So I guess ﬁrst question, just on the Illinois law proposal. Could you just maybe give us a little bit color of the kind of who is supporting that and how if at all that this proposal might interact with the Clean Air Clean Jobs (inaudible) also going on?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Look that a couple of things (inaudible), the bill is sponsored by Senator Hastings and Senator Hunter and the Senate sign on the House side it's, it is sponsors are representative of Greenwood and representative of Hoﬀman. So, when you step back and you look at the fundamental elements of this bill, this legislation. Number one, it's very consistent with things that have been talked about in Illinois really for the past 12 months in terms of trying to put greater levels of investment for solar, for battery storage, electriﬁcation. These are all things which are consistent with the Governor's package. So we think, as we've talked around with key stakeholders, these are important elements of any forward thinking legislation and so that's in this bill.  Secondly, I think over time, you have seen the modernization of the grid and the legislation associated with that, how that has received widespread support for all the right reasons, for reliability purposes, for customer aﬀordability purposes, for job creation, all those things are really spelled robust support for that. When you put these two things together, we think this legislation has really the opportunity to gain broad-based support.  Having said that, it's early in the session here. And so, Richard and his team have done a fantastic job of educating key stakeholders, talking with many folks that are at the table, including those that are looking at other pieces of legislation and so we're not done doing that. So I would say that a lot of these elements of this legislation are very consistent and much in line with what key stakeholders want to see, but there's still more work to do, but we're pleased with where things are at today and look forward to engage with these folks in the future."
"Okay, great. One other question, just have to ask that there is I guess noise going on with your neighboring utility and makes the question kind of whether you would be interested or your policy on M&A activity.","Sure. Of course, Steve, and we don't comment on rumors or certainly speculate on any M&A transaction, but let's just be clear. Our team remains very focused on executing our strategic plan. As you heard me just talk about a little bit earlier that plan is based on strong organic growth across all of our regulated businesses. And as you've seen in our presentation it has certainly delivered strong returns in the past to the execution of that strategy and that is absolutely our focus going forward, because we believe it's going to continue to deliver superior value, not just to our shareholders, but especially to our customers and so we're going to continue to stay focused on that plan, because we think that's going to deliver superior value in the long term for all of our stakeholders."
