Question,Answer
"Good, good. Thank you for all the colors today, very helpful. Maybe just starting oﬀ with regards to Illinois legislative session here. Do you have any sense for the relative priority of utility issues within the overall clean energy legislation discussions, and do you see any potential for a grand bargain here to be reached on energy?","Thanks Jeremy. A couple things there; one, I do think clean energy legislation is a focus for the legislature. I think just by the fact that you see so many bills that are being discussed out there, and rightfully so. The clean energy transition is obviously very important, not just for Illinois, but across the country. Certainly, as I said in my prepared remarks, there's no doubt that there are several bills that are being considered. Whether there's a grand bargain if you will or whether these bills were put together, look, it's just too early to say.  The only thing I can say is this, is that we are at the table with key stakeholders trying to ﬁnd a solution and to advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Aﬀordability Act, because, as you heard me say many times, that Act, those provisions, our performance-based ratemaking approach has really delivered signiﬁcant beneﬁts for our customers in the entire state of Illinois. We have until the end of the month to try and get something across the ﬁnish line. Richard Mark and his team have been working tirelessly at that and I'll say their tireless work and the work that we've been doing for many years has already elicited strong bipartisan support. We're hopeful to get the proper provisions and a ﬁnal piece of legislation."
"Maybe pivoting over to transmission, it seems like an exciting time for transmission if you will. Do you have any sense of the magnitude of speciﬁc projects that could be identiﬁed by MISO before year end or in the not too distant future, and what do you see separately as the potential for large scale HVDC transmission opportunities outside or beyond the MISO process? Then ﬁnally, I guess with transmission trying to scale the opportunity set here, I was wondering if you could help us think through roughly how much CapEx did Ameren deploy over the years where MISO brought renewable penetration from very little to the high level that it is today? Is there any rule any comment, 8%, 10%, just trying to scale the opportunity set here.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Jeremy, lots to unpack here. Let me see if I'll try to respond to those things and Michael and Andrew will help me if I haven't hit a point, but certainly come back on. Let me answer your ﬁrst question -- your last question perhaps ﬁrst. As I said in my prepared remarks, there's about $6.5 billion of regional transmission projects that really were deployed across the MISO footprint over the last decade if you will. We did about $2 billion of that.  Now, that doesn't mean that was a diﬀerent time, diﬀerent place, but obviously we did 25%, 30% almost of those. It's because of our location in the MISO footprint, so that's number one. Two, what you said at the outset, I agree with. It is a very exciting time to be in the transmission business, and especially one in the MISO footprint when you're sitting in the center of the country. What MISO does with its transmission is integral to the clean energy transition for our country. What you're seeing today, obviously, is a preliminary list of projects that they were informed, certainly, by stakeholder conversations, as well as Integrated Resource Plans and state energy policies among many other things.  It's hard to say just exactly what will ultimately come out of, let's just call it the transmission plan that will be ﬁled later this year. But the way we look at it, we look at that Future 1 which we showed on that slide, we think that there are a lot of projects in -- contained in that, that we think are really kind of no regrets types of projects. It's premature to put a number on it and which projects to go, because what MISO does now that they've put out this roadmap, they are basically looking for input from stakeholders. You can expect, throughout 2021, stakeholders will be providing input into that roadmap, and with that input, MISO will ultimately prepare their long-range plan, their MTEP is what they call it. We expect that to be ﬁled in the fourth quarter.  Ultimately, that process from there, Jeremy, is then there's some more input. But ultimately, the MTEP is put before the MISO Board of Directors for vote and hopefully approval by the end of the year. It's not too far away, but that Future 1 is, I would say, the ﬁrst step. But then as you look beyond that, as we've said, in Future 3, obviously those investments continue to grow over time. As we said, they range from $30 billion; to $100 billion, those are MISO's preliminary estimates that will continue to be reﬁned. So hopefully that gives you some of the sense. I'm not sure if that addressed all of your questions in there, but I think I got them all there."
"I think that's very helpful, but maybe just a follow up: anything on that HVDC front where Ameren might have a bit more leverage?","It's a little premature to say that. These are things we look at. Obviously, there's some opportunities that we're looking at even in connection with that Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, so a little early to be making those kind of judgment calls, but stay tuned."
"Got it. And if I could just do one quick last one as far as what's coming out of the Biden Infrastructure Plan? Early stages here, but is there anything that you're focused on and do you   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   see investment upside or beneﬁts from lower ratepayer costs or anything else that could really get things moving with the transmission permitting, planning process here?","Sure. Well, I will say one thing that we are encouraged by, in terms of what the Biden administration has done. Number one, they're very focused on providing signiﬁcant funding for new clean energy technologies, which we think is going to be so important for our industry, for our country, to get to a net zero carbon future by 2050, which is certainly our goal. I think the other thing that you're seeing is Senator Biden put out a bill that really had some, I think, some very good incentives to invest in clean energy technologies. Those incentives range from tax credits, they range from tax normalization policies to give opt-out provisions. They include cash credits, also for transmission.  And so if you look at the provisions of that bill, and I won't go through all the details there. That bill will really have a direct impact on the overall cost to our customers, and so we're obviously very encouraged and enthused about that. A lot going on in Washington D.C. We are at the table working with stakeholders and we are hopeful that we'll continue to see progress and incentives for clean energy technologies here in the next several months."
"Hey, good morning, guys. Good morning, Warner, how are you doing?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  I'm good, man."
"Good, excellent. Just a quick follow up on Illionois. If something doesn't pass in the next couple of weeks. Warner, do you sort of intend to push over the summer-what are your thoughts on getting something done with the veto session? I know there is obviously a lot of competition interest, there's a lot of bills, you highlighted that, some of them are outside of that energy is new legislators and politicians. So there is also a question, Mark, with many, if energy's even a priority right now. Just trying to get a bit of a sense if something doesn't get done in two weeks, how do we sort of price in their veto session?","Sure. And Shar, one of the things that you talk about, veto session in Illinois -- and Illinois is a bit unique perhaps compared to other states whereby the veto session isn't really just there to address bills that have been voted, but also can address bills that have been presented during the regular session. To be clear, I'll say this ﬁrst, we are very focused on trying to get something across the ﬁnish line for the beneﬁt of our customers and the State of Illinois and energy policy here by May 31. But your question is, what if it doesn't happen in the several weeks? Well, then it could be brought up in the veto session. And our approach should be very much of what we've been doing. We will continue to strongly advocate for the Downstate Clean Energy Aﬀordability Act, and the reason why we'll continue to advocate for it is because has strong bipartisan support.  We have house bills and senate bills with strong bipartisan as supporters well from the North and the South part of the state. We're going to continue to push for that, because we strongly believe it's the best policy going forward for the State of Illinois. And it isn't just because we believe it, it's because it's been delivering results for almost a decade now; so that's why we're going to continue to advocate for it. I do think people say, ""Well, it's a priority"", I will tell you, there are a lot of conversations going on in the State of Illinois around energy policy, so I know they have other priorities that they have to balance, but I do believe energy policy is one of them."
"Got it, terriﬁc, that's helpful, Warner. And just lastly shifting maybe South, obviously it's not a major priority for you guys or essential to the growth plan that obviously you're re-highlighting today, but any thoughts on securitization legislation as it makes its way through the Chambers, any sort of expectations you can provide as we get to the home stretch?","You bet. Well, we're in the home stretch in the State of Missouri at the end of this week, and Martin Lyons and his team have been working hard on that and they're provided some perspectives. But Marty, you've been in the middle of that, I am just going to turn it over to you and maybe give the latest update if you don't mind.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Yes, sure, Warner. Yes, you're absolutely right. Securitization isn't something that we see as required to be able to carry out our Integrated Resource Plan, but we do think, it would be a good tool to have in the toolbox with the Commission, especially as crafted in Missouri. You're right, there have been versions going through the House and Senate. They're very, very similar at this point. Last night, actually the Senate passed the House Securitization Bill, which is HP734, and they did make some slight modiﬁcations to that, so now that goes back to the house to the Fiscal Review Committee, and we'll see whether that can be then voted on in the House. We may see, actually, some action as early as today.  But in any event, what has to happen over the remainder of the week is that the language needs to get conformed between the two, the Senate Bill and the House Bill. Like I said, they're very, very similar at this point and ultimately needs to be passed by the end of the week. As Warner indicated, the legislative session ends on May 14 this Friday afternoon. In any event, we're very close, can't predict whether it'll actually get done, but it's really positioned pretty well for success, so we'll keep our ﬁngers crossed for the remainder of this week."
"And then just, Marty -- just assuming you get securitization, obviously this is the message is you don't need it for the IRP, but curious if you get securitization, is there an acceleration of the plan under the IRP, or any opportunities to potentially accelerate the plan?","No, there's really no change to the Integrated Resource Plan. When we ﬁled that last September, we ﬁled it believing that it was the most aﬀordable process and most reliable process for transitioning our ﬂeet over time, so we stand by the Integrated Resource Plan that we ﬁled. Of course, we've been getting comments on that. We expect that ultimately the Commission will rule on whether that process that we went through was appropriate; we certainly believe it was. And it would only be through consideration of changes that might occur over time that would cause us to modify the IRP. We still believe that the preferred plan that we ﬁled is the appropriate path. If securitization passes, there would not be any immediate impact on the Integrated Resource Plan, though like I said, conditions change through times and we do believe having securitization in the toolkit of the Commission would be a good thing to have."
"Terriﬁc. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it to someone else. Congrats.","Thanks, Shar. I appreciate it.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question."
"I would say, I mean, Warner, you made some interesting comments on transmission earlier. I would ask, obviously Future 1, Future 2 and 3 have big numbers, long time lines, and you've already tried to piece them apart, but how would you characterize this current MTEP best as you see it coming together against some of those bigger projects? How much would you be expecting here, right, if you want to just sort of start to set expectations initially here considering that, obviously, these things have long fuses.","Yes. Julien, a couple comments there. It is really premature to really say exactly which of those projects will ultimately show up in the MTEP. MISO did a ﬁne job of putting together this long range plan which gives us collectively an opportunity to weigh in on it and to try and keep, really, a ﬁnger on the pulse of all the things that are going on around the country, not just in the states, but around the country. It just is too premature, but I will say this, that we as well as MISO and other stakeholders, there is a sense of urgency to address these matters, because we see the clean energy transition coming and we know that transmission is critical to its success. Consequently, well, there is a signiﬁcant amount of interest, a signiﬁcant amount of work being done, so we're not too far away from really hearing what that it's going to be. The fourth quarter, for all practical purposes, is right around the corner.  And as you know, some of these projects, as you said, they take time to plan, get approval and ultimately execute. Again, as we see these, and I've said this in the past, it's really just the study really is consistent with what we've been talking about really for the last several years. We see signiﬁcant transmission opportunities. And should they come in the form of this MTEP or otherwise, we think they're probably, if there are any, they'll come towards the back end of our ﬁve-year current capital expenditure plan. But especially in the second half of this decade, you'll   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   see some of these transmission projects really come to fruition, and as I said before, we are well positioned to execute on many of those projects, so we're looking forward to it."
"Got it, excellent. Sorry to follow up on legislation very narrowly here. How do you see the potential of moving to June versus end of May? I know there is some latitude you mentioned. Then also, more importantly, the contrast of a grand bargain would be potentially carving out this issue and to sunset a question on the utility front separately from anything bigger. Is that achievable in your mind, or does this need to be a bigger deal, as far as you're concerned? What you (Multiple Speakers)","Hey, Julien, Michael here. I'm not sure we caught your whole question. You're talking about moving from outside of the May 31st, ending the session into June, so it's like a special session?"
"Fair enough, but you don't need to necessarily get this grand deal to get this sunset addressed","No, I'm sorry. Thank you. No, at the end of the day, so just to be clear, this expires in 2022, so this is not a piece of legislation that has to be done this year. It expires in 2022, and let's not forget that the overall regulatory framework that we have, which would go to, there's some things in there that are solid. It has a forward test year, it has decoupling, bad debt riders and all   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   these other things, and return on equity that would be done in the normal course of return on equity setting and by the Illinois Commerce Commission.  And so bottom line is this: we strongly believe that the Downstate Clean Energy Aﬀordability Act and all the provisions in there are clearly in the best interest of our customers in the State of Illinois. We're going to continue to advocate for that, but it doesn't have to be done here in the next week or the veto session, but having said that, we think having that certainty and sustainability is the right way to go. That's why we're pushing for it."
"Thank you. Michael, a quick clariﬁcation on the equity. In Q4, you guys said $300 million a year through 2025. The ATM goes through 2023. Is still $300 million per year a good sort of number to model through 2025?","Yes, I appreciate the question. So if you go back to February, the same metrics that we gave we're doing $150 million here in 2021, and then $300 million in 2022 through 2025. All of those assumptions still stand today. And this ATM is going to allow us to execute against that."
"Got it. So thank you. And then maybe just, I want to get into a little bit of detail on the Missouri securitization. Clearly, you're saying it doesn't impact your IRP. Could your assets be at risk? I'm thinking about early retirement of coal plants, capacity factors of your generation assets, and   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   whether the legislation now sort of accelerates the recovery of coal plants and impacts your rate based growth proﬁle? Any color there would be great. Thank you, Warner.","Yes, thanks, Durgesh. I'll have Marty weigh in a moment. As we've said before, we're very fortunate. We have a strong base load coal ﬂeet that runs, that runs a lot, and it's because of some of the actions and things we've done, really, over the past several years, decades, frankly. We laid out our Integrated Resource Plan and you see that systematically, we are retiring our coal-ﬁred energy centers over time. It is because, number one, we think it's in the best interest of our customers from a reliability and aﬀordability perspective. As Marty said, we don't see that changing; but conditions could change, whether it's at a state level or federal level. Securitization is not going to drive us to do anything diﬀerent, other than add some changes that may happen, as I said, from a policy perspective or otherwise, but it is a good tool to have in our toolbox, should those changes occur. Our coal plants are valuable assets to us today, over time, we will retire them, but we don't see any near-term changes to how we plan on operating or, certainly, risks to those assets. Marty, would you have anything to add to that?     Well, ﬁrst, I ﬁrmly agree with everything that you conveyed. And when you look at the Integrated Resource Plan that we ﬁled, we've got four coal-ﬁred energy centers. As Warner said, we've got very eﬃcient coal plants. They operate very well. With that said, in our Integrated Resource Plan, we did lay out that we're retiring our Meramec facility here in 2022. We expect that, that will be fully recovered at that point in time. We did propose the accelerated closure of both the Sioux and the Rush Island plants; Sioux by about 5 years and Rush Island by about six years. Sioux would close in 2028, Rush Island in 2039, and then Labadie, which is our largest plant, and most eﬃcient plant would close in two stages in 2036 and 2042.  So again we've accelerated the expected closure of two of our plants, and those accelerations and the recovery of those are actually reﬂected in the rate review ﬁling that we made here in March, so we're looking to accelerate the recovery of those plants. Then of course, the rates are also positively impacted by the expectation of Meramec closing. Those things are reﬂected there; that's historically the way we've handled things in Missouri. Again, as Warner said, when we ﬁled the IRP, we made a host of assumptions conditions can change and vary from the assumptions that we made through time, for a variety of reasons. As I said before, securitization is not going to change the Integrated Resource Plan, preferred plan that we have today; but if conditions change versus the assumptions we've made through time, again, securitization will be a good tool to have in the toolbox."
Understood. Appreciate the color. It sounds like it's more of an opportunity than a risk for you guys. Thanks for taking my questions.,"You bet, thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question."
"Doing great, doing great. Thanks so much for your time. Lot has been covered in Q&A. I guess I was stepping back and thinking about kind of key areas of growth upside for you all over -- I mean, you have a very impressive growth plan as it is. But just thinking especially about incremental renewables, elements of your IRP, but just other dynamics, and just wanted to step way back and think about those kind of key categories of additional growth upside and wondered if you could just comment on that.","Well, I think there are a couple of them more than a couple frankly, there are several. One, we talked quite a bit about already today, and that's transmission. As you know, we present investment opportunities through 2030 of $40 billion plus of investment opportunities, and one of the reasons we put that plus there is because transmission. That $40 billion number that we have investment opportunities, does not include any of the regional transmission projects that we spend quite a bit of time talking about already. Stephen, that would be, certainly, one meaningful upside to our investment proﬁle that we have prospectively.  A second one and another one that we've talked about, and again, I've mentioned this a little bit earlier is electriﬁcation and the infrastructure that has to go for the greater electriﬁcation, especially of the transportation sector in our country. Our long-term plan has really no meaningful investments associated with the electriﬁcation of the transportation sector. As you listen to the policymakers discuss the needs for a cleaner energy transition in this country and lower carbon emission as well. The transportation sector is the greatest carbon emitter in our country today, so you've heard, certainly, the automakers and others continue to lean further in; well, we're going to lean further in too, and we have been. I think that too is a signiﬁcant opportunity. But I'll tell you, just to be clear. We're not done with all of our investments in grid modernization. We need to continue to continue to make investments in the grid, both in Missouri and Illinois to make sure that the grid continues to be reliable and resilient. As we look at those investment opportunities which could also include greater levels of renewable energy over time, we have quite a bit in there; but times, as we've said, could change if policies change. Those two can be investment opportunities. Now, I didn't put a speciﬁc number on those, but they're sizable. They are sizable, and so we see our robust infrastructure plan that we have already today continuing for some time."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Really helpful. And then maybe just one additional question on transmission. A lot of questions already on this, but thinking about FERC and FERC has their objective to eliminate barriers to executing on transmission. How do you see that factoring into the existing RTO processes? Is that more of a just a long-term objective of FERC, or could that yield particular impacts to the outlook for transmission growth?","Thanks, Steve. I would say it's a bit too early to say to what extent FERC will get more engaged in the RTO processes, which have obviously been very well deﬁned over the years. Whether FERC will engage in that, it's just premature to say. What I will say is that, certainly, the clean energy transition and the importance of policies to support that clean energy transition are important issues for we, certainly, as transmission owners but also for FERC. I think Chairman Glick and the commissioners there recognize that, and I think you're going to continue to see greater levels of attention and focus at FERC on things that they can do to accelerate safe, reliable and aﬀordable transmission build around the country."
"(inaudible) So a quick technical question for Marty. The Missouri securitization bill, it sounded to me, and I've been following it, the House version that's been amended in the Senate and now is in the House and Committee. If it passes out of the House without any changes, does it go straight to the Governor? It was a little confusing to me, or would there have to be some changes does it have to go back to the Senate? Assuming there's no changes made in the House.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yes. If there are no changes made in the House, then it'll go to the Governor. If the Senate voted it out last night and the House makes no changes and votes it out, then it will be done and oﬀ to the Governor."
"Okay, that would be nice. And then, with respect to the Illinois legislation, and I know this doesn't pertain speciﬁcally to you guys but is sort of an element, I think, potentially, is the PJM auction. Do you think that's going to play any role in the timing here, because as you know that's coming up a little bit sooner than the at least it's beginning a little sooner than the end of the month.","Hi, Paul, this is Warner. I simply can't predict that, I really don't know. Obviously, you're right, it's not something that's directly correlated to us, but obviously we keep an eye on all things that could have an impact, so it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on that."
"Okay. I'll leave that one alone, the crystal ball question. Just moving on very quickly on the MISO issue and the ROE means you're being part of an RTO, if FERC takes action that you perceive to be negative with respect to the transmission, ROE and being part of an RTO, is there anything we should think as being potentially an outcome from that, that you guys might take? Or how should we I mean, I just noticed you guys bringing that up in the slide presentation and I just wanted to I'm just wondering, are you guys -- is there any, how should we think about that, if they do reverse the speciﬁcation at this points or do other action, it might lower the ROE?","The mean the reason we bring it up, certainly in our prepared remarks is because we believe that the potential direction that FERC is taking is inconsistent with FERC policy. I think it's inconsistent with the intention of the law. And we think right now is the time where FERC should be doing everything it can to incent companies to join and remain in RTOs. And so we bring that up simply because of that, and certainly we think that the 50 basis point adder is absolutely positively appropriate for us to have, because we've given them control of our system. I think that's in the ﬁrst interest. We're not trying to be any more speciﬁc than that. We are going to work very hard here between now at the end of the month and put together our comments, like others in the industry, to state our position very clearly to FERC."
"Good. Hey, Warner. Just one question from me and just wanted your update on the latest on the Clean Air Litigation. You know, regarding the Rush Island plant and I think Labadie as well. I think you are expecting a ruling from the appeal court sometime this year, is that still your expectation? I guess depending on what comes out of that, if it goes against you on the appeal side, how do you think about the next steps as it relates to the timing of potential CapEx or just the state of these plans?","Sure. A couple things, just to refresh everyone's memory. Our argument was held in December of last year, and so that case, the New Source Review case is simply before the appellate court now. We've said we expected a decision this year, but I'll tell you that the appellant court has no timeline in terms of when they must issue a decision, but we would think in the normal course, we would expect to see something this year, so we simply don't know.  Look, if the question is whether we get an unfavorable ruling, I'll start with this. We believe we presented a very strong case to the courts in this matter in December. And should they ultimately rule against this, we'll step back and assess what actions we need to take at that time. Insoo, it'd be really premature to speculate on what actions we would take and what impact it might have on our overall plan. If and when we'll come to that, we'll address that in due course. So stay tuned is probably the best message here."
"Got it. I guess in terms of in relation to the current securitization bill, perhaps do you think that could provide one avenue that could help you navigate through this matter?","Certainly, as Marty stated before, securitization is a tool for several things, whether it would be something that would apply here, we'll just have to wait and see. But ﬁrst things ﬁrst; we're focused on winning that case before the appellant court, and then continuing to execute the plan that we laid out before the Missouri Public Service Commission in our Integrated Resource Plan.
