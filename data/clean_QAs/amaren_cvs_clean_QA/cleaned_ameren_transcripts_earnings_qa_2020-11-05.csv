Question,Answer
"Just want to dig in on 2021 a little bit more if I could and would you be able to provide any additional color on the sales outlook for us, diﬀerent sectors residential, commercial, industrial in your 2021 earnings considerations and what local trends are you seeing and how do you expect these trends to change over 2021 with COVID recovery?  And then, lastly, are there any additional considerations for your gas versus electric operations under continued COVID impacts?","So Jeremy, lot to unpack there. Clearly, Michael laid out some of the trends that we're seeing in 2020 and now obviously we've talked a little bit about 2021 in the past. So Michael, why don't you maybe touch on some of those trends and then we can sort of look at the gas business and sort of the second part of that question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Yeah. Good morning, appreciate the question. Yeah, we did allow quite a bit of detail obviously onto 2020. We continue to, I think track pretty well with where we expected things to come out as we've talked about the beginning of the year. I think for the most parts it's coming in about where we had expected. The mix is a little bit diﬀerent. As you think about 2021, I mean, we're doing a lot of diﬀerent scenarios, Jeremy, and we're thinking about how this recovery is going to continue. And we are obviously modeling a recovery to continue into 2021 and we're looking hard within each of those sectors.  And obviously, you've seen the strong piece on the residential side, industrial is come back for the most part, commercial here, we're spending a lot of time on just really trying to understand what that impact will be for retail, et cetera. So we haven't obviously provided what we're going to exactly see for 2021, because we want to really see where 2020 continues to ﬁnish out here, being really thoughtful about it. I mean, I'm -- to be honest, I'm not seeing a lot of scenarios where we would gain all of that back. I mean, I'll be honest about that but we clearly do continue to see the recovery continue in place.  Now, all of that is premised on the fact that we wouldn't go back in any sort of shelter-in-place orders and for the most parts, where we're impacted by earnings here in Missouri, we're pretty well opened up. I mean, you do have certain sectors operating at some limited capacity, restaurants, stores in retail, those kind of things. And so, we're assuming that some of that continues to come back but again, and all that's premised on the fact that we wouldn't have any signiﬁcant sort of shelter-in-place at the moment.     Yeah, Michael, I think that's a great summary. So I think Michael summed it up well. We continue to see really pretty much what we expected at the outset. We expected a modest recovery over time, that's what we're seeing and we'll give more guidance of course when we come out in our February conference call to guide to 2021 and beyond. So we'll better give you some more perspectives.  But, yes about the gas business -- and so, keep in mind, the gas business, we have a small gas business in Missouri but the big gas business is in Illinois and that's decoupled. And so, when you think in terms of COVID-19, the implications there are really non-existent in terms of the overall impacts on sales and margins and the like.     Yeah, that's exactly right, Warner. I mean, we are decoupled for residential and small non- commercial customer in Illinois, which is probably about 90% of the margin over there, Jeremy. So that's probably really the way to think about that for 2021."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe just pivoting a bit over to the Missouri rate cases. And what are the primary drivers of the timing of Missouri rate cases here? And do you expect to incorporate any IRP elements in your electric ﬁling around the plant retirements and are there any notable test year diﬀerences under a ﬁrst half '21 ﬁling versus ﬁling now?,"Hey, Jeremy, so this is Warner. Look, I think that we'll be able to provide a lot more detail when we ultimately ﬁle the rate case but as we've said before, when we think about ﬁlling this next rate review, we're going to be mindful of the fact that we have some big wind generation projects, right, normal wind generation projects that we expect to be substantially in service by the end of the year. So that's clearly a driver, always an opportunity to true-up for the costs and sales, those are obviously the drivers as well.  But to say there'll be any signiﬁcant variations at this point in time, that'd be premature. Marty and his team are diligently putting together that rate reviews we said we'll put together in the ﬁrst half of next year. And so, well, I think the best thing to say is that obviously the wind generation is a big portion of it as well as the smart energy plant, right, just -- that keep and not lose focused on the fact that we're making signiﬁcant investments in Missouri.  So those would be some key drivers to be looking towards and we'll be able to give you a better update when we ﬁle that plan sometime in the ﬁrst half of next year."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was on mute. Maybe you guys talked about you're going to be cautious and disciplined in including some of this incremental CapEx on the Q4 call, perhaps what are between now and Q4 sort of what goes into that consideration of including the CapEx? And is it the -- is it something incremental on the IRP that you're going to hear? Just any thoughts or color on -- around that would be appreciated.","Sure, sure. So this is Warner again. As we've said in the past, we'll be thoughtful in terms of when we include new renewable generation projects, things from the Integrated Resource Plan into our -- in our long-term CapEx and look at a variety of factors. And certainly one important matter that we'll be mindful of is that Marty and his team, they've issued an IRP for the wind and solar projects. And so, that's already out there and so we not only ﬁled the IRP, but we're taking steps to execute elements of that plan, and of course, an IRP, and our ability to assess those projects from that IRP will be one important consideration that we'll look at.  And of course the regulatory factors. It's always -- we want to be thoughtful in terms of when we do these things, looking at the nature of the projects, the regulatory approvals that would be required. All those things go into -- to our determination and when we actually put it in there. But as I said at the outset, the one thing is clear is that the opportunities from our Integrated Resource Plan are signiﬁcant and there are $3 billion for 2030.  And so, Michael, any other thing that you would add to that?     No, I -- Look, that's a great summary I think of the IRP itself. I mean, I think, the -- out of just the normal kind of budgeting and some updates that we'll do in the February timeframe, we go through that process obviously throughout the year, we continue to look at capital allocation issues. And so, it will be the normal updates just in the course of the business that we run through. And so, you certainly should expect to see that and that's typically when we do that in our February call as well.     Absolutely, absolutely."
"That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Could you comment on sort of how much room do you have in the state with PISA caps? I mean, that's sort of something that we are looking you'd talk with investors about and how does the IRP plan ﬁt into that?","Yeah, perfect. I appreciate the question. Yeah, really what we've said in the past, I think, you're referring to the 2.85% cap that was built into Senate Bill 564. Really, there's only two things that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   have occurred again, that's a CAGR over that '17 through '23 time period. Two things have happened since that legislation was passed.  We had the -- obviously, the federal tax reduction that occurred in '18, we were able to keep half of that for purposes of that calculation. And then, we just obviously concluded this last rate review which was another 1% decrease. So we haven't speciﬁcally said exactly how much headroom but I'll give you a sense that both of those things have been rate decreases. You had a 2.85% CAGR, so it gives you hopefully an idea what kind of headroom we have today."
"Doing well. Thanks. I just wanted to quickly touch on your 2020 guidance as I look at your drivers relative to the Q2 update, it looks like you're expecting an incrementally higher ROE in Illinois, and it looks like your Q4 COVID impact once you back out the Q3 impacts, looks like that's gotten a little bit better by about a $0.01. So can you maybe just help us understand a little bit better, what drove the reduction by $0.05 at the high end?","Yeah, I mean, really I think if you think about the reduction of the $0.05. I mean so you go to the 9 -- $0.29 to $0.30, we're down about $0.04 obviously on weather. We've had a number of COVID impacts, there you can see about $0.17 or so along with that and as we thought of that,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   we've oﬀset a lot of those COVID impacts, obviously with some disciplined cost management on the O&M side and really it's about adjusting that down by a couple of cents on the weather piece of that really is what drove that decision."
"Okay, great. Thank you. If I could just touch on the dividend brieﬂy as you mentioned in your remarks earlier, you guys, it sounds like you have a little bit of latitude relative to your 55% to 70% range. So I know future decisions are obviously subject to Board approval but how should we think about future increases in the payout relative to the payout range and also to your 6% to 8% EPS CAGR?","Yeah, no. I appreciate it, this is Warner, again. Clearly the dividends are an important area of focus for our Board of Directors and we've been clear all along that we target our dividend payout ratio of 55% to 70% and so, as you know, over the last several years that we have allocated a great deal of our capital to rate base growth, which has obviously driven strong earnings per share growth, which that coupled with our solid dividend has really delivered really strong total shareholder returns.  So at the same time, I think as you pointed out and that we've seen that dividend payout ratio now come lower down than our overall range, and so that factor coupled with our strong earnings per share growth expectations of 6% to 8% really positions us well for future dividend growth and I can't ultimately predict that but the point that is we try to execute our strategy and position ourselves for a solid dividend growth and perhaps even greater dividend growth in the future. And so, you saw our Board of Directors just increase it 4% just recently, I think that's evidence of their belief in our overall strategic plan and their conﬁdence in it, and so we'll continue to visit that going forward, but that does just give us an opportunity, certainly when you look at those metrics to continue to grow that dividend."
"All ﬁne, I'm managing to the day-to-day. So in terms of Illinois, legislatively speaking, do you expect anything to happen in this abbreviated session here with respect to clean energy or the formula rate stuﬀ that you put forward and what -- did you see anything legislatively signiﬁcantly happening with regard to you guys?","So Paul, this is Warner. So yeah, as I -- and I said in the talking points, we do not expect comprehensive energy legislation to be addressed in the veto session, which is coming out, they obviously have two sessions scheduled in November and December and for certain days. So we do not see that at this point, of course, we can't certainly predict that but as we sit here now, we do not see comprehensive legislation on really any of those fronts being addressed in the veto session at this time."
"Okay, and then, just to clarify, it looks to me that you're -- although you're lowering the top end of the guidance for this year, your growth rate is still oﬀ of the midpoint of your original guidance of 2020, correct?",Yeah.     That's the way to think about it.     Absolutely. And this is Michael.
"Just to follow up on the Illinois legislature question, can you tell us when they do come back full time, and if you have a sense of when they may decide to pick up the states of legislation?","Well, so we laid out on the talking points to speciﬁc dates for the veto session and..."
Thanks for clarifying. if I can follow up with just one more. Can you tell us what the timeline looks like for the Missouri IRP approval since that will give us some kind of indication on CapEx increases?,"Sure. A couple of things around that. I know Marty Lyons is on the line, you can jump into some of the speciﬁcs, but there is no set time period with regard to the integrated resource plan. History has shown that it's usually all addressed within sort of one year of the ﬁling and I think last time those were around nine months when it was all said and done. And so remember to the commission when they go through this, they really approve the overall process and what we go through in terms of putting together the Integrated Resource Plan. They don't necessarily go through and approve speciﬁc elements or projects contained within that plan.  And so, that the process has been started, ﬁlings have been made and then, Marty, I'll let you come on in if there is any other speciﬁc details around that, but again, the commission doesn't have a set time period, but history has shown this is usually done within nine months to 12 months. Marty, you have anything to add from that?     Warner, that's all accurate. I would say that once you ﬁle the IRP, there is opportunities for others -- other stakeholders to comment on their perspectives and any deﬁciencies they feel. The commission at its option can have a hearing to discuss those matters that others bring up and ultimately will provide some perspective on the IRP but typically what the commission does is just identiﬁes whether there were any deﬁciencies or not, it's not necessarily approval of the IRP itself for an endorsement of the IRP.  So with all of that said, the other thing I would simply mention is in our prepared remarks, we mentioned that we have already issued a request for proposal relating to projects that we would plan to do in accordance with our preferred plan and we're not precluded from moving forward with negotiating or announcing or ﬁling for certiﬁcate of convenience and need with the commission. There is nothing that precludes us from taking any of those steps before the commission actually rules on the Integrated Resource Plan in the way that I mentioned."
"Great, thanks. Thank you so much. And that was very helpful.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Great, thank you.  Operator   Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with HITE Hedge. Please proceed with your question."
"I'm doing well. Actually, I think, I'm more upset, I think Paul already asked my questions, but just to clarify, so the 5% delta from your guidance we shouldn't carry that into 2021, there is really no eﬀect from that as far as the midpoint or what's going to be your base or anything like that, it's all under weather-related and kind of one-time. I'm assuming one-time stuﬀ but -- that said -- that will come back in 2021.","You got it. I think you said 5%, but $0.05 is and..."
"Hey, good morning. Just one question from me, could you just give us the latest update on the appeals process for the -- I think the judge's ruling last year on the Labadie and Rush Island plants and whether we can expect any updates before the end of the year?","Sure. Insoo, this is Warner again. We have ﬁled our briefs with the appellate courts obviously putting forward what we believe a very strong arguments. And so, really where things are at today is that we're waiting for the court to schedule oral arguments and we're still hopeful to have those scheduled by the end of the year. So that's -- it's going through the normal process, but of course, there are no speciﬁc timeframe that the court has to act or to take speciﬁc action, but -- so, we'll wait to hear the schedule and it's still possible to have them still by the end of the year."
"Got it. And if the decision at the appellate process goes against you, then what are procedurally the next steps that you are considering? And given these plants in your IRP at least you've laid -- outlined some of the retirement dates and this could potentially require you to take other actions that were some of the thought processes there.","So I think, Insoo, I was just making sure, it's just a little bit garbled here in terms of -- is speciﬁc question as a result of the court's decision or how much time would that -- might that change, is that was your question was in terms of our IRP?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Not necessarily IRP, but if the appeals process doesn't go your way, what are the next steps and just ﬁnal thoughts around given the remaining rate base of the plants, what your thought process around the plants would be?","Sure. Look if -- as I said, we strongly believe we have a great case. But having said that, if things go against what we think is the appropriate answer then we'll do what we always do, we'll step back to really take a look at what we believe our next steps are. It depends on the speciﬁc actions and things that the court says, of course, and then we'll take a look in the term what we think is the -- in the best long-term interest of our customers and that concerning our shareholders. So it'd be premature to speculate just exactly where that might head."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Great. Just one follow-up question maybe assuming you are to own the 1.2 gigawatts of renewables under your preferred option in the IRP, I think those are projected to be online by year-end '25. Do you anticipate that to be -- have an upward bias on your EPS growth target or will that CapEx, renewables CapEx push out or displace other non-renewables CapEx in that '24, '25 period? Thanks.","Yeah. Hey, David, this is Michael. Probably won't be a terribly satisfactory answer, but I mean, I think, look, we're just, it's probably a bit premature to speculate on that, I mean, it's something that we will be very thoughtful about and we'll take a number of things under consideration when you look at it just in terms of what the overall rate impact is, the timing of it. I mean hopefully, we'll be able to give some additional color on that in February as Warner talked about. I mean, we don't want to get ahead of just the regulatory process there, but we'll be very thoughtful about it, but it's probably a bit premature to answer that."
