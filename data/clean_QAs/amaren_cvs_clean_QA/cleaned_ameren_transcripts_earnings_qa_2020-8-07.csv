Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Just want to start oﬀ with the IRP here, and just wanted to see how the outreach was progressing in and any early thoughts that you can share with us at this point or feedback with the ﬁling coming soon here?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Morning, Jerry.     Yeah. Well great question, Jeremy, appreciate the question on the IRP. Well, as you know, this is a an extensive process with stakeholders that's been going on for several months. Marty Lyons and his team have done just a terriﬁc job of just outlining some of our perspectives and getting insights, which is really important.  So I would say, as you know, we're getting to the tail end of that process, and it would be really inappropriate to say, just exactly what the feedback is in because we're putting together all that and we'll ultimately issue our integrated resource plan here at the end of September. But I can tell you that the conversations have been constructive, the insight's great, and we look forward to submitting that integrated resource plan.  As you heard in my talking points, we look at a lot of things in this integrated resource plan. We certainly look at the technology, which is out there and we've certainly seen renewable energy technology and their related costs continue to come down. Took a careful look at our coal-ﬁred energy centers in there -- and then the useful lives of those plants, and we really think about what's really going to deliver value to our customers in the state of Missouri. And so, we look forward to submitting that plan at the end of September."
That's very helpful. Thanks. Just pivoting to the O&M savings side with what you've guys realized so far year-to-date this quarter. What portion do you think you might be able to retain on an ongoing basis? And do you have any kind of updated thoughts on cost savings in to 2021 at this point?,"Sure, maybe Michael you want to hit a little bit on the quarter and then, I can maybe address some of the ongoing. So I'll let you take the ﬁrst shot at it.     You're. Absolutely, Jeremy, we said on that ﬁrst quarter call and I think, even if you think of that sort of the beginning of the year, we said that O&M was going to be up, we didn't say how much for the overall year, and then we came forward to the ﬁrst quarter call, and we said O&M was going to be down.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And you can see that obviously we are doing a good job of managing, the team's working hard on managing cost down where we can, being very careful about headcount, obviously where we have opportunities on because of reduced load, there's reduced maintenance cost, obviously from a travel, entertainment perspective being very thoughtful there. And so I think, the team's done a nice job continued to help oﬀset some of these things going into 2020.  In terms of sort of what we retain and what is reoccurring I mean Warner can certainly touch on 2021 but I mean, at the moment, we're just going to continue to watch this closely it's helping us oﬀset some of these sales headwinds that we have, and it's across the board. I know, we focus a lot on the Missouri side because that's where it hits the bottom line, but it is across Ameren Illinois distribution, and Ameren Illinois natural gas as well.     Yeah, well said Michael. Jeremy, the reality is that we obviously were very focused on 2020, but we're looking ahead too. We do see several -- savings that we're realizing today that we can really carry over into next year, things like all the diﬀerent perspective of how we think about travel, well, the diﬀerent perspective in terms of the consultants that we have to bring in to work with us and how they can work remotely.  I mean, our digital investments have really been a step change not just for our current workforce, but how we engage in work with others. We think about real estate too and facilities cost, we've had to explore because of our digital team and the investments that we're making, we're exploring other facilities to lease in the future because we are simply outgrowing what we currently have. We see opportunities there and that's just not going to be necessary, prospectively, because reality is we can work very eﬀectively remotely.  And so, no that coupled with some really -- I said in my talking points how the team has really done some innovative things, and been agile out in the ﬁeld in terms of our work practices. Not only are they safer and they are, I mean they're going to give us the ability to work more eﬀectively and productively, and that coupled with our digital investments, I think these are the types of things that we are already going to put in our playbook not just for this year, but for many years ahead. So stay tuned, more to come when we talk more about the future in our O&M."
"Good. If I can follow up on the last question here on the IRP and I understand that with this thing fairly imminent, you can't comment too much, but can you give us a little bit of perspective on how that might eventually ﬂow into your formal CapEx projections, especially the extent to which we're talking about incremental renewables and how they -- your future recovery?","Sure, Julien it would be just premature to the really say how that would play out, I mean, number one, we have to roll out the IRP plan, we'll talk about what additional investment opportunities might be there, of course associated with renewable energy, and then, we'll take a look at that in terms of our ﬁve-year plans and to what extent that it has an impact.  So as opposed to doing a piecemeal, would be better served for everybody when we roll out the plan to build a -- to really talk about it in a comprehensive fashion. And so, we'll be in a good position to do that, certainly during our third quarter conference call and as we move into EEI, that'll be a great topic of conversation just as it was in 2017 when we announced our 700 megawatts of wind generation and 100 megawatts of solar. We anticipate having a very comprehensive discussion at that time as well."
"Okay. All right. Great. And then if I can also follow-up on the last question around cost management and -- the sustainable cost savings that you talk about you've identiﬁed and you anticipate holding onto. When you think about the pressures created from the lower 30-year treasury, is this potentially an oﬀset as you think about it? You can take that any way you want, but I'm curious on how you would frame the ﬁve-year view given those longer data pressure here.","Yeah. Julien, it's Michael here, just putting in context of not necessarily a number, but absolutely I mean, O&M customer aﬀordability has always been a lever that we have used. I mean, it's not   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   something that's sort of we've discovered here during 2020 as a result of this pandemic, but obviously, there's been more accelerated focus on it. But absolutely I mean, it is something that helps us work through these headwinds that we've had and as you note that 30-year treasury, it's been a headwind for a while and we've continued to oﬀset that with it     That's well said, Michael, and Julien, we're mindful of the lower 30-year treasuries, and certainly O&M is one of those levers for all the reasons that Michael said, but no look, we also have leverage in terms of a robust capital plan as we talked about on the call that we have infrastructure that we can move forward especially at this lower cost of capital, it might make sense for customers and for us to do that. And so we'll look at that, and of course, we always take a look at capital allocation and many other levers. So that's just how we operate the business in terms of looking at just that one lever, but multiple levers to make sure we're delivering on our promises."
"Okay, I'll turn it over. Thank you very much guys. Take care.","Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.     Hey Shahriar, how are you doing?"
"Hey, it's actually (inaudible) for Shahriar. Thanks for taking our questions. So ﬁrst, just on the timing of the next rate case in Missouri. Just wondering, if you have any updated thoughts here in the past. You've pointed to potentially ﬁling the summer for new rates at the beginning of next year. But obviously, a portion of the win has the potential to move into the ﬁrst quarter of   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   next year. How are you thinking about those now given all the moving pieces and the (Technical diﬃculty) -- just wondering what have you been hearing from the legislature in terms of continued interest. Has it still been on the mind of lawmakers or has it kind of taking a (Technical diﬃculty) issues related to the buyers have come to the forefront and then taking this all into consideration -- sorry. Go ahead.","No, no, no, please ﬁnish your question. I apologize for interrupting."
Yeah. Just wondering if something could get done in the veto session in November. Is it more likely that it gets pushed into next year.,"Sure. Let me try and take that in several pieces and Richard, Mark and his team and continued to work very hard to have conversations virtually, of course with key stakeholders and not just legislative stakeholders. So couple things to think about there. In terms of energy policy, I think energy policy broadly in the state of Illinois is still at the top of a lot of folk's minds, and rightfully, so because energy policy is so important.  That's why as we said as part of our talking points and as well as what you've heard us say before is why we support so strongly to down state clean energy aﬀordability act because it really addresses many of the key issues that the state of Illinois is focused on, more renewable energy resources, more investments and electriﬁcation as well as grid modernization.  These are things that have been really important for the State of Illinois and will continue to be. And so, we continued to have conversations with key stakeholders around that particular piece of legislation and that we still support. Having said that, as you know there's been a lot of dialogue and some concerns raised as a result of the Commonwealth Edison Federal Investigation, so we understand that.  And so consequently, as we think ahead what we're going to do is continue to double down on our eﬀorts to work with stakeholders collaboratively, listen to their concerns, but make sure that we point out the value of the current regulatory framework and our proposal. And at the end of the day, our focus is going to continue to be to try and ﬁnd a solution that gives us the ability to collectively in the State of Illinois to invest in critical infrastructure and give us the ability to earn a fair return and deliver values to our customers in the State of Illinois.  Now in terms of timing, now I've learned a long time ago that I don't predict when things will be addressed by any legislature or when things will ultimately get better. And obviously, things are a little bit more complicated as we approach this upcoming veto session. In light of lot of the activities, my best perspective and Richard had talked a lot about this whether something gets done in the veto session around the down state clean energy aﬀordability act, I would tell you it's my perspective a challenge or as I like to use sports analogies, I call it a long putt, right? to   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   get that in the veto session. So that's our best perspective on it. In terms of what we think may still happen this year, but importantly, we're going to continue to focus our eﬀorts on."
"Good. Some of my question's have been answered here. Just to sort of follow up on the Illinois thing, there just seemed to be this lease with a vocal group sort of this unhappiness with the formula rate plan, which you outlined the beneﬁts of and in fact the low cost of capital associated with and what have you -- and I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more as to what's sort of driving that, is the the same people seem to be sort of interested in the issues you also discussed which are, ethics and diversity and economic justice that sort of thing.  And so I'm just wondering is there some room here to sort of address their concerns or is there something more fundamentally that's happening here that's just not clear to me with respect to this concern about formula rate plans. And I realize you guys are just one part of it, there's this big northern part of the state that has its own issues. I was just wondering if you could talk about that?","Sure, fair question. I guess, a couple comments. Yes, clearly, we've seen the governor and other groups come out and say, they oppose the existing framework that's out there. And look, the thing that we think is important recognizing that a lot of that maybe -- and so I'm speculating a bit -- just simply surrounding the issues with Commonwealth Edison and the investigations and how it was linked to when performance-based rate-making was put in place many years ago.  Our job and Richard and this team, they do a terriﬁc job at this and we're just going to sit down and just make sure we meet with stakeholders in a collaborative way and just sit there and explain what this framework has really done, and that's really what we should do is -- open and   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   transparent framework that essentially every year the Illinois commerce commission takes a look at it what we're doing. And you've heard me say in a -- to beneﬁts of this particular framework, and the real winner's been the State of Illinois and our customers.  It's been an overwhelming success in so many ways. And so, it's just important that we make sure that we level set everybody. At the same time, we're going to be at the table listening to their concerns and if they have legitimate concerns, we'll see what ways we can try to bridge whatever gaps there may be. And so that's just how we will continue to do business. And as I said a moment ago, really the key from our perspective is sitting at the table and really to put in place constructive energy policies.  They're going to support investment and infrastructure -- energy infrastructure, in particular, gives us the ability to earn a fair return on those investments, but also to deliver signiﬁcant value for our customers in the State of Illinois and create thousands of jobs. So, we think there's opportunities that -- and there will be opportunities to sit down and talk with these stakeholders, and make sure we have a good understanding of what's been done. And what we think can be done prospectively. And so there is a lot of noise like we recognize and that creates challenges I get it, but at the same time, just because there's noise, does it mean that we're not going to sit down and have a collaborative approach with these key stakeholders."
"Alright. Good morning, and happy Friday. My only remaining question is I guess partially relate to the IRP. But could you just give us the latest on the U.S. district judge's order from last fall to install scrubbers on couple of your coal plants, including Rush Island, and how are you incorporating or thinking about this when you're developing your IRP process?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So I want to make sure, are you talking about the new source reviews, is that what you're referring to? Or something diﬀerent."
It was just the -- I think the violation of the clean air.,"Yes. That's right. That's right. So yeah, just a quick update on that one. So this has been a matter litigation related to our Rush Island Energy Center back to 2011, and we've been through the courts and so the state of play right now is that we've appealed the decision to the court of appeals and made all the appropriate brieﬁngs and ﬁlings with the courts, and my sense is that there is no speciﬁc time frame, but it'll be this fall before you probably see any kind of activity associated with this. But again, there's no speciﬁc time frame. But all the briefs have been ﬁled here in the ﬁrst half in May, and so I would just say, stay tuned, no real developments other than going through the standard process."
"Got it. And I guess in terms of the thoughts on the generation freight transformation and the upcoming IRP, your assumption will be that you haven't violated the act, so you'll plan accordingly based on that assumption.","Yeah, rest assured, we clearly believe we have not violated the act and so yeah, that would be a fair statement and assumption that we'll have going into the integrated resource plan."
