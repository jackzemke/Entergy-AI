Question,Answer
"I wanted to talk about transmission growth plans beyond what you've already laid out, as I think about Entergy joining MISO, and as you think about your service territory being a linkage, could you talk about how you think about additional transmission growth plans? What would the process be, timing, et cetera for thinking through that? And is that something we should be actively thinking about?","Hey, good morning, Stephen; this is Warner. I'll touch on some of the big picture things. And then in terms of some of the timing maybe I'll ask Maureen Borkowski our CEO of our transmission business to step in. But big picture, we do see opportunities for incremental investments in transmission. Certainly, as you mentioned, you look at Entergy coming into MISO, and we see that there are clearly opportunities there. But I wouldn't limit it to just that. I would look at the opportunities at the MISO and PJM JCM, as well as between MISO and SPP, and frankly, beyond that, just with some of our NERC reliability project. If you put all those types of things together and we see over the next several years, real opportunities for growth in transmission.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And Maureen and her team, even today, are taking steps to position ourselves to execute on an investment strategy there; just as we did, frankly, many years ago to put ourselves in the position we we're at today to execute on the $2.25 billion that we're executing in that plan. So we absolutely – that something you should be thinking and something we are clearly thinking about, and we intend to execute on.  In terms of overall timing, Maureen, I know that there's a process going on, perhaps you can ﬁll us in a little bit on that.     Certainly from a timing perspective, all of the RTOs are engaged in implementing their post- FERC Order 1000 processes, and we've been actively engaged and participating in those both in terms of the certiﬁcation processes to participate as a transmission developer in those regions, as well as to participate in the planning process proposed projects.  We've actually already been pre-certiﬁed by both PJM and MISO to participate in that post- FERC Order 1000 process. We're working with Southwest Power Pool as they continue to develop their rules for certiﬁcation. So we are in the development phase, I would say, at this point in time. But as Warner mentioned, those are all milestones that need to be met and as we continue to accomplish those, we're hoping to increase that portfolio of projects."
"Great, thank you. And shifting gears over to Missouri, clearly, disappointing that the legislature didn't take action. Can you talk about what would need to happen, what would need to change in the state for there to be better appreciation for the need for more incentives to actually spend capital in the state? It sounds like other priorities, really, you're saying, Warner, sort of took higher priority this year. But just wondering what needs to change for the situation in Missouri to improve?","Yeah. Thanks Stephen; this is Warner. I think certainly there were other priorities that the legislature took on this year. And certainly, to be clear, I mean, there certainly was some opposition by certain consumer groups that really, I would say, are taking more of a shorter- term (27:00) focus than a longer-term. So one of the things that we have been and will continue to do is continue to educate key stakeholders, not just legislators, but others around the state, about the importance of solid energy policy in the state of Missouri; about the importance of infrastructure investment. And not only how it's going to meet our customers' energy needs and expectations in the future, but also how we're convinced it can drive economic development and growth.  I think a great example that will be helpful for us are the great things that Richard Mark and his team are doing over in Illinois, in terms of using that constructive regulatory policy over there to invest in our infrastructure, helping deliver on the energy needs and expectations of customers and certainly driving job growth.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So it is an educational process that we'll continue to do. It is an outreach process to legislators and key inﬂuentials. And it's important that we continue to raise the priority level of responsible energy policies in the state of Missouri. And Michael Moehn, who I know has taken over in my role in Ameren Missouri, I know this is a top priority for he and his team. And we're going to continue be relentless in our discussions around this important energy policy in the state. But I think ultimately this is going to continue to be working, working very hard to educate key stakeholders and continue to advocate for that responsible policy."
I was wondering if you could just give us a ﬂavor for what the level of discretionary capital would have been if something like SB 909 had been implemented? How much more you would have been investing in Missouri? And where that would have come from? It would have come from Illinois? Or would it have been additional capital raised in the capital markets? How should we have thought about it?,"Hi, Paul; this is Warner. I'll start with sort of the big picture about the incremental capital we thought we could put to work, and then I'll let Marty jump in, in terms of how we're thinking about the allocation of capital. The big picture: we looked at this legislation if it would have got across the ﬁnish line, it would have given us the ability to add, say, $50 million to $100 million per year of incremental discretionary capital we could put to work.  Now this bill was not – that we were talking about this session, was not the same bill that we had looked at in the past, nor is it really a similar bill that was done in Illinois where you get more   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   timely recovery of costs. But no matter, we could clearly have put $100 million incrementally per year in variety of aging infrastructure projects, from both the transmission distribution and generation side of our business.  Marty, you want to touch a little bit about how we think about that in terms of allocation of capital?     Yes, sure, Warner. Paul, as I mentioned on our last call, what we'll do to the extent that we do have incremental capital expenditure opportunities, whether they be in Missouri at some point in the future or other parts of our business, is fully look at the relative returns that we can get on our various projects across the enterprise, look at our overall funding needs. But also look beyond the current 5-year period, as we've said before, to be developing sort of a pipeline of investment opportunities, rate based growth and earnings growth opportunities beyond the 5- year period through 2018.  So if the opportunities present themselves, no matter where they be, we'll take a look at enterprise-wide and across not just the 5 years but the 10 years, and decide whether to fund those incrementally in the short-term or rearrange our project timing to push some of those projects out and build that pipeline for the future."
"Okay. And I guess just to clarify this. There really was no – you guys in your forecast previously hadn't really baked in anything for SB 909, is that correct?","That's absolutely right, Paul. There was nothing baked into our capital expenditure guidance for that nor did we feel that that was necessary in order to achieve the earnings growth targets that we provided on our last call."
"Okay, great. And then on the Noranda case any potential for settlement? Or should we just expect this to be litigated like, I mean, what you guys think?","Hey, Paul; this is Warner. Look, big picture: we feel two things about those cases. Number one, about the earnings complaint case, we don't feel it's justiﬁed for our rates to go down, so we look forward to having that discussion before the Missouri Public Service Commission here over the next several months. And then secondly, I think we've been clear that we believe that the rate shift that Noranda is proposing is simply not in the best interest of our customers. And so, you should expect these cases to go before the Missouri Public Service Commission here over the next several months.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay. And then just ﬁnally, the FERC ROE case that you guys touched on, looks like things are just sort of halted there. I'm just wondering if you had any other insight or read tea leaves in any certain way about how that might – or when something might happen there?","This is Maureen Borkowski. We really don't have any particular insight on either what might happen with the MISO case or even watching to see what happens with the New England case. One thing I will say, we were pleased to see the renomination of Commissioner LaFleur, and are also watching to see what happens with the Norman Bay nomination. I certainly think some of those things are things that need to be resolved perhaps, but we're watching it just like you are."
"So ﬁrst quick question, if you will. Under the EIMA there seems to be a certain element of inﬂation permissible. As we're seeing some of the commodity prices recover, how are you seeing your latitude remaining under that mechanism? And if you could remind us a bit, when do we actually kind of true that up and test that, if you will?","Yeah, sure, Julien. Yeah, I think that under the legislation coming up actually here in July of this year, we'll be making a ﬁling to show how rates have been impacted in Illinois across the board   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   in terms of the total customers' bill. And interestingly, what's been happening since we got into the formula rates is the major components of the customers' bill, both the power prices as well as the delivery service component, both of those components have actually been coming down. So we said in our prepared remarks, well, number one, we expect that when we present that to the ICC, which is due again on or before July 31, we're going to show a reduction for our residential customers during that period.  We also had mentioned in our prepared remarks that while we did just ﬁle recently a rate update case that would take eﬀect early in 2015, we still believe even with that increase that the total electric bills for most of our customers will still be below the 2011 levels. So, so far, so good in terms of not only meeting the overall test, if you well, which was a 2.5% compound annual growth rate in total bills, we're actually believe that the bills for our customers are actually down versus where we started."
"Great, thank you very much. I suppose just a second question in light of CSAPR of late, but more broadly, environmental spending, especially focusing here in Missouri at this point, how are you thinking about your exposure A) to coal ash; and then secondarily, to future rounds of regulations 1R, (35:35) SO2, et cetera, what kind of spend are you thinking about in the latter half of the decade as you might tactically shift back to Missouri at some point in time?","Julien, this is Warner. In the bigger picture I think that our team has done a nice job and positioned ourselves well to comply certainly with the existing environmental regulations. We're well positioned to address the MATS rules with these electrostatic precipitators and, as we've said, we're well positioned to address CSAPR.  But we certainly can't predict what the new rules are going to be in the future. And so certainly as the DASH (36:16) rules get ﬁnalized, we will obviously take the steps to comply with them. As we all know, here in June there'll be potentially proposed rules around greenhouse gas regulations. The one thing I will say is that we'll continue to be advocating for responsible energy policies. We will take a very active role within the industry, within the state and federally to try and make sure that we have responsible energy policies that factor in the impacts on customers, the economy and certainly environment. And so with that that's really how we see it is as we sit here right now.     Yeah, Julien, the only other thing I would add – this is Marty, is go ahead and take a look at the 10-K disclosures we've made and we'll update them as appropriate in the 10-Q, though I don't think there's anything major in terms of latter half of the decade changes and estimates for costs. I – the 10-K is probably the best reference in terms of some of those longer-term potential capital expenditures.  And the other thing that I'd just remind you of and everybody else, we'll be also ﬁling an Integrated Resource plan in Missouri later this year, in the October timeframe. And that'll also   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   be a document that you might reference in terms of thoughts on our future generations."
"Great and perhaps just a last quick clariﬁcation of the last question here around Noranda settlement, et cetera. How does the Noranda case ultimately play out in terms of your own upcoming ﬁling? Obviously, the timing of the decision relative to when you ﬁle the Missouri case doesn't exactly coincide. Is there any potential true-up or any impact at all as you think about one versus the other?","Julien; this is Warner. The bottom line is that we intend to ﬁle our electric rate increase request by July 15th, and we will execute that case as planned. We will have these other proceedings going on, and perhaps in parallel, perhaps it'll be consolidated at some point, we simply can't predict. But we know that we will be ﬁling our other electric rate increase requests by mid July."
Do you still expect kind of the merchant costs to whittle away half of those this year?,"Yeah, Paul, this is Marty. You're correct. The guidance we gave at the beginning of the year – last year, we had about $0.18 of parent and other costs. It was both a G&A cost as well as parent interest costs. And our guidance at the beginning of the year was that we would expect to reduce this year down to about $0.10 per share. And we are on target to accomplish that, if not beat that slightly."
"And I know it's less pertinent to you, but what's the update on SB 702?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Paul, the SB 702, this is the property and transmission cost trackers, is that what you're referring to?"
"I have a couple of questions, ﬁrst on Missouri. Can you talk about the rate base in Missouri that is being mentioned in the two cases that are outstanding, the complaint and the earnings – the rate design case and the earnings complaint case versus the amount of rate base addition that might be included in a ﬁling? I'm thinking the work at Labadie, the reactor vessel head that you mentioned at the beginning of the call. I'm just kind of trying to get a picture of how much incremental rate base that is? I know that's capital spending, probably previously disclosed. I'm just not sure of any of the oﬀsets.","Well, Michael, this is Warner. I'll try and take a high-level shot, because you know the fact of the matter, the speciﬁc rate base in the earnings complaint case is still, I would say, a moving target.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   No one really knows the speciﬁc rate base, I think ultimately the ﬁnal test year and true-up period is still under discussion. So we really don't have that.  In terms of the rate design case, rate base may not be as critical a discussion as it would be in the other earnings case. What I would say is this, as we've talked about in our talking points, just in terms of incremental capital additions I mentioned three that are – a few of them that out there. Number one is the Calloway, the reactor vessel head at Calloway. We had the precipitators that are taking place at our Labadie Energy Center. We have a new solar energy facility, which will coming on in the second half of the year. And then we've actually added two new substations downtown.  Those projects alone, I'm not talking about the rest of our projects rate, they alone are about $370 million. And so then you can look at some of the other disclosures that we've had in the past in terms of our rate base may be growing, but those are just some meaningful projects that whether a piece of those will be included in this rate base, but certainly they will be included in our rate case that we'll ﬁle in July."
"And the best way to think about what you'll ﬁle in July is you'll use kind of an ending year 2014 rate base, because you're doing a midyear ﬁling, the known and measurable process, like you kind of true that up?","Yeah, I mean, that's right. We will do a known and measurable process and, historically, what you typically see is a true-up of about six months post that test year. And so obviously, when we think about ﬁling rate cases, we factor all those elements into our thinking, including meaningful rate base additions. And so that's all part of the eﬀective managing of a case process, from our view."
"Got it. One or two other items, on the Illinois side, we've seen a – I mean, the broader markets have seen a pretty decent downdraft from kind of the highs in terms of where the 10-year Treasury was and where the 30-year Treasury yield was. Can you talk about just the earnings sensitivity in Illinois to changes in the 30-year Treasury?","Yeah, sure, Michael. This is Marty. One of the – I'm sorry, a little background noise there, I was distracted. The best way to think about is we've talked before about a 50 basis point (43:35) in Illinois is about $0.025 per share of those electric delivery earnings. So I think that's probably the best thing to think about. Coming into this year with respect to the ROE, we would expect sort of a formula midpoint of about (43:59), which is – we were expecting a 30-year Treasury of about 4.1%. And as we sit here now and based on as we look at our guidance, given Treasury rates – 30-year Treasury to-date plus a Blue Chip consensus estimate as of May 1, we're thinking it could be a little lower than that 4.8% maybe around 3.8%, which would give us an ROI (44:23)   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   about 9.6%. So at that 9.6% versus the 9.9% expected, I mean, again, it's probably about a $0.015 of earnings right there, if that holds."
"Okay. And then just one last question, I'm trying to think through O&M over the next couple of years. Callaway outage in 2014, no Callaway outage in 2015, but one in – I guess and like if you're on an 18-month cycle or 20-month cycle that would imply like second quarter-ish, ﬁrst quarter-ish 2016. Do you incur all of the O&M still in the quarter incurred? Or is there some amortization, meaning, would 2015 beneﬁt because there is no Callaway outage O&M in 2015, but then you'd have it back into 2016?","Yeah, Michael, absolutely, that is about (45:50) 10 months of this fourth quarter of this year. We expect to have another about (45:57) cost for Callaway refueling. Next year, we would not expect to incur those costs. So there's no amortization of the actual cost. We end up reﬂecting those and incurring them in the quarter that they incur. From time to time, and I'm not certainly giving out the 2015 guidance, but we certainly think about our outage schedules with respect to our other fossil-ﬁred generating units too though as we think about year changes in O&M, so there's some variability there as well."
"Got it, okay. Thank you. And one ﬁnal one on Illinois Rivers, how signiﬁcant was the route change? I'm just kind of think about what the kind of directionally, what the capital spending change could potentially be when you re-ﬁle.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, it's not going to be necessarily to re-ﬁle, but we'll provide you – what we're basically saying on the call is that as we go through the year, at some point, we'll give some updated guidance on CapEx. And just wanted to y'all to know we were looking at the overall ﬁnal project plan, timing and capital expenditures for that project.  Overall, as Warner mentioned in his talking points, the route was, I'll call it, marginally longer. There were numerous angles that we're in the ﬁnal plan to accommodate property owners and avoid environmentally sensitive areas. So all of those things we do think put some modest upward pressure on the total cost of the project. But as I said, again, we're working through the ﬁnal project plans, capital expenditure amounts and timing. And as I said, I think in response to a question earlier, what we do then is we'll step back and look at our overall Ameren wide spending plans and allocate capital as we feel appropriate."
"Okay. And can you remind us what was the original capital for that project? And what was the length of the original plan, meaning mileage?","I don't think I have the length of the original plan, but our cost estimates you see in our slides have not been changed, so the cost estimates that you have in the slides are the same cost estimates that we've provided historically. And we're just simply saying that we do expect to be some moderate upward pressure on those cost estimates, and we'll provide updates later on. But – so I don't have the exact change in the miles, but the miles were an impact. But also, like I said, twists and turns to avoid certain properties also had an impact."
"Okay. And given the breadth of the range, hopefully, you'll tighten that up a little bit, perhaps at the next quarter?","Yeah, historically, we'll continue to evaluate it. I think, historically, maybe we tighten it up a little after the second quarter. But really, as I said before, the third quarter is where the bulk of the earnings come. We (52:22) pretty signiﬁcantly after the third quarter.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Sorry, if I missed this earlier. What was your – I think you just touched on this, Marty, though, what was your weather adjusted sales growth by segment?","Yeah. No, I didn't go through that in any detail. In response to the last question, I simply kind of mentioned it. But I think I'll go ahead and go through it in some detail if you'd like. I'd remind you that coming into the year, we did expect that residential and commercial sales would be down about a full 1% and industrial down about 0.7%. And remind you that 1% decline in residential and commercial, really, we expected that to be driven by signiﬁcant investment in energy eﬃciency in Missouri, as well as just sort of national energy eﬃciency lighting standards.  For the quarter, our heating degree days were up about 19% compared to last year, and about 26% compared to normal. And as I said on the call, we estimate both of those had an impact of about $0.07, about $0.07 positive compared to the normal and compared to the prior year. And we weather normalize our residential and commercial sales, they're actually up about 0.8%.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Illinois was really driving that. Illinois residential and commercial sales up, while Missouri was down, which was certainly our expectation that they would be down, given some of the energy eﬃciency spending. But I would say that overall and what I said in the last Q&A was that that was better performance, I would say, in terms of sales growth, both in Illinois and Missouri than had been expected, despite Missouri being down; it was just down less than expected.  Absent the impacts of the energy eﬃciency programs in Missouri, which as I mentioned – I think I mentioned on the prior call, we get recovery and are basically made whole of the impacts of energy eﬃciency investment in Missouri, we actually estimated, excluding those impacts of energy eﬃciency, so both weather normalizing and stripping out the impacts of energy eﬃciency, that the residential and commercial sales in Missouri also would have been up maybe 0.5% or so across the residential and commercial class.  So in overall, David, I think it was a positive. What I said in the last response though is I think for the remainder of the year, we're going to continue to take a cautious approach and take credit for the good performance here in Q1, but not really raise our expectations for the remainder of the year.  I guess a couple of other comments in the sales area. I'd remind you the last year our sales in that residential/commercial were up about 0.6%, which was good. Our customer accounts in Q1 were up about 0.3% in residential and commercial. So there are some good signs there and we'll continue to watch that.  In terms of industrial sales, again, Missouri was up, which was positive. We saw that last year. We saw about 0.3% of increase, nothing huge, but nonetheless a little bit of positive growth in Missouri, which was great. Illinois, as I mentioned in our last call, we continue to see industry struggling there, where we saw our industrial sales down about 2.6%. So that's kind of an update, unless you want more in terms of what we saw in terms of sales."
"And I presume it will be the same in the pending, over earnings complaint?","Well, again, we'll see how that proceeding plays out, but absolutely, we believe that in the process of setting rates that sales levels should be normalized for weather.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Great. And then just your coal stockpiles, I'm just curious what they're looking like right now as we head into shoulder? Or I guess we're in the shoulder season.","Yeah. I would say that we don't typically give out our exact coal pile levels, but..."
