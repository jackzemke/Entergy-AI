Question,Answer
"Excellent. Well, I wanted to ﬁrst ask, obviously you made an announcement about Meramec. I wanted to ﬁrst – with respect to your current contemplated CapEx budget, how does that change anything? Obviously it's pretty long dated. And then secondly, obviously your IRP is still coming up here, but with respect to the balance of your portfolio, and thinking Rush Island or others, how could that eventually shift here as well? How are you thinking about in compliance for those plans?","Sure, Julien. This is Marty; I will start and see if anybody else, Warner, wants to add anything. But with respect to our overall capital expenditure plan that we have laid out for the ﬁve years that was in the slide Warner covered and we've shared previously, really, we don't see any change there, resulting from the Meramec decision. Really there, the Meramec decision in the context of certainly the rate case ﬁling is probably where the biggest impact – where we're looking to shorten up the depreciable life of Meramec to coincide with the expected retirement date of that plant. And you know, that's driving I guess about $17 million of the overall increase we are requesting as part of the Missouri rate case.  But overall, no change in our capital expenditure plans. And I'd say that in terms of how Meramec will impact our future generation resources and plans, as well as other considerations regarding the rest of our ﬂeet, as you point out, will really be laid out as part of our October Integrated Resource Plan ﬁling.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And ,Julien, this is Warner. I think you asked a question about Rush Island. As Marty said, we will talk about the speciﬁcs of our Integrated Resource Plan in October, but in general, our objective is to take our existing coal-ﬁred facilities and utilize them towards the end of the useful lives, which is what we're doing with Meramec, and that's how we would think about Rush Island as well. And so we will be able to spell that out in more speciﬁcity, but we are not contemplating accelerating the retirement of our coal-ﬁred units as part of our Integrated Resource Plan because we think that's in the long-term interest of our customers and the State of Missouri."
"Great. And then, secondly, on FERC, obviously a lot of activity in the quarter. First, could you comment on potentially ﬁling for incentives to the extent to which that the ROE itself gets adjusted here? And then, secondly, from your point of view, what do you perceive the timeline as being for the MISO 206 at this point in time?","This is Maureen Borkowski. Obviously, we can't speculate on either a timeline or any results at FERC. With regard to the question about incentives, we obviously already have certain incentives like QUIP for the Illinois River, Spoon River, and Mark Twain projects. We are also, we believe, entitled to an extra 50 basis points adder that's not included in the 12.38% MISO base rate today. We, in our answer to the complaint that was ﬁeld in November, asked FERC to aﬃrm that we were entitled to that 50 basis points. So obviously to the extent FERC chose to take some action at some point, we believe we are entitled to that adder."
"But just to be clear, when would you ﬁle for that adder? Would that be subsequent to any resolution?","I really can't speculate on that at this point. As I said, we actually did already request FERC to aﬃrm that when we ﬁled our answers. So, to the extent FERC took any action, they may address it at that point."
"Great. Excellent. And then lastly, on ﬁnancing, just at the parent, any updated thoughts on timelines in terms of getting that done and perhaps just more broadly, I'm not sure I heard it, how are you thinking about taking down the parent expense, any updated thoughts there, just post Genco, et cetera?","No, fair question, Julien, but I wouldn't say any updated considerations. I think as we pointed out in our talking points, we were able to utilize commercial paper borrowings in order to   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   handle the maturity of the $425 million parent company debt. Obviously, very low costs there associated with those commercial paper borrowings less than 50 basis points of ongoing costs.  We'll evaluate the need for – and the amount of parent company ﬁnancing -- long-term parent company ﬁnancing, over time, both in terms of considering how much short-term debt we would ideally keep outstanding and then how much long-term funding we would need.  Certainly some of that parent company ﬁnancing right now is really going to support the transmission build out that is occurring. And so longer term, we will be considering whether to issue the – more permanent ﬁnancing at the parent company, or at the Transmission Company level. And that's something that will play out over the next couple of years as we build out that transmission business.  So, may or may not do some parent company long-term ﬁnancing later this year or into next, we'll be evaluating that through time. In terms of other ﬁnancing activities, later this year, we do still plan to issue additional long-term debt at our Ameren Illinois utility company, again there because of the capital expenditures for our electric and gas distribution businesses, but also for some of the transmission growth that we're seeing there as well."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I wondered if you could just give us an update on expected timing for your transmission plans relating to the integration of Entergy into MISO. And just more broadly milestones or other steps we should be on the lookout as you think further about growth in transmission.,"This is Maureen again. Any integration with regard to Entergy has to go through the MISO transmission expansion planning process. We are actively engaged in that with the intent of identifying future projects that might both provide better reliability and integrate Entergy fully into the marketplace, but that has to go through the timeline that MISO has established."
Is there anything speciﬁc in regards to upcoming MISO events or timelines that we should be focused on?,"I would say, at this point in time, the MISO planning process is like a 15-month process, so the one that we're beginning now that we'll be actively studying the transmission opportunities for between Entergy and the rest of MISO would ultimately come to fruition at the end of 2015."
"Okay. Understood. And shifting gears just over to the proposed EPA carbon regulation. Well, you mentioned that, as you looked at it, it appeared to be a fairly unworkable rule as presented. Could you talk a little bit more to the key issues that you see with the proposed EPA regulation?","Yeah. Sure, Stephen. And I would probably put them in probably two or three buckets. I think the most important bucket we should talk about is it's unworkable from a customer standpoint and in terms of the overall signiﬁcant cost increases that they would result in. We have a baseline plan that we have put together as part of our Integrated Resource Planning eﬀort. So our team has been able to really compare what it would take to execute the greenhouse gas proposal compared to our baseline plan. And as we identiﬁed, it would be a signiﬁcant cost increase to our customers.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And that's really driven by some of the – what I would consider, some of the more operational challenges associated with the overall proposal. And you probably have heard and many of my colleagues have been out there talking, doing the same thing about the building blocks and some of the challenges that they have with those.  From our perspective, you look at the plant eﬃciency, building block looking for plant eﬃciencies of approximately 6%, simply put, those aren't achievable. Those aren't achievable. We've taken a lot of eﬃciencies out of the plant. We've already done a lot of those works to try and get an additional 6% is, from our perspective just simply not achievable.  And you think about the uneconomic dispatch of natural gas, which is another key driver of the increase, look, I think you have to think about the gas infrastructure ﬁrst to support that. But then the uneconomic dispatch and whether – frankly states have the ability to dispatch in that way – as you know, the RTOs control that – that's just a tough – it's a tough nut to crack. I'm not sure if that is ultimately going to be fact-based and whether we can execute that.  You look at energy eﬃciency, which we have the largest energy eﬃciency program in the State of Missouri today. To be able to get an incremental 1.5% out of that not only would drive higher costs but certainly no guarantee that customers ultimately would participate at that level.  And then, I would say, lastly, we look even at – at even the renewable piece associated with the building block. And again, in Missouri, in particular, our ability to do renewables is under state law capped by the amount of renewables we can do in terms of impact on customer rates and ultimately the participants.  So you look at those things, all those factors really drive the operational issues that we have, that drive the signiﬁcant cost increases to our customers which, as I said before, not only causes us concerns there, but also in terms of the economic competitiveness of our region and certainly the State of Missouri.  And lastly, but not least, I think when you – there certainly have been – as I said, we expect there could be legal challenges to the rule. There are already. And so, we too share some of those concerns. And so, you put all those things together, we have a rule – when we put it all together that we believe is certainly unworkable in its current form.  As I said too, our objective going forward is to continue to work constructively with key stakeholders, both at the federal and state level, and including consumer groups and others, to make sure, as well as the EPA, to try and put in place energy policies that ultimately – that will allow us to execute our transition plan, which we believe is in the best long-term interest of our customers, but also to ensure that we do the right things in a broadest economic sense for the state and the region."
"Just back on the FERC ROE case, could you can give us a little bit of a ﬂavor of some of the diﬀerences you guys see in your situation versus New England, that might not lead to the same outcome that we saw in New England?","Well, you know, Paul, we laid all those out in testimony, so certainly would refer you there. I mean, I think right now certainly there is more uncertainty, because the FERC really hasn't established any kind of a time line for the MISO case and therefore it's really uncertain when they will take the case up, assuming that they do take the case up. And then, what the data will look like at the time that that data is collected to determine the appropriate range of ROEs to consider. So I'd say the biggest diﬀerence, I would point to is just timing and the uncertainty about when the FERC would potentially take the case up and how that might aﬀect the data that underlies the ROE determination. So I'd say that's the biggest factor."
"Okay. Just to make sure I understand though, have you guys ﬁled anything in response to the – because there is a lot of stuﬀ going on, have you guys ﬁled anything in response to what FERC decided in the New England case or you're just referring to stuﬀ that you ﬁled previously in the back and forth?",I was just referring to things we ﬁled previously in the back and forth.
Okay. I got you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"Hands on that speciﬁcally, we could certainly help you oﬄine. But no, we did not ﬁle anything speciﬁcally as a response or reaction to the New England."
"Okay. Thanks, I'd appreciate that. The second thing is, with respect to the Noranda case, what I am a little bit confused by is why, and I'm talking about the rate design case, why the OPC and these other customer groups seem to be supporting this subsidy, which I would assume to be coming from their customers that they are representing? Do I understand that correctly or am I missing something or could you maybe ﬁll me in on what's going on there?","Hi, this is Michael Moehn. It's hard to speculate honestly. They are certainly representing consumers. As we've argued all along in this case, we don't think it's a good policy, it's not good for our customers because of the way it shifts the costs, and it's hard to speculate why they're doing it. But it absolutely is – it doesn't seem to make sense, and that's why we are absolutely so opposed against it."
"Okay. And then, just two really quick ones. I'm sorry, I missed this, but what was the weather normalized sales growth for Q2? And then, with respect to Noranda, just if the smelter closes, does that change anyway your CapEx plans with respect to load and what have you, because these smelters sometimes use a lot of electricity? I'm wondering, if it closes, does that make, I don't know, does that change what you might need to do with respect to certain plans and stuﬀ?","Sure, Paul, it's Marty, I'll try to take those in reverse order. Certainly not speculating on Noranda's operations and any risk or potential for closure there, but your underlying – the bottom-line question there is, would it aﬀect any of our CapEx plans? And the answer to that is, no. That there wouldn't be any change in our – in the CapEx plans that we have outlined over this ﬁve-year period as a result of that.  Going back to your original question then which was about the sales and the economy. I took your question out of order, because I'll probably give a little more, sort of, lengthy explanation about what we're seeing in terms of sales and the economy. When we started oﬀ the year, you may recall, that we expected sales to be down, residential commercial about 1% and industrial overall down about 0.7%.  Year-to-date, what we are actually seeing on a weather normalized basis is that, our residential and commercial customers are up about 0.5% and the industrial customers are actually down about 1.5% and again, that's Ameren wide. And so, as we think about the remainder of the year,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   we have seen, like I said a little bit more of a positive in terms of residential, commercial, through middle of the year.  So we're factoring that in, but still expecting that, due to the energy eﬃciency programs, as well as federal lighting standards, etcetera that the remainder of the year, we would still expect to see a sales lag the prior year. So overall, we are now expecting about residential and commercial to decline about 0.5% versus our initial beginning of the year guidance of negative 1%.  On the industrial front, we are still seeing to see really manufacturing weakness, particularly in Illinois and so we are expecting there for the full year to see industrial sales down about 1.4%. So those are some of the factors that are going on.  Like I said, we are spending quite a bit on energy eﬃciency and in Illinois we're spending about $85 million this year and Missouri about $50 million this year on energy eﬃciency and that is impacting sales. The programs in Missouri have been ramped up here, just in the past couple of years as a result of our energy eﬃciency program that was approved by the commission.  So we're seeing a pretty material impact there. I mentioned that we saw residential commercial sales year-to-date up about 0.5%. In Missouri, we're actually seeing the residential and commercial sales down about 0.9%, so almost a full percent. But if you back out the eﬀects of the energy eﬃciency programs, it's probably equivalent to about 1% of actual sales growth. So I guess what I'm trying to communicate there is, absent the energy eﬃciency spending that we've got, we are actually seeing pretty good growth in residential and commercial sales both in Missouri and Illinois, and, of course, we are compensated for the energy eﬃciency impacts in Missouri.  On the industrial front, I mentioned that Illinois sales were down year-to-date, they're down, as we talked about in the call, almost 3%. In Missouri, we're actually seeing some continued expansion in terms of industrial sales where we're seeing those sales up about 0.5%, and there is some impact there, again, from energy eﬃciency. They're probably up a full percent, backing out the impacts of energy eﬃciency. So we're continuing to see some good expansion of our industrial sales in Missouri.  And, I guess, my last point on all this is, I do think that sort of reﬂects what we're seeing in the overall economy in the two states. We're seeing an uptick in I'd say services jobs and manufacturing jobs in Missouri; seeing about ﬂat kind of trend in services jobs in Illinois, a little bit of decline in manufacturing jobs. And that's kind of what we're seeing in the two states in both in terms of sales and in terms of jobs."
"Hey, guys. A couple of easy ones and then one on the Missouri rate case. Marty, you made some comments about O&M in the second half of the year, outside of the Callaway outage, the $0.10 impact in the fourth quarter and that's more of just a timing issue, what else is impacting O&M and is it up more than 1% or 2%?","Paul, it's – not Paul, I apologize. It's Michael, I apologize, and good morning to you. Yeah, just in terms of the O&M, we did comment on that. It's just general growth across the business in terms of our distribution business, our generation portfolio as well as just other areas like increasing property taxes and the like. So we're kind of seeing growth across those areas this year. I don't have anything in terms of overall percentages for you. But as we think about the rate case and the rate case that we ﬁled in Missouri, certainly those costs are ticked up. So the test year has an update period out through December 31. And as it relates to signiﬁcant drivers of, say, fuel costs or other elements of O&M, it actually will reach out and pick up, say, January 1 kinds of cost increases.  So those things are built-in and I point out in our discussion of our rate case ﬁling that overall we're actually seeing sort of – while there's a rate increase being requested, that's net of about a $67 million reduction in operations and maintenance costs. So in that two-and-a-half-year period from the last rate case to this rate case, while there have been some elements of cost increase net, we've been able to use continuous improvement eﬀorts to drive costs out of the business, and that's reﬂected in the rate case."
"Okay. And I wanted to ask a little bit about the rate case only because I thumbed through some of the detail earlier. As I kind of think about the Missouri business – and please correct me if I'm using wrong data here, kind of a $7.6 billion, $7.7 billion of total rate base for next year. If you use kind of the authorized equity layers in the very low 50% range and kind of the ROEs that the Commission has given over the last one or two cases kind of around 10% or so, you kind of get close to about $400 million of authorized net income. And if I look backwards a little bit like 2012 or 2013, your UE segment kind of reported net income in that level. So I wanted to think about what's driving the actual need for the case. Just kind of back of the envelope rate base math would imply you are not too far oﬀ from actually earning your authorized, and it may have been yet abnormal weather in some of those years or abnormally low costs that are now creeping up a bit. I wasn't really sure I understood the puts and takes.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, Michael, I would say without knowing exactly what years you're looking at, certainly prior years' earnings, when you pick them up on an as-reported basis, certainly do reﬂect ﬂuctuations for things like weather, for the timing of Calloway outages. So certainly you can't really look at a calendar year earnings and assume those are sort of normalized and apples-to-apples for what might be achievable in a diﬀerent year.  As it relates to the rate case itself and your earnings drivers, I mean, I think you were picking up the right things overall. If you refer to slide 15 in our slide deck, we've outlined the drivers of our current rate case, and we've shown there what we expect rate base to be at the end of this year, around $7.3 billion. We talked about the equity ratio we expect for the end of this year, 51.6%. Those are the real drivers, of course, of the earnings levels. And then as part of the rate case process, you normalize the cost levels and sales levels, and things of that sort. But the real driver over time in terms of earnings, of course, is your rate base and the amount of rate base supported by your equity and your capital structure.  And as part of this rate case, just going from the last rate case to this rate case, is a result of a $1.5 billion or so of spending. Our right base has actually increased about $500 million from the last rate case to this rate case. That's a real driver of increased earnings in Missouri over time."
"Got it. Okay. I will follow up oﬄine. Thanks, Marty. Much appreciate. And congrats on a goods quarter.","All right. Michael, thank you.     Thanks, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from Andy Bischof with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi. Good morning. Any update on the Missouri legislative front in terms of reform on reducing regulatory lag, among other things?","No real update for you. I refer back to our last quarter's call and the transcript there, where we were sort of right at the end of the legislative session, and I think provided pretty full comments about the situation there. I think as we go through time, I think as we've talked about, we will   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   continue to work to educate all stakeholders in the state about the need for and the importance of investment in our aging infrastructure in Missouri. And in months like this, like any other time of the year, but particularly between active legislative sessions, we are certainly doing our best to continue to make sure that we are doing the right outreach with stakeholders and education about the importance of good strong energy policy for the State of Missouri."
And I appreciate the comments on the sales discussion. How are customer count numbers looking in the quarter?,"Yeah. We continue to look at those. Our residential and commercial accounts in Missouri were actually up. If I talked about last time, they were up slightly, so less than 0.5%. But nonetheless, residential and commercial accounts were up. And I think that's a positive.  Over in Illinois, residential accounts were down a little bit. So again, just a small amount, less than 0.5%, but we did see commercial customer counts actually grow by 0.7%. So overall, I think those are good trends. They are positive.  If you want, I'll talk a little bit about the industrial sales I mentioned in Missouri that they're up. I mean, in terms of industrial sales, I mentioned about 0.5%. We are seeing good robust growth in areas like cements, automotive, food and agriculture, those kinds of industrial customers. And so that is encouraging to see that industrial sales growth. It's encouraging to see jobs grow and it's encouraging to see the customer counts go up. I think all of those things seem to be moving in a positive direction.  And in Illinois, like I mentioned, industrial sales have been down. It's more there in the steels and metals, heavy equipment manufacturing, those are some of the industries that have seen declines in sales. But as I mentioned, not much of an impact right now on residential customer counts, down just a little. It's certainly encouraging to see commercial accounts still continue to grow."
