Question,Answer
"A couple of quick questions here, ﬁrst just on supply chain, are you seeing any impacts on the renewable side, especially as we think about the 2.4 gigs. I mean, we've seen a few of your peers shift megawatts out either from panel shortages or other sort of supply chain disruptions. Any thoughts here? Any materials locked in and procured and if this isn't transitory since you guys are essentially swapping megawatts for megawatts, as we think about renewables versus coal, could any revenue any project delays cause an impact to sort of the coal retirement timelines, especially as we're thinking about Sioux?","Hey, Shar. Yeah, this is Marty. Let me take that one on supply chain as it relates to renewables and then perhaps Michael can comment on supply chain or issues more broadly. First of all, I'd say that as we went through last year, we had hoped by the end of the year to have announced some renewable projects. As you saw, we just announced one this week, which we're excited about. I would say it's a start in terms of the renewable projects that we hope to get announced and delivered in the 2024 to 2026 timeframe.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   But to your point, some of the negotiations last fall and into the winter were I would just say slowed by supply chain issues, tariﬀ issues, some of the inﬂationary pressure seeing in the renewable space which simply meant that it was taking a little longer to work through some of the contractual negotiations, but we were able to get that ﬁrst project announced. We are still expecting this year to announce other projects.  And we'll see whether these things are transitory or not, but again some of the bigger bulk of the projects we're trying to get done are out there in that 2024 to 2026 timeframe. So certainly time for some of those issues to settle down. Ultimately, whether that has any impact on longer- term, our scheduled coal retirement at Sioux will remain to be seen as you know, especially in light of the accelerated closure of Rush Island.  We plan to update our integrated resource plan in the ﬁrst half of this year and so as we do that, we'll be taking into consideration some of the observations -- more recent observations we have on the renewable market, the timing of expected projects there as well as just the broader dynamics associated with reliability of our system long-term and providing updates in there.  So it really be premature to say whether there is any impact on the retirement date of Sioux, but again, we're continuing to work with developers on these renewable projects and do you expect to have further announcements this year. As I did indicate on the prepared remarks, to the extent that we have additional projects to be approved by the commission, we anticipate ﬁling those CCNs after we ﬁle the update to the Integrated Resource Plan because that Integrated Resource Plan provides a good backdrop for the commission to consider the approval of the CCNs. Michael, any other comments broadly on supply chain?     No Marty. No, that was pretty comprehensive. Nothing material to add to that answer. Shar, do you have something else?"
"Yeah, terriﬁc. And just one last one is, I know this is maybe a little bit of a perennial topic at this point, but any thoughts on sort of the potential end of QIP in Illinois. I mean it seems like eﬀorts to eliminate it are getting a little bit noisy again, but it's also scheduled to expire in '23. Could we see an extended? Would it change one way or another have any impact on your updated plan to invest about $1.8 billion between now and '26. Thank you.","Yes, Shar, terriﬁc question. You know that the QIP gas business in Illinois has been really I think a terriﬁc rider for the beneﬁt of customers. It's really allowed us to do a lot of projects in Illinois as much as 50% of our capital expenditures is replacing underground pipes, et cetera, to improve the safety and reliability of our gas system. So it's been a good rider.  Certainly can't predict whether any legislative eﬀort to me to ended prematurely will be successful or not. As you said, its already scheduled to expire at the end of 2023. So look, it's   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   been a good rider. We'd love to see it extended. We'd love to see perhaps some other mechanism go in its place that would be similarly beneﬁcial.  But ultimately, we do have in the gas business in Illinois a favorable foundation for rate-making, which is a forward test year with other good features like decoupling. So look, as we move forward, we'll continue to see whether there is either an extension of the QIP or perhaps something else that goes in its place, but ultimately, we can reassess both not only the projects that we've got, but also the timing of rate reviews and the like.  At the end of the day, we feel like the projects that we're doing there and the projects we have plan there are great for our customers, great for the communities and we'll look for a path forward to making those investments."
"Hey, good morning team. Thank you for taking my question. On the 6% to 8% growth rate target. I mean, obviously, it looks like there's a ton of upside CapEx potential whether it's the Rush Island related CapEx, the MISO transmission CapEx and there may be an ROE bump in future years from the SB2408 in Illinois, what are you assuming in that 6% to 8% growth rate target in terms of these upside opportunities?","Well, again, I think that you've summarized it well. At the end of the day, we've got $17.3 billion of planned capital expenditures over four quality jurisdictions. We expect that to drive 7% compound annual rate base growth and really that is the foundational driver of our 6% to 8% planned EPS CAGR over this period of time, but you also pointed out some additional opportunities we have, and those are speciﬁcally in the areas of renewable generation as well as some of these regional regionally beneﬁcial transmission projects and those represent potential additions to the capital expenditure plans in the rate base growth.  So those are the things that you highlighted are the things that give us conﬁdence not only in our ability to execute the $17.3 billion and the 7% rate base growth, but certainly conviction around that 6% to 8% EPS growth target.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      The only thing I would add to that -- Marty's really comprehensive answer is with respect to Illinois, we kind of move through this new process there in terms of opting into the multi-year plan. I think we'll continue to step back and assess the opportunities there. There obviously is a tremendous amount of projects that are need to get done on the beneﬁt of customers. We've made some great progress there but there's just a lot of aging infrastructure. So as you know we've been pulling that CapEx down a little bit over time just because some of those returns and so we'll assess that too as an opportunity, but Marty certainly highlighted the big ones.     Thanks, Michael."
"Got it. Thanks guys. And then maybe, can I just follow up on the whole staﬀ and commission review of the Rush Island retirement and generation needs to ﬁll that hole. What are sort of the key milestones for us to watch there in terms of like the next steps that we should be watching for and then what are the end outcome you think of that review process? Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So I think as it relates to Rush Island, we'll be continuing to work with the District Court in terms of the plans forward for the ultimate retirement date of Rush Island. As we shared in our prepared remarks, there was a preliminary assessment done by MISO related to the closure of Rush Island, which really determined that there were upgrades and additional investments needed to for voltage support and longer-term reliability of the system in light of that planned closure.  And so now will be moving forward with ﬁling an Attachment Y soon, which will be more of a formal assessment. The preliminary assessment is done. The formal assessment will be done and then once we've done that, we have to determine what the right investments are to be made on the system and get those planned and approved and executed over time.  So some of the milestones to watch there, the MISO Y ﬁling as well as decisions coming from the District Court around the retirement of that plant. So those are some things in that regard now speciﬁcally in terms of the staﬀ review, like I said, what they're looking to do here I think is really get a deeper understanding of the decision to close Rush Island as well as these reliability impacts that I've been talking about. Rush Island, as you know, is a 1,200-megawatt plant. It's been highly reliable. It's been low cost and provided great value to our customers over time.  So in terms of their review, they'll be conducting that. There is going to be -- the commission has asked them to ﬁle a preliminary report around April 15, but there's really no deadline on any kind of a ﬁnal report from the Commission staﬀ and then we also at the Commission's request, will be providing monthly status updates in terms of the progress towards closure of Rush   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Island and I think importantly too, what we're doing from a reliability standpoint associated with that. So those are some of the milestones to look for."
"Yeah, thank you, guys. Appreciate the time. Congrats on a solid quarter.","Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Hi, good morning.     Good morning.  Operator  Just wanted to build oﬀ on some of those questions there. Just wondering if you could frame with regards to the Missouri IRP, MTEP process for Rush Island and just when could this be pulled into the plan. When do you think this could materialize and how do we think about I guess potential incremental equity needs should this come in. Just trying to get the size of CapEx timing and incremental equity, how that might balance out?     Yeah. Jeremy is Marty. I'll start and I'm sure Michael will add-on to this as well, but a couple of things as we laid out, again, in the IRP, we really expect that that will get ﬁled in the ﬁrst half of this year and importantly there, we'll be considering, like I said, the early retirement of Rush Island, any updates to our renewable expansion plans, investments needed in the transmission system as well, doing a comprehensive update of that Integrated Resource Plan.  So through that certainly you'll get an idea of some of the updated thoughts in terms of additional investments that may be required. Also, as you mentioned, and we mentioned in our prepared remarks. We do expect that the MISO will end up improving some of the projects that will move us towards that Future 1 plan that they've got out there and we expect that that again too is going to occur by mid this year.  Pre premature to say the size of the portfolio of projects that MISO will approve in this tranche one that we expect to get approved midyear or the size of the allocation of projects to us, but that's going to be another key milestone as we look ahead to this year in terms of identifying additional potential investments that we'll have longer-term. So with that, mid-year, we should get some greater visibility I suspect in terms of some of those potential projects and then I think   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   as a team, we'll have to step back and assess those projects and decide ultimately which of those becomes additive to our plan and in what years and how we move forward with execution. Michael, you want to tackle some of those other questions.     Yeah, perfect, Marty. I think that's well said. I mean just in terms of, Jeremy, we said this before, we just don't want to get in front of the regulatory process in that and we'll just continue to assess these over time and as we make that determination and ﬁgure out sort of what is incremental to the plan that's when we would step back and look at what our ﬁnancing needs would be with respect to that. As we've said in the past, we like our ratings where they are today, we're very focused on our metrics.  We're targeting this capitalization ratio of about 45% equity over the balance of the plan. That's really what's driven the $300 million that we have in there today, and again, it would kind of be just on case speciﬁc basis. I wouldn't see us deviating much from that honestly. So I mean if that gives you any indication on how we think about the ﬁnancing that's going forward, but we would assess it at that point in time. So hope that helps.  Operator  That's very helpful on that much on the equity side. That's great to hear. And then just from a transmission perspective, can you give any sense of the size and scope of the reliability needs around Rush Island's closure. Just wondering, any thoughts you could provide there?     Yeah eally hard to at this point, you know we're in those early stages like I said, through the preliminary assessment that MISO did is clear the transmission upgrades, are going to be needed both for voltage support as well as to ensure long-term reliability of the system. So clearly some transmission investment needs there, but it's premature to say exactly what those will be eﬀorts along those lines given the preliminary assessment are already underway to determine some of those things, but ultimately it will be a process working with MISO in particular to determine what those needs will be and how much of an investment will be required there.  Operator  Great, that's helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.     Thanks for the questions.  Operator  Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
So just on the Missouri legislation that you have there. Just wondering sort of what the practical impact from a shareholder perspective might be if you guys have that and also what's the reason from going from a 2.85% cap to a 2.5% cap. Is that just part sort of the give and take of legislation or is there something that speciﬁcally's happening that's causing people want to that?,"Yes, Paul, good questions. Look, as it relates to this legislation, ﬁrst of all, this plant and service accounting, we call it Missouri Smart Energy Plan, has been working really well for customers. It's really allowed us to make signiﬁcant additional investment in our system. We talked early on in the call about how that's just driving higher reliability. It's allowed us to deploy clean energy. It's really doing good things for the economy. We've created a lot of jobs and at the same time, been able to keep rates very low for customers.  So it's really been working extremely well and what this legislation is all about is just making sure that we have a sustainable long-term framework to support continuation of those eﬀorts. So it's really all about longevity of what the legislature put in place several years ago. So that's what it's all about. You see some of the features we laid out in the slides, removes the sunset from from the plan which would be good, improves longevity to begin with, improves the economic development incentives, which have been really great for attracting businesses and helping businesses expand in our state. So it's improvement there.  What the cap speciﬁcally is all about is today as you see there is a cap on the overall growth in rates -- total rates. What we're saying here is that it would be better to have a cap, which is a good consumer protection, a cap, but it would be on the impact of these deferrals, the piece of deferrals that were really directed by that legislation and so that too I think improves the longevity of the ability to utilize and this great regulatory framework long-term."
"So it's not a real sunset. I mean, so I mean, I guess it will be at the discretion of the commission as opposed to having it let -- sort of legislatively in place, is that the way to think of it?","Yes, it's the right way to think about it. That's right. And that's why I wanted to clarify my thoughts you'd use the word sunset and I'd responded, but it's not a hard stop, just a checking point, if you will, to go back to the commission and re-up for another ﬁve years, but you're absolutely right in the way you've characterized the legislation, which would be more of a steady state going forward.     And Paul, this is Michael. I mean, if we were to do that opt in and then everything that sort of exists today from our cap structure, all of that will continue to apply going forward, it's in the commission has the ability to do extended but not modify it in anyway, just to be clear."
"And then on the coal, any thought about what the and I apologize if I missed this, what the total number in terms of the EPA impact might be and also, is that, how would that be treated regulatory speaking. Is that something that could be securitized or just how should we think about any potential coal ash cleanup expense.","No, you know, Paul, there's really no -- we weren't really talking about coal ash cleanup expenses. It's really modiﬁcations to the impoundments that we have at these power plants in order to be able to continue to dispose of either ash or residuals coming out of our scrubbing. So again, what we said on the call there is really don't expect to have any material impact from the EPA's decision, part of it related to Meramec which we have plans to close at the end of   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   2022 and then the other potential impact was that our Sioux Energy Center and we are working through options which we believe will ultimately mean that there is no signiﬁcant impact in terms of the EPA's recent ruling.     Yeah, it's all right and then, Paul.     Yeah, it would just be."
"Okay, so in other words the impoundment improvements really aren't going to be all that costly, is that right?","Correct. It would just be a typical capital project that we would recover in the normal course of a rate review. Yeah, correct, itis not going to be an overly material number as we sit here today."
"Well, that's very good. Okay, awesome. Thanks so much guys and congratulations again.","All right, thanks.  Operator  Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question."
"Thanks for the time. Sorry for being late. Just with respect to the comments on Jeremy's question earlier I want to go back, if I can just understand the cadence of some of these updates. If I hear you guys right now with respect to Rush Island and some of the MISO agreements in principle that you have, you could be in a position to at least update some of the transmission spending earlier than perhaps say some of the increments of renewables here. Can you talk about the timeline here.  I mean, you've got Attachment Y coming pretty soon it would seem. If this agreement translates as you say Stage 1 in mid-2022, could you be in a position to look at kind of a more holistic view on transmission by say November EEI timeframe. Just curious if you can elaborate a little bit   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   more on how that comes together and to what extent. It seems like there is an overlap in what you would be doing from a transmission perspective and what ultimately transpires around Rush Island or do you need to really wait for the full IRP process to play itself out prior to knowing what that transmission spend looks like?","Yeah. Julien, obviously you had a lot of topics in that question and there are a bunch of moving parts. I think number one, like you said on Rush Island, we'll let this MISO Y play out, but even if they come back pretty quickly on the MISO Y and again conﬁrm that transmission investments are needed for both voltage support and long-term reliability, still then there'll be a process to determine what exactly those investments are and over what time period they'll be made. I can't give you an exact timeline in terms of one will have clarity on all of that, but that's item number one. Item number two is the MISO actually approving projects as part of their Midwest region tranche one approval process and like I said, we do expect that will occur around mid-year.  And so there we should get some clarity in terms of what projects of that portfolio would be ours to do and we can begin assessing how we'll go about executing those and when those would be added to our plan. So we'll get some clarity there as well. And then with respect to the IRP again timeline there is again around the middle of the year, we said ﬁrst half of this year. There is a little bit of dependency there, we'd certainly like to have clarity in terms of when transmission investments could be made when Rush Island will actually be closing. And so we expect that over the course of this next six months, we should be able to have working with the District Court MISO et cetera get some clarity on that.  So all of those I think things will come to fruition likely in the ﬁrst half of this year. We should get a lot of information, which we'll certainly be able to discuss I think on our second quarter call. We'll have a lot of information there. Whether we update or not at EEI hard to say. What traditionally we've done and we discussed this earlier step back, look at all these additional projects, look at the prioritization within our overall plan consider which of those projects we can get done, which of those are going to be additive, et cetera how we're going to ﬁnance it. Typically, we've laid that out on our fourth quarter call, but again, we should be able to provide I think a pretty comprehensive update on where things stand at the end of the second quarter and going into the EEI. Michael, any additional thoughts there? No, Marty. That's good."
"Awesome guys. Thank you. And a quick clariﬁcation from Paul's question. Just with respect to the QIP. Obviously, you've laid out your gas CapEx expectations through the full period here including the I'm going to use the word sunset. I guess that's not entirely appropriate. How do you think about whether or not that's extended and how that impacts your CapEx budget. I understand it impacts the recovery mechanisms and timing there in, but it presumably does not impact your CapEx one way or another.","That's right. I mean look CapEx is important CapEx and needs to be done on behalf of customers. While it is a step back, I think, as Marty said in his answer and look at if that was not   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   in place, how we ﬁle rate reviews and those types of things but look, this is needed CapEx that's driving reliability improvements for customers, safety improvement for customers et cetera."
"Got it. All right, excellent. Guys, I'll leave it there. Sorry, you were going to say something?","No, I was going to say thanks, Julien. I appreciate the questions."
Thank you.  Operator  We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Marty Lyons for closing comments.,"Great. Well, hey, I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for joining us today. As you can see, we had a really strong 2021 and we remain very, very focused on delivering again in 2022 and beyond for our customers, our communities, and for all of you, our shareholders. So with that, please be safe and we look forward to seeing many of you in person over the coming months.  Operator  This concludes today's conference.
