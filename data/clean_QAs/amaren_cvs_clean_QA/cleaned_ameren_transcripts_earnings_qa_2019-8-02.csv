Question,Answer
"So, maybe just to kick things oﬀ, if I can, I'd love to go back to your comments, Warner, on the terminated agreement with EDF and how you think about next steps. And also just to make sure that you've secured your interconnection upgrade costs and ﬁrm those up on the other projects as well. Do you think this was very much isolated to this project, or is this kind of a wider theme that you're seeing in the MISO footprint?","Yeah. Thanks, Julien. So, a couple things. Number one, yes, with regard to the two projects that we have, the 400 megawatt project and the 300 megawatt project, we have the ﬁnal interconnection costs done. And that was not the case with the EDF, that was only in the second stage. So, now those other two are done. So now keep in mind for the 400 megawatt project, we have the CCN already and so well positioned. We can move forward on that. We still have to get the interconnection agreement, but we expect that by the fall. And so we don't see any major issues with that.  With the 300 megawatt project, as you heard me say, we're real pleased to get a non- unanimous stipulation with the Missouri Public Service Commission staﬀ. And so we're well positioned to have the review by the Missouri Public Service Commission and we look forward   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   to having that and hopefully a decision by October. So as I step back and look at where we're at with the 700 megawatts that we have in place, I think we're very well positioned to get the necessary regulatory approvals and to begin construction in those projects and to get them all in service by the end of 2020."
"Got it. And just to clarify here with respect to the initial project that was terminated. Is it your expectation that you go back to try to ﬁnd an alternative project, restructure this project somehow to address some of the transmission costs, however, that might ever be possible? Or perhaps just forgo it altogether because obviously, as you said, you're ahead of the plan as you initially described anyway?","Yeah. So good question, Julien. So look, the bottom line is that with the 700 megawatts now that we have announced, we are in compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard and so we're well positioned. And in fact, that's consistent with what we said at the outset of these conversation and consistent with our integrated resource plan.  But like I also said, we continue to look at renewable energy investment opportunities and I mentioned the Renewable Choice Program. Certainly, we will ﬁle an updated integrated resource plan next year. So, we're not done kicking the tire renewable energy project is my message. But with regard to the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard, where we will be in compliance with these two projects that we plan on executing next year."
"Got it. And if you permit me just a follow-up here. With respect to transmission once more, we've seen some interesting headlines thus far on MISO 2019 plans and where those budgets are coming in. Also, still September we are going to see the next round of the draft MSEP 20. How are you thinking about altogether transmission spending trajectory, if you can comment at least initially on some of the procedures?","Look, as I sit here today, obviously, and with regard to the other project, can't speak to the other projects. And I can speak to ours. And as I said a moment ago, all the two projects that we've got across the ﬁnish line, they are in line with what our estimates were. We certainly don't have visibility to all the projects that are going on in the system. That's certainly something that MISO has the visibility.  But what I will say, when you talk about broader transmission and you think about all the interconnection agreements and all the things going on here, I do continue to say and believe that when you look to the long term, that there is an opportunity for us as a system in MISO to look at multi-value projects to try and address the transmission matters and issues that we see today and the continued desire to put more renewable energy generation on our system.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So, this is an area of focus, as Shawn Schukar and all of our team are working with MISO and many others to be thinking about, we have to get through these interconnection agreements today. We need to be thinking about those multi-value projects down the road because that's what's going to enhance our overall system prospectively."
"Great. Another MVP. Excellent. Well, thank you there. I'll leave there.","Thank you, Julian.  Operator  Our next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Greg. Greg, you there?  Operator  Greg, are you muted? Greg, you are live with our speaker.     Why don't we go to the next question if Greg can get back in the queue. If he jumps back on, please.  Operator  Okay. Our next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning."
"Thank you. Good morning. To go back to your comments, I just want to clarify -- want to make sure I understand regarding the potential solar/battery facilities. Is that something that new -- something new that you guys are considering for the CCN? And again, it seems like the timing that you talked about at the end of 2020 kind of matches up with the last 157 megawatts of the other win, but is this potentially to serve as an oﬀset to your plans?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","And so, I'm going to let Michael Moehn talk about this exciting project. And so, Michael, I know is part of your Smart Energy Plan. So, who don't you talk a little bit about the beneﬁts that this is going to bring the customers?     Perfect. Thanks, Warner. Good morning. Yeah. So, really these three projects that Warner referred to these battery plus storage facilities, there are three projects across the Missouri footprint and they really are focused primarily on reliability enhancement. So, we are making these investments in lieu of investments that we would need to make in substations, et cetera, to enhance the reliability on that system.  There will be some environmental beneﬁts associated with them and will have some renewable energy credits that come as part of the solar projects. So, I mean they -- we will account for those, but they really are being driven by economics and reliability thing. We're excited about them. So hopefully, more to come there. But as Warner said, we're going to be ﬁling those CCN very, very soon for those three projects.     So, Insoo, you also had a question in there as to whether this was incremental to our existing point. They are not incremental. They have been part of our ﬁve-year plan, part of the Smart Energy Plan. We've mentioned these projects as part of our comments because these are innovative technology projects that we're doing on behalf of our customers and certainly have a part in the renewable energy space as well. So..     So yeah, I think, just one important note on the 15% requirement that we have as part of the Missouri Renewable Standard. There is a 2% requirement for solar as well, 2% of that 15%. So, these will go to satisfy some of that as well."
"Good morning.  First question. Can you, Marty, give us any more insight to your thinking on how you're planning to fund the wind acquisitions next year? Should we assume for planning purposes that the ﬁnancing will be next year? Or any thoughts to any kind of a forward component to get that oﬀ the table today? Just what's your latest thoughts there?","Sure, Ali. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Overall, I have to say our ﬁnancing plans haven't really changed from what we communicated to you and others on the February call and then again on the May call. In the February call, you'll recall that we laid out our $13.3 billion ﬁve- year capital expenditure plan that included about a, at that time $1 billion for wind today. As you heard on the call, looks like $1.2 billion of wind and you also heard, we do feel conﬁdent about those projects.  We said at that time, of course, and we reiterated, may I should say, that our ﬁnancing plan included equity issuances under our DRIP and our employee beneﬁt plans of about $100 million a year and the issuance of common equity to fund a portion of Ameren Missouri's wind acquisitions. We believe those two sources of equity, Ali, will allow us to fund the capital expenditure plan while maintaining approximately the same capitalization levels we have currently and our current credit ratings, which as you know, we've worked hard to achieve.  So sifting through all that and answer your question, I would say that other than the DRIP and employee beneﬁt plan issuances and with respect to our current capital expenditure plans, we have no plan to equity -- external equity needs, other than for these wind projects, which are expected to close next year in the fourth quarter of 2020. So with respect to your question about options, we do have options in terms of accessing the equity markets. We're clearly aware of the where -- aware of the ways our peer utilities have approached the equity markets. We are monitoring market conditions and ultimately, we will move forward to a manner that we think is most appropriate given the funding need. So -- and I think that's -- that's what we've got to say on it. I don't think I'll comment beyond that, but we recognize the options that we have before us."
"All right. And Marty, can you also remind us, do you still believe there is a further debt capacity at the parent or holding company level at this stage for Ameren?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Look, we've laid out the ﬁnancing plans that we have. I think you're aware of the credit ratings that we have overall and where the thresholds are. And we've talked about that on prior calls. Moody's, we have a BBB plus and FFO to debt threshold of 13%. At Moody's Baa1, the thresholds a little bit higher there with a CFO pre-working capital to debt of 17%. And so a little bit, I would say less cushion there with respect to the Moody's rating.  So, we're conscious of that. We watch where the credit metrics are. We like those credit ratings. We'd like to hold those credit ratings. And we think about other factors, maintaining a strong balance sheet, positioning these various investments like the wind for success in the regulatory environments. And ultimately, all of that led us to the conclusions that we've reached and communicated earlier this year. And as I just repeated that, overall, we want to keep our capitalization levels approximately where they're at today at all of our legal entities. And we do plan to fund a portion of these wind investments with equity and we think that's the right balance overall."
"Got it. And my second question related to the $13.3 billion ﬁve-year plan. I know in the past, you all have talked about that the Missouri legislation incentive that there was more CapEx potentially you could spend. There was more need for CapEx at Missouri. And I'm just wondering, when is the next time you all will update us on the CapEx plans? And should we assume that there is potentially upside to this plan that currently is at $13.3 billion?","Well, this is Marty. And I'll start oﬀ in case others want to jump in. But I would say that traditionally, we update our long-term capital expenditure plans in February on our year-end call. As I -- we noted on this call, we put out a $13.3 billion plan this past February that included $1 billion for wind. Now, we stand at $1.2 billion. So logically we'd include that in February. And then with respect to further grid modernization, we'll continue to assess that.  As you know last year when we rolled forward our ﬁve-year plan, we updated our capital expenditures across the board notably in Missouri, increased our capital expenditure plan, excluding the wind about $1.5 billion versus the prior ﬁve-year plan. So, we've incorporated a considerable amount of incremental infrastructure spending in that plan. But you're absolutely right. In terms of that $1.5 billion, that was only a percentage, a fraction of the overall potential incremental capital expenditure that we can make at Ameren Missouri over time. So, I don't want to speculate today on what we may or may not add next February. But clearly, we have a very large infrastructure investment pipeline and some great projects incremental to those that we've already put in the current ﬁve-year plan, incremental projects that we think would bring great value to our customers."
"Yeah. Yeah. So, I know you did talk about the energy infrastructure legislation that I guess has been tabled into potentially the veto session coming up in the fall. Can you talk about what it is that, that you speciﬁcally would like to see that legislation accomplish if it does get considered? And then also Vistra had their earnings call earlier today and they've made a proposal with regards to a coal, to solar plant that I think is the, basically, impacts the assets that you sold Dynegy all those years ago.  How do you see that, even though it doesn't have a, obviously, a direct ﬁnancial impact to Ameren's P&L, how do you see that proposal? Do you think it's beneﬁcial overall to your customers? Would you be supportive of it or any other comments you might want to give us on that topic?","Sure. Thanks, Greg. This is Warner. So look, I think we've been clear and we'll continue to be clear that our focus has been and will continue to be on passing the grid modernization legislation that supports the extension of formula rates through 2032. You heard me talk on the call about the signiﬁcant beneﬁts that it's brought to Illinois in terms of investment, reliability, jobs and still aﬀordable. And so we think -- and this is why this has been extended twice and that's why it's received such favorable votes in the committees in both the Senate and the House. And we're hopeful that the legislature takes it up because we think it would be a good thing for the State of Illinois for many years to come. So, that's going to continue to be our primary focus.  There is no doubt that there are several other legislative proposals being looked at in the State of Illinois, very comprehensive, very complex. And so the only thing I can say is that Richard Mark and his team are at the table, speaking with all these stakeholders, trying to sort through all the details including Vistra's proposal. So it would be premature for me to speculate just exactly where those proposals are, all the pros and the cons. The only thing I can tell you is that they are complicated, they're complex, they're big bills. But that doesn't mean that they won't be considered either in a veto session next year. The only thing rest assured, we're at the table.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"So a couple of questions if I may. First, I wanted to follow up on the solar plus battery projects that you discussed. And I was wondering if you looked at other applications of battery storage technology at this point maybe replacing peaking generation capacity or you've even addressed in one of some of those transmission interconnection issues that you discussed. Is that the potential solution to transmission interconnection costs?","So Michael, why don't you talk a little bit about this innovative project that we're doing in Missouri and then we can talk a little bit more. Shawn, you can weigh in on some of the things on the transmission side.     Yeah. Again, these are exclusively focused on the distribution side. So again, looked and found places within our system that we need to make some reliability enhancements and combining these two projects together to make those reliability improvements in lieu of traditional sort of substation investments. My sense is -- and Shawn can comment on this with respect to whether those kind of applications are available on the transmission side as well.     Yeah. This is Shawn. On the transmission side, we do look across the system to see where are alternatives just like Michael was describing on the distribution side and continue to look for   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   those as we look for solutions to enable both reliability improvements on the system and those generating -- generator interconnection.     And so, look, the bottom line is energy storage is something that we as a company look very carefully at, for a variety of diﬀerent reasons. And we're pleased that we'll look forward to having a conversation with the stakeholders in Missouri on this Missouri project and we're going to continue to kick the tires on energy storage product because as I think, we all know, the cost continue to come down in various applications. And so we'll continue to put our innovative eﬀorts forward to see if we can actually do some of these projects for the beneﬁt of our customers."
"Good morning. Thank you. You spoke a little bit about the lag in between cases on the, I guess, the gaps in PISA mechanism. And I was wondering if it's possible to scale that impact or quantify it some way, how you're thinking about it?","Yeah, I don't -- Gregg, this is Marty. Hey, thanks for the question. I don't know that I have a way to really scale it, our objective and walking through those PISA mechanics was really just to help you and investors understand some of the nuances of the accounting ratemaking, because we still do receive a number of questions about it in the context of the need for this current rate review and the next one to incorporate the wind.  So -- but bottom line, as you know, this PISA has really been a big step forward for us in terms of improving the Missouri regulatory framework for infrastructure investment. We've signiﬁcantly increased our ongoing and planned investments. So, it's really terriﬁc. It's really, I guess, to say again, there is a small amount -- there is still a small amount of lag in terms of the ratemaking,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   that's for the 15%. That doesn't get PISA deferrals. And then we have this delayed recognition of equity earnings due to the accounting for the PISA deferrals and that needs to be understood. Today, we're booking those debt returns at about a 5% rate, so that may help you in terms of some of your modeling.  And as we stated, we're going to continue to manage the business in terms of cost management and regulatory rate reviews turning us close to allowed returns as possible, while as I said earlier being mindful of operating business needs. So, I think, Gregg, those are the components that we wanted to communicate and lay out and hopefully, you can use that to help with your modeling."
"Hi, guys. Good morning. Quick question. Just to clarify on new wins [Phonetic]. So, as you're evaluating and thinking about it, so ex the RCP, would new wins necessarily have to go to be a part of the IRP process or not necessarily?","Hi, Neil. Good morning, Neil. It's Michael Moehn. Thanks for that question. Yeah, I think as Warner stated earlier, I mean, as we think about the future and think about future opportunities, it's really going to be part of that integrated resource planning process that we have here in the State of Missouri. And so those renewable opportunities will be considered in the context of that. Again, we are complying with, the Missouri Renewable Standard with the 700 megawatts and the $1.2 billion investment today. So, future investments are really going to be contemplated in the IRP.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And so, Neil, I'll just add to this. And you broke up a little bit at the front end. Of course, the Renewable Choice Program though is diﬀerent, that would be outside, that's a separate program that's been approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission. And we already talked about that in the past, so I just want to clarify that."
