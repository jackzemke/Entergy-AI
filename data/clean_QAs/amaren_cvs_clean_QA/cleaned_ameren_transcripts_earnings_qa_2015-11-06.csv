Question,Answer
"Excellent. Well, congratulations on the results. I wanted to ﬁrst ask you, on parent debt issuances, can you elaborate given the upcoming issuance, how much you're thinking and how you think about general target there?","Good question, Julien. I don't want to get into speciﬁcs in terms of the amount at this point. But if you take a look at the balance sheet, we have about $783 million, I believe of short-term debt that's outstanding. And as you look through the K, you'll see – or Q, you'll see that that balance really resides up at the parent and its money that we've been borrowing on a short-term basis to fund these long-term investments we're making in transmission assets. So, we feel now it's a good time. As we said on the call expect to reﬁnance a substantial portion of that with long- term debt, but – and don't want to get into speciﬁcs on amount here yet."
"All right. Great. And then secondly, you've talked a lot about transmission, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts following the Wood River announcement yesterday and potential for Clinton retirements. What does that mean for transmission? And perhaps more broadly, how do you think about the transmission CapEx budgets in light of MISO planning? And also, should you get an ROE reduction, how does that drive your thinking into this 4Q update on transmission?","So, Julien. This is Warner. Lot of questions in there. So, I think to kick that oﬀ, we'll let Maureen Borkowski, who is the President of our Transmission Operations, give you sort of a general   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   sense on some of your initial questions.     Hi, Julien. Thanks for the questions. First of all, with regard to either Wood River or Clinton which Clinton has not at this point in time deﬁnitively said anything, we work with MISO to deﬁne what additional transmission investment is needed to maintain the system reliably. And then we would move out on developing any projects or making any upgrades that were necessary. I would point out that any of those would be reliability investments and therefore would not be subject to FERC Order 1000, but we would make those investments ourselves. I'm not sure about the rest of your questions, could you kind of repeat what else you were asking?"
"Yeah. I mean, I was just thinking more broadly. Where do we stand on the MISO planning process in light of, say, CPP and just in light of getting the FERC Order 1000 processes going? How do you think about the transmission budget? And then, perhaps also a related question would be, if you do get an ROE reduction, does that negatively impact your CapEx budget?","So, this is Maureen again. With regard to the Clean Power Plan, and with regard to FERC Order 1000, we don't currently have anything reﬂected in our current CapEx to address either of those issues. We do believe that MISO may be having a very small FERC Order 1000 project approved this year, which would then go out with an RFP next year.  And with regard to the Clean Power Plan, MISO is actively working on developing a transmission expansion plan to address what they believe would be some of the impacts of the state plans. Again, we would expect to see more of that later next year or even into 2017. With regard to the ROE, all I can say is we still ﬁrmly believe that FERC understands the need for continued transmission development, and they also understand that the ROE that they set does impact the capital allocation of utilities, and if they want that investment to continue, they need to keep the ROE healthy."
"With respect to the legislative outlook, can you give us a ﬂavor as to what may have changed there that might make you feel more optimistic about something happening if anything has changed? And just give us a little bit of a ﬂavor for what we might be seeing in spring?","Yeah Paul, this is Warner. I'll comment, and then Michael Moehn if he has additional comments, I'll ask him to join. But in terms of what's diﬀerent, I think there are a couple things just to be mindful of. None of these things ultimately guarantee success, but there are some diﬀerences. I think number one, as we've said before, we have seen very clearly the constructive outcomes that are resulting from the changes in the Illinois framework, constructive outcomes which are beneﬁting customers and clearly beneﬁting the entire State of Illinois. And so, it isn't just one year, we're seeing several years of those constructive outcomes, and those are certainly notable.  I think the second thing to be mindful of is that earlier this year, the governor issued his comprehensive energy plan, that included a host of things, but also incorporated in there was the recognition for the need to modernize the framework to support investment. So, I think that too is something that will be – I'm sure a subject of discussion during the upcoming session. Certainly, I think when you look around the nation and as you follow, I think it's becoming clear as part of our conversations with key stakeholders across the state. The Missouri is lagging behind in terms of their framework, their policies and their investment.  So, you put all those things together, I think those two are diﬀerences, coupled with the fact that we do have new leaders, both in the House and the Senate, and we look forward to working very closely with those new leaders not just next year, but in the years ahead. So, all those things I think are certainly you asked for what were some of the diﬀerences those are just some of the highlights I would put out there.  In terms of solutions, look – that the bottom line is that there are lot of solutions that are being – that there are out there that we've talked about in the past, but also ones that are being used, utilized across the country. So, I think these are things that we look at. But more importantly we discuss with stakeholders. Because whether there is any legislative initiate that goes forward, it will be informed by those conversations with the key stakeholders across the state. So, Michael, I'll ask you to – if there is anything else to add.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well said, Warner. I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to overstate the importance of the comprehensive state energy plan, but I mean, really it was a thoughtful document, it was a collaborative process, really brought together through both utilities as well as environmental groups and others. And there are a number of recommendations in there about modernizing the electric infrastructure, enacting legislation that provides for accelerated grid modernization, performing Missouri's utility ratemaking process. And so I think there really is a framework I think to bring forth these discussions, there are a number of interested parties and trying to see that happen, because there is a number of things in there. They would like to get done as well. And so, I think it really does provide a catalyst to try to put something forward."
"Well, did notice it as well. But, I guess, what I'm wondering is, I mean outside of an actual legislative change, what should we think would be the timing for the next Missouri rate case?","I would say – yeah, Paul, this is Warner again. Look, I think as we discussed during our last call, there've been no decisions on the next Missouri rate case. And as we've said in our talking points, we'll be mindful of regulatory lag and the need to ﬁle a rate case to make sure that we earn a fair return on those investments. So, no decisions have been made, but we have to ﬁle a rate case within four years. And so, generally speaking, that takes – under the fuel adjustment clause provisions. And so that takes you out sometime until 2018 where we would have to ﬁle, but up until then it is one of those things that we continue to study."
"Okay. And then on energy eﬃciency, if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the rejection of your plan. And you mentioned you were thinking about perhaps re-ﬁling it, just any more you could tell us about that?","Yeah, sure. This is Michael Moehn. I think it was unfortunate. We thought we were addressing the commission's concerns. We had a number of parties that had actually signed on supporting our plan, but ultimately it came down to a couple of things. Really the commission desire to apply and utilize an after-the-fact evaluation and measurement and veriﬁcation process that really prevented us from recording the revenues associated with those lost sales. And there was also – they are very focused on reducing demand, and our programs are really designed on reducing energy, and so those are a couple of things that we have to go back and think about and see if there is a solution forward. These are important programs. They really have worked well. I think everybody has beneﬁted from them, shareholders, customers. And so we'd love to see them come back and so we're trying to be very thoughtful about that process and think about what the next steps would be here in the very near future."
"Okay. But sales growth after 2016, I mean, you mentioned that there is a lag eﬀect in terms of, you still expected to impact usage in 2016, but we should expect – what do you think the impact   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   in 2017? If there is no new plan to replace it, how should we think about your projections for sales growth in 2017 and beyond?","Yeah, Paul, this is back to Marty again. Yes, we did talk about in the call, they're expected to have some bleed over into 2016, and largely I think that will be a function of how 2015 programs wrap up. So it's premature to really talk about how much that maybe in 2016, but we wouldn't expect meaningful impacts on sales from the current programs beyond 2016, in fact, never really even when we did envision additional energy eﬃciency programs going forward, never really expected a meaningful impact on earnings when you look out to, say, like a 2018 time period.  So short answer to your question, expect an impact in 2016, expect that to be diminished as we get into 2017, and again never expected really a meaningful impact overall in 2018. One thing while you are on that, the energy eﬃciency, Paul, that I do want to clarify. I'm told that earlier in the call I talked about the performance incentive we would receive in 2016, and I may have misspoke and said that related to the 2013 to 2018 period. What I meant to say is it relates to 2013 to 2015 program that we'll be wrapping up later this year."
"I just had – one of the big drivers in the quarter you said was some rate design timing issues. Kind of, I guess, what quarters did you borrow that from to make this quarter strong and will have a fourth quarter impact?","Yeah, I get your question. This is Marty again. So yeah, we did have a seasonal rate redesign that did aﬀect the timing of margins and earnings recognition through the year. Mentioned that it was a $0.06 positive in the quarter. However, it's mostly, I'll call it, repayment from prior period."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Okay.,"So, on a year-to-date basis, it's a positive $0.02. And then we expect that $0.02 to go away through the fourth quarter so that by the end of the year, it's ﬂat with no net impact on margins or earnings."
Thank you. That helps. And then what was weather like in the fourth quarter of 2014 relative to normal?,"Let's see, I think we've got that. If you look on slide 16 where we give our fourth quarter earnings guidance, you'll see down at the very bottom that we expect it to be a slight negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter, about negative $0.01. So we had about $0.01 of positive weather last year and expect..."
And then when you issue – it sounds like you're going to issue most of the long-term debt to pay down short-term at parent and less so in Illinois.,Didn't really comment on that. What we said was that we plan to do long-term debt issuance at both the Ameren parent company level at this point as well as at Ameren Illinois here in the fourth quarter.
And that would get picked up in your next formulaic rate resetting?,"That is correct. The cost of long-term debt, whatever that may be at Ameren Illinois, would get picked up in the next regulatory ﬁling.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
So there might be a little bit of lag there in getting those higher debt costs in?,"Well, the way it works again formulaically is we'll true up our revenues this year based upon our actual costs of service this year, our year-end rate base. And so we'll factor that into whatever true-up that we do reﬂect.  And then the ﬁling we would make next April with the commission would be to seek recovery of any diﬀerential or a refund to customers if that was appropriate. But again, the whole program is designed that there would be no lag. The revenues we reﬂect in each year are a function of that year's costs and that year's rate base and cost of capital. So there is really no lag in Illinois in terms of an earnings perspective."
"Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. The way that the energy eﬃciency program worked, were you getting an incentive for performance that was on a one-year lag, so you would get sort of 2014 and 2013, 2015 and 2014, et cetera, or are you getting a – or is this a payment that you're getting for the cumulative impact of the program, and so it happens sort of once every several years?","Yes, Greg. This is Marty. So the incentive that we expect to recognize in 2016 is really for that full period 2013, 2014 and 2015.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Got you. So if I think about the moving parts here – and we could talk more about this on Monday (48:03), there'll be some oﬀset to top line revenue from the incentive payment. Are those the only two moving parts to this or is there something else that gets into the mix in terms of understanding the net impact of the energy eﬃciency program, or is it just those two pieces?","Well, as you look into 2016, that is correct. Those would be the two moving pieces, absent the new energy eﬃciency program put in place. There would be the bleed over impact into 2016 of the prior year's programs partially oﬀset by the expectation of this incentive payment. So as you look into 2016, those are the moving parts. If you look back historically, it's been a function of not only the reduction in sales, but the net shared beneﬁts that we've received. But once the three year program ends, those go away. So it's really, as you look into 2016, you do have the two components."
"Okay. So what was this net shared beneﬁts component, and was that calculated on a sort of contemporaneous year basis or was that calculated on a lag?","It was calculated on, I guess, a contemporaneous year basis, not exactly sure what you mean by that. But basically..."
Meaning that (49:22) the calculation of the beneﬁt happened in the same year as the calculation of the savings.,"Yeah. So it was actually calculated based upon the programs and what incentives were actually provided to the customers and the expected beneﬁts that were to be received from the customers as a result of those programs. So I think it was contemporaneous. What you'd do is you'd provide the customer an incentive, there'd be an expected beneﬁt there in terms of energy use savings and then a percentage of that was reﬂected in that year in terms of net shared beneﬁts. And as we've shown in the slides, it was basically a present value of the expected beneﬁts to be received from the customer from those programs oﬀered in that year."
"Hey, guys. Quick one here. You mentioned the positive impact of lower O&M next year. How material is that? How should we think about that relative to the slight year-over-year headwind due to the, having a Callaway outage, like which one's bigger or smaller, do they oﬀset et cetera?","Michael, obviously we're not giving guidance today. We wanted to give you some of the overall moving pieces. So I don't think I really want to get into quantifying the overall magnitude. We continue to work hard, as we said on the call, to leverage our continuous improvement eﬀorts, to be disciplined in our management of cost, to be disciplined in our management of our capital, and we'll continue to do those things. But, I think pre-mature at this point to really get into quantifying the pluses and minuses on 2016."
Where do you see is the biggest opportunities to realize cost savings?,"Yeah. Michael Moehn will again jump in on that one.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hi, Michael, it is Michael Moehn. I think as we think about the program, we've had conversations about this in the past. It really is across the entire business. I mean I think that it's anywhere from generation to the distribution side, to the overhead as well. And so, we're probably three years, two and a half years into this ﬁve-year program. We're making great progress. I mean it's really based on two things; work force productivity and deploying technology to drive eﬃciency. There are obviously bigger areas based on where some of the spend is within energy delivery and some of the power plants, but it is equally being deployed throughout the organization.     So, Michael, I would just add, this is Warner, that – two things. We talk a lot about Missouri, but as Michael said, it isn't just at Missouri, it's across our entire organization which includes our business and corporate services. And I'll tell you, we have a disciplined approach across all of our businesses; both in Illinois as well as in transmission. So this is something we work together as a team and something that we will continue to work together as a team going forward."
Yes. Thank you. How much of you reserved year-to-date for the transmission ROE? And is that just at ATXI?,"Gregg, this is Marty. I think we'll deﬁnitely – when we ﬁle our Q, which we expect to do later today, we'll have that number. I believe the number is about $36 million. But check the Q4 to be sure. And really that's being reﬂected both at ATXI as well as at Ameren Illinois. So, it's basically proportionate to the rate base that we've got in those two jurisdictions or to..."
And that would be pre-tax?,Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   To legal entities I should say.
Can you quantify the potential investments associated with the NERC requirements on ballpark?,"David, I don't think we can. I mean I think that in terms of exactly what those are, we've certainly given, as you well know, our planned rate base growth through 2019, it's got transmission investments in there. Some of those are for NERC projects, especially those that are within Ameren Illinois. But, we don't call them out separately. There is certainly NERC related projects happening in Missouri as well.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And then also, as we've mentioned, while we've got that 6% rate base growth out through 2019, it doesn't yet – hasn't yet been updated to reﬂect any of the $500 million to $1 billion of incremental projects that we're evaluating. As you know, it's a third-to-third-to-third between Illinois distribution, electric distribution, gas distribution, and FERC regulated transmission. Portion of those moneys too could go towards NERC reliability projects. But, David, I can't really breakout within the current disclosed program or the $500 million to $1 billion speciﬁcally how much is NERC related."
"Okay. And then on your consolidated – looking at the consolidated balance sheet, what is your target equity ratio and where did you end the quarter?","Yeah. So if you actually look at the last page of our attachments to our press release, you will see a stats page and we're right around 50-50 debt in equity at the end of the quarter, and over time that's approximately where we want to be from a debt-to-equity perspective."
"Got you. Got you. Okay. And just on customer growth, have you provided what you're seeing in terms of the level of growth particularly in Missouri, not sales growth, the customer growth?","No, we didn't comment on that earlier. In Missouri, this year year-to-date, we've seen some growth, but it's been modest. I think their residential customer count is up about 0.3%, commercial customer count up about 0.7%. The Illinois or excuse me, the industrial customer count unfortunately is down about 0.8%. But we have been seeing a little bit of growth in the residential and commercial areas in Missouri."
