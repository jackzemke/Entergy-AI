Question,Answer
"The Missouri legislation -- given that we got the May 17 deadline showing up here, and for the lack of movement over the last several weeks, how should we think about the potential for its passage? And if it doesn't pass, given the substantial amount of CapEx and rate-based growth that you guys have, how should we think about your ability to manage regulatory lag, in its absence?","Sure. Paul, this is Marty. I think I'll let Warner Baxter, who is here with us -- President of Missouri Operations -- go ahead and answer that question.     Yes. Good morning, Paul. How are you doing?"
"Okay. I hear you. But just in general, there is a lot of opposition. And, in the absence of a change in regulatory policy, should we be thinking about an ROE lag as we go forward, if there is no improvement? Or -- I am sure you guys are working hard, or whatever -- but just in general -- how -- if you could just -- I don't know if you can address that or not. But how should we think about that? And then also related, SB9 sailed through the legislature in Illinois very well. But the gas stuﬀ -- the gas legislation seems to be held up. And I was just wondering if you could compare and contrast that?","You know, Paul, it's me, Marty. I'll maybe try to tack on to what Warner said. I think as you look at what we have been able to accomplish over the past number of years in terms of Missouri regulation and Missouri earnings, certainly over a series of rate cases, we've been able to achieve use of various riders and trackers for fuel or for energy eﬃciency or things of that nature which have provided us a better opportunity to earn our allowed returns. And we have meaningfully closed the gap between earned and allowed returns. Clearly, in the absence of some better framework for capital investment, it's hard to be able to earn those alloweds on a regular basis, if you are deploying signiﬁcant amounts of capital. When you look overall, at our plan going forward, and you look at our 7% rate-based growth plans across the enterprise, heavy focus on those jurisdictions with formulaic ratemaking, with the kinds of frameworks that allow us to make the investment for the beneﬁt of our customers to grow jobs and to grow that rate base. If you look at the trends we put out in the past while we're planning to still invest substantially in Missouri, the growth is at a much lower pace. Again, providing ourselves the opportunity to earn something closer to our alloweds. And again, as Warner said, making sure that we continue to control our spending in order to position ourselves for success there. Now, transitioning over to Illinois -- you know, you're right. The changes or the modiﬁcations to the formulaic rates for electric did pass both chambers with very strong majority votes there. And that's now before the Governor. And then, as it relates to the gas legislation, things have, I'd say, stalled a little bit there. I think legislative interest has moved somewhat away from the gas formula ratemaking and is focusing maybe on something more like an infrastructure rider or something of that nature. May I remind you, that with respect to gas in Illinois, we do have use of four [ph] forward-test years. We have got a gas rate case pending right now and -- incorporates those forward-test years. And that's where things stand in Illinois.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Yes. I understand this week that the Missouri legislation actually hit a little bit of a speed bump. Just curious -- are there speciﬁc concerns the industrial customers have? And is there ways the legislation could be tailored to alleviate some of those concerns?,"Well, Michael, this is Warner again. The bill was debated last evening, as Tom said, and they ultimately did not come to a vote. Certainly, there have been concerns cited by some of the industrial customers, in terms of impact on rates and those types of things. And there have been eﬀorts made to try and address that in the legislation. And we will continue to have those discussions with those customers, and other stakeholders, to see if we can get something across the ﬁnish line. So we're going to continue to push to see if we can get something constructive done during these last two weeks."
"Got it. And turning to Illinois -- assuming that SB9 is eventually made into law, and assuming the litigation around the prior rate case turns in your favor and upholds the law passed in 2011 -- is there still any remaining structural lag that exists for your Illinois REC distribution businesses? Meaning, are there still some level of costs that simply aren't recoverable in rates? And, if so, could you quantify that level? Lots of state commissions don't allow things like incentive compensation or regional or local marketing cost, donations -- that type of thing. Just trying to think about what are the remaining drivers of lag, if any, once the whole legislative and litigation process plays out, and assuming it plays out in your favor.","Sure, Michael. Thanks. You know, there are some of those costs. And if you look back to our slides from our year-end call, we did outline some those structural things, if you will, that were there. When the law was passed in Illinois, while it did provide for formulaic ratemaking for the vast majority of costs that are incurred, historical ICC ratemaking adjustments were preserved by that legislation. So we outlined some of those non-recoverable costs. I think it was on slide 13 of our year-end slide. Some of those non-recoverable costs did include about $8 million of historical ratemaking adjustments. Those are the kinds of things that would be impactful going forward. This year, we identiﬁed some other things, like $7 million of certain electrical system rework costs. Those we expect to be -- they occurred over a couple of years, last year and this year. But we do expect those to diminish and to go away. So there are a little bit of things that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   continue to be there. And then, we have the opportunity and we'll continue to focus on those costs and make eﬀorts to control and reduce those to the extent possible.     For the most part, Michael, the costs we incur in serving our customers, improving our service and reliability, are recovered through the formulaic process."
"Got it. And then a broader transmission question. We have seen in some regions of the country, in New England and Colorado and California, intervenors come in and ﬁle at the FERC to dramatically lower the base ROE in some of the RTOs. We haven't seen that type of Section 205 -- or I think it's 206 -- litigation yet in the MISO or in the SPP, I don't think. But just curious -- if it did play out, and if you saw lower authorized base ROEs for transmission, how would that impact your views in terms of dedicating as much capital as you're planning to interstate transmission projects?","Sure, Michael. You're right in terms of, we haven't seen that type of push here. I think, as you know, our FERC-authorized ROEs aren't really incentive ROEs like you might see in some jurisdictions. But to your question, to the extent that the ratemaking treatment or the ROEs were changed, it detracts from the incentive that exists today in investing in these large regional projects. They are signiﬁcant amounts of capital deployment. They do have risks associated with them. We believe that the ROEs that we've got are appropriate. And to the extent that the ROEs were reduced, it certainly would aﬀect ours, and I think other companies' thought processes about the investment opportunity. Whether they were banned or not, I certainly won't speculate. I'm just saying that it certainly becomes less attractive, and there's less incentive there to take on these big projects."
"Actually, a question on the utility guidance -- or, I guess, overall guidance. But it seems that the midpoint of your guidance, $2.00 to $2.20, reﬂects a utility midpoint of $2.30. Is that fair?","Yes. I think, yes, that is fair. When we provided the guidance, which is now guidance from continuing operations of $2.00 to $2.20, we also mentioned that we expected for the full year parent and other costs of about $0.20. And so that would, if you do the math, as you have done -- that would imply, for the regulated utilities, about $2.30."
"Okay. And then just -- sorry, back to what's driving that nickel increase on the utility side?","Well, I think, overall, as we go through the year, we've certainly seen -- I will comment on a few things, since you've opened the door on guidance, which I appreciate. First on the -- I'll talk maybe about the parent and other of about $0.20 that we see there. What's driving that is that, as you go through the accounting for continuing operations or discontinued operations, you've got to take costs that maybe were previously allocated to the merchant business. And to the extent that those aren't naturally going away with the business you're disposing of, you would continue to classify those in continuing operations. So some of the things driving that $0.20 are interest on the parent company debt of about $425 million of parent company debt, which is about $0.10 of interest or so. And then there is G&A cost previously allocated to that merchant business that will be retained for the time being, once the segment, the divestiture, is actually completed. We'd certainly have the opportunity, then, to reduce and drive some of those costs out. And then there are other parent company costs that have existed through time that are in that $0.20. Then, overall, with respect to utility results for the First Quarter, as we talked about a lot of the improvement over last year was really driven by weather. We saw about a $0.10 improvement from weather overall. But when you strip out the weather and you look at weather-normalized sales, overall, those were positive during the quarter. Overall, saw residential and commercial sales up about 2% on a weather-normalized basis across the Company. And that was a positive sign and a little ahead of our expectations. We were expecting little growth this year. We haven't really modiﬁed our expectations for the remainder of the year. We still expect a little growth for the remainder of the year, but the quarter was a positive from that perspective. You know, the sales versus normal -- I've been meaning weather versus normal, I should say, was a neutral. We didn't see much impact from weather versus normal conditions. But we did see on a weather-normalized basis is a bit of a pickup. And we would also expect to see for the remainder of the year some positive variances versus expectation in O&M. And we're also expecting to see some positives from further infrastructure investment, rate-based growth -- in those areas where we have the formulaic ratemaking. So those are some of the drivers on the regulated side. You know, I would say that those -- we give the $2.00 to $2.20 guidance. It's a $0.20 range. That parent company and other of $0.20 is an approximation. I would say, probably, there is a little bit of a rounding up there. And so, therefore, your derived $2.30, I would say there would be a little bit of a rounding up there too, in terms of the -- you know, the regulated midpoint.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Okay. Just so I heard right. You said weather-adjusted -- weather-normalized sales were up 2%?,"Residential and commercial combined, across the Company. And we were pleased to see it. We saw a little bit of a positive growth in the same categories in the Fourth Quarter of last year, though. You may recall, I think others do, in the Third Quarter of last year, they were down. So, weather-normalization is, an approximation. And when we looked over the course of last year we had some ups and downs during the quarters over the course of the year. We actually saw residential and commercial sales down a little bit versus 2011 levels. So we are happy to see this trend. It's good to have this starting out the year. A little bit of a positive trend. But I think we've still got a cautious view for the remainder of the year."
Got it. I appreciate walking -- you walking me through those steps. Just one quick question on the dividends. What is the way we should look at dividend growth going forward from here?,"Yes. We've talked in the past about payout targets in the 55% to 70% of regulated earnings range. And, we've given out no speciﬁc guidance on when to expect increases going forward other than to say that we do have the 7% growth rate planned in rate base. With that, we would expect to grow our regulated earnings over time. And as we grow those regulated earnings, we would expect to also be in a position to be able to recommend to the Board increases in the dividend."
"Okay. So that 55% to 70% is regulated earnings excluding the $0.20, or whatever that ultimately becomes of parent drag?","Yes, I think that's a fair way to think about it."
"Excellent. Kind of following up on the last one, actually. So you talk about $0.20 this year. You've talked about that abating somewhat. How much of that is due to the interest expense re-ﬁing in '14 -- and I suppose mid-year and onwards. And how much of this is fundamentally just being able to reduce the G&A over time with the merchant gen segment out of the way now?","Fair. Good question. So the $0.20, as I broke it down, was probably about -- the $0.20 -- $0.10 of interest and then $0.10 of G&A previously allocated to the merchant business as well as some, corporate overhead costs that we've had historically. So when you think about that parent company debt, as you know, $425 million of debt, 8.875% interest rate. You know, in today's market we'd be able to reduce that substantially. Cutting that better than 50%, Julien, maybe -- and maybe even by two-thirds. So on an annualized basis, decreasing that $0.10 by $0.06 or so wouldn't be unrealistic on an annualized basis. You're right. The re-ﬁ for that would be a May time-frame of next year. And then, with respect to some of these other costs, like the G&A costs that are in the parent company number this year, that historically have been allocated to the merchant business, that's probably about $0.06 over the remainder of this year. And we certainly can't reduce or eliminate those costs until the divestiture is completed, but then we'd expect to be able to reduce those through time. We talked a couple of calls ago about the expectation that we believe we could eventually eliminate those fully. That may take through the end of '15 to be able to get there when they're fully gone. But we would expect to be able to begin to reduce those substantially next year. So what we've said is, we expect that $0.20 this year to go down to a range of $0.10 to $0.15 next year, and then those costs would further diminish the year after that. As you get the full-year beneﬁt of the reﬁnanced parent company debt and you fully reduce the drag from those -- G&A costs previously allocated to the merchant business."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So if I hear you right -- call it a run-rate around '15 time frame -- $0.20 minus $0.06 with interest expense; at least minus another $0.06 once you fully eliminate the allocated cost. So less than a dime, easily?",Yes. Less than a dime is what I'm getting as well.
"All right. Fantastic. And then going over to the ATX side of the world -- perhaps a little bit similar to the last question. When you are thinking about your successes on developments, what are the next important data points? And as you think about it, how do you feel about the execution on the CAD -- just deploying capital, if you will? And maybe a secondary question oﬀ that -- also looking at CapEx, how would EMIA change your CapEx outlook, too? Your EIMA, yes.",Yes. I think I missed the ﬁrst part of your question. What was the base part of your question?
The base part was more ATX. How do you feel about deployment? What are the next key milestones in terms of it? Seems like there have been some developments in the quarter.,"Yes. No, there would. In terms of outlining those, there have been good developments. So certain -- we ﬁled for the ICC Certiﬁcate of Public Convenience and Necessity as it relates to the Illinois Rivers Project, which is sort of a big centerpiece, multi-value project, that we've got planned over the next several years -- $1.1 billion project. As we updated, the staﬀ ﬁled some initial testimony. Overall, we saw it as positive, where the staﬀ overall was recommending that the ICC grant a certiﬁcate for the project. We've recently, as you know, probably, ﬁled rebuttal. So the upcoming dates there are ICC hearings in the May time frame. And we're still expecting an order, and we're optimistic that we'll get the ICC certiﬁcate and be able move forward then late this year with right-of-way acquisition, and next year, with that full range of construction activities. So we're anxious to begin deploying capital relative to that project. We feel like the testimony we provided in response to ICC and others -- testimony we hope was responsive. And we hope to see the ICC approval and begin to move forward. So those are some of the key milestones. Certainly, the expectation of being able to move forward with that project on the time frame I just outlined is really key to the overall plans we have to grow rate base at that 7% rate that we talked about earlier."
"Great. And then EMIA. Just, I am curious. Like -- how much CapEx upside are we talking there?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, there what we did, if you look at our CapEx plans, we didn't substantially change those as a result of the ICC order last year. We eliminated about $30 million of planned capital spending for this year, but didn't really substantially change the plans that we had longer term. We're certainly optimistic that we will see the appropriate modiﬁcations made to the legislation to provide the clarity about the legislative intent. And at that point we would be in a position to add back that $30 million of reduced capital spending to our forecast."
"I think most of my questions have been answered. One, just going back to the legislation, we know the end date of the thing. But what it's like, right -- it has to ﬁrst get passed from the Senate, then go to the House? And if I'm right, is the bill in the House the same right now, or does it have to go to a Committee? Can you just walk us through what the path could be for approval? How does it go from one to the other and then get approved?","Sure, Ashar. This is Warner. One, there are several vehicles that are still available in both the House and the Senate. You have your original bills, which are HB398, House Bill 398 and then Senate Bill 207. If those bills would be approved, they would have to go through committees on either side of the House to move forward. So a likely path to move forward now -- between now and May 17 -- would be to amend an approved Senate or House bill. So say a House bill is on the Senate side, and that has been amended by the Senate and sent back over to the House. Then, simply, the House can take that bill and vote it up or down. It does not have to go through all the Committee process. And indeed, that's certainly an approach that's being considered in both the Senate and the House right now. So is it possible to get something done in the next two weeks, utilizing those vehicles? The answer is yes. But as we said before, we have two weeks. And there -- still takes time to get through some of the processes, but it isn't as extensive as the original bill process would have to be."
"Okay. But just practically thinking, we have to see, say, some movement by the 12 or 13 of May. Is that a good point? Because it has to pass the Senate. Or can it all be done on one day, the last day?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Ashar, the only thing I have seen in Missouri politics and the legislature -- it's pretty amazing how things can get done in the last few days. Having said that, the more time you have to move things, the better you are. And certainly every day is precious when it gets down to the last two weeks. So I can't say there is a speciﬁc cut-oﬀ date one way or the other. But there are a host of - - there are vehicles. But just because they are vehicles doesn't mean that there still aren't some challenges to go through both sides of -- either the House or the Senate."
"Just a question to follow on -- on ATX and the CPCM process. First question is, could you elaborate a bit on the staﬀ position, what they came back with, and how you responded to it -- what were the concerns? And then second question, and separate from this is -- I believe you are pursuing a couple of other meaningful projects at ATX in Illinois, and want to know how you think about the likelihood and timing of these projects? What do we need to see happen to push these into happening? Would it be load growth, coal, unit retirements, et cetera?","Sure, Neil. This is Marty again. And one thing I would refer you to, overall, that I thought was a good piece of testimony is -- the President of our transmission company, Maureen Borkowski, in the testimony that we ﬁled recently in response to the ICC -- to intervenors in the case. But Maureen's testimony I think provided an overview of the issues that had been raised or concerns that had been raised and the overall ATXI response to those. And she summarized well, I think -- both the concerns as well as the comments that we were providing back. And I think, Neil, overall in my view, the intervenors I mentioned earlier, the staﬀ in particular, overall   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   recommended that the ICC go ahead and provide the Certiﬁcate. But there were questions raised about the need for certain speciﬁc substations. There were concerns or questions raised about the path for certain segments of the overall project and the lines. And, in that regard, we have provided testimony supporting why the substations we proposed are needed for reliability or other reasons, and why the routing that we proposed makes sense. And I think there were also a number of stipulated settlements reached with a number of parties that had raised questions along the way, as well. And those were also, again, summarized in Maureen's testimony. So, again, by and large, in summary, I felt like, looking at it, that overall the project was certainly needed. The question was about the path and the need for certain elements. But, again, we felt like we've largely addressed those in the testimony. So, I think that's the Illinois Rivers Project. The MISO has already approved a number of other multi-value projects, back in December of 2011 -- the Spoon River Project, the Mark Twain Project. And then there are some other pending projects like the Big Muddy River Project. All those projects, again, have been approved by MISO as multi-value projects. So the plan would be to go ahead and move forward with those projects over time. And I don't know that there is really anything pending, in terms of further demonstration of need for the project. It's just a matter of sequencing the projects and moving forward on them."
"So just to clarify then -- would those projects that have been approved by MISO -- should we expect those from an in-service date as being outside the ﬁve-year period -- get the Illinois Rivers through and done, and then go in and go for the other projects as well, over time? And then as you come in and go for the other projects as well over time?",Yes. I think that's largely a way to think about it. Within the ﬁve years there could be certainly some spending on those projects. But the overall transmission growth plans that we have certainly do extend beyond the ﬁve-year window that we're presenting.
Just a quick question on the Genco business. There has been some talk on the other -- from some of the other conference calls today that there has been some basis issues. Can you talk   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   about whether or not you have seen any basis issues for some of your plans?,"Yes, sure. Over time I do think that, historically, at the Illinois hub location, there has been some basis discount to Indy hub, which is typically looked at as a more liquid trading hub in our region. And what we've been seeing, anyway, in the recent, say, 12-month time frame for the merchant business, is probably a basis discount to Indy hub around the clock of about 12% or so. And we have seen those basis diﬀerentials certainly ﬂuctuate over time."
Did you see it widen at all in the First Quarter?,"You know, I can't comment speciﬁcally on the First Quarter. But it has ﬂuctuated over time. And a 12% basis diﬀerential isn't historically out of the norm or abnormal when you look back, say, to some of the 2011 data and the like. So it does ﬂuctuate over time."
"Okay. Do you see it as general transmission constraints? Are there line outages over time, or are there any other unique issues going on that you've observed?","I can't really pinpoint any unique issues as it relates to our system. The things you mentioned are things that historically have impacted basis diﬀerentials. So certain generator outages or transmission-line outages, load ﬂuctuations -- all of those things can aﬀect basis diﬀerential from time to time. We'll see basis diﬀerentials diﬀerentiate seasonally based upon the demands on the system. So, all of those things you mentioned certainly are contributors from time to time."
"Okay. I follow you. Okay. I apologize. I said bear with me here. Laughter [ph] But then you seem to have like rate-based growth of about 7% a year, if I'm not mistaken, which probably turns into about 5% earnings growth? And I know you haven't given guidance, but is that a good ballpark to kind of think about?","Well, you're right. We haven't given that out. What we've talked about is that 7% growth rate in rate base. But I think if you model it out, you should see some sort of similar trend rate with respect to earnings. But certainly not commenting on speciﬁcally the 5%."
"I got it. So if you did that and you go back to answers to Julien's questions, you probably could look at earnings in the $2.50-type range for '15. That's what I'm thinking. But what you said on the rate base helps me with that. So I appreciate it, but that was my question. Thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.
"First of all, you indicated the Illinois timing issue should be a headwind in the Second Quarter. Can you quantify that?","Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So, we did talk a little bit about one of the headwinds we saw in the First Quarter compared to last year. This wasn't unexpected from our perspective, but was just the timing of revenue recognition this year versus last year as it related to the Illinois electric delivery service. So in Q2 we expect that to be maybe a $0.03 negative versus last year. And again, we -- (multiple speakers). Go ahead."
"Is this going to continue to whipsaw around? Or do we lap this at some point, and it stabilizes?","Yes. Hopefully we'll see it stabilize next year versus this year. I'll try to describe for you the phenomenon that's causing this, though, which is that we're -- obviously, our revenues for the full year are ultimately determined by our actual cost incurred in that year. Last year was the ﬁrst year, obviously, that we were accounting for this new regulatory regime, if you will. Going into last year, we projected what our cost of service was going to be. We projected what the ROE was going to be based on 30-year Treasuries. And we had an expectation of how the Illinois law would be applied by the ICC. So as we went through the ﬁrst couple of quarters last year, we were recognizing revenue based on those overall expectations. As we got into the Third Quarter of last year and towards the end, we saw that the cost of service for the full year was going to be less than we had previously estimated. We had an ICC order which changed our expectations, and the 30-year Treasuries were coming out, as well, lower than expectation.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Therefore, in the Third Quarter we had a downward revision to the revenues that had been recognized over the ﬁrst half of the year. And then a further adjustment in the Fourth Quarter. So that accounting model is still in place, and we're still saying this First Quarter, recognizing revenue is based on our full-year expected cost of service for that business. So there still could be some volatility from year to year. But I would expect that to dampen over time. Last year was the ﬁrst year we were working through this new process. So I think, probably, bigger ﬂuctuations this year versus last; then we should see moving forward. In Q1, we estimated that the impact was about $0.08 in terms of negative impact versus last year. Due to that, as I mentioned, about $0.03 in the Second Quarter. We expect that, that then will reverse. As I mentioned, last year in the Third Quarter, we had a downward revision. We expect that, then year over year in the Third Quarter of this year we would see a beneﬁt, and it could be in the range of as much as $0.10 of positive impact in Q3 -- another $0.04 in Q4 -- so that over the course of year you are up a few cents versus last year."
"And what's the order of magnitude of the Missouri Appeals Court, depending on how that goes?","Yes. So that could swing either way. And you will recall that we have actually recognized a charge in a prior year of about $18 million or $0.04. So that could reverse. On the other hand, if that goes against us, that could be a negative of up to about another $26 million or $0.06. So it's a range of about a plus $0.04 to minus $0.06 on that."
"And you would keep that in ongoing earnings, or?","Yes. We have historically had that in ongoing earnings. And I would say on the minus $0.06 -- that would really be dependent upon how things ultimately played out with the Commission on those remaining costs. So we do have before the Commission a Request for Accounting Authority Order on that to be able to defer and recover some of those costs, but we'll just have to see how all of that plays out."
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator  We have no further questions at this time, Mr. Fischer, so I would like to turn the ﬂoor back over to you for closing comments.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you for participating in this call.
