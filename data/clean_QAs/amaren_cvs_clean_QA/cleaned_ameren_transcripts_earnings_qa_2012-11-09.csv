Question,Answer
"Just curious, ﬁrst on your outlook for power prices. There's an ongoing debate about the impact of upcoming environmental regulations on the price of power and whether the forward price of power is really fully accounting for all those environmental costs. Particularly post election, the question's coming up a lot. I was just curious, as you think about the Midwest and the amount of potential economic retirements that we're seeing out there, and as you look at the forward power markets, do you have any general comments on what you're seeing out there?","Yes, Stephen, it's a good question. I think it's always been -- this is Marty, by the way. It's always diﬃcult to speculate on what's going to happen with forward power prices. Our view, I think, along with others, is that forward power prices today are obviously pretty low, certainly reﬂecting the continued weak economy and low gas prices. We do expect that, over time, especially when you look out to the MATS rules that take eﬀect out in the 2015, 2016 time frame, that you will see the need for folks to either make additional expenditures or for higher cost generation, to shut down. I think MISO has estimated as much as 12,000-megawatt hours of reduction across the MISO footprint. So those types of things will certainly, I think over time, put pressure on capacity prices, if not power prices."
"Okay. Great. Thank you. A related question -- just as you think about the merchant business, you've laid out for 2012 the business is able to fully fund itself. It's not cash-ﬂow negative. And, as you think about the outlook for that business, from a strategic point of view, is there a sense that through strategic activity that cost cutting could be achieved, greater scale could be achieved? Is there a view that greater scale is needed in general in the merchant generation business? If you wouldn't mind just giving an update on how you think about, strategically, your merchant business.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Stephen, I think a couple things. First of all, you talked about cash ﬂows; and I think, as we said in the call, certainly we're expecting the business to cover its cash needs this year. From time to time, we get questions about GenCo in particular. They started the year out with about $82 million of cash and advances to the money pool. As of September 30 they still had about $57 million of either cash -- cash and advances to the money pool combined -- about $57 million. And, as you know, have the ability to sell gas-ﬁred assets or exercise put option for liquidity purposes. So, those options are out there. As well as they certainly expect, going forward, to have the beneﬁt of certain net operating losses that they've got as well. So, there are some tools in the tool kit in terms of liquidity and cash ﬂows in the short term. Longer term, strategically -- I think it's something that we will continue to evaluate. Obviously, I think the larger the scale platforms that are out there, there are certain synergies that you can have. I think, as we have managed this business over time, we've certainly gotten some synergies by the overall combination of the entities that we have. But, going forward it's something that we'll continue to consider -- the nature of our overall hybrid mix."
"Just quickly on weather -- it sounded like there was $0.10 above normal for the quarter, I believe. Could you give us a sense as to what the weather-normalized growth is for the quarter and year-to-date in Illinois and Missouri? And, whether or not you're seeing any decrease in weather-normalized sales, particularly in Missouri, and the potential for regulatory lag in that jurisdiction? We heard something today that might indicate that's a potential with another company.","I don't know about the other company you're referring to, Paul, but I can certainly -- this is Marty again. I can certainly comment overall. We did estimate about $0.10 per share of positive impact from weather in the Third Quarter versus normal. We also mentioned, in our prepared remarks, that overall we thought Missouri Electric sales negatively impacted earnings by about $0.04 versus last year. And that's because, while it was $0.10 versus normal of positive weather impact in the quarter, as we looked at the weather this year versus last year we thought the impact was   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   about ﬂattish or no impact. You may recall that we had a warm summer last year. It was a persistent warm summer, whereas this year we had some heat in June, extreme heat in July, and then it dropped oﬀ to more normal conditions for the remainder. What we saw this year is that, as we had those extremes in heat and we quantiﬁed, as I said, the impact to be about $0.10, when we looked at the weather-normalized sales they were actually down. And so, when you look at the statistics page we've provided, you'll actually see that residential and commercial sales were down year-over-year. And, again, remember that we believe that overall, weather was about ﬂat. So, the sales declines that you're seeing are weather-normalized sales declines. Now, as we know, weather normalization is somewhat art and somewhat science. That's why we say, in particular, in our talking points, that some of that reduction in overall weather-normalized loads may be because of customer conservation eﬀorts as they receive some of the higher bills from the June and July time frame. But, getting back to your question -- I mean, I think that's a backdrop. What we're actually seeing, then, in Missouri for the quarter was -- in Missouri, residential sales on a weather-normalized basis, down between 1.5% and 2%. Same pattern in the commercial sector. In Illinois, we saw a little bit greater decline in residential usage and commercial was actually a slight positive. So, overall, for Ameren in the quarter, what we saw on a weather-normalized basis was residential sales down a little over 2%, commercial sales down between 0.5% and 1%. So, we saw some, again, some weather-normalized declines in the quarter. And, again, how much of that may have been a reaction to the extreme weather and some of the bills people received is diﬃcult to know. We expected, coming into the year, to have about -- residential commercial sales -- about 0.5% to 1% of growth. What we're now expecting for the year, Paul, is that residential sales to be down somewhere around 0.5% for the year; still expecting to see some commercial growth, however, of up to 0.5%. I think on the industrial side we're seeing pretty ﬂat loads in terms of industrial sales in Missouri. While we're still seeing some growth in Illinois. We're seeing growth year-to-date in Illinois of about 3.9%, and we're expecting for the year all across Ameren to have growth of about 2.7%."
"In terms of regulatory lag and going forward, I mean, with the conservation eﬀorts that we've seen actually around the country for a while now, or whatever it is, at least usage -- how should we think -- is there a potential for regulatory lag in Missouri that you guys are -- or is there not? And, just really brieﬂy, on the merchant -- depreciation went down about $0.05? Was that because of Duck Creek, or was it anything else?","Let me hit that one. Maybe I'll actually let Warner Baxter talk about Missouri. Yes, you may look back -- when you look back to our beginning of the year guidance compared to now, our actual guidance today is about $0.05 higher than it was at the beginning of the year. And, in part that is because of the Duck Creek write-oﬀ, which then positively impacted depreciation; and that's about $0.05 for the year. So, that is part of that, Paul."
"It looked like it was $0.05 for the quarter, though.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. We also -- I think the other thing that we did in the quarter that you'll see in the 10-Q is, we actually did adjust some of our asset retirement obligations for certain ash pond closures and that had a little bit of an impact as well.     Paul, this is Warner. Just a couple things to keep in mind. Number one, with regard to these lower sales, be mindful that we're in the middle of our current rate case. Consequently, we update our billing units for the lower sales levels. Those were done through June. A piece of the things that you're seeing, at least throughout 2012, are part of our overall rate increase request that you see today. Secondly, what you have to be mindful of is that, as we go forward, I think Marty mentioned during the talking points, that we have a new energy eﬃciency regulatory framework that's been in put in place. We're going to be moving out on some additional energy eﬃciency programs, which obviously are going to be beneﬁcial for our customers. But, also as part of that we're going to not only recover our program costs but also we'll be able to recover the lost ﬁxed costs, or the lost revenues, associated with some of those. That's part of the existing rate case as well; and frankly, a settlement that the Commission has already approved. I think there is still risk, to be clear, for regulatory lag associated with conservation eﬀorts. We have taken steps with this rate case and with our new energy eﬃciency proposal to try and mitigate that to some extent."
"First quick question -- on the quarter with regards to Illinois, the $0.12 -- could you break that apart in terms of the distribution, just the quarterly shift versus the earnings under the rate- making?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Well, I guess I'd break it down this way, Julien. I think about -- I'd attribute about $0.05 of that total of the $0.12 to the impacts of the rate order that we received. And the remainder of it really having to do with the distribution of revenues and earnings."
"Great. Next year should we see this more normalized, given the fact that the rate-making has been in eﬀect for the balance of this year? So, this will go away year-on-year?","Yes, I think it should normalize year-over-year. I think what we'll do as we move into next year is see whether we can -- if there is any variation that we can foresee and project, we'll certainly provide that. But, certainly, what it has to do with is, this year, what we're trying to do under the formula rate-making, is preserve some of the seasonality of the revenue requirement. But, as you go through the year and there are changes in the estimated overall revenue requirement for the year, then those are adjusted within the quarter, which is one of the things that impacted us here in this quarter. I think, Julien, in terms of the drivers, on our slide 12, drivers of overall Electric DS earnings, we tried to lay out some of the overall drivers as we see them right now, given the impacts of the ICC order."
"Great, quick follow-up there. You discussed lower CapEx in Illinois, I believe, for '13. Can you provide a little bit of a sense on a go-forward basis what kind of capital expenditure reductions we could potentially see, depending on what happens upon re-hearing, et cetera? Where could this go, ultimately?","Well, I think that's something that we'll have to evaluate over time. Obviously, we gave the 2013 number. What impact there is on 2014 or beyond is something that we'll have to evaluate as we move through time. Our focus right now, as you heard in our talking points, is trying to get the legislative intent incorporated into the rate-making process. We still do believe that over the long term, the formulaic rate model intended by the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act is good for Ameren Illinois and its customers. We're certainly appealing the decision of the ICC to the courts. And, as we noted in our prepared remarks, again, considering what legislative remedies might be possible."
"But, just to be clear, it wouldn't necessarily impact any of your commitments under the formula rate-making?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   That's true. We've made commitments under the formula rate-making. And so, when we look at our capital expenditures, certainly to the extent we're participating in formula rate-making, we will fulﬁll our commitments under the law."
"Just curious, when you think structurally across both the Missouri and Illinois regulated businesses, what are the structural impediments to earning your authorized rate of return? Which ones tend to be the biggest drivers that keep you from being able to do so?","Yes, sure, Michael, this is Marty again. I think -- we'll start with Illinois. I think when you look at the slide that we provided, slide 12, you see some of those impacts as it relates to the Illinois Electric delivery business in terms of rate-making adjustments, certain costs that are incurred that are non-recoverable which we've laid out again for the electric distribution business there on slide 12. Other things, I'd remind you, for instance, is weather, sometimes. For example, in our gas business this year in Illinois, earnings are down roughly $0.03 because of weather. So, that type of thing can certainly drive it down. Then, I think, Michael, I think you and others have this baked in to your overall analysis in Illinois, but I'd just remind you that the goodwill in Illinois is deducted out for rate-making purposes, against equity in that overall business. So, that's always been the case. That's not something that's new, that's a historical rate-making adjustment. Again, I'd remind you of that."
"I just had a question on -- I believe you commented on this previously, but I just wanted to see if we could get some more speciﬁcs -- on, in terms of you said previously that you would be able to comply with MATS without undertaking a scrubbing program for Newton in your merchant gen segment? Obviously, that's irrespective of the state variances recently granted. I was just wondering if maybe you could provide a little more detail on how you think you're going to get there in terms of compliance? And, is that baked within your current CapEx plan?","Sure, this is Marty again. You're correct on all that. That is consistent with what we've said in the past. One of the reasons that we were pursuing the variance from the Multi-Pollutant Standard with the Illinois Pollution Control Board was, in fact, we were able to comply with the MATS rules without that scrubber. And, it was really the Illinois rules that were imposing the need to construct that scrubber. So, we do believe that the capital expenditure plans that we've laid out will allow us to comply with MATS. It's really a function of a number of things. It's a function of the investments that we've already made in our plants over time. We've made signiﬁcant investments in pollution control equipment. We also burn low-sulfur coal which helps with our overall emissions. And, as a result of compliance with the Multi-Pollutant Standard in Illinois, we're already using signiﬁcant amounts of activated carbon for control of mercury. So, through the, I'd say, the compliance with the Multi-Pollutant Standard, we've actually built into our operations those things that are needed to comply with the MATS rules."
"Marty, I just wanted to reconﬁrm what you're saying. As we look from '12 to '13, is this $0.12 recovered? Or is this just lost and there's no positive delta year-over-year?","Yes, it's not really the $0.12 year-over-year. I think that what is more permanent, I would say, until we get either some ﬁx to the ICC rate-making to conform with the Act, or otherwise adjust our spending or capital structure -- I guess what I'm saying is, I'd point you back to slide 12 again. I think those are really the drivers of the earnings. And, as I said earlier, that $0.12, when you break it down, was really $0.05 having to do with the ICC rate order. And then the remainder just really being seasonality of the revenue requirement earnings under formula rate-making. What we tried to provide on slide 12, though, was more of a straightforward build-up, or provide you with a straightforward building blocks to build up to the revenue requirement as we see it today, given the ICC's rate order.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Good morning. Just a couple quick ones on the GenCo side of the house, real quickly. In terms of fuel hedge, I noticed that the '14 number actually stepped up by $0.50 there. I suppose it's a little less than intuitive given some of the recent trends. I'd just be curious.","Yes, Julien, that's right. In our prepared remarks, I tried to provide a comment on this. What we did do in the quarter was rebalance our mix of our coal hedges a little bit. And in the rebalancing of the coal hedges it actually impacted the average price a little bit. As you see now, too, you might notice that the coal hedge percent -- or the coal hedge number dropped down from about 14 million megawatt hours to 13 million megawatt hours, which also aligns with the forward power sales that we've made, about 13 million megawatt hours. So, it was a bit of a rebalancing of the coal hedge mix. You've got to remember too, these are -- we round oﬀ to the nearest $0.50, so there's a little bit of rounding in there. That coal hedge rebalancing wasn't a full $0.50 impact, but that was, I'd say, one of the drivers."
"Great, and then, a second question here -- obviously you talked about free cash ﬂow breakeven for GenCo. I'd be curious -- how do you think about execution of the put options? Speciﬁcally, your Q alludes to losing access to some of your other sources of liquidity at some point. Would you imagine execution of the put in tandem with some of the other liquidity source losses? Do you get what I'm saying?","Yes, I don't think it would necessarily be in tandem with the other liquidity source losses. Like I said, they've still, as we sit here -- well, at 9/30 they had about $57 million of both cash and money pool advances on the balance sheet. So, we'll be thinking about that as we look at the overall cash ﬂows going into next year and the year beyond -- what the available cash is, as they, again, seek to cover their own cash needs, and then making a decision about what the right course of action is in terms of execution of that option.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Right. So, eﬀectively, to be clear, once you roll oﬀ of the existing cash balances, at that point you'll probably take a look at execution?","Well, that's right, to the extent that the cash balances roll down. And if we were in a position where we didn't see the ability for them to meet their own cash needs, certainly then we'd be in a position where we'd be executing the put option. But, again, right now, I mentioned the overall liquidity that they've got."
"Right, absolutely. And, just to be clear also -- if you were to execute the put option, you would expect to sell those assets in turn? Would this be a transitionary thing? Or would you eﬀectively intend to keep those new assets at the new subsidiary?","I guess, Julien, at the end of the day, we'd have the option to do either. But, certainly the idea was that if GenCo exercised the put, obviously they get the $100 million immediately. They get the remainder of any excess in the fair value over the $100 million, as determined by the appraisals at closing. And then, AERG, who would actually then have those assets, would have the ability to sell one or all of those in order to reduce outstanding borrowings resulting from the put."
The ash pond ARO -- is that just for the quarter? Or is there an ongoing impact associated with that?,"No, it's just for the quarter. We periodically actually update our estimates. These ones in particular, though, had to do with Meredosia and Hutsonville and some of the closure there as we're working through the closure of those facilities and had better estimates on the overall cost. So, it's really a one-time impact."
"The severe weather that you mentioned in the release -- I gathered that, and also from your comments, that's this hot weather that you guys incurred in the summer. Were there any new peaks this summer, just in terms of -- I know you gave us megawatt hour declines, but was there any -- how was peak compared to megawatt hour volume, if you follow me?","I think we commented on some of the peaks, actually, last quarter. But, I'll let maybe Maureen Borkowski talk about the overall system peaks that we saw.     Yes, from a system standpoint, we did set a new all-time peak, being that 2008, I believe, was the previous all-time. Within the two individual systems, either Ameren Illinois or Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois set a new peak, but Ameren Missouri did not exceed its all-time peak."
"Okay. Then just ﬁnally, given this outlook that we've seen around the country and memories of the gas industry, LBCs and how it took some to come around to decoupling. Any thoughts there about ways to mitigate the potential issue that we might be seeing here? Also, considering that it seems that Missouri seems to have -- and other jurisdictions around the country want to have - - conservation, and what have you -- any thoughts on decoupling? Or how should we think about that and how you guys are approaching that issue?","Paul, this is Warner, I can speak for Missouri. Certainly we don't rule decoupling out. In fact, there's been discussions at the Commission as to whether decoupling is an approach forward. So, there's no formal docket on that, but that's certainly one thing we look at. In part, that's why we took the steps that we did and were able to achieve a meaningful enhancement for energy eﬃciency. That was a meaningful step change, because absent that, those energy eﬃciency programs really could not have moved forward. So, you look at decoupling, you may look at   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   other regulatory mechanisms that would try and address energy eﬃciency issues or conservation issues. It's not something that's imminent. But, it's certainly something that's on our list of things that we have to continue to look at; as is, as you rightfully point out, the environment changes a bit from what we've seen in the past. Ultimately, what we're pushing for and trying to do in Missouri, and certainly Illinois, is to do what we can to promote economic development; to try and get growth, not just from our residential, commercial. But, also to get investment made in the state, so we can put people back to work and actually get electric sales growth from that perspective as well."
"Do you have any ratio associated with GDP that you can share with us that you're expecting in terms of that? In terms of what percent -- if we have a 2% GDP growth, what that would translate in terms of electric growth -- do you guys have that estimation or --?","Yes, I don't have it at my ﬁngertips, an updated one. But, like I said, I think overall we certainly are expecting net of energy eﬃciency that relationship, that ratio, to be less than it historically has been. But nonetheless still positive."
