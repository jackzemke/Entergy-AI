Question,Answer
"Just with respect to the long-term earnings growth rate and your comments regarding the legislation and Noranda, I guess, it seems like you were suggesting that Noranda might be a temporary situation, and that you expected that it might change. I was just wondering is Noranda in the long-term guidance, Noranda coming back that is, or how should we think about that?","Sure, Paul. This is Marty. You may recall, when we gave the long-term guidance outlook back in February, we, number one said, we expected 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth from 2016 through 2020. And the foundational element of that, of course, is the 6.5% rate base growth that we have, which we showed from 2015 to 2020. But importantly, when we talked about that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth, we were basing that oﬀ of an adjusted 2016 EPS guidance of $2.63. Obviously, if you took our guidance for this year, the midpoint is $2.50, but we added to that the impact we estimated at that time of the Noranda outage, which was $0.13 at that time to get to an adjusted midpoint of $2.63 and then base the earnings guidance oﬀ of that.  And the reason we did that is that we do believe the impact of Noranda's outage on our earnings to be temporary. And, as we mentioned on the call, we do expect to ﬁle a Missouri rate case in early July of this year. We expect that that rate case will reﬂect the reduced usage by   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Noranda, and as our rates are adjusted next year, then the temporary impact of this earnings decline from the outage would be erased. So that's how we expect it to go. And so long-term in terms of our earnings growth guidance, Noranda may be there or Noranda may not be there. We're not speculating on that, but we do believe that through the rate case process, that the impact of the outage will be mitigated."
"Okay. That makes sense. And just in terms of the legislation, as I recall also, your earnings growth rate is not dependent upon Missouri legislation getting enacted. Is that still the case?","Yes. That's absolutely right. We said that in February, and we stand by that. As you know, the overall 6.5% rate base growth is the foundation. We've got about 2% growth forecasted for Missouri over that period of time. And we do believe both that rate base growth as well as our earnings growth expectation of 5% to 8% can be achieved without the need for legislation in Missouri."
"How should we think about this tax beneﬁt? I mean, how do you sort of model it? It sounds like there was obviously a beneﬁt this year, but I mean, just in general, how do we factor in this new guidance associated with the taxes?","You know, Paul, it's a good question. I think going forward, continuing to think about that 38% eﬀective tax rate is probably the right way to think about it, but to be aware that there could be some variation, up or down, from year-to-year based upon this new accounting guidance. And as mentioned on the call, what it will really be a function of is what the fair value is of long-term share-based compensation is at the time it vests versus what's been reﬂected in book expense over the three years, and as it relates to our plans over the three year vesting period.  And that can create a little bit of volatility in the eﬀective rate. In this particular period, as you see, the value of what vested was greater than what had been recognized in expense over the past three years. And therefore, the tax beneﬁt was greater than the eﬀective tax rate reﬂected over the past few years. So we ended up with a beneﬁt this year. But as noted on the talking points, it could be a beneﬁt or it could be a detriment. But I think, in the absence of any further information, I think I'd expect that 38% eﬀective tax rate.  As it relates to this year, that item had a discrete impact on the ﬁrst quarter, so it lowered the ﬁrst quarter eﬀective tax rate. At the end of the year, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the eﬀective tax rate to be around 35%, which would imply over the remainder of this year in the remaining three quarters, an eﬀective rate somewhere between 37% and 38%."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. And then just ﬁnally on the Mark Twain Transmission ruling, this idea that you have to go back to the counties to get approval there, county consent, there was some discussion at the PSC that that was going to probably lead to more litigation in the court system. I just wonder if you could sort of elaborate a little bit on how you see that.","It's Maureen Borkowski. Yeah, at this point in time, we are fully expecting just to go to each county and present the evidence, really, their statutory obligation in each county is to ensure that the transmission line doesn't have any impact on the user safety of public roadways. So we will put that packet of information together for each county and pursue getting their assent when we make that demonstration. So at this point in time, we're not anticipating any additional litigation in that regard."
"Great. Thank you. Quite well. So, perhaps following a little bit up on the last round of questions here. Can you elaborate a little bit on the speciﬁc diﬀerences in the statistics between Missouri and Illinois? You started oﬀ your remarks elaborating on Illinois, but just how do the two compare? And then, what are kind of tangible projects that would be on the table if you were to succeed either this year or next year under a new legislative framework?","Yeah, Julien, this is Marty. Could you please state your ﬁrst question, we're not clear what statistics you're referring to?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Well, I suppose, what are the reliability statistics, the diﬀerentials between Illinois and Missouri? Just to get a sense as to what the – what are you aspiring to Missouri versus Illinois? And then, or perhaps to boot with that, what are the discrete intangible projects that you're evaluating should you be able to get legislation this year or next year?","Yeah, Paul, (sic) [Julien] this is Warner. I think a couple of things. Number one, by and large Illinois has clearly made progress and an improvement in reliability as well as is responding to outage duration as a result of the Grid Modernization Project.  By and large, what you're seeing between the two jurisdictions that they are moving closer in terms of what their overall reliability and ultimate responsiveness to outages are. And so, Illinois will continue. They have speciﬁc metrics that they have to hit as part of the Grid Modernization Act and they'll continue to pursue that. As part of the legislative eﬀort in Missouri, there were speciﬁc performance metrics that are put out there as well for reliability and that was in the legislation. I think importantly, what really we were focused on, we'll continue to be focused on in Missouri is to address the aging infrastructure.  So, what are the kind of things that we would think about doing well? We would certainly be doing many of the things that you're seeing over in Illinois, investing in smart meters. Missouri needs to do that, and it's an opportunity, not just for our customers ultimately to use the more advanced meters. It's investing in the smarter grid, whether it'd be on the power lines, whether it'd be in automating much of the grid compared to where it is today, substations, all these things are very important and things that we're doing in Illinois that we'll be focused on doing in Missouri.  We would also, as part of the legislative eﬀort would be looking at the generation portfolio. Clearly, have aging infrastructure there and we could do improvements in a more timely fashion, we think in our generating power plants as well as invest in renewable energy, which was a signiﬁcant aspect of this Bill. So when you put all those things together, these are things that we would be focused on in Missouri, should we get legislation passed that would support that investment, and those are the kind of things we're going to continue to talk about with policymakers, both the remaining part of this session, as well as frankly moving into next year, both during the rate case as well as preparing for the next legislative session."
"Got it. Excellent. And then turning my attention to Illinois, speciﬁcally here we've seen a lot of retirements in the last few weeks here. Can you comment at all where you are in the process of evaluating trends, any requisite transmission upgrades for MISO...","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah, we're going to have Maureen Borkowski, so she can jump in as we've seen some of these retirements. We think there are some transmission opportunities. And so Maureen, why don't you to jump in and talk a little bit about some of those?     Yeah. It's little too early to be speciﬁc about what projects, but process-wise when a generator applies to MISO to shutdown even on interim basis, there is a study that's done by our transmission planner, so if it generate on our system to determine what the transmission needs would be to make sure the system can still operate reliably. So there is certainly the potential as these reported shutdowns are studied for additional transmission investment. And the one thing I would point out is that, because any needed investment here would be for reliability purposes, that would be outside of the competitive process, and it would be Ameren's own company, that would be making any investment that was identiﬁed."
"I'm sure, nor am I. A last quick question on Missouri in the rate case, any changes in the regulatory framework that you would be seeking in this? And also do you have any initial estimate on what the rate impact would be?","Julien, this is Warner again. I think a couple of things; it would be premature for us to say if we're going to do something special from a regulatory framework perspective. Every time, we move into a rate case, we step back and say okay, what from a policy perspective things that we want to pursue. So, we'll step-back and think about that. And in terms of the overall rate increase, yeah, it too is premature. You'll see a lot of that here coming up very soon in early July, we'll give you all the speciﬁcs. And then as we move forward in the rest of the year, we'll explain the case in more detail to you and the rest our shareholders."
"You mentioned growth in Missouri of 2%, is that EPS or rate base or both?","Yeah, Paul, this is Marty, that 2% I was referencing was rate base. So overall, we're expecting 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. In Missouri, we expect it to be 2% compound annual rate base growth. So really not commenting speciﬁcally there on earnings, but overall, I would say that 6.5% rate base growth is sort of the midpoint of our long-term earnings per share growth guidance of 5% to 8%. So, consistent with what we've talked about in prior quarters, I mean the bulk of that growth is coming in our FERC-regulated transmission and our Illinois electric and Illinois gas distribution businesses, where we're allocating a signiﬁcant amount of capital because of the constructive regulation we have in those jurisdictions."
"And then in February, I think you indicated that you might pursue an accounting order of some sort for Noranda, or other means to rectify the situation, where does that stand, or is it just going to be through a rate case?","Sure, yeah. Now, good memory, good recollection. We laid that out there as one of the options that we would have in terms of ensuring, to say, impact to be temporary. However, that's really   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   not needed if the plan is to ﬁle a rate case. We'll make the appropriate request in the context of the rate case we ﬁle in early July, and therefore that accounting authority order would not be needed. So, as we said in the call, that is our plan as we sit here today is to ﬁle that rate case in early July."
And so we model in $0.075 drag for Noranda in 2017?,"We haven't given that, but to your point, we always said on our call today as we expect the impact to be about $0.15 this year, and just to give you an idea of how that breaks down. This year, we expect – obviously, we experienced in the ﬁrst quarter about a $0.03 drag on earnings, we expect another $0.03 drag in the second quarter, $0.06 in the third quarter, and then $0.03 again in the ﬁnal quarter of the year in the fourth quarter.  So, through the ﬁrst half of this year, about $0.06. To your point, Noranda was up and running to some extent in the ﬁrst quarter. So, I would say an impact in the order of $0.07 – $0.06 to $0.07 in the early half of next year until we can get rates updated, is probably a fair assumption."
"And why is 3Q so heavily weighted, you had summer rates or...?","Yes. Noranda, and we talked about this at some length in our February call, Noranda has diﬀerential in rates, so between October and May of each year, the rate has been $31, and during – per megawatt hour in June to September about $46. So it had diﬀerential, I'll call them, winter and summer rates, and so there is a diﬀerentiated impact in those various quarters."
"Hi, good morning. This is Ashar. Marty, one thing, which I read in the Q, which I was a little bit surprised, was that the change in the FAC, of course, I knew there was some transmission earnings, I guess, that we don't get recovery on a timely basis. But you mentioned that in 2016 that could be a gap of like $20 million. So as we ﬁle the case next year, is there some way that this gap can be minimized to kind of zero or something to be changed? I'm trying to kind of like   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   put that into my model, is there some way that in this next case ﬁling that this regulatory lag can be eliminated?","Sure, Ashar. What you're referring to in the Q, I believe, is that we actually lay out what the amount was that was actually included in rates when rates were set, and then contrast that with the transmission costs that we're actually experiencing in 2016. And so there is a diﬀerential there. The transmission costs have grown. During our last rate case transmission cost will renew from recovery in the FAC. And that's an element of lag that we're experiencing. So you would expect as we go to ﬁle this next rate case that we would update our cost of service for the transmission costs that we're incurring. And through the rate case process, you would expect then that increased cost would be incorporated into the revenue requirement."
"But my question is, there is some way to, because I'm assuming the transmission costs are going to keep on going up. So, is this going to be a repeat issue like a year after the next rate case we will again have under recovery, or is this just something which is happening this year? That's what I am trying to kind of like gather.","You know, Ashar, in the absence of a change in the regulatory framework, or some mechanism to avoid that, there would be continuing drag on earnings or regulatory lag associated with that item. So it's something that certainly we'll consider as we go into this next rate case is how to deal with that. But absolutely, at this point in time, it is not incorporated into the FAC.  I'd remind you, Ashar, that overall, we continue to work very hard to earn as close to our allowed return as we can. You know we have had that lag from transmission since the last rate case, and we've been working hard to do what we can to ﬁnd cost reductions in other areas.  I mentioned in the guidance earlier this year that year-over-year as we move from 2015 to 2016, that we expect overall our operations and maintenance expenses to be down in Missouri. And when you normalize for the Callaway refueling and remove the eﬀect of Noranda, we expect to earn within 50 basis points of the allowed this year. So in isolation, absolutely yes, the increases in transmission costs are creating lag for us."
Could you remind us of the test year in the most recently concluded Missouri rate case?,"Yeah, I think it was – you might look, I think it was in 2015, but I can't remember what the exact cut-oﬀ date was. I think I'll let Doug maybe address it.     Yeah. The test year was the 12 months ended March 31 of 2015, but then a number of things were updated through the end of the year. Am I giving the year wrong there, 2014, I'm sorry, March, end of March 2014 was the test year, and then we updated for a rate base in a number of items through the end of 2014.     Correct.     And the rates went into eﬀect in May of 2015, late May."
"Okay. So, I guess, if we wanted to kind of calculate the incremental net plant that you'll be seeking recovery of in the July rate case. Could we just back of the envelope take through year- end 2014 and grow with by the 2% CAGR?",Yeah. I think we'd have to give that one some thought and whether that simpliﬁed works or not.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)
"Got it. Okay. And I'm just curious, hypothetically speaking, what happens if you go through the Missouri rate case, you get new rates in eﬀect to reﬂect the lost Noranda sales and then Noranda resumes the plant? Is that just incremental excess sales and margin until your next rate case?","I don't know if I would assume that to be the case. As we work through the rate case, maybe there'll be clarity brought to that issue, but wouldn't want to speculate that there'd be some windfall that would be achieved as a result of that."
"Hey, just two questions. Just can you guys talk about just M&A and in the context of Ameren as a buyer?","So Andy, this is Warner. And so, a couple of things, just in general, as you know from a buyer perspective, obviously, you look in the past, we have been a buyer of M&A. But as I've said before and continue to say, our policy has been we don't really kind of get into the speciﬁcs or comment on speculative transactions or M&A activities just in general, that's not very constructive. As you know, we've grown in the past through acquisitions. But to be clear, our   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   current plan is focused on the plan that I laid out before, and that's on the organic growth in our regulated business. We plan to deliver strong earnings growth that I outlined, and that's driven by the rate base growth, of course.  And with our strong dividend, we believe we'll deliver the superior value to our shareholders and ultimately, to customers, too. And so, M&As happening in our space, so it doesn't surprise us that there continues to be some level of consolidation. And then, in particular, we continue to be attentive to things going on in our space like other companies, but whether we're a buyer or anything, that probably takes it one step too far other than just what we've done in the past."
"Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, the second question I have is just regarding Missouri Commission. What's the thinking now since legislation is not getting done, that the Commission may do some type of workshops this summer to maybe address some of the things in the legislation?","So Andy, this is Warner and I'll ask Michael Moehn to speak up as well. I think that there is – whether there is going to be a speciﬁc workshop, I don't think there is anything been decided in particular, and there's always a possibility. But now I think the Commission's come out with a speciﬁc statement or ruling that they plan on doing that. Michael, I don't know – I'll let you...     Yeah, I think that's right, Warner. The Commission remains focused on trying to help deal with this regulatory lag issue and I think that that could potentially be an outcome to a work-through the summer to help gain some additional support with respect to what we're trying to do here in Missouri."
"Hi. Just really quickly, I think you guys mentioned the potential for non-comprehensive legislation. In other words, you guys mentioned that you got conﬁdence that legislation was likely this session, but that there – I was wondering if that meant that there was maybe some other sort of legislative opportunities that should you see potentially and if you could elaborate on that?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Sure, Paul, this is Warner. I guess a couple of things. Number one, the session, is I said, ends this Friday. So the reality is, time is very short. And while comprehensive performance based regulation legislation that will not pass, at least from our perspective. That doesn't mean that we still don't have conversations with key stakeholders to see if we can make some level of progress. It's probably not appropriate for me to speculate frankly to say what that may or may not look like, we'll know frankly in a few short days whether anything happens. But time is short, and so, while it may be diﬃcult, it doesn't mean that we're still not at the table talking to key stakeholders."
"Going back a while ago, the company used to talk about the – keeping the parent balance sheet pretty consistent with the utilities, and particularly Missouri that used to be kind of a focus in terms of just making sure there is not a big diﬀerence there. Is that still something that you need to kind of monitor and keep in balance, or not?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah. Steve, this is Marty. You know, look, I think still if you look at our slides that we've got out there today, we look to keep a parent company cap structure around on 50% equity. Today, I think in our Missouri rates, we've got a little north of 51% Illinois, about 50% the transmission business depending on where it's at anywhere from 51% to 56% with our hypothetical cap structure for ATXI. So, we have over time tried to keep those all in the ballpark in the general vicinity of one another, and generally keep strong balance sheets and solid credit ratings."
"Okay. But is that just a choice, or is there in Missouri kind of a risk or some kind of imputation if you were to have a lot more parent, or holdco leverage?","You know, well, I guess Steve, I'd say in Missouri, we really haven't experienced any sort of look- through kind of issue, if that's what you're getting at, I don't think over time in Missouri, we've been able to demonstrate that the equity in the utility balance sheet hasn't been funded by any debt at the parent. So, largely I would say it's by choice. We think it's good to keep all of those in general alignment. And like I said, keep a strong balance sheet, I do think as you look around the state, there is diﬀerent historical practices in terms of use of the parent company balance sheet, or utility-speciﬁc balance sheet, but it seems more situational versus some bright-line test or standard practice."
