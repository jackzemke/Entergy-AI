Question,Answer
"All right. Weather normalized sales growth. I was wondering if you could tell us where you are year to date? I remember you guys are being sort of ﬂattish, was your expectation. Just sort of if there's any update, in not just the actuals, but the outlook for going forward longer term?","Yes, sure Paul. As it relates to the sales growth, I think we came into this year, we talked about I think 0% to maybe even 0.5%, however, of growth as it related to residential and commercial sales. As we sit here today, I would say we are seeing sort of diﬀerent conditions in Missouri and Illinois. We are actually seeing that nearly 0.5% sales growth in residential and commercial sales in Missouri, despite, I would say, some spending that we have increased spending we've had this year in terms of energy eﬃciency. We've also seen industrial sales growth in Missouri this year of about 0.7%.Overall, we are pleased, I'd say, with that level of growth. As I said, we are spending quite a bit on energy eﬃciency, which I think longer term will keep that sales growth more muted and down in that 0% to 0.5% range. Some positives, I'd say we are seeing in Missouri. We you know this year growth in jobs in both services jobs, as well as you know goods-producing kind of jobs, manufacturing jobs. And I think that's some of what's coming through in terms of improved sales. So we do expect continued moderate growth, but oﬀset by continuing conservation and energy eﬃciency mitigating some of that sales growth. But year to date, happy with that. In Illinois, it is not been not quite as positive. We have seen that residential and commercial sales actually ﬂat to down about 0.5%, with commercial in fact being down a little more than residential, and industrial sales, as we've talked about on prior calls, down about 6.6% this year. And that does reﬂect, I'd say, some of the conditions we have being seen in Illinois. We have seen, in terms of jobs, we've seen goods-producing jobs down, though   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I would say services jobs have been up in Illinois. But the conditions just don't seem to be as good with some of the industrial sales down. We've seen declines at places like Caterpillar and heavy equipment, some of the metals areas, Alton Steel, US Steel, things like that. One important thing to remember though, Paul, about Illinois is that we do have the formula rates there. And there is -- we've got a formulaic ROE, but there also is a collar around that, plus or minus 50 basis points, which means that at the end of the day sales ﬂuctuations, positive or negative, are bound by that. So at most, I'd say a $0.025 positive or negative from any kind sales ﬂuctuations, whether they be weather-related or load-related."
"Great. Then just as a follow-up to that. The ambitious rate growth, just how do we think about customer bills? You mentioned energy eﬃciency. That's going to oﬀset, obviously, some of the impact. Some of the things you're doing are probably going to increase operational eﬃciencies. So you cannot just look at that as a ﬂat impact. Just in general, how we should think about how customers' bills will be impacted by this rate-based growth, given the low sales growth, but of course factoring in these operational and energy eﬃciency things that are going to be counteracting rate-based growth rate impacts, if you follow me?","Yes, sure. I'll talk a little bit about where are rate-based growth is. As you know, a lot of our rate- based growth is really in transmission, and we're also investing in the modernization action plan in Illinois, as I discussed. With respect to transmission, of course the centerpiece of our investment is really in MISO multi-value project where the beneﬁt of those projects is region- wide, and therefore the costs associated with those are spread region-wide, and do not necessarily then impact our Illinois customer rates, but more rates and costs regionally. So those get spread. As it relates to the modernization action plan and some of the investments we're making in Illinois, the Illinois bills of our customers are being impacted at the same time as they are by the rollout of these investments, but also by falling power prices that have taken place in MISO and have also been impacting customers' bills. So one of the things we are focused as it relates to those Illinois bills is really working to keep rates, annual rate increases, below, say, a 2.5% level. That is a focus there. Then in Missouri, you are right. Energy eﬃciency is -- we are rolling out meaningful energy eﬃciency programs. I think it is a well-constructed program for Ameren Missouri and for the state where certainly we are kept whole, if you will, for the energy eﬃciency eﬀorts, but customers have the opportunity to beneﬁt from those. Then we are also continuing, as we talked about on the call, focused on disciplined cost control. And we are focused on lean eﬀorts, really across our Missouri operations and across the Company, to try to keep any rate increases minimized."
"Hello guys. Congrats on a good quarter, and thank you for taking my call. Just thinking about the Missouri rate case you plan to ﬁle, does this imply you're expecting to under-earn [ph] by a good bit Missouri in 2014? Is there kind of -- how should we quantify the amount of lag that is happening in Missouri right now?","Well, as you know, Michael, thanks ago for joining us by the way, and your comments at the outset. As a relates to the Missouri rate case, it's -- the ﬁling of that rate case next year is not solely a commentary on earned returns. But certainly it's been driven by the things we talked about, making meaningful investments in the reactor head replacement as well in environmental controls for the Labadie plant. Clearly under Missouri's current framework, which does use historical cost, what we need to do as we think about those meaningful investments that will grow the rate base and being able to earn a fair return on those investments, will need to make a rate case ﬁling in a timely way to make sure we will cover those costs. And again position ourselves to earn a fair return. Those are really the drivers."
"Then is the bulk of the $320 million to $370 million for Callaway and Labadie, is that cost you will incur in 2014? When I think about Union Electric's kind of CapEx of directionally $500 million to $600 million, that this makes up a the large portion of it?","Yes, it is a large portion. Some of those costs, you do not start those projects necessarily in 2014. So we've been certainly spending some, say, towards that reactor head already. But yes, they will hit largely in 2014, and again be in service by the end of 2014.,"
"Got it. Last question. In the quarter, or maybe more importantly year to date for 2013, what was the earnings contribution for the FERC-regulated transmission?","Michael, I will see if Doug can dig that out. I do not have that here in front of me and do not know it oﬀ the top of my head."
"This is Paul from (inaudible) here. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on the impacts of the closing of the Paducah processing plant? How do see this impacting the outlook for Joppa as well as power prices and demand in the region, and also if you can mentioned the impacts to your ﬁnancials?","Yes. Paul, this is Marty. As it relates to the Paducah facility and the impact on Joppa, obviously the Joppa facility is one that is part of the portfolio that we're looking to sell to Dynegy. In terms of the impacts of the Paducah facility closing on our earnings, don't really have anything to report there. Overall, that merchant business this quarter versus last performed well. Availability was solid, capacity factors were solid at the plants. I think as we all know, power prices were down a little bit, down some this year versus last. But we came into the year pretty well hedged. Overall, the unit continues to perform well. I cannot really comment on how that facility closing would impact future years, and certainly expect that that plant to be part of the Dynegy IPH portfolio going forward."
Okay. Great. Quick follow-up. I believe you said you were assuming a 3.44% average for the Treasury yield. Could you quantify what the impact was for the Third Quarter and roughly the amount that was implied in that Fourth Quarter guidance?,"Well the amount that is implied in the Fourth Quarter guidance, Paul, really is in the 9.24%. When we talk about the 9.24%, it is really what we are expecting to be the average over the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   course of 2013. As we looked at the Blue Chip Consensus for next year, we see that going up to maybe 3.95% it for the 30-year Treasuries, which would put you at about a 9.75%. In terms of the impact on the ROE, you can kind of do the math. What we talked about is about 50 basis points is roughly $0.025. Depending upon what your expectation was, you can cut it take a look at you know what the impact is."
Good morning. In your prepared remarks you had talked about just growing the dividend. I was hoping you can walk us through the policy and your expectations going forward there? And then a follow-up.,"Yes sure. And so there, as we've discussed in the past, what the Board looks at is number of factors. But ﬁrst of all, getting this deal closed with the sale of the merchant business, which as we talked about, we expect the beneﬁt of that to be you more stability and certainty in terms of earnings and cash ﬂows going forward. That is an important step. Then looking at growth in the earnings and cash ﬂows of the regulated businesses going forward. We've talked about a payout range target to be in the range of 55% to 70% of our regulated earnings. Today we are at the upper end of that range. With our $1.60 earnings. But as we do grow the earnings from the regulated business, and we believe we have a good plan to do so. As we go those earnings and cash ﬂows, aspire to be able to then grow the dividend, and as that payout comes down into the range of 55% to 70% that I discussed."
"Okay. And then the follow-up question. I think you noted that earnings for this year at the Illinois utilities don't reﬂect the SP-9 impact, is that accurate?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, what the earnings reﬂect,, I guess I'm not follow you in terms of what you mean by does not reﬂect?"
"I guess there was some beneﬁts around the changes with the legislation earlier this year. I'm trying to ﬁgure out of that is Incorporated in your earnings for this year, or if that's more of a next year event, just giving timing?","No. I think that to the extent that the legislature clariﬁed its views on the way the Illinois formula (technical diﬃculties) that into our 2013 earnings expectation. So it is our expectation that the Illinois Commerce Commission, as they rule on 2013 reconciliation will, I guess, rule in line with the legislature's intent and ﬁndings is this last piece of legislation. That is reﬂecting in our 2013 earnings. We have not done anything in terms of going back in time and picking up any kind of beneﬁt for prior years that may come through appeals of the Commission's rulings for prior years. We did update 2013 earnings to reﬂect the provisions of that legislation."
"Okay. And then in terms of just regulatory lag in Illinois, can you just talk about where you expect that to be going forward? Or if there should not be any lag with the changes made?","No. Really should not be any lag. When you think about the formulaic rates going forward, there really should not be any lag. The legislation, we believe, is pretty prescriptive in terms of the costs that are picked up. Earlier this year we did lay out certain costs that were outside of the formulaic rate-making that would continue to be a drag but for continuing eﬀorts to reduce those costs, and we laid some of those costs out and we also identiﬁed those ones which we expect to go away over time. And then as it relates to the gas portion of the Illinois business, we have ﬁled a rate case as we discussed on the call with a 2014 forward test year. That forward test year is intended to minimize lag and some under-earnings that we are experiencing this year in the gas business. With the updated rates reﬂecting the 2014 costs and investments, that will minimize a lag next year, and then we also have the ability now with the legislation and the gas portion of the business to update rates monthly for incremental investments in our infrastructure that are beyond those reﬂected in the forward test year. That also will help going forward as we deploy capital in the gas portion of the business to make sure we have an opportunity to earn a fair return there. Then the other portion of the Illinois business is continues to be transmission, where we still have transmission that is FERC-regulated transmission in the Ameren Illinois business, and of course we have formula rates there. And again, do not experience lag as it relates to the transmission business. All in all, I would say in Illinois, very little in terms of ongoing regulatory lag."
"Good morning, and thanks. If I can go over these factors that you pointed out, Marty. So if I take the midpoint of the guidance for this year, which is I guess now $2.05, you kind of mentioned there is like $0.07 that doesn't come in because of the (technical diﬃculties) $0.03 because the weather's been normal. So a more normalized number would be like to $2.15 if I add those $0.10 back. And then you were saying that the parent and other should go from a negative $0.20 to somewhere between $0.10 and $0.15. So say now you pick up on the $0.07, the midpoint of that. So you are starting at $2.22 normalized, and on top of that we should add rate- based growth for the distribution and transmission business. Am I doing my math right?","Yes. All your math is correct. Those are pieces of information provided. The midpoint, as you point out, is $2.05. Our range is $2.00 and $2.10. I'd say as we sit here today, we feel good about being maybe even a couple of cents into the top half of the range. So your $2.05 is a good starting point. You are right, we've had $0.07 of negative impact this year, one time from the FAC. Weather, one number, you mentioned $0.03 weather. I think year to date it's probably $0.02 of negative weather. So you're probably talking about $0.09 there to add back, which you did appropriately. You are absolutely right. We expect to reduce those parent company and other costs, which we estimate to be about $0.20 for this year down to the range of $0.10 to $0.15 next year. The things you're adding back are correct."
"Just there was this independent market monitor report from MISO that companies have been talking about in terms of potential impact on reliability and reserve margin decrease. Rather, I guess, under certain circumstances, rather sort of dramatic decrease, perhaps in reserve margin has been discussed. I was just thinking, how you guys see that? I'm sure you guys have reviewed it. Obviously for Illinois, the impact is a little bit diﬀerent since you do not own generation. But just how you see that in terms of Missouri, and just any thoughts you have on that? How that may or may not be in your rate-base growth forecast right now, if you follow me, in terms of potential resolution of that, or any comments you have on that, I would be interested in.","Laughter [ph]. Yes, Paul. I think as it relates to the issue you're referring to, we've had a long- standing position that we do believe that within MISO we do need to get beyond this sort of annual capacity construct. That really more of multi-year, longer term price signals are appropriate to incentivize investment and make sure that we have good reserve margins within MISO. It really comes down to being important, we believe, from a reliability standpoint. So our positions on those factors have not changed over time. In terms of our Missouri operations, we obviously operate a good strong portfolio of assets that are performing well. As we think longer term, as you've see in our ﬁve-year investment plans right now do not have anything in there in terms of meaningful change in our generation mix. But as we think longer term, we certainly do have an aging ﬂeet of generating units. And we will monitor all conditions, capacity, price conditions, and as well as the IRP process in Missouri, which as we've discussed before, I think it's late next year we will ﬁle another IRP with the Missouri Public Service Commission. At that time I think we will lay out our thinking about the options we have around our portfolio long term."
"Okay. But I mean, I guess what are just a more general comment in terms of this potential rather remarkable reserve margin potential that, under certain circumstances, could theoretically show up? Obviously you guys feel reliability is important. Is not clear to me exactly what service territory would be impacted or who would be deﬁcient. I am sort of wondering, if there's any -- if you feel that there is any issue that require sort of a more rapid response?","Well we don't. As it relates to Missouri, which I guess from your question, we do not see a deﬁciency in our Missouri resources. I mean, we do have adequate resources in our Missouri business to meet our Missouri load obligations. So we do not see anything there. I think one of the things we've said, Paul, honestly is that with the reserve margins today, we believe are high within MISO. At what point we get to critical conditions, is uncertain. We've certainly looked at   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   what has been put forward by the market monitor and the committees that have reported out to MISO. And certainly those are valid concerns that are being raised. So we do think it is important that MISO take action to -- with regard to its capacity construct and move, as I've said earlier, into having a multi-year capacity construct. As it relates to Missouri, certainly do not see any kind of condition of emergency or urgency as it relates to our resources there."
"Okay. What about Illinois? I know that you are not responsible for it. But just in general, do you see that as that Zone 4 as being problematic? And I guess does that maybe lead to maybe additional transmission issues, or potential investment, or just any thought there?","Well, obviously we are investing a lot in transmission. I don't know if it will lead to incremental transmission in the near term. But our concerns about the capacity market and our continued belief that it is important from a reliability standpoint to have a multi-year capacity construct does get to Illinois and making sure that in Illinois, where it is a deregulated market, that the right price signals are sent over time to incentivize investment in generation so that there are resources available as Illinois goes out to -- and customers in Illinois go out to procure the power capacity that they need. So again, Paul, I am not by any means saying that there is an emergency situation, necessarily. But I think the points that are being raised at MISO are the right points to debate and consider as we think about a capacity construct going forward and the need for reliability in Illinois, and throughout MISO."
"Hi. Good morning, guys. Just had a question about the underlying O&M growth that you've seen for this year? I know there was some lumpy items. What do you guys see going forward at the utilities in terms of maybe an O&M growth rate? You've got this comment about continued discipline and cost management. Is there a target in mind? What are your thoughts around that?","Yes we have not really -- Bill, thanks for your question. We have not really communicated, I would say, a target. Our goal, as we've said repeatedly, is to, in Missouri for example, is to keep our earned returns very close, as close as we can, to our allowed returns and to really try to minimize that impacts of regulatory lag. So as I said earlier, we continue to look for ways to streamline our operations to become more eﬃcient. I mentioned our lean eﬀorts, which we believe over time will produce savings, but really have not communicated, I would say, any   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   speciﬁc targets or expectations. In Illinois, we continue to be focused on running eﬃcient lean operations there as well. Earlier the question came up about customer bills, and we are investing and improving the infrastructure in Illinois for the beneﬁt of our customers. It's creating jobs as well. But one of the things we are doing is continuing to work to be eﬃcient in terms of our operations and maintenance spending. As we rollout those investments to again minimize the overall impact on our customers' bills. So really across the operations, we are looking to operate in a very disciplined way."
"Okay, thanks. Then I guess just at the parent, I know outside of the reﬁnancing of the parent debt next year that will drive some of the cost savings, what are the other areas that you guys are focused on to reduce the parent drag?","Yes. I talked earlier in the year about as much as $30 million or so of costs that were G&A costs, if you will, that had been allocated over time to merchant business. A signiﬁcant amount of those are really direct costs, costs that we were incurring at a parent level that were directly associated with the merchant business. As we get to closure there, those costs, those direct support costs will be eliminated. To the extent that there were other costs that were being allocated, we've had signiﬁcant eﬀorts under way over the past several months to identify ways to be able to eliminate those cost as well. And that progress, that work has been going very smoothly and very well. So those targets that we talked about, getting $0.20 down to $0.10 to $0.15 next year, we feel very good about, and then as we look to 2015, what we talked about on this call is getting those costs down even lower as those costs are reduced and rationalized and we get the full-year beneﬁt of a reﬁnancing next year. As have said before that we expect that we might be able to get those -- we'd be able to get those cost, not might, we'd be able to get those costs down under $0.10 in the 2015 time frame."
"On the reﬁnancing, do you expect to reﬁnance the full $425 million, or would there potentially be a lesser amount that's reﬁnanced? Or in terms of reducing the principal?","Actually, that is under consideration. We think that today, if you look at today's markets, that be able to reﬁnance that 8.875% debt today maybe at around the 2.5% mark. Favorable conditions as we sit here today, and big opportunity for interest savings. What amount of that we do, sort of in a longer term versus a short term reﬁnancing is under consideration. We will let you know when we've got a speciﬁc view on that. But we do have, as you know, we have the full capacity under our credit facilities available to us today. We've got no borrowings under those. So we have the ﬂexibility with respect to that $425 million to do some of that long-term and some of the on a short-term basis as well."
"My apologies. Two items. One on O&M. Can you walk us through how the Callaway outage schedules impact O&M? I think Impacted last year, and then this year, and what the impact is on 2014? Does that get capitalized, or is that all kind of following through and therefore you see some abnormal trends rather than just steady year-over-year changes in O&M?","Michael, that is true. I know the accounting practices vary across the industry. But we do expense the full cost of the operations and maintenance expense for the Callaway refueling in the period that that outage occurs. So we have the full Callaway refueling expenses expensed earlier this year. So we did have a refueling in the spring of this year. The next one, as I sort of referred to earlier on the call, is in the fall of 2014. We certainly have signiﬁcant capital expenditures at the time that I mentioned. We also have the refueling and maintenance outage O&M cost that we will incur there at the end of 2014. And then 2015 we have no scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. So 2015 would not have any refueling and maintenance outage cost in it."
"Got it. So would the -- because it is a bigger or more complex outage that's happening in the fall 2014 because you are doing the extensive capital work, will the O&M piece of that outage be diﬀerent than a normal refueling outage? Or will some of it get capitalized, some will be O&M? I'm just trying to think about, as you start to give drivers for 2014, how the Callaway refueling schedule will impact things?","Michael, I think sitting here today, we are not giving out our 2014 guidance. I will give more speciﬁcity when we do along the Callaway outage. However, I do not believe that the 2014 O&M costs are expected to be materially diﬀerent than the 2013 costs."
"Okay, and when you did the 2013 costs, what was the cost of that outage that happened in the spring?","This is Doug. It is in the Q. I do not have it precisely. Maybe we can --      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   We will try to dig that one out for you too, Michael. But as Doug said, it's in the -- we did disclose that in the --     When the Q is ﬁled, it will be clearly in there."
"Guys, thank you. As a fellow fan, sorry about the Cardinals, but it was a great year.","Laughter [ph], We appreciate that.  Operator  Mr. Fischer, there are no further questions at this time.
