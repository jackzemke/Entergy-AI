Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for all the extensive commentary. Hope you all are doing well.","Yeah. Thank you, Julien. Hope you're doing well as well. Good to hear your voice."
"Likewise. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on Missouri. And I mean, this is mostly in context of 1Q, you had a number of, call it, higher expenses. You've listed them out fairly in some detail. How do you think about those cascading through the course of the year and into '21? I imagine much of it like weather and onetime contributions are pretty limited to 1Q '20. But separately from focusing on higher expense, how do you think about the totality of O&M opportunities to oﬀset the details that you provided on the lower 2.5% sales altogether?","Perfect. Thank you. Good morning, Julien, this is Michael. So I'll take a stab at this and then certainly Warner can add anything as well. But I mean, if I heard you right, you broke up a little bit there, but in terms of the higher costs that we saw in the ﬁrst quarter, clearly, we're impacted by this company-owned life insurance, which we indicated in there, so that obviously provided a headwind. As you think back in terms of where we were at the beginning of the year, we talked about O&M costs being higher in general. We didn't guide to a speciﬁc number, we just said that we were going to be higher. Obviously, you have these headwinds that are occurring in the ﬁrst quarter. As we think about all these COVID-related issues that we outlined in terms of what's going on with sales and bad debt, we are clearly focused on guiding to a lower O&M number today. And so hopefully, it gives you some context, not giving you the speciﬁcs of it. But clearly, we were higher O&M going into the year, got these headwinds. We've taken a number of actions, as Warner said, in terms of just managing headcount, obviously travel, conferences, watching overtime where we can, all those kind of things to make sure that we can keep a ﬁrm grasp on this.     Yeah. I think, Michael, you hit it right. So look, we're guiding down now from O&M expenses from where they were last year. And look, in looking at some of those things, Julien, clearly, we're mindful of several things. Of course, we're mindful of the expected impacts of COVID-19, which Michael did a nice job of outlining before. But of course, we're also mindful that we need to make sure we're delivering safe and reliable service to our customers. But clearly, we never   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   lose our focus to earn as close to allowed return as possible. So when we think about all those things and providing that guidance, that's how we think about the O&M actions that we've taken."
Got it. Okay. But no speciﬁc pinpoint number here for the total -- totality of the year. And then a follow-up --,"Yes, not at this point. I think we're going to continue to monitor it. And as you can appreciate here, we're here in the ﬁrst quarter. And so we'll continue to monitor operations for the rest of the year, so yes. But that gives you, I think, a good sense of the direction that we're headed."
"Absolutely. And then related to this, if I can, what about the Missouri's rate case strategy? I know you put a bullet in your slides about that, but can you elaborate on your thinking today? And again, also being cognizant that, yes, we're still in the ﬁrst quarter here in terms of results, but how are you at least conceptually thinking about approaching it?","Yeah. So Julien, just a couple of thoughts there. And then Marty, who's joining us remotely, all of our leaders, just so you know, our presidents are joining us remotely today as we continue to make sure we do the proper social distancing. So look, I think, at the end of the day, really no decision has been made at this time. But clearly, when you think about your next rate case ﬁling, there are several things you have to think about. And certainly, the wind projects, right, which we've talked about on the call, but we also have to be mindful of the implications and impacts of COVID-19. And so those coupled with the fact that we just completed our last rate review, and those are some of the things that you would put on the list in terms of making a ﬁnal determination there. And Marty, I know that you're on, anything that you would add to some of the things that you and your team are kicking around?     Well, Warren, you hit on a couple of the key ones. I think, Julien, when you look back at our last rate review ﬁling, it was really to set up the timing for this next one, given the wind projects that we have going into service later this year, so those projects will still be top of mind in terms of getting those completed and making sure we think about how to time a rate case around those. Of course, Senate Bill 564, the Plan and Service Accounting, has really provided us some better ﬂexibility on capital expenditures and the ability to be able to defer depreciation, return and get full recovery, so that's a consideration.  But as Warner said, we feel good about the constructive rate settlement that we just had in this past rate review. I think that puts us in a good position to really think about the timing going forward. COVID-19, obviously, having impacts on our customers and our business, as Warner   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   mentioned. And so all of those will be considerations as well as other cost of service considerations that will go into it. So I think all of that considered just means that we'll be thinking about really the best timing for this next rate review."
"So just starting oﬀ with the wind project, appreciate the update there. Could you speak to any regulatory obligations with regards to the in-service dates? And maybe just a little bit more color with the line of sight to the potential end of year versus a slight push into Q1 for the 300 megawatts?","Yes. So this is Warner. So in terms of regulatory obligations, really none by the end of this year. Of course, we're very focused on getting those done in a timely fashion, as we outlined during the call. But if some of the projects -- and we talked about, at this time, we think there's a possibility for $100 million of that second project to get pushed into 2021. That doesn't cause any particular regulatory challenges for us. So that's how I see that.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Yeah. I mean, you got the renewable standard here in the state of Missouri. You got 15% by 2021, but we'll be in compliance with that. That's what Warner is saying that no issues with that."
"Great. Thank you. And then on bad debt expense, could you speak to a little bit about trends from maybe '08, '09 and what you're baking into guidance for 2020?","Yeah, Michael, why don't you take that one, please?     Yes, you bet. So look, we're looking and mindful of everything that's happening to the customers. They're looking at in terms of LIHEAP is providing, obviously, an unprecedented amount of dollars here. I think Warren mentioned as well that we have dollars that are being allocated, obviously, to energy assistance as well. But as we step back and look at and going back to '08, '09, you're right, I think that's a great place for us to spend some time. I mean, we've done a nice job of driving down bad debt expense over time. We're probably at about $8 million today in bad debt expense. If you think about '08, '09 time frame, you're probably closer to $14 million, $15 million. So that's probably a good proxy to think about in terms of a couple of cents, about $6 million in terms of headwind potentially associated with bad debt expense."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, alright, I'm managing. Just on your comments, you mentioned that the long-term growth had certain expectations with respect to the 30-year treasury. And I know you guys have legislation pending in Illinois, which you mentioned and went over. But how should we think about what the long-term growth rate is if we do have this 30-year treasury where it is at? And also just your rate base growth seems to be unchanged and what have you. How should we think about what your expectation is, absent any legislation changing what the treasury -- the 30-year treasury would be?","So Michael, why don't you address sort of the overall 30-year treasury, and then maybe I can jump in and talk about the potential allocation of capital and -- okay?     Okay. Got it. I appreciate the question. I think as you think about the long-term guidance, and if you think about the 350 as the midpoint for 2020 and you take the 6% to 8% oﬀ of that, Paul, I mean, you get to about a $0.35 range out there in 2024, so a decent size range. And I think that range accommodates a number of things, which I think Warner maybe even referred to earlier. I mean, it refers potential treasury outcomes, certainly rate case outcomes, the timing of CapEx, other things. I mean, there are a number of levers that can be pulled over time.  I would remind you a couple of, I think, key data points just to keep in mind. I mean, for every 50 basis points move in that distribution business, it's worth about -- it's an impact of about $0.035. And the other thing to keep in mind, too, is, I mean, as you think about how we're allocating capital today and where rate base growth is going over time, I mean, you get out to 2024, that Illinois distribution business is only about 18% of the overall rate base. So those are things just to keep in the back of your mind as you think about diﬀerent impacts associated with that $0.35 range. I don't know if Warner --     I think that's a good point. So maybe I'll add then a little bit more color because you had a speciﬁc question around how we might think about our investments in Illinois. So look, we're mindful of the fact that our return on equity in Illinois is below industry averages. And I mean, that's why we're supporting legislation that's going to add 100 basis points to the current 580 basis points to the 30-year treasury. And so at the same time, too, we recognized that we're currently in an, frankly, unprecedented period in our country's history that's obviously driving historically low interest rates.  And so what I would say is that, look, we're not going to have a knee-jerk reaction to our investment strategy because the investments that we've been making in Illinois have been delivering value to both our customers and shareholders. But look, we're also going to continue to monitor the situation. And at the same time, Rich and his team, they're going to be relentless and trying to make sure we pass what we think is really good legislation for our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly for our shareholders. And in so doing, we're going to continue to advocate for fair returns on those infrastructure investments. And then so doing, too, we think if we continue to make them, they're going to deliver a lot of value to our customers. So that's the color, that's in terms of how we think about it right now.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay. I mean -- and I appreciate the color. I'm just sort of wondering, though, if we don't get legislation and if the rate is so low, would you -- I mean, I would assume that there would probably be some change in how you would allocate capital. I mean, it is a pretty robust rate base growth that you have in those slides and stuﬀ where --","Sure. Like I said before, we're going to be mindful of our returns in our businesses. We always are mindful about how we allocate capital. We obviously are very thoughtful and strategic and so doing. But at the same time, as I sit here today, we're not going to be making any predictions or knee-jerk reactions."
"Okay. I'm sorry. Just on the COLI, you broke it out for Missouri. And I just was sort of -- just trying to understand why the Illinois distribution isn't aﬀected apparently by it? And could you just give us a little bit more color about how that COLI is distributed and -- I mean, not anything huge, if it's very complicated, don't bother your time, but just want to get more on that.","No worries. Good question. Certainly, it's not complicated. I mean, it really -- Illinois -- it doesn't impact the Illinois distribution business because of the formula rate nature of it. So where you do have a little bit of impact is on the Illinois natural gas side. And so really focused in on the primary piece of Missouri because that's where the biggest impact is just because of the nature of that regulatory regime."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Awesome. Thanks so much guys.,"You bet.     Thanks, Paul. Have a good day.  Operator  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, gentlemen. How are you doing?"
"Thank you guys. I appreciate it. Just following up real quickly on Paul's question. As you kind of look out at the reaﬃrmation of the 6% to 8% in the past, I know you guys have used kind of the forward curve for treasuries. Is that kind of what we should assume as embedded in the growth rate from here?","Yes. No, Paul -- no, Jim. Historically, I think we maybe did guide to that several years ago. I think we kind of moved away from that a bit ago. And so again, just we have various internal assumptions in there. And again, as Warner stated, when we have a lot of diﬀerent levers that we can pull, I know there's some sensitivity about just given, obviously, where that 30-year treasury sits today. But again, it's a $0.35 range, talked about the size of that overall distribution out there in 2024. I talked about the sensitivity to those rates. And so I think there are things that we continue to do to manage around that.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. I think, too, Michael, just to add. I mean, so don't lose sight of the slide that we show up there about the robust pipeline of investment that we have across all of our enterprises that goes not just beyond this ﬁrst ﬁve years, but the $36 billion in total over 10 years. So that's certainly a lever that we have. And of course, all along, we're mindful of customer aﬀordability and those types of things. So look, we don't -- we never say anything is a lay up, right? But at the same time, we're going to be very thoughtful in terms of how we manage the business that drives value for our customers and value for our shareholders."
"Got it. Okay. And I guess, just as a real quick follow-up. As you look at the range, I know that you aﬃrmed it today, but are you guys comfortable at this point in kind of talking about with your cost containment, and what you see for your sort of sales progression through the year through the various scenarios of kind of where you see yourself within that range? Would it be sort of at the midpoint, upper half, sort of lower half? Like how are you thinking about that?","Yeah, Jim. So this is Warner again. So I assume you're talking about our 2020 EPS guidance. And so look, consistent with our past practice, we just don't disclose where we're at within our guidance range, frankly, at any given time. And so the only thing I would say is that this team is focused and has a strong record of not just being focused but delivering within our guidance, and that's where we're going to continue to be focused in 2020."
Got it. Thank you very much for the time and hope everyone is safe and well.,"We are. Thank you very much. You do the same.  Operator  Thank you.
