Question,Answer
"I wanted to start with slide 22, the illustrative adjusted EBITDA for EWC, and how it ties into slide 12. You're showing a step down in EBITDA for the merchant business in 2014 even though we have quite a considerable O&M cut and a likely pick-up in capacity revenues in New York. I know that there's a reduction in energy prices but I'd still expect a bit of a stronger projected EBITDA for that business.","Well, the reality is that we're still facing lower prices overall. As Drew suggested, on a per megawatt-hour basis we're seeing a reduction.  While we're encouraged and we've seen uplift from the Lower Hudson Valley capacity zone. The fact is, in a lot of the other markets, speciﬁcally the New England market we're not getting appropriate rents in terms of capacity prices. So, net-net, you're correct, we are looking at a decline in total EBITDA for EWC for 2014."
That bar already fully incorporates cost cutting and MISO's projections for the capacity price uplift?,"I don't believe that it includes all of the HCM eﬀorts, but it does reﬂect our point of view on current market conditions."
"Okay. Then, on slide 12, could you just explain a little bit, what is this potential for portfolio management activities? What do you mean by those?","As we look at that portfolio, as Leo mentioned, we consider all options. We do this on a regular basis. Obviously, we look at a hold and optimize scenario, where we're taking the steps to reduce our costs and be as eﬃcient as we can at each and every facility.  We also explore market opportunities to determine if any asset or portfolio assets would be better owned by another party. And we also continually evaluate the potential for a shut-down of a facility. When we talk about options, those are the three diﬀerent areas that we constantly look at. That's similar to what we've always have done."
"Last one. We have those projections of O&M cuts, targeted projections by 2016. Can you explain to me the timing of this announcement, vis-a-vis your pending rate cases and ITC transaction? Should it facilitate the ITC deal and your pending rate cases? How will it actually be incorporated in the pending regulatory ﬁlings?","I'll let Rod take that. Rod West, who's our Chief Administrative Oﬃcer, all of the HCM eﬀort is being directed under his organization. So I'll let Rod take that.    To be direct in answering your question, the timing is not designed to facilitate or feed a regulatory point of view. The timing of the HCM announcement really does reﬂect where the Company's planning process has involved, to where we think we     have a clear point of view on the savings. And our conﬁdence around being able to articulate what we think the bottom line impact would be.  As we begin this process, Leo, I recall announced at EDI last year as we were formally beginning, to publicly, at least, execute on our point of view around MISO and ITC. We had perspectives around where the organization needed to be on a going- forward basis. As we evolved, as the analysts evolved, we felt more and more comfortable about when wed be able to communicate. The timing, it just reﬂects where we are."
"Good morning, guys. Following up on the cost cutting program and the numbers out there, the overall savings are up signiﬁcant relative to --. On the magnitude of cost savings, could you share a little more color on where you expect to ﬁnd the savings? We've seen past M&A transactions recently. Their savings have been in line or smaller than what you are talking about today. Trying to bucket those better would be helpful, I think.","Sure, Rod?    Dan, as we discussed in prior conversations, what you know and what we call the HCM process is centered around four work streams. Both Drew and Leo alluded to them.  The ﬁrst is the Oregon process. I think that one answers your question, in terms of where we think the lion's share of what we've communicated today rests, particularly as we look to what meaningful in 2013 going into 2014. Then you have comp beneﬁts, procurement costs, management, and then the non-employee-related operational expenses. The lion's share of the savings, order of magnitude, half to two-thirds perhaps comes from our Oregon in process point of view."
"You guys reiterated the 6% earnings growth in Utilities. That would then include the 2014, I guess? Was there a bit of a backﬁll on supporting that 6% growth? Or is that number actually biased higher because you'll have more savings in those numbers for next year?","We are not considering it added to the 6%, as I mentioned. There could be some small beneﬁt short term, but ultimately, we expect it to be recognized in ﬁlings when it's known and measurable within the regulatory process of Utilities. We're not counting it as incremental to the 6% target."
"On the ITC mitigation plan as proposed, how would you envisage those credits ﬂowing through the ﬁnancial statements, or not?","We're still looking at it. Preliminarily we would expect it would be reﬂected in the net revenue. It could change with ﬁnal orders that we ultimately get.    The only change that we would see is whether or not we would recognize a liability on the balance sheet for the ﬁrst ﬁve years. After that, everything is contingent, so it clearly wouldn't be a balance sheet liability. But at this point we expect it to ﬂow through in net revenue."
"And my second one, on page 12, under EWC, you mentioned depreciation as a driver for 2014 and then declining useful life of nuclear assets. Can you clarify the latter part of that statement?","That was related to potential change where currently we have accelerating depreciation, as we get closer and closer to the end of life of the units. We may make a change where we ﬂatten that out a bit. But I think that is the primarily thing we are talking about there."
So that would be beneﬁcial to earnings?,"Well, it would be beneﬁcial to the end tail of the earnings. It would be against earnings. It would be harmful to earnings."
Okay. Any idea how much that might be or is it small?,We don't have that information right now but we'll give you a additional details later.  Operator  Next to Andy Levi at Avon Capital.
"I'll go quick so you can get someone else in there. Getting back to the cost savings, on the EWC side, you had 35% to 40% of that segment would realize the cost savings. Then, as you said, you have the EBITDA on that slide coming down in 2014.  And then you were vague on whether ultimately the savings were going to be incorporated in 2014. Does that mean that we'll see them in 2015? I need clariﬁcation and then I have one other quick follow-up.","I think, Andy, the clariﬁcation was that the EBITDA number did not include HCM, but we would anticipate there would be some.  In 2014. The bulk of it you can expect to see for EWC in 2014."
"On the ITC Entergy deal, there are savings from the system agreements going away, right? And then there is savings. So, I'm wondering what the breakdown of that is.    I'm throwing out a number. In Louisiana, $100 million of rate mitigation that's going to the customer. What is the breakdown of that?","Andy, this is Theo. Are you referring to the avoided costs?"
"Thanks, guys. When I think about the HCM program in terms of its impact on your Utility businesses, should I think about this as being -- driving the ability for you guys to have a higher conﬁdence level in earning, at your authorized returns, across the jurisdictions prospectively? I think the guidance this year, for instance, presumes a signiﬁcant level of under-earnings.  So, the HCM program would have two beneﬁts. One, it would reduce the necessity for rate increases but also keep your costs proﬁle from creating regulatory lag? Is that the right way to think about it?","That's fair, Greg. The major component is to become more eﬃcient. And through that eﬃciency, we should end up with lower rates, lower costs, to the customers, and have a better shot at earning the rate of return that we're allowed. That's correct."
"Right. One follow-up, if you were to be ordered to implement the rate mitigation plans by establishing regulatory liabilities, as opposed to running it through the P&L. We should assume then that's an oﬀset to rate base, right? That lowers the rate base. Is that right?","Drew?     Well, we would only get to do that if we got a rate order or rate deferral. I would think of it more as a regulatory asset that we would be able to realize over time, on the one-time incurred costs."
"If you had a regulatory liability, that would ﬂow through as a contra-expense, but reduction in revenue. So, you'd wind up having an upfront write-down, and then there would be a cash impact as you ﬂowed the credits back, but not an earnings impact, right?","This is Theo. I think what would happen, if in fact you booked it up upfront, you would recognize the liability. But the cost obviously would be recognized as an expense at the time you booked the liability.  If in fact that was the case, as Drew said, that's not what we're saying at this point in time. What would be the case, if in fact, you had a liability as part of a regulatory construct, I would imagine that you're not likely to see that as it relates to regulatory rate setting going forward."
"Okay. So, you think the most likely outcome, should be mitigation plans be approved, is they'll ﬂow through as they ﬂow back to customers, you'll incur the expense. Your cost cutting plans allow to you to plow through that and still close the gap between the current ROEs and your future authorized ROEs?","If in fact, it happens as we see it or expect it today, you would see the impacts of the rate mitigation ﬂowing through currently as reduction of revenue, which obviously would put downward pressure on ROE. You would also have, as the regulatory processes move forward, you would see the impact of cost cutting making their way through the regulatory process. That could happen at various points in time.  Obviously as that happens, Leo mentioned earlier, we would see rates being adjusted to reﬂect those changes in cost structure within the Utility. So, for a period of time, there is a potential that you could have oﬀsets. But again, as you go forward and the regulatory process encompasses those rate reductions within the setting of rates, the rates would be adjusted to commensurate with that. Those beneﬁts would ﬂow back to customers at that point in time."
"Also on the target of 6% growth in 2014. If you achieve that in 2014, would you generally be earning your allowed returns in your regulatory jurisdictions overall? Or would you still be under-earning?","This is Theo. I believe if we achieve that, I think the answer is yes, we'd pretty much be earning our allowed ROEs within the construct of the jurisdictions."
"Okay. In theory, the cost cutting is helping you to get to earn it and will in the future at the Utilities, I guess. One last thing on the HCM, the compensation beneﬁts procurement that you mentioned, are those included in the $200 million to $250 million or not?","Steve, this is Rod. They are currently included. I was making the point earlier that the lion's share of that number was in the Oregon process but all four work streams are and will continue to contribute to the point of view on the $200 million to $250 million."
"Hi, on the rate mitigation plan in year six when it's determined by the savings, who is the arbitrator of that savings? Is it MISO? Is it the state commissions? Do you hire an independent consultant? In other words, who's making that decision of what the savings are?","Charles, if you look at what has been ﬁled as a part of that rate mitigation plan, what has been proposed is an independent third party that would be mutually agreed upon by ITC and a regulatory body."
