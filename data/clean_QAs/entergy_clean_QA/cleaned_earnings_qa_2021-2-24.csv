Question,Answer
"Hi guys, this is actually Ryan on for Jeremy, just wanted to kind of start oﬀ with the order in Arkansas, and you guys, were very clear about reaﬃrming the guidance and potential oﬀsets with capital and O&M, I just wanted to dig a little bit more on what some of those oﬀsets you're thinking about in Arkansas to oﬀset this potential negative order? And then if you get a positive outcome on the rehearing, should we be thinking about maybe top end of the range for 2021?","This is Drew. I'll take that and then Rod can provide any other framework elements as needed. We are adjusting as I mentioned in my comments -- we are adjusting our O&M and capital to prepare for or respond to I guess the order that we got in December. And you can see that in some of our capital disclosures. There is some other just normal tightening capital always moving around some of the jurisdictions, but the main thing is in Arkansas. That's the primary thing that we are taking action to adjust with.  In terms of potential upside, as I also said in my remarks, to the extent that we are able to get the order reversed, we would anticipate putting most, if not all -- depends on what the order would say -- back into our capital plan, so that our customers can beneﬁt from the capital and O&M that we are planning to deploy in Arkansas. So that's what's going on there."
"Okay, it makes sense. And then just as a follow-up, obviously the stock price has been at depressed levels recently. Just wondering if you've got any thoughts on what's required to get the stock moving or reassure market conﬁdence? And then if it stays at depressed levels, if you'd think about any type of transaction that may be sell down some of your utilities to maybe oﬀset some of the equity needs going forward?","Well, I'll start and I'll let Drew talk about the last part of that Ryan. But the best thing we can do, is continue as we have over the last several years to continue to execute to meet our commitments to our customers, and to meet our commitments to all of you, which just means being disciplined about our capital and O&M spend, about where it is and what level it is, continue to improve the level of service that our customers receive from us, and continue to hit hit or exceed the numbers that we committed to all of you. And that's what we intend to do.    And then I'll just talk about M&A and sales of possible portions of utilities. Certainly of course, we are always open to anything that would be value creating for our stakeholders, which is always our number one rule in M&A anyway; is that we would want to make sure that we're creating value for our stakeholders. Other     considerations are execution and distraction from the things that we are doing to further create value for our stakeholders already underway.  The second one is probably the one that makes it perhaps a little bit challenging for us in the sense of trying to do that for equity raises; because we would likely require approval from regulatory commissions in order to do any sort of M&A activity at the OpCo's and so while we might be able to ﬁnd good value, if we were counting on that for an equity raise, and we had to go through the regulatory process that would create a lot of uncertainty in that equity rate. So it's probably not the best path for us, but certainly if there is value creation opportunity out there, then we would be looking at it."
That sounds good. I appreciate the color and that's it from me. Thanks guys.,"Thanks.  Thank you.    Operator  Your next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, your line is open."
"Just wanted to I guess, step back and talk about the impacts to the system from just really unprecedented weather impacts that you all noted. As you think about sort of lessons learned from Texas and just from your other utility businesses, I know you're spending a lot on making your systems more resilient, but are the lessons learned resulting in potential for further other acceleration of spending or changes to plans?  Whether it be generation plans, renewables plans, et cetera. Or is this just consistent with your overall focus on resiliency in these recent data points? Just kind of reaﬃrm sort of the existing approach that you're taking.","Well, I guess I'll start on with the others chime in. But, Steven, certainly every event that occurs has unique attributes that allow us to have lessons that we learned, and so whether it's the hurricanes or tropical storms; Harvey is diﬀerent than Laura, for example, in terms of what the impact it had on reasonably similar areas of our service territory. And what we've experienced, obviously, we're still in the process of getting the lessons learned about the events that we saw last week. So we always, I wouldn't say that it's inconsistent with the plans we have for resiliency, but certainly, every time we go through any kind of event, we will learn something that we will apply to the next events.  So there are things we learned in Katrina that have really served us well for every event that occurred after that, both in terms of what we do to our system and how our capital shapes up but also as well as our processes our operations and our interactions with the industry, et cetera.  So there will be lessons learned, and they will direct our activities potentially diﬀerently. I wouldn't say that it's going to create an incremental capital spend or anything like that. It's potentially re-direction of it. Now, it could provide some incremental capital spend, if when working with our regulators they determine -- we jointly determine that there are things that we need to do more quickly than we otherwise would have done, but I wouldn't say right now that there is some anticipation of a change in the size of the capital plan going forward because of these events. Might be a change in direction for some things just to prioritize diﬀerently, but everything is a learning experience and we'll continue to do that, and as I said -- events of last week; we're still unpacking everything there."
"And that's helpful. Maybe just one last from me just on nuclear operations, just curious. More broadly, how are you feeling in terms of operational progress, performance? Just trends and any recent developments there or is it sort of fairly consistent with prior messaging there?","In the majority, it's consistent with where we've been, I would say that we continue to work with Grand Gulf. We have some work to continue to do there to get that plant into the space where we want it to be, but majority of it is on track."
"Understood. And the Grand Gulf work, is that sort of just general operational improvements? How would you sort of highlight the work needed there?","In the equipment reliability space for the most part, as you know, we've gone through a couple of major outages equipment modiﬁcations. The most recent equipment modiﬁcation; the turbine control system, we've had some issues coming out of that outage with some of the equipment associated with that modiﬁcation. So     we're going to continue to work through those, get those knocked out and get the plant up to the level of excellence that we desire."
"Just a couple of questions here. Firstly, just on the cost savings, you presented under $150 million; that was $150 million in savings. That was obviously executed in 2020. That was well in excess of your original $100 million. So, just curious to the level of recurring cost savings you think you can take into '21 and sort of continue on that momentum.  And can you ﬁnd sort of incremental opportunities, especially on the corporate side? And you know we've seen several peers generate signiﬁcant cost savings from, for instance, real estate optimization, so wondering if this is also a potential lever as you guys go through COVID and the learning curves there.","Hey, Shah, this is, this is Drew. So, most of of the cost savings that we saw in 2020 I would characterize as more one-time in nature. They were part of our ﬂexible spending eﬀorts, and those are typically looking for ways to take action to manage to the outcomes in that particular year, and so we would not necessarily see those as recurring, but this year, we've identiﬁed new ones that we would be able to use to manage this year, if needed.  And we continued on last year after we said that we got to $100 million looking for more in the event that we needed it and as it turned out, as you know, that we needed all of it. Having said that, there were some things that were identiﬁed as potential continuous improvement elements and sort of ﬁt into those other buckets,     although they were relatively small. I would think in the 20% range, and those are now accounted for in our outlooks as part of our O&M expectations.  And there are other things that we are looking at, we are driving our continuous improvement eﬀorts forward things like real estate optimization are in the spotlight for us, as we think about how we manage our workforce of the future, and that's an easy one to consider as we go forward. So those things are part of what we're looking at, and some of those expectations are now getting baked into our outlooks."
Got it. And then just maybe a timing on when you'll update around on the additional levers?,"Well, I think they're just, I think they're just part of our ongoing process. We don't have anything today, we don't have a speciﬁc timetable that we're working towards. It's just an ongoing element."
"Got it, got it. David Borde congrats on sort of the new leadership position. And Rod, make sure you work him really hard. Thanks guys.",I don't think you have to worry about that.    Operator  Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
"Good morning. Can you -- sorry if I missed this, but have you quantiﬁed in terms of ﬁnancially, what impacts if any due to last week's events have for you?","Yeah. So this is Drew, so Leo in the remarks mentioned some of the cost elements; up to $140 million in terms of restoration costs. And an incremental $400 million in terms of fuel costs. I'll give you a little bit color, and there will be more speciﬁc numbers in the K, which we'll ﬁle in a couple of days. But the -- but on the fuel costs, I think it's all in, it's about $500 million. I would say about $100 million is kind of what we would normally have expected, and that gives you to the $400 million that Leo was talking about.     Of the $500 million, about $200 million of it is in Louisiana, and that is about 90% to 95% ELL in the rest of New Orleans, about $150 is in Texas, and these are all-round numbers. As I mentioned, you'll have speciﬁc ones later.  There is a positive deferred fuel balance in Texas of about $90 million that will help oﬀset that. And then in the neighborhood of $100 million in Arkansas and around $50 million in Mississippi. So that's kind of how that would all breakdown."
"Understood, that's super helpful. Really thank you. So it's essentially $400 million increment to what you may have otherwise expected on a normal basis.","Yeah, yeah. In February, and I'm talking about the month of February, really."
"Yeah. Okay, perfect. Thanks.    And then just quickly, can you sort of, so the slide here, says the the Arkansas FRP extension ﬁrst quarter. Right. Just can you remind us what the date is of that ﬁnal order? And then in terms of like what to look for -- could that get extended? Just any color on when we may get resolution on that front?","Yes, this is, this is Rod. March 15, is the date that the commission has set for itself to issue the order for both the 2021 FRP and the renewal the -- of FRP extension."
"Yeah, thanks, good morning. So this was a helpful update. Thank you. And just the the Louisiana FRP extension. I think you continued settlement talks there; could you just maybe give color on your conﬁdence in being able to settle that case?","Steve, I can. It's Rod. But I can tell you that the conversations in Louisiana are going perhaps consistent with our expectations. Slowed only by the -- by certainly the storms and occasionally the COVID, but the types of issues that we've been working through with our our stakeholders and the regulators have been consistent with expectations, we are targeting -- we're targeting the resolution of Louisiana renewal by the end of March. And that said, we'll be monitoring that progress as we have others, but March that is our target to resolve that, all things being equal."
"Okay, great. And then separate, diﬀerent question. Drew, on your ﬁnancing plans, is there -- I might have missed it, but is there any update or changes in your equity issuance plans for the three year period?","No, no new changes from what we described at Analyst Day. We have made some progress, we got the after-market program up and running in January. And then we will have a proxy ﬁnally coming up, we will have a request get the authorization to issue preferred equity. So, that should be coming up soon. But those are, those are the only two things that are noteworthy since our last disclosure."
"Okay and then just on the, at the market -- is there like a timeline for that part of the ﬁnancing you're targeting?","No, there is no -- there is no timeline, we don't have any additional information there."
I guess if I heard you correctly in Arkansas. Your guidance is essentially contingent on an FRP extension. Are you expecting that to come through a negotiation or through a ﬁnal Arkansas Public Service Commission rate order?,"The answer, without being -- sounding trite, is yes. So whatever progress we're able to make, to-date and through the 15th, which is only two and half weeks away, will incorporate whatever progress we make. The assumptions we are making in our guidance and outlook assume the December order and FRP presumptively with the December order, but it's our conﬁdence and our ability to manage to expectations with whatever would be the likely or reasonable components of an Arkansas order. And so that's really the commitment we are making today -- that our outlooks are tied to those two primary assumptions."
Right but would your guidance hold if the FRP were not renewed.,"If the FRP was not renewed, then we would likely have to see what the circumstances were, obviously, we have the ability, if needed to, for instance, ﬁled a rate case or take some other remedial action. And so from a planning standpoint we are contemplating all of those scenarios, but it's too early for us to know which levers we'd ultimately pull. But our commitment is to manage to those likely outcomes."
Okay. And -- I think that's it -- that's all from my questions. Thank you very much.,"Thanks.  Thanks, Paul.    Operator  Our next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open."
"Feels the same way. But if I can, let me come back to the planning scenario we talked about as second ago. So you're talking about cost reductions, CapEx levers and also a series of ﬂow charts, if you will around what you could do. Can you elaborate a little bit on all these levers, like if you were to pursue this out, would you ﬁle a rate case later this year in Arkansas? Or is litigious and appeal strategy the ﬁrst way to go? How quickly when you think about the diﬀerent scenarios would you pursue one over another? And how quickly could we come back with a cost savings program and CapEx program to preserve, at least the integrity of returns, I suppose.","Julien, I appreciate the question. I guess we're in the midst of discussions and these orders and we're only a couple of weeks out from resolution. So I think it would be best for us to just defer commentary around all of that until we get the outcome since it's pretty prompt."
"Yeah, understood. But to be clear about this, it sounds like you've got contingencies already running on both cost and CapEx levers as it stands today. And then the second quick question if I can just -- which is probably related -- on the subject of Bill impacts and how you think about cumulative bill impact. How do you think about the total trajectory knowing what you know about storms and otherwise, as well as the pace of CapEx and sales trajectory in '21 onwards, are you anticipating at this point in time across your service territories?","So, let me make sure I can we get to everything that was in there. So you're correct. Right, we've made adjustments to our plan to anticipate what we think is the likely outcomes in the FRP renewals or any regulatory process going forward.  So that is incorporated in the -- in our thinking, and obviously in our outlooks based on what we told you today. And certainly from a bill impact standpoint, we're obviously going to work through all of these processes whether it be the storms from last year or the storms from last week and try to make recovery work, or keep the company in the right space as it relates to our credit proﬁle, and earnings as well as to keep our customer bills mitigated as much as we possibly can.  Which is what we've always done, so the tools that we talked about, whether it'd be securitization or normal ways that we handle fuel cost recovery, or some of the     options that we've taken to those in previous times, all of that will be on the table to where we can make it as minimal impact on customers as we possibly can, while we continue to meet for example our credit and earnings commitments."
Could we get maybe an update on where you are on arrears and any incremental bad debt since you updated last quarter?,"Sure, Jonathan this is Drew. So as of the end of the year, we had recorded bad debt expense of $112 million. Our normal bad debt expense in any given year is about $25 million. So, in that incremental $87 million was recorded as a regulatory asset because we have orders in each of our jurisdictions that would allow us to recover those costs.  The arrears typically runs about three times higher than the bad debt expense. And so that number is pretty consistent. We've seen it begin to level oﬀ, but we need to see where it goes with this latest round of storms and a little bit of backtracking on disconnects because of the storms. And we never did get oﬀ disconnects in Arkansas and or New Orleans. So those two jurisdictions have continued on for a little bit longer, but that's kind of where we stand right now."
"Okay, thank you for that. And then just maybe if I may, on the quarter and just an understanding the numbers a little better and the full year. It looked like you had $0.23 of tax related beneﬁt for the year, but you were shooting for $0.15 when you last updated guidance on Q3 and so there would be a sort of $0.08 incremental help versus what you were expecting. And maybe another $0.07 or so of P&O. Am I were reading that right or is there a better way to think about that?","That's correct. There is some details in the appendix which talk about those things, for 2020 and show or they are in the fourth quarter, most of that is in the fourth quarter. It was related to just annual true-ups that happened to work out in our direction. There was a small item that we found, which is an opportunity for us. But that's consistent with what we've been doing for a long, long time.  Obviously, the big item we adjusted out which we committed to you all, we would do and so going forward. Any of those annual true-ups, they might break for break against us, we have to manage within that. We do expect to ﬁnd small items going forward, but we're not counting on it.  If you look at our tax rate for 2021, it's at 22% and I think we're not disclosing it, but in our plan, we actually have a drifting back up to around 24% -- 24.5% beyond that. We've had at lower for the last few years, as you know, because we had all the AFUDC from the projects, pretty much all of which went online in 2020. So that positive tax eﬀect is in a strong going forward."
But fair to say that sort of help $0.15 or so in Q4?,It did. We also weren't planning the $0.16 regulatory provision from the Arkansas order. So it kind of balanced out.
"Sure. Yeah. got it and then I may have missed this in -- and just wanted to make sure, I obviously noticed your CapEx down for the '21. Yeah, $300 odd million -- the best part of 9% was -- is most of that dialing back in Arkansas or some other things going on?","That is primarily Arkansas there. We've taken some capital out of '21 and '22, we've put a little bit back in '23 in Arkansas. There were some other timing element in some of the other jurisdictions, but the main impact is Arkansas."
"Just real quick follow-up. And I think I know the answer -- you reiterated the -- your ranges -- I guess you through 2023 as well as the midpoints. And I think in relations to Steve's question, Drew it doesn't sound like you're ﬁnancing plan has changed. Has there been any change in the cadence of that ﬁnancing? And I mean, we look at it as fairly ratable, but just kind of given where the FFO metrics are, should we assume that maybe some of that equity is a little bit more front-end loaded or still ratable?","So we haven't, we don't have any additional information to provide on timing, other than what we've said previously. We do expect to issue some equity this year, and then we have the 2.5 billion by 2024. But outside of that, we don't have any other timing or amount items that we would disclose right now."
"Okay, got it. And the $1 billion ATM that you were mentioning, I think you guys put that in place in December -- that was part of that original ﬁnancing plan too, just to clarify?","That's correct. It's one of the tools that we were putting in place, with the other being the authorization request for preferred equity."
"Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on some of the bad debt items. Can you remind us exactly what's in your 2021 earnings guidance as around bad debt assumption? And if there is any incremental oﬀ of the initial assumption from the events from last week? I appreciate the $400 million of incremental fuel cost number, but curious if you adjusted any bad debt in such assumptions on that right.","Now we have not adjusted our bad debt assumptions for that right now. I believe it's probably fairly normal around the $25 million amount that I was talking about earlier. Obviously we'll be monitoring that closely and seeing where all the COVID arrears actually fall out, we have an incident as we were discussing earlier there. About a third ultimately, we would expect to be able to recover of those costs through through the regulatory process, but we don't have exact numbers yet. This is -- that part is a little bit unchartered territory, we'll see where it comes out."
Are there any regulatory approaches are tools that you have or any potential critical responses to help mitigate that potential incremental bad debt expense?,"I don't know about regulatory tools. I mean we have the orders that are already in place, we are working closely with customers to try and mitigate the impact on customers. We've done a number of things to put new deferred payment plans in place. We've been working hard with our customers, we've renegotiated thousands of plans with our customers already, to try and help them out. We've invented new ways to get LIHEAP funding to our customers and other community tools that are available. We've actually work with some of our retail regulators to do some of that in New Orleans and other jurisdictions.     So there are a number of things that we have underway to try to mitigate the impact, and we are trying to work hard and communicate very closely with our customers to make sure that they know where we are. And with our retail regulators at the same time."
"Okay. And thank you, and if I could just squeeze on one last question. In terms of -- what's the regulatory approach to enable a path forward for Louisiana and any other jurisdictions to fuel LDCs with hydrogen in light of your hydrogen strategies that you highlighted?","Well, from a regulatory process standpoint, it would be the same process, we use with our resource planning. So whether it's an RFP process recovery of those of the investments we make for those resources would go through our existing recovery recovery mechanisms.  But to the extent, there are some nuances where the current mechanisms don't account for some of the really forward looking aspects of the hydrogen or in any new technology, we'll be talking with our regulators about closing whatever those gaps are, but we have an existing process thus far with the IRP and the writers and would."
