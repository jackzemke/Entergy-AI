Question,Answer
"Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the time. My ﬁrst question was about the -- I know it was in your GAAP results, you favorably adjust out that large tax item from the tax audit. Was that -- did you receive the cash on that as something that kind of beneﬁts shareholders? I know you have the $100 million for customers, but if you could just give some ﬂavor of how that impacts kind of the company's beneﬁt as well as the rate payers.","Sure, Paul. Thanks for the question. The tax item was a resolution of a 2016 to 2018 audit, and as you noted on EPS, we adjusted those eﬀects out of earnings. From a cash perspective, there's no real cash eﬀect of that as the NOLs and the tax deposits had taken care of that. So no signiﬁcant cash eﬀect there."
"Okay, great. Thank you for clearing that one up. And then also I noticed even just since the EEI update, you increased the sales expectations for 2024 pretty much across the customer classes. Just what are you seeing on the ground that made you more conﬁdent in a change upward so recently?","Yeah, certainly at EEI, our plan is preliminary. We continue to adjust and modify it. As I noted, the industrial customers, we expect them to be strong in 2024. You probably saw the announcement in Mississippi around a signiﬁcant customer there that provides economic opportunities in Mississippi, but we continue to reﬁne and modify our forecast as we move from EEI into quarter end.    Yeah, and I would just add that coming oﬀ of this year, we were a little lower than expected. So our outlooks for '23 haven't changed as much as might indicate by the big bump, but it's some of the things that Kimberly talked about for '23 with customers having unplanned outages and slower ramp rates that is also boosting that number.        Okay, okay. Great. Thank you. And then if I can quickly follow up on that, is there any initial estimate or way to think about how much infrastructure you could need to build for that large Mississippi customer? Yeah, we haven't broken that out speciﬁcally. You can see that we continue to reﬁne our capital plan and have added some capital in Mississippi in order to support that and ensure that we have clean energy for our customers in Mississippi, but we haven't given speciﬁc estimates related to that customer."
"Thank you. So just following up to Paul's question, so is this CapEx update still coming, meaning as we head into your Analyst Day, we should actually expect that this accelerating load growth translates into higher CapEx?","Yeah. Angie, at EEI, we laid out a capital plan that's pretty close to what's here. It's a couple of hundred million more here, and we continue to reﬁne our capital plan, prioritize around customers that we're aware of. We also showed at EEI additional capital that could be added. There was additional transmission, additional clean energy for -- to support customers and a couple of other areas. And so we continue to work to prioritize those, but I would think about this as this is our capital plan that we're planning for, we're continuing to prioritize it as we move into Analyst Day. I'd expect we'd show you ﬁve years of capital and so that would be the view that you would get at that point.    Yeah. Some of that capital that we talked about is coming into this plan, and then we're ﬁnding ways to manage with all of the capital needs. And that's -- I think that'll be a key discussion point at the Analyst Day."
"Okay. Changing topics, on SERI and the resolution of SERI issues in both New Orleans and Louisiana, is there any timeline on those? And should we actually link any resolution of SERI-related issues to the resilience CapEx maybe as a way to pay for some of the spending?","Hi, Angie, it's Rod. Good morning. You're touching on, I think, the heart of the conversations at both Louisiana and New Orleans around SERI. No, there is not a timeline by which the parties have to come to some resolution on SERI, but I think the fact that FERC has already decided with regard to Louisiana's eﬀorts to request a rehearing, certainly our settlement with Arkansas and Mississippi has derisked SERI, but our conversations in New Orleans around settlement are ongoing.  There is, as you would think about the ancillary or complementary regulatory dockets both in Louisiana and New Orleans that could be aﬀected by a SERI settlement, I think you're touching on what's been at the heart of the ongoing conversations. And that is, is there an opportunity for New Orleans or the State of Louisiana to provide beneﬁts to its customers through a SERI settlement, much in the same way that Mississippi and Arkansas did? And in this case, I believe New Orleans is certainly considering how a SERI settlement might inﬂuence customers' capacity to pay for resiliency investments. None of those things are settled, and I certainly can't talk about where we are in the negotiations, but I think it's reasonable to assume that the conversations we're having are trying to ﬁgure out how a SERI settlement might beneﬁt customers on the resiliency front."
"Just a couple of clarifying questions here. So if I could follow up on that load growth number, that 8% industrial for this year, if you could estimate, how would you break that down in terms of the kind of recapture, for lack of better word, of what you were expecting in 2023? And what's a good kind of go forward two-year, three-year type of run rate on a core basis? Does that make sense?","Yeah. Travis, the -- what we've talked about going forward is a 6% to 7% or -- CAGR through the '26 outlook period. What you're seeing, as you noted in '24, is coming oﬀ of a base year of '23. That load will be a little lumpy as it comes in over that period, but we expect a 6% to 7% growth rate on those industrials over that outlook period."
"Yeah. Okay. Just doing the math there. Okay. Other one on the resilience, the new CapEx that you added in, is that part of the Louisiana, New Orleans plan that you've proposed or is that in addition to?","Yeah. As Drew noted, we have a little less than $1 billion of resilience spending in our capital plan over this period. Once decisions are made in Louisiana and New Orleans around the recovery mechanisms and the pace around that, then we would - - that could be additional capital, but what's in that capital plan is close to that $1 billion number.  And that part of -- that $1 billion is part of the ﬁled plan.    That's right."
"It's part of the plan. Okay, okay. Got it. So that number would go down in terms of potential CapEx relative to what you've added in.","No, I don't think so. The ﬁling -- just to be clear, the ﬁling is more than what we've included. What we've included is what we can spin in our given mechanisms that we have. And as you probably know, we requested accelerated mechanisms in both Louisiana and New Orleans so that we can accelerate that spending. And so depending on those mechanisms, that could provide additional opportunity for capital there."
"Okay, okay. Very good. And then one other quick clarifying. The $2 billion of solar, how much of that is through the RFPs that are out right now and how much is that through either traditional rate making or future RFPs that you anticipate?","I don't have a precise breakdown of that. We do have quite a bit, which isn't necessarily going through RFPs, certainly in Arkansas and in Mississippi, and so I think there's a good chunk of that, but I don't have a precise number for you."
