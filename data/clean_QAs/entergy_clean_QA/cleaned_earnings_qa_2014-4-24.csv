Question,Answer
"Congratulations on a pretty amazing quarter. A couple of follow-up items. So, can you go into a little more detail on the increase in the O&M spending? If I understood it correctly, I took away that it's an opportunistic spend due to the improved revenues and sort of reinvestment, if you will. Are there particular segments, or companies, or projects that you're spending that O&M in?","Thanks, Kit. Yes, so at EWC that is certainly the case as well as the utility. At EWC, part of that is paying people for the great performance that Leo talked about in the First Quarter, and part of it is looking for opportunities to move projects forward if those arise. The challenge associated with those, of course, is that they are diﬃcult projects to plan. It's not easy to move a lot of O&M forward like that. And, we are getting an early start on it. It's easier to pull back than it is to decide at the end of the year that you want to move a lot of O&M forward. At the Utility, we're a little ahead in that same regard. It's something that's beneﬁcial for customers in terms of rate stability if we can oﬀset some of the beneﬁcial weather, and since it's still early in the year, we don't know that we'll be able to actually have the opportunity at the utility to do that. And, we'll certainly be looking at each Company because not all utility companies will likely have that same opportunity. But, that's what we're working on today. We're preparing, we're trying to form up projects, and we're looking for those opportunities, but there's no guarantee that we'll ultimately end up spending that O&M."
"Thank you. And, on a separate area, you mentioned that -- if I heard it right -- that 80% of the EBITDA in 2014 First Quarter could recur in First Quarter 2015. And, that $0.90 a share of the increase in the guidance range was due to the First Quarter? Just wanted to conﬁrm that those were correct. And, I just want to try to get an idea of how much of a, if you will, permanent baseline change there is here in level of EPS and EBITDA that will recur in 2015 and forward. Obviously, forward prices have gone up some. You say volatility has gone up and so on. If you can give us some idea of what we're looking at going forward, that would be a big help.","I'll start with the math part, and then I'll turn it over to Bill for the point-of-view discussion. I think the math that you had, Kit, was correct, but I'd put a bunch of caveats in there as well. So, it's 80% under the same market conditions that we see next year in the First Quarter, and yes, that's against the $0.90 increase plus the part that we already had built into guidance. It's the overall EBITDA that I was talking about when you look at it that way. So, part of that is from the fact that Vermont Yankee is not going to be in our portfolio next year. And, part of that is, as you said, forward prices have already moved up. We do have some still open positions in our remaining portfolio. They've beneﬁted from some of the price moves so far. And so, you get up above what Vermont Yankee's contribution was this quarter because some of our other positions have beneﬁted from that early price rise. With that, I think I'll turn it -- .  This is Leo, Kit. Let me jump in to make sure -- I want to make sure you get the right speciﬁcs. The 80% Drew was talking about was if the same price volatility happened next First Quarter that happened this First Quarter, we're positioned that we could capture that value. When you were asking about permanence, the slide we have in the deck on EBITDA -- that's where the market is today. And so, you may not have been thinking this, but I want to make sure. We're not saying that we already have 80% of what we got this quarter, First Quarter next year. If the same thing happened, we're positioned to capture it. That's what Drew is trying to say."
"The same market conditions, but not the same weather, obviously.","Well, whatever reason. It might happen because of weather. That would probably be why it would happen."
I get it. It's basically just removing the Vermont Yankee impact.,"That, and some of the price rise we've already seen so far this year. As you said, 2015 prices come up a little bit already."
"The slide 21, the area you're just alluding to -- talking about the look at market today. Obviously, you don't specify the numbers, but it seems from the movement in the 2015 number in particular that it's up about $100 million of EBITDA outlook versus the prior version of this slide. I guess my question is, you got 74% hedged. You now expect to realize $53 on that versus $49 before which is a $4 uplift, and then the market pricing slide is also kind of a $4 uplift. It seems four times your generation ought to be closer to $150 million than $100 million. Is there some oﬀset? Does my math make any sense there? And, is there some oﬀset embedded in there? Or, are you embedding some conservatism about next year in particular?","I'm not sure I followed all the way through on the last part. But, it should all kind of hold together. I don't think there's any big oﬀsets built into the numbers that we're showing you there."
"Your hedged is up $4, and your open is up $4. You've got 35 terawatt hours. It doesn't seem that the bar is moving as much as it should by some reasonable margin.","There's a bit of rounding in there as well. But, we don't have any unplanned or hidden oﬀsets in there. We're showing you just the revenue uplift there."
"Okay. And then, if I may on this discussion, you had about the 80% and the 20% if we had a repeat of this year's conditions next year. Can you be a bit more speciﬁc about what kinds of products that you used this year are not available in the market for next year? And, how your -- just more color on how you're adapting to changes in available products in the market?","Sure, this is Bill. I think as we've explained previously, we use a variety of diﬀerent products. Some of that includes unit contingent. Some of that includes cap collars.     And, we use a variety of diﬀerent option structures, both European, which clear on a forward basis, versus Asian options, which clear more on a daily basis. As you can appreciate as the volatility in this market is increased, and if you look at daily volatility from -- for example, from winter 2013 to winter 2014, we've probably seen a pickup of over 50% between 2014 and 2013. Obviously, some folks who were willing to sell those products in the past have reconsidered their risk proﬁle. Right now, they are not as willing to oﬀer those products. And so, we have to readjust our portfolio to what's actually available in the market to be able to capture that. However, as Drew said, we still believe we have the opportunity to capture a signiﬁcant portion of those upside, but it will be a diﬀerent portfolio, and there will be diﬀerent prices associated with the products available due to that increased volatility."
"Thank you, very much. I just want to better understand the changes that are taking place in the Utility guidance for 2014. The starting point would be there's a $0.20 reduction in the midpoint, and that includes the $0.18 of positive weather in the First Quarter. So, are we really looking at sort of a delta here of $0.38?","This is Drew, Paul. That's a good question. In the net revenue line, there is an oﬀset to that $0.18 in our unbilled revenue category. And, unbilled is something that we don't normally talk about. It's usually kind of plus or minus around zero. But, this quarter it's a large number. And, it has to do with sort of the estimates at the end of each quarter that we make. So, it's really sort of a hold over from the very end of 2013 when it was really cold, those last couple of weeks in December. Those dollars have since gone into the billed revenue category, and we're backing them out of the unbilled category. And you see the oﬀset to the build. So, it's about -- as I said, it's $0.09 quarter over quarter. It was about $0.10 between December and the First Quarter of this year. So that's the biggest thing in that net revenue line that you're probably not seeing completely there."
"Right. In other words, if that's $0.09 out of what would potentially be $0.38, what would be -- ? Or, is it $0.09 out of what really is $0.20? That's what I'm trying to ﬁgure out. Don't I need to look at -- ?","If you're looking at $0.30, I think you're looking at quarter over quarter versus the $5.20 midpoint is just for 2014. So, our expectations for 2014 from the net revenue perspective have been largely met except you would say plus $0.18 for weather minus $0.10 for unbilled and then a little other noise in there to get you to that plus $0.05."
"Okay, but then that still leaves $0.28. I'm just trying to ﬁgure out what drove -- what's driving the $0.28, and weather we should look at that as potentially recurring items or nonrecurring items?","I'm not sure I'm following where you're getting the $0.28 from, I'm sorry. We said $0.28. It's plus $0.18 whether this quarter versus minus $0.10 First Quarter of 2013. There's a $0.28 weather delta there. Is that what you're looking at?"
I'm taking the $0.20 change in the midpoint of the guidance and adding in the weather of $0.18 and then subtracting out the $0.09 or the $0.10 that you gave me for -- .,"If you come down on the guidance table maybe what you're seeing is there's a bit of the opportunity spending, and then the other part is the taxes piece. There were some tax items that we thought would occur this year. When we set guidance in October, it looks like those have pushed back a little bit, probably into 2015. And so, that has moved out. We still think those things are going to happen, the timing has just changed on them. From the guidance table, those are the main drivers."
"And, the opportunity spend and the taxes together would sort of represent the diﬀerence? You also mentioned somewhere in there rate case outcomes.","Right, right. And, that's a smaller piece that's in that net revenue line item. That's part of what gets you down to the $0.05, and it has more to do with the Arkansas rate case at the end of the year probably than anything."
"Okay. And, still the expectation -- so even with sort of -- so in other words if the Arkansas decision isn't reversed, you're still conﬁdent that you can come up with other oﬀsets by 2016 to get to the same $950 million, $1 billion utility net income number?","That's correct. That's correct. And, as Leo said, we're looking for ways to exceed that. So, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of our 2016 number. Recall that that doesn't include any tax beneﬁts in it. We have all of the industrial renaissance and economic development opportunities in front of us. We think that that's pretty safe right now."
"Good morning. Just on the hedging strategy -- just make sure so I understand this. In the ratable or kind of point of view base you are using, you didn't really increase hedge positions in the quarter. What is the thought process for adding on in the out- years as we move through this year? And, what kind of percentage hedges do you want to have maybe going into 2015?","Typically, we look at (prompt year), we hedge 85% of that position. So, that's kind of the guidelines that we followed and we'll expect to continue to follow. Of course, this year, eﬀectively we were a little less than that due to the fact of the uncertainty around VY and how long that unit would run and the uncertainty around the CPG. We would intend to be hedged at an 85% level."
"And then on -- with the MISO integration, having had a little more time with it. And then, some of these issues that have come up between transfer between MISO Classic and MISO South. Can you maybe give a little color on how you see that getting resolved? What impact that's had on maybe the value proposition of joining MISO from what you originally anticipated? And, is that going to have any bearing on potential CapEx opportunities with the MISO transmission  Operator     Gentlemen, this is the Operator. We are unable to hear you at this time.","Can you hear me now?  Operator  Yes, we can.  You can hear me okay now? Operator, can you hear me?  Operator  Yes, I can hear you. You are distant.  I'll come to another microphone. All right, do we have audio right now?  Operator  Perfect.  The point I was making on the SPP MISO issue for the Company. SPP ﬁled a complaint at FERC seeking to in essence to have FERC charge MISO for any excess capacity beyond the 1,000 megawatt limitation and that tie-in between MISO north and MISO south. The point being, that we're in the initial stages of the litigation, if you will. We have not ruled out the possibility or likelihood of resolving that issue by way of settlement. But, if we were to ultimately go to hearing, and if SPP were to maintain their position, that's essentially what they're seeking to limit that inter- regional dispatch to 1,000 megawatts and to issue -- to have payments to SPP from MISO for any megawatt beyond that 1,000-megawatt capacity. The debate is really about that we don't have a point of view on how MISO would address it if FERC were to ﬁnd that SPP's position was well founded. But again, it's early in the process, and so we really don't know how that plays out at the moment."
Just wanted to ﬁrst clarify how the LHB pricing came in relative to your expectation of a $2 increase for the full year? Maybe just some color on that?,"Yes, I think as you know, the LHB pricing came in for the summer strip a little bit under $10. May auction -- spot auction was around $12.25. That's in excess of our original estimate."
"Okay. One other question just on clarifying kind of your point of view on New England and the like. One could argue that there's obviously some pretty severe constraints. We also did seem to have some relatively severe weather. Maybe not as much in New England, but kind of the whole regional area, or the whole northern part of the country. When you're talking kind of the bullish point of view in keeping your strategy the same -- is that -- in a normal winter weather situation do you think there'd be this much extreme -- or, still have an extreme option value that things are that bad in New England that even normal weather you'd want to keep the big option position?","Yes, I mean here's the way we think about it. We've seen volatility in those markets the last two winters okay? And, this winter was more severe than the winter of 2013, but nevertheless we saw volatility. Take into consideration for 2014 you've got Salem harbor coming oﬀ. That's about 750 megawatts. VY will be oﬀ in the ﬁrst part of 2015. It will actually shut down the end of this year. And then, you've got other units like Brighton point that will come oﬀ in 2017. So, you're losing a substantial amount of resources over the next four to ﬁve years. In fact, if you look at their overall portfolio, you're going to lose about 4,000 megawatts, which represents about 10% of their generation -- over 10% of their generation capacity. And, reserve margins obviously have declined to the point where FCA 8 resulted in a deﬁciency, and you went to basically new build prices for new resources. So, there's a lot of dynamics going on there. But, we believe that they will continue to be constraints while there's a minimal amount of new pipeline capacity coming on due to compression projects, that type of thing. We don't believe it's adequate to replace the additional capacity that will be retired."
"I hear your comments with Steve on the markets and what have you. I also heard your opening comments, which sort of indicated substantial concern with the way the market is being structured and what have you. I guess to follow up on this, do you -- I know what you are planning in terms of your ﬁlings. And, I saw your (exlawn) and Entergy joint ﬁling on the four capacity nine. But, is there a plan B if in fact we don't get the market structure that you contemplate? Or, should we think basically that things are sort of going in your direction, and you are cautiously optimistic. And, we're going to be seeing this sort of process continue in the stakeholder process, what have you, and see how it plays out. Or, is there perhaps another strategy you might be thinking about to get more value for your generation plants?","Well, it gets to be a little bit complex. Let me lay this out. We're working through the stakeholder process both in New York and in New England and at FERC, and we believe there is improvements to be made in the capacity market design. We believe there's improvements to be made in the energy market design. And, we also believe that there are opportunities to be fairly compensated -- for generators to be fairly compensated based on the actual attributes they provide. For example, on-site fuel, zero carbon emissions, et cetera. That is going to be a fairly lengthy process. We think we will see some immediate improvements, for example in ISO new England with real-time energy pricing coming up by the end of this year. Leo mentioned the slope demand curve. In the interim, as we have mentioned, we expect to see quite a bit of volatility in the markets just due to the constraints themselves. And so, when you say is there a plan B, we're kind of working all of those in parallel, and we expect to see some continued volatility until some of these market issues get resolved. I think the polar vortex brought to the attention of all the markets and to the regulators that we've got some structural design issues that need to be addressed."
"Okay. Going back to (fort) capacity auction number nine, there is this new entry -- pricing extension that's being proposed. I was wondering if you have any thoughts? Obviously, you are against it. I understand that. But, if you have any thoughts about what the impact might be if that provision stays in the -- whatever the proposal that New England put forth.","Make sure I understand. Are you talking about the exemption as it relates to the renewables associated with that? And, the slope demand curve?"
"I was talking about the slope demand curve pricing and the new entry pricing extension. They're going to increase by 40%, at least they're proposing, from ﬁve to seven years for new entry pricing. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about what that impact might be? Or, if that's signiﬁcant given the constraints you're talking about on the gas side?","I think our point of view is we're not necessarily hung up on the ﬁve to seven. What has been the most challenging for us is that when the ISO sets -- has new capacity enter the market, they choose a number of $7 a KW month to provide existing generators. We believe with the slope demand curve that we have the opportunity depending on resource availability to see additional upside, probably somewhere to $10 or $11 a KW a month once that slope demand curve gets put in place."
"Regardless of these other market design issues such as the extension and the MOPR exemption that you were discussing earlier. Even with those in place, you still think that the capacity price will probably get up there? Is that right?","We still think -- obviously, we're concerned about the exemptions because it's another intervention into what's referred to as the competitive market. But, even with that, we believe that there is some additional upside from a capacity pricing perspective."
I wanted to just talk through the low growth numbers that you're seeing which is obviously robust compared to the natural average. Are there certain areas that stand out as the strongest areas of growth? Do those oﬀer potentially more transmission spend than you've been currently contemplating?,"Theo, do you want to -- .    Stephen, this is Theo. I guess when we talk about it, we would probably want to talk about -- to answer the second part of your question around customer class somewhat. When we look at residential and commercial, for the past few years, we've expected what we saw last year -- kind of a dip in growth. That being driven primarily by energy eﬃciency policies primarily at the federal level. Somewhat around -- primarily around lighting. What you're seeing now in 2014 in the First Quarter as compared to 2013 is really a return to what we had probably seen on a simple average -- low growth 2010 through 2012 prior to 2013. And, it's something we somewhat anticipated post- the dip we saw in 2013. When you now talk about industrial and you talk about the industrial renaissance we talked about fairly extensively. Leo mentioned on this call, and we've talked about previously. As that growth shows up, and it shows up to the extent that we've embedded it within the context of our guidance numbers and to the extent it shows up even greater. There is the opportunity for additional transmission investment to connect that resources to that demand growth to that load growth. We have some obviously, the transmission bill we have within the context of our current construction plan reﬂects the expectation we have relative to the our 2% to 2.25% sales growth. To the extent that that growth goes beyond that, which again, given what we're seeing we view as a possibility. That could be transmission to connect those load pockets. And, we could see additional transmission spend associated with that.  Stephen, from a transmission point of view, obviously the way to think about it is we've got a plan -- the construction plan of the $1.7 billion over the next three-year period. That would include, as Theo said, some of the economic development activity we have in our plan for that time frame for 2% to 2.25% load growth. The renaissance -- the projects -- the $65 billion that has been announced and that we were talking about. That goes out through 2019 so that's even farther. To the extent that we pick up more, as Theo mentioned, there's an increment that could show up just in the base business. You have got the current run rate. If we get outsized growth on top of that outside growth, we get more. The other two buckets also -- look at the FERC order 1,000 issue any (PMVP) projects that's out there as well that we would anticipate participating in at some level. Certainly within our service territory, and then there's that opportunity outside of it too which we're certainly going to Â¶ consider what we do there as well. So, there's -- the transmission part of the business is actually more complicated and more interesting because of it given those diﬀerent buckets that are all pretty robust at this moment. The normal load growth in and of itself is pretty good based on what we've already got line of sight on. The incremental piece on that could make that even better if we're successful in our     strategy to attract and serve that load. And then, we've got these other two buckets that we're evaluating, and certainly, we're going to have to make sure we do everything we can to do the right thing for our customers and work with our regulators on how we would all work through that. That's an extremely interesting part of the business for us right now that we get to work through."
"That's very helpful. And, I just had a very quick factual question on the EWC business. I assume that the forecast still includes the DOE nuclear waste disposal fee? Is that correct?","Yes. Well, Stephen, there is, as you know, the possibility that that might not be in there. We sort of factored that into our midpoint at ($6.15). If it comes in -- or, I should say, goes away some time in June, it would be about $0.08."
