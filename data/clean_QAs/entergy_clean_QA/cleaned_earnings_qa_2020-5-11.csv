Question,Answer
"Just a couple of questions here. So ﬁrst, thinking about the headwinds, you're calling out at this point, the $100 million to $120 million. You mentioned some relief for COVID costs, can you just be speciﬁc what those costs are or how we should think about ultimate recovery? How long you can kind of diﬀer them?  And then, thinking about the cost reductions you report today to oﬀset the COVID impact. Are these one-time in nature or could we sort of think about them as being somewhat perpetual ongoing beneﬁts? And then I've a follow-up.","Yeah. So I'll address the cost so far. So I think there is kind of two buckets of costs that we're looking at. Some are incident response costs, and those include things like, more PP&E, hand sanitizer, masks, and things like that. There is also cleaning costs associated with that, and then costs associated with moving people around and things like that. Those types of dollars at this point are fairly limited. We expect them to -- for the year to be somewhere in the $15 million range right now, and we've incurred less than half of that so far. We're anticipating as we get back to work there'll be more cleaning costs, for example, and more PP&E that we have to provide over the course of the year.  The other bucket of costs is related to potential bad debt expense, and that is -- we haven't incurred anything of that nature to date, and we probably won't for a while, but those are the kind -- those costs we would expect to incur as well. In terms of the magnitude of that, historically, we've seen about $25 million of bad debt expense, and we have past experiences like 2008-2009 ﬁnancial crisis or Katrina, Rita, that     kind of environment. We've seen anywhere from $10 million to $20 million of incremental bad debt expense in a year. Of course, this could be a little bit worse than that and we're working hard to make sure that we mitigate that. Leo mentioned, new payment plans. We're working to make sure that our customers have access to light [ph] funds and information on how to access the paycheck protection program.  And as I also mentioned in my remarks, we're trying to accelerate some future regulatory liability payments through today to try and mitigate some of those impacts on customer bills. So all of that plays into trying to make sure that customer bills are as low as possible to mitigate what the bad debt expense might ultimately be as well."
"Got it. Thank you. And then just, you guys -- last question, you guys always have some really good insight into your customer trends, right. How much growth do you see being deferred from '20, the new assumptions call up '21 and beyond this potential economic impact as a headwind. Are you quantifying '21 versus just being slightly lower and assuming this backdrop is more protracted versus kind of your own internal planning assumptions. Do you have these incremental levers like today's cost cuts to mitigate or could that start to pressure your growth guide maybe through CapEx referrals that may become secondary in nature? I mean, it sounded like from Leo's comments, you guys are very conﬁdent around the plan. So I just want to -- under the assumption, this is more protracted. Do you see any kind of concerns around growth CapEx, 5% to 7%, or you have enough levers at your disposal, I guess?","All right. There was a lot in that. I will start with the customer trends piece and then talk about O&M and then ﬁnish with CapEx. So on the customer trends fees, the expectation in our outlook right now is that our sales will be about 1% below what we were planning in '21 and '22. Obviously there's a lot of uncertainty associated with that. So we are also running scenarios to think about what it might be if something lower than that. Once we get out a couple of years, we should have gone through regulatory processes in each jurisdiction and that should help us, but at the same time, we are also working on, okay, so what other O&M management tools might we have at our disposal to work our way through that. And the further we get out, the more sustainable we really need these cost changes to be unlike this year.  This year, as we mentioned, there is a lot of one-time items, and we're trying to look for additional continuous improvement in the O&M category that is more sustainable, but we really need to rely on our skills to develop that -- those opportunities as we go forward to manage that a little bit more. There always be one-time levers within a given year that we have, but we will -- on a long-term basis we want to rely on continuous improvement.  And then ﬁnally, in regards to growth CapEx. We currently don't have any plans to change our growth capital or our capital at all for that matter, and we think it's important for our communities and our customers and for us to continue to make     those investments. We think we have the capacity and liquidity to do that, there is no concerns there. If for some reason, it was lower for longer from a sales perspective, it might start to shift around the nature of that capital. So for example, if we no longer needed some transmission capital to meet NERC reliability standards, there may be other capital that we think would be very important for our customers in the distribution space. So there is a lot of levers still to manage things going forward, but hopefully that answers all of the nuances of your one question."
"Got it. Congrats, Leo and Drew on this execution. Stay safe. See you soon.","Thanks, Shar. You too.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your question please."
"Yeah. Hi. How are you guys? Thanks for the time. Just wanted to follow-up on the last set of questions. I'll throw in a quick follow-up. But starting with the last set. How do you think about your FRPs across various states in those rate caps against the need to ensure earning at your returns, and at the same time, recognizing the consistency commitment to invest capital? I imagine, obviously twin goals, it seems like you had a little bit more latitude than you had historically in those annual ﬁling, ﬁrst oﬀ?  And then the second one is just, if you can quantify the potential impact of that theory decision from the ALJ? That's a quick one.","All right. It's Rod. Good morning. I'll start on the FRPs, and perhaps Drew will follow- up. In Louisiana and Arkansas, Mississippi, and New Orleans, we've just mentioned that four of our ﬁve jurisdictions had FRPs in eﬀect, where those FRPs are working as designed, and to the extent that the COVID cost might operate beyond the FRPs we have the accounting orders that would just reference. We are seeking to renew the FRPs in Louisiana and Arkansas, because in Mississippi we don't have a sunset provision, but those FRPs are working as designed to address many of the changes in sales as we are forecasting.  So from an FRP perspective, the eﬃcient recovery mechanism we have in each of the state is giving us the relative conﬁdence we have around what we are forecast and its     incorporating the various puts and takes with O&M and projected sales. So it's working as designed. It is certainly part of the case we're making to renew them in Arkansas and Louisiana. So from that vantage point, we think the FRPs are working as designed.    And I'll just add. You asked about the rate path. Our expectation for the rate path is that we would still be at or below inﬂation. You have to take into account the excess ADIT that we have been given back last year if you reap oﬀ of 2019, but it's still a very low growth rate for our rates and our bill path.  And then, you asked about ROEs. As Leo was talking about, we have an important role to play in the community right now in terms of putting capital to work to not only beneﬁt our customers, but also to drive economic activity. And in order to do that, we have to make sure that we maintain adequate credit and liquidity, and our retail regulators know that we've been in conversations with them about that. And so, they are also committed to make sure that we have the credit and liquidity we need to do the things that require to support our customers and our communities. So I think that's -- I think that will help address some of the ROE question as well.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question -- our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Your question please."
"I just wanted to start up -- I guess, what you guys are seeing across your footprint right now? In your diﬀerent jurisdictions you start to see -- certain areas start to open up and just wondering kind of maybe more real-time like what type of trends are you seeing from your larger customers ramping up and what kind of line of sight have you gleaned from that kind of informs your guidance here?","Yeah -- and this is Rod again. I think in the -- across the customer segments, we alluded to it earlier, certainly in the residential segment, the stay-at-home orders have certainly driven the expected experience of high usage per customer in that segment. A lot of variability across the commercial customer segments, as Drew alluded to, where we saw schools and restaurants, movie theaters, and churches experiencing the brunt of the near-term demand erosion. In the industrial sector, we've been in constant communication -- aside from the AMI data that we're tracking     on a day-to-day basis, we've been in constant communication with those larger industrial customers around their respective outlooks.  We are paying as much attention to the various components of their value chain as perhaps they might and they've given us relative comfort that the data we are receiving from AMI is supportive of our point of view that about approximately 10% demand erosion that we are experiencing in the last several weeks is likely to be stable until such time as the economy recovers.  Certainly, in the Reﬁning and Primary Metals segment, we expected those segments to be harder hit in driving some of the downturn, and that's played out in a way that we expected, and that -- I say that with all of the uncertainty that still remains around the timing of the economic recovery relative to our ability to get testing and tracing and things of that nature. And so the engagement -- in addition to the AMI data, the engagement with customers has really reinforced what we're seeing, and certainly it plays out diﬀerently from state to state, but the signiﬁcant presence of our industrial base in -- is in Louisiana and Texas, and that's where we've seen the lion's share of volatility within a 10% range."
That makes sense. And then maybe just picking up on that last point for the longer- term for the industrial petchem load. It seems like the Brent Henry Hub spread kind of being a proxy for naphtha ethane spread. It has been the key determinant of the US Gulf Coast competitive advantage across the global cost curve given the favorable feedstock there. Do you worry that the dynamic of a tighter crude oil to nat gas spread narrows this competitive advantage and kind of adversely impact future low growth versus prior expectations?,"Yeah, this is Drew. So we are closely monitoring that spread. That's one of the ones that we pay close attention to as well for the very reason that you mentioned. And obviously, near-term, that spread is not as healthy as it has been historically, but we do expect it to return to where it was and continue to provide economic advantage for our Gulf Coast industrial customers going forward, and we do see those spreads and others like them being healthy if you look at on a long-term basis. But we recognize that near-term, they are a little bit more challenged. It does not change some of the other advantages that we do have that I listed oﬀ in my remarks, but that is one that we are paying close attention to."
"Most of my questions have been addressed. I just wanted to go into tax in a little more detail. I think the change in guidance in terms of the tax is about a net improvement of around $0.18 a share, and I wonder if you could just give a little color around what the changes were. I guess, I see an IRS settlement and stock- based comp, could you sort of explain what the changes were in a little more detail?","Sure, Stephen. The main one is the IRS settlement which we completed in the quarter. That settlement had to do with Isaac securitization costs for several years ago. And while there is a tax beneﬁt on the tax line, much of that is oﬀset in the revenue through customer givebacks, and that is net about $0.05 only.  The other stuﬀ is like the stock-based compensation, that's just annual true-ups that occur each year whenever stock vests, and we true up from a tax perspective. There is no true up from a GAAP perspective. That's why there is a diﬀerence there."
"Understood. And I understand the expectation is now for an 18% eﬀective income tax rate this year. Longer-term, approximately, where do you see your eﬀective income tax rate being, just so we're trying to think through your longer-term earnings power properly?","It's similar where we had it previously, around the 22% range."
"Just a quick question on -- previously you said you thought that equity from 2021 would be on the order of 5% to 10% of utility investment. With some of this, if you're going to accelerate some of these regulatory liabilities and then maybe have a cash impact, is that still a good number or should we be thinking about re-calibrating that scale once we get after 2020?","That's -- I think that's still a good number. We're very careful about the way that we are moving reg liabilities forward. They are either increasing rate base, because they are coming out or we are discounting them to make sure that we are economically neutral, such that we have more cash ﬂow in the future. So that's the either way we should have the ﬁnancing headroom to move some of those liabilities forward. It's going to -- those kind of choices will impact the current year's FFO to debt ratio, but there should be a little bit better headroom in that ratio going forward as a result."
"Okay. Great. And then you mentioned, Drew, wanting to keep the rates -- the rate below inﬂation. Have your views of inﬂation as you make in the plan changed and can you share what your number is that you're using for longer-term inﬂation?","That's an excellent question, Jonathan. I wish I knew what inﬂation was going to be. We use 2% as a rule of thumb for that, kind of the benchmark that we look at, you know adding $3 trillion of ﬁscal stimulus. We don't really know what that will do for inﬂation."
"Fair enough. Okay. That's good to know what your -- what your number is. And then, I think that was -- and just one thing. I was trying to reconcile the Slide 15 on retail sales which shows, I think that shows what you're expecting industrial to be down 7% for the year. And then Slide 41, how that 1.5% number on industrial, is that -- is that just a typo or is a diﬀerent basis of what you're telling us there?","Yeah, they are two diﬀerent basis. The one on Slide 15 is versus our original guidance. And as you will recall, we were planning to be up about 6% or 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5%. I can't remember the exact number, but -- and you subtract out the 7% you're getting to the --"
I got it. okay. The one -- so the guidance had the uptick and that's it. Thank you.,"Thank you, Jon.  Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe. Your question please."
"Good morning, Leo. Just wanted to do to re-ask the question that was asked earlier about the CRE decision on the ALJ and if that were ﬁnalized, you know you don't think it will be, what the impact would be?","So this is Drew. And yes, thanks Steve, for picking that up. We didn't quite get to it on Julien's question. So we appreciate you re-asking it. The impact is laid out in the queue. As Leo mentioned, there are a lot of details. There's two components to the ruling that came through associated with lease payments and uncertain tax positions and the amounts are in there. The lease payments is a little bit unclear, because the calculation from the ALJ wasn't provided speciﬁcally. So we don't -- the bottom line is, we don't think that will be a very large impact there. The larger one is the uncertain tax positions. And as the ALJ laid it out, if you include the refund and the interest, it looks like it's close to about $600 million.  As Leo mentioned, we believe that we have the right policy perspective, and that the ALJ's ruling is interim into the FERC is the one that would drive policy decisions. And we would also note that in that calculation, even though the ALJ wrote about it, ALJ     did not include oﬀsets that are included -- that you might included in there, like, interest that we've been paying to the IRS for the position over time, and that would reduce that $600 million down -- down to a little less than -- probably a little bit more than half of what that -- what the ALJ put out. And of course, the overall impact of that would basically be the ﬁnancing costs of whatever that number would ultimately be."
"Okay. And just -- so that would be obviously a one-time refund, just -- is there any -- aside from ﬁnancing that as a risk, would there be any other ongoing earnings impact or just the one-time?","Well, the lease payments, they indicated that -- they indicated that the lease payment will not be able to continue. That's what the ALJ wrote, which is about $17 million a year. And then, of course, the one-time would be a change in our rate base on an ongoing basis for the deferred tax position. So there we have that as well."
"Okay. One other question. Just the -- you probably said this, but I'm -- maybe I'm still just not clear on it. Just in terms of the base assumptions you're using for your kind of sales forecast now. How would we track kind of progress or reopening soon, and then slow recovery, and that's kind of -- how to think about kind of the base economic -- something that you're using?","Yeah, this is Rod. I'll start the -- the base assumption is that, sometime in the early summer that is later this month, into June, we'll begin to see a change in the stay-at- home order orders and that dynamic will begin the upswing in the economy. The outlook through 2020, particularly from an industrial growth perspective is essentially that 10% reduction in industrial demand, that's driving the overall growth for the utility would then begin to see a slower up uptick. And then as Drew laid out, in '21 and '22, we expect the drivers of our growth to still be driven by industrials as the commercial and residential sort of normalizes to our pre-COVID point of view.    And Steve, I'll just add that the timing of all that matters a lot. So if the current economic environment lingers through the summer, and there people are more at home than what we're planning, because they're not working, that could be sales improvement for us because of the higher residential load that we typically experience in the summer time. So if that -- if they were to linger all the way through the end of the year, of course, the summer would end and it would fall back into what we kind of expecting on the second quarter, which would not be as positive, but the timing of it all does matter."
"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Real quickly, the O&M savings, the $100 million, do you expect that to be kind of a permanent savings level or do you expect all of that to come back and we should be embedded in '21 or '22 forecast?","Yeah, this is Drew, Michael. We are currently considering that to be one-time -- one- time savings."
"So it's an O&M that will go away, but eﬀectively it would come back in future years, maybe not all in 2021 but over time. So not leading to a permanent kind of O&M reduction.","Yes, it's not permanent. The timing of it, some of it depends. We're already working to -- because some of it is deferrals to 2021. So we are working to even oﬀset those in 2021 in our forecast. But I would say that they are just one-time and they don't really relate to future periods at this point."
"Okay. And can you remind us in your multi-year EPS forecast, what is assumed for kind of an O&M growth rate oﬀ of 2019?","We were saying that we were going to come in at about $2.65 billion for utility impairments O&M, and then we're going to keep that ﬂat."
"Got it. Okay. Great. And then last thing. On EWC, can you remind me, do you expect EWC to send cash up to the parent or need cash infusions from the parent over the next couple of years.","We have said that we expected to be net cash positive to the parent, not by a lot, but by little. And as we get closer to the end, it's trending to zero, because we're very much close to the end of EWC. But right now it's still net cash positive to the parent."
"Got it. And then I'll keep one last one. The RFP for new gas generation in Texas, just curious, does the change in the outlook for demand change the need for the size and scale of that unit?","At this point in time, no. As you recall, Michael, the new generation is typically replacing older generation with a much more eﬃcient lower cost, more environmentally sound unit. So this is all part of that portfolio transformation strategy that we've had, where the net adds to our capacity are relatively small compared to the amount of generation that we're at. I think, actually within the next year, we may pare down three new -- three old plants, and we're deactivating units as well. And up till this past year, when we put a couple of new units in service, we were pretty well, you know as many megawatts as we added, that's what we were deactivating.  So it's not -- as I mentioned earlier, when you look at the capital plan, over 90% of the capital plan is driven by this improvement in the level of service through a technological overhaul across all four functions that we invest in, whether it's generation, transmission, distribution or customer solutions, and that is going to continue. And as Drew mentioned, to the extent, some of our reliability investment in transmission is kind of like the Lake Charles project was a couple of years ago after the fact beeﬁng up the system to serve load that had already been there to the extent that that might change where we've got a whole host of distribution and customer solutions opportunities that could take its place, a lot of which actually drive down the cost while they improve the level of service for our customers. So they're a good option for us to make.  So I know it's a bit of a long answer to your question, Michael, but keep in mind, 90 plus percent of the capital plan is driven by that reliability improvement, technological improvement across the system, and beneﬁting customers, and then obviously in the near-term, we're overlaying on that fact that there's a lot of jobs created by the work we do. And if there's one thing everybody can agree on, more people need to be working today rather than fewer."
"Got it. Thank you, Leo and Drew. Much appreciate it guys.","Thank you, Michael.    Operator   Thank you. Our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Your question please."
"Hi. Good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe I could just quickly follow-up on Indian Point. Just check in if there are any disruptions in the process that you're going through from the wide shutdowns in New York State? Thank you.","Hey, Sophie. Thanks. For Indian Point, no change. Indian Point to shut down, as Leo mentioned, April 30, and it's currently being refueled. As far as the processes around the sale of Indian Point, those were initially slightly delayed, but we still have plenty of time. We don't expect to close on that transaction till about this time next year. So we have plenty of time to continue to work through the processes in New York and at the NRC, and we still believe that the interest in New York are aligned with ours. Looking for a way to expeditiously decommission Indian Point is the goal, and working with Holtec to make that happen, we believe this continues to be the best option. So no real changes at Indian Point at this time."
