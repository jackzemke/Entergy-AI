Question,Answer
"Just following up on the point of view conversation, which is obviously getting a lot of attention. If the point of view was consistent with where prices were earlier in the second quarter, can you talk about the lack of additional hedging that happened from the ﬁrst quarter to the second quarter and how you guys are going to kind of approach the hedging strategy over the remainder of the year?","Sure. Dan, this is Bill. Couple of things. As we look at what's happened in the shorter- term market as mentioned, we've seen moderate weather, increasing storage. Obviously, the front end of the curve has dropped down. However, when you look at 2015, we are still – our point of view is consistent with market, and in fact, in the second quarter we executed about 750 megawatts of hedges or converting placeholder hedges into more ﬁxed price hedges, which represents about 17% of the portfolio. So at this point in time, we believe we have got 2015 adequately hedged. As you look out into the future, 2016 and beyond, our point of view is largely unchanged. Perhaps 2016 was reduced a little bit from a point of view perspective, but remember that as we talk about the ability to hedge, there's a couple of things to consider.  One is, and primarily is, the liquidity out in the marketplace. So as we look at hedging 2016 to 2018, we're seeing a much less liquidity than we do for 2015. Obviously our point of view is higher than current market prices and increasingly higher as you go further out on the curve really due to the drivers both from a heat rate perspective, heat rates being compressed and our point of view on demand for natural gas. So we remain bullish on natural gas because of addition of gas generation, shutdown of coal units, incremental industrial load, additional exports to Mexico and LNG expansion.  So really the challenge we face 2016 to 2018 is just a lack of liquidity and the fact that our point of view is substantially higher. The other piece of that is if you remember I think we were pretty clear at Analyst Day, volatility in the markets has been substantial since the polar vortex, therefore, making structured products, options, et     cetera much more costly, and really we don't believe now is the time to put those hedges on."
"Thank you for that explanation, and then, Leo, there seems to be couple of Utility properties for sale in the region. Can you just remind us how you guys think about M&A and how that prioritizes against the CapEx program you guys have internally?","Sure, Dan. The whole M&A question for us has not changed in terms of how we think about it. We have our objectives as a company that we're trying to meet in terms of growing the business, and if we can do transactions that will facilitate that objective, we'll do them. So something with a growth opportunity, something with a balance sheet opportunity, something with a cash ﬂow opportunity, things like that.  The capital decision that you're talking about for us is probably a little bit unique and that we have signiﬁcant amount of growth opportunities that reside within the Utility itself, the organic kind of growth. So that just, I guess, would tend to potentially make the bar higher if we were looking to deploy capital, deploy balance sheet, towards something, it would have to be a superior way to grow the business than the objectives or the opportunities that we have within the business itself.  And again, as we've talked about a lot of times, the size of the customers that we look to add, the 1,700 megawatts, is between now and kind of the foreseeable future. But as long as oil to gas ratio stays where it is, as long as the opportunities remain out there from a manufacturing standpoint, you know, that was just a point in time estimate. We go out beyond that; we would continue to see that growth opportunity.  So nothing's changed. If you think about our objectives, growing the Utility business and preserving optionality within EWC, if we can help manage that with a transaction, we'll do it. But the thing we have to be mindful of is the capital deployment opportunities we have within the business as well."
"Excellent. So ﬁrst question on the EWC side, if you could comment, with regards to what's going on in New York, not just with the highway but the REV, how do you see that impacting the future of Indian Point? And perhaps more broadly, what are your latest thoughts on the Lower Hudson Valley, pricing and sustainability as a construct, if you could comment?","Sure. This is Bill. As it relates to our point of view on New York, if you look at where they stand, obviously they're in a situation where they've got declining reserve margins. In fact, as Leo mentioned, if you look at their projections as they go into the future, they really need Indian Point. In fact, if they try to pull Indian Point out of the portfolio, even with some of the resource additions proposed, they violate reliability limits.  So we believe that projects or policies, such as REV, are certainly something that can be implemented over time. But it will take a substantial amount of time to implement those. And if you look at lot of the proposed projects in New York and the timing associated with those projects, you really have to question the viability of those projects and if they can meet the actual commercial operations date. So our point of view is that Indian Point remains critical for reliability, economic sustainability and also environmental sustainability.  As it relates to Lower Hudson Valley zone, we feel conﬁdent that FERC will uphold its decision on that zone. Prices can change in that zone as resources are added. As we look out into the future we include some of that in our forecast. Obviously, Danskammer is on the front burner right now and so we're watching that very closely. Our point of view on that is that maybe part of that unit may become commercially viable within a reasonable period of time. The rest of that unit may take longer as it relates to the larger units at that facility, but we, in general, we believe that the pricing associated with LHV will be maintained and that FERC will uphold its prior decisions."
"So I wanted to ask a little bit about your mention, Leo, of the carbon rule. I noted that you said that the implementation may not match the EPA's objectives if I can quote or misquote you. But can you give us a little more detail on what you think the development of that situation might look like?","Sure. Rod will handle that.      Behind the comment is the observation, we're not going to make a formal statement beyond it, it is the observation that the state by state limits that have been, that at least are evident in the EPA proposed rule, remember it is just a proposal, suggest to us that we're not going to, it's not going to be an easy path to achieve across the board emissions if we just limit it to a state by state approach.     Our fear is that the marginal cost of compliance across the board is ultimately going to wind up working against EPA's objectives to reduce carbon and have a greater impact on, for instance, jobs, the cost of electricity for customers. Here is where we see the chaos creating problems for EPA's objectives. If we aren't able between now and October to arrive at, let's just call it, a consensus position for EPA, given the industry, given the respective states, we're going to put, we're going to force EPA to wind up having to go square against Congress and as a forcing mechanism to try and get at a comprehensive energy plan. We don't see that as being realistic within EPA's timeline.  And what we're trying to ﬁgure out between now and October is whether or not there's a path that allows us to get there. And so we're taking a very cautious approach but recognizing the complexity of this rule alone, it's just making it really diﬃcult for us to see a path where EPA is actually achieving these stated goals, of achieving through its four, what we call building blocks, to achieving any realistic, achievable, enforceable rules at the end of the day.  And Entergy has been at the forefront of greenhouse gas reductions from 2012. And just from our limited perspective given where we are today, we really don't see how beyond EPA's stated goals how they'd get there from here. And it's just we're trying to remain optimistic. We're trying to remain engaged with EPA in ﬁguring out whether the rule can be modiﬁed between now and October. But we're having a hard time ﬁnding a reason to be optimistic that this ultimately works for us.    Kit, if I could just add, as Rod said, there's stated objectives about the reductions, stated objectives about the ﬂexibility, stated objectives about types of technology and everything and then there's a lot of math behind the rule. And we're not sure that the math and the stated objectives all mesh up as well, but as he said, proposed rule through constructive dialogue, through those sorts of things maybe we get there. But it's just kind of drawing that line as Rod said between all those objectives, the complexity of the state by state issue and then the math that goes behind it that might not support it, but it's still early in the process."
"Right. Okay, and then the follow on one particular state, New York, has there been any indication that the folks who matter in New York say at the Governor's oﬃce or other high ranking oﬃcials that the possibility of the carbon implementation has changed their thinking at all or led them to reassess how they think about Indian Point?",This is Bill. I would say at this point we have not seen any – we haven't had any signiﬁcant dialogue associated with that. We've had some conversations with the PSC but I think like us everybody is still in the process of trying to evaluate this and understand how it practically gets implemented. So it wouldn't be fair to say we've seen a change in their position at this point in time.
"Hey, Leo, I know you guys have been a point of view company from as far as I can ever remember, but I don't recall kind of initially having the point of view as part of the guidance. So just when we're thinking about future quarters and periods, how are you going to be updating the point of view so to speak? Just so we – I'm sure you're updating somewhat at all the time but is this more of like an annual thing, quarterly thing? How should we think about that?","Well, I'd say that in continuing with past practice, we are not putting our point of view in guidance. In continuing with other, with past practices, we are – we've got it overarching in our decision making process and in our outlook. So when we look at guidance, with the exception of the fact that I think last year when we were given – we had to put something in on Lower Hudson Valley and there was no market and so we're clear about imputing that. Our guidance is inclusive of market, not our point of view.  Now our outlook of what we think is achievable and where we'll be, that's based on what we think is going to happen. And in a lot of situations, that includes an assumption about the price power. And that's where we put our point of view and where we think we'll be at that point in time. But we would distinguish that diﬀerent from guidance. And that's I don't think diﬀerent than our past practices.  As far as how often we'll update that, obviously we're going to continue to give you a perspective around where we think we're going to get by 2016, et cetera. But that will probably be on a quarterly basis. And while we update our book every day, we don't run all the way through all the ﬁnancial models every day all the time. Hope that helps."
Okay. And you highlight the pension discount rate a couple of times; was that just because that's been a volatility item historically?,"Yes. As you know, it gets that at the end of each year based on interest rates at that particular point in time. And so it is uncertain as to whether it will actually become until you get to that point. Interest rates have been trending down most of the year. So there is some risk to that. And I know you all are aware of that. But that's just part of the list. We want to make sure that you're thinking about all the drivers that we're thinking about."
"Just a quick one on, there's been obviously a ﬁling made at the New York PSC around some kind of a contract support for another upstate nuclear plant. Could you comment on that, just conceptually, and any sort of likelihood or interest in a similar arrangement or request for Fitzpatrick?","Hey, Jonathan, this is Bill. Yes, we're well aware of the ﬁling that's been made regarding that facility. Our understanding at this point in time is that is for – to meet a short-term reliability need. As it relates to Fitzpatrick, we always consider those types of options. But in general, we continue to try to advocate for improved market structures. Our general thought is that if – we have the right market structure which     values the attributes of speciﬁc generators. And obviously, with nuclear it's base load, carbon-free generation with onsite fuel. That is a much better long-term solution. However, if there are opportunities to enter into other agreements based on certain other needs on the system such as reliability, we certainly are open to that. But nothing on the table right now."
"I guess just back to the point of view. Could you give us what you think the reason is that the market is mispricing or is not accurately forecasting the issues that you see coming up in terms of reserve margin, et cetera?","Sure. A couple things you have to remember that I think are constants in what we've talked about for a number of years as it relates to point of view and the forward market is, number one, is as you look at the forward power markets, you got to remember that there's a lot more sellers than there are buyers as it relates to long- dated transactions. And so while we see very good liquidity in the front end of the curve, so obviously for the prompt months and for the next year, as you get beyond that, you have a lot less natural buyers.     As a result of that, probably one of the key drivers in the lower market prices is lower heat rates. And that's just the situation that we are dealing with and we have been dealing with. As you get closer to delivery, then you will see the markets respond. You'll see heat rates increase and you'll see the issue such as the physical constraints that exist in the market, in the physical delivery market, start to come out in the forward markets. And so I can't tie it to any speciﬁc issue. Our belief is that in general, infrastructure in the Northeast is going to be constrained. We're seeing a lot more retirements than we are seeing resource additions. Therefore, we're seeing lower reserve margins, and as we saw during the polar vortex, when you get periods of high peak demand, then you see a signiﬁcant rise in the price of both natural gas and the price of power."
"Okay. And then turning to New York and the legislation which passed the House of Representatives to de-fund I guess FERC's activity regarding the new capacity zone, how should we think about, A, what do you think the likelihood of that passing the Senate would be? And B, even if it does pass the Senate, what would the practical eﬀect be considering that I think pretty much FERC has already acted on this and acted on the hearing if I understand it correctly. If you could just sort of elaborate a little bit on that.","Well, ﬁrst let me say that this type of intervention in the markets goes to the very heart of what we're working on from a market structure perspective and is what's actually undermining some of the markets, overall when we actually see political motives behind proposed changes that aﬀect that market. As it relates to this speciﬁc appropriations bill, we – it's not currently, has not been initiated in the Senate at all. And our prevailing belief is that FERC has ruled on this, they've had all the information required to make their decision and we remain conﬁdent they will maintain that decision going forward."
"Okay. But I mean, if they de-fund this, how would that actually impact FERC? I mean, is there – would it just be simply symbolic? Or would it actually have a practical impact on the capacity zone? Can you...","In terms of, this is Rod West, in terms of the actual order that FERC currently has out, the rule is in place. And so the de-funding doesn't change the tariﬀ that's ultimately in eﬀect. Yes, you can assume – and you'd have to ask FERC this, whether or not they were speciﬁcally de-funded, whether they would lose the ability to access resources from other sources to actually do their job. It's so from a practical matter, the rule is where it is and in the unlikely event, and we do not believe that it is a likely outcome that the Senate would carry that amendment, that's a question for FERC, but we have to have conﬁdence that FERC's jurisdiction at the end of the day is going to be upheld and supported through the legislative process."
"Thanks. Looking at the preliminary 2015 drivers, can you elaborate at all on the changes in the, the eﬀective changes in EWC deprecation? Because I guess in 2014, I think your guidance had like a $0.25 increase in depreciation, and it looks like you're looking for depreciation to go up yet further in 2015.","Yes, this is Drew. That just relates to normal incremental capital, most of it above what we're depreciating right now related to Fukushima and the like. So that's just normal changes. Last year, Paul, you'll remember that we had that new depreciation study, and that's what was driving..."
"Okay. And then in terms of the Department of Environmental Conservation remaining hearings in New York, can you give us an idea of when the hearings are expected to end on Indian Point?","Sure. I think you saw a ﬂurry of activity last week regarding this matter, where we had a number of politicians, business folks, community members really speak out against the proposed capacity outages. Following that, the ALJs decided that they were going to push back the hearings associated with that topic for several months. They were scheduled to take place in January of 2015. Our point of view on this whole process hasn't really changed since we talked to you at Analyst Day, as we don't see any decision occurring on this matter any time before 2016, and likely may get pushed beyond that. So our point of view on that is consistent with what we talked to you about at Analyst Day."
"Wanted to talk about membership in MISO and just if there's any general timing we should be thinking about in terms of further transmission planning, sort of signposts we can look to in terms of the capital that will be required to integrate Entergy into MISO.","Theo, you want to take that?      Yes. I'll start and maybe others could weigh on this a little bit. MISO obviously goes through with its transmission planning processes. And as I think as I talked about at the Analyst Day, we talked a little bit about transmission opportunities, and I laid out a timeline as it related to projects that might have been submitted under MISO's MVP/MEP processes. And August, the month of August, August we think actually is a time when we would see MISO completing some evaluations of projects that they would consider for their MTEP 2014 process.  So we also generally have our typical MISO transmission planning process that you would go through as a part of MISO where we would submit projects, reliability projects, and that sort of thing. As we laid out again at Analyst Day, I think we said we had about $1.7 billion of transmission CapEx through 2016. Many of the projects that would be reliability type projects that we would submit through MISO would be part of that $1.7 billion. But again, as you think about other types of projects, the MVP projects or other types of projects that might enhance economic beneﬁts, you could see potentially spending above that level."
"Okay. Thank you. And just shifting gears for follow-up on Indian Point in the Coastal Zone Management Process, what is the earliest date under which the New York State Department of State could make a consistency determination? I know the deadline is at the end of this year. But what would be the earliest date they could make a decision?","Well, they could actually make a decision themselves by the end of the year. However, we have reason to believe as based on previous experience, that, that decision could actually be further delayed. Remember, consistent with our discussion at Analyst Day, then that would, if it was an adverse decision, then we would take that to a Secretary of Commerce appeal process, which lasts over a year and then there's appeals process in addition to that. So at this point in time everything that we mentioned at Analyst Day is still correct."
