Question,Answer
"Maybe just starting with the equity message ﬁrst, you really laid out some of the drivers behind this, but just wanted to drill down more speciﬁcally on the share count aspects for '21, as well as just the overall evaluation. Could you speak a little bit more just to the timing of updating for the new Moody's outlook. And what other considerations around business mix and where the plan stands now could factor into the lower equity needs?","Sure. So I'll talk about the time, this is Drew, I'll talk about the timing ﬁrst. We've been working on this a long time, but we just got the recognition from Moody's in the past week or so as I mentioned. And so we are still early in the assessment of what the overall impact mean, I pointed to a couple early elements associated with it. We expect to complete that this fall, it could be sooner, I would say probably no later than the EI, but it could be sooner than that. And as it relates to something like the share count or speciﬁcs around size, I don't have those kinds of details available to give you today, other than to say, we believe it will be meaningful, it will be a meaningful change.  In terms of the evaluation, which is I think part of the question that you had in there, we still want to make sure that we are hitting our earnings and credit expectations. We will still need to issue a little bit of equity to do that, but the opportunity is much more robust in front of us now, we think it's been signiﬁcantly derisked. We have a lot more conﬁdence as I said in our ability to execute and -- but we don't have. We don't have speciﬁcs that we can give you today.     A couple of other sizing or I should say evaluation perspectives one is it, as we have talked about extensively, we have a signiﬁcant growth opportunity ahead of us and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to invest into that opportunity as it materializes. And then Moody's speciﬁcally also talked about SIRI and our ability to manage that risk as it's presented right now, speciﬁcally around the uncertain tax position case.  And their perspective was that we should be able to manage that risk and still meet the expectations around earnings and credit. And so we want to make sure that we have that capacity built-in as well. And of course, we still believe that we're going to be successful in SIRI, I know that wasn't really your question, but if that doesn't materialize, that would be incremental opportunity for us to invest in the business."
"Got it. Thanks for the color there. And then maybe just switching gears to the CCGT in Texas, what is the timeline for regulatory approval and do you expect the hygiene and aspect to impact approvals process at all?","Hi, it's Rod. Good morning. From a procedural standpoint, the process will begin at the Commission right around the Labor Day timeframe. We're zeroing in on that. And then the procedural schedule will be set by the PUCT and that process could run six to 12 months if we are eﬃcient in the way that we're pursuing it, but again that's up to the PUCT in Texas. And you asked a question around the hydrogen component, I want to make sure I heard the question correctly."
"Sure, just curious you've given the novel nature of hydrogen component if you expect that to impact approvals process at all?","No, the hydrogen component as it's currently conﬁgured represents approximately 5% of the overall cost. And we believe we have a compelling case for why having that ﬂexibility beneﬁts our customers and certainly would support the CCN. So it's novel of course and we are prepared to explain why it's been oﬃcial, but more importantly, bringing our customer beneﬁts along when we think about the industrial opportunity that we are -- that both Leo and Drew referenced.  We think that also adds to the viability of hydro being part of the CCN process at this stage.  Jeremy, I'll just add to what Rod said, there's two advantageous components to the hydrogen piece of this. One is certainly in the environmental space that hydrogen is a cleaner fuel. The other is that what we are going to end up with at the end of the day is a dual fuel unit, it will be able to run on natural gas or hydrogen or any     combination in between. And so if you think about resiliency that optionality provides not only environmental beneﬁts, but a added level of resiliency which we've all seen is something that we need as we start to deal with the weather events."
"If I can try to rehash a little bit, I know it's early in the process, but maybe the other way to ask this is, what are the big puts and takes as you think about the outlook now relative to new targets, et cetera. I just want to make sure that as you think about it, what are the building blocks that you're -- shall we say assessing here early in the process? And then related to that, if you can just sneak this in there, where are you just in the ﬁnancing plan year-to-date. I know this is all ﬂuid and dynamic, but would it be done thus far this year relative to the full-year plan and expectations here if you can around that.","So, Julien, this is Drew. In terms of the big puts and takes, I mean I think the ﬁrst thing is just sort of the back of the envelope math in terms of what the -- how much put and take is out there and when you go from 15% to 14% and given the size of our cash ﬂow, it's somewhere in the $1.7 billion to $2 billion range and it's sort of growing over time. So it's a lot of extra capacity. The -- yeah and what we are considering in terms of the building blocks, I think this I mentioned I think there's probably three big ones, right? One is, well, okay, so how much incremental equity do we really need right now that will take up some of that capacity.  One is how much opportunity is really out there for growth in the commercial industrial space as we ramp up our ability to work alongside our customers to manage their Scope 1 and Scope 2 positions, those are probably the two big ones.     Then Moody's speciﬁcally talked about our ability to manage identiﬁable risks that are out there and they pointed to SIRI speciﬁcally and if you take the -- if you take the ALJ's recommendation around uncertain tax position, that's in the ballpark of little over $500 million that could be a piece of capacity as well. Certainly we are very comfortable in the way that we are positioned in that case and we can go through that and we have in the past as you know purely. So I mean I think it's -- that is additional something that we're thinking about as well make sure that we have the capacity to manage that risk like that and that Moody's was pointing at that.  So, I mean those are the three things and we certainly had a forecast before this ruling last week that said, we were going to hit our earnings expectations, we were going to hit our targets on credit, now still the case now we have extra capacity to do that and manage through these new opportunities and these risks.  So it's incremental the better for us because it really de-risks our ability to execute."
"Right. And perhaps, is that still in the current year, I just want to understand on the speciﬁc ﬁnancing?","I'm sorry, I didn't hear that Julien (multiple speakers) something that's on the table for us still, but we are looking at -- we're sort of stepping back and thinking about, okay, what's the best way for us to proceed given that we have this extra capacity. And so we want to think through it a little bit before we proceed with so with any speciﬁc ﬁnancings. And once we get ﬁnished with that, then we will start moving forward and communicate with you all about what our plan is."
"And sorry to rehash this slightly your comments on upper half, I just want to be extra clear about this, that is strictly tied to dilution and equity needs and that is not reﬂective of any changes in your cost-cutting eﬀorts and/or perhaps more critically load trends and especially industrial load trends there and et cetera.","Yes, so we were very comfortable in our guidance and our outlooks before just to be clear. And this the fact that we don't needed issue as much equity starts to move their earnings per share up so. So that is a driver for helping us move to the upper half of range. And then in the additional conﬁdence that we have because we have now have additional ﬂexibility to achieve this earnings outcomes and the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility that we have available to us now.  So the combination I would say of those two things that allows us to say, we think we're going to be in the top half of the range with some work to do to reﬁne that for you all going forward."
"Right. Excellent. Well done, will speak to you shortly. All the best in this process.","Thanks, Julien.  Appreciate it.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead."
"Just a quick one again on ﬁnancing, given the lower need, does that make you sort of more likely to look at something which might put this total in no need to bad quicker as opposed to sort of doing it through, through the plan? Any thoughts on that this early stage?","Yeah, Jonathan, that's a good question. Certainly, that is a possibility now, we haven't completed our assessment, but that is something that we would consider if we could do it. We're mindful of the so-called equity overhang. We understand that. And so we are thinking about that as deﬁnitely a consideration as we're doing our assessment."
"Okay. And then just ﬁnally, you obviously from the Analyst Day, you also had a 24 range out there which you've now been including in the last couple of slide decks, so I'm just, so any reason why we wouldn't could have continue to use that and why your comments about the upper end wouldn't also sort of fold into that longer-term outlook that you gave whenever it was?","Yeah, so I mean I can't go out right now because we haven't got that information available, but our expectation is to drive steady predictable earnings and dividend growth and to the extent that we want to be steady, predictable that might imply what you're looking for."
"Couple of things just on those three considerations you mentioned Drew, one of them was the growth opportunity. I assume this is on as you talked about on the industrial, so as they look to clean up and electrify more. just when you talk about that as a growth opportunity, are you referring to more as a kind of rate base CapEx or as a sales and cash ﬂow?","So, Steve, it's a good question, there is couple of growth opportunities that we're assessing right now, one as I mentioned in my script, which doesn't have to do with environmental beneﬁts necessarily, but is part of it is the assessment we're doing, resiliency across the system which could lead to more T&D investment going forward. So that's an area that I did want to point out. The assessment of that in conjunction with what's going on with infrastructure in Washington could be a combination of rate base assets plus some cost that are -- that are actually picked up by the states, the Federal Government through potentially the infrastructure build I think how that all works out.  The big opportunity that -- and we've been talking about this for a while, obviously is the size of the emissions footprint of our industrial base. And if you just go on the Internet, look into our industrial customers, look into websites they all have, sustainability objectives that many of which are public. And so there is a couple of ways for us to help them out. One, what we already do when they provide electricity from us and some of the cleanest electricity in the country, so their Scope 2 emissions are lower.  To drive those even lower, we've been discussing things like green tariﬀs with those customers and that really makes the deployment of our renewables more eﬃcient. And so for example, we've got the solar facility that we got approval for in Arkansas ﬁnally green tariﬀ in Arkansas where we already have customers like Walmart who want to talk to us about taken a slice of those facilities to make the deployment of those more eﬃcient in a way that could accelerate our investment in renewables, yes, there is a large uptake of that particularly and that spreads over into our industrial customers, which we're already having discussions with them on that.  Then the big opportunity is exactly what you said is to attack their Scope 1 emissions and that really is getting outside of just merely adding generation to this technological improvement now we would be adding toward load growth. And so you can think about it as its new load with new sales for new processes that today are not electriﬁed, it would provide us the opportunity to deploy assets to help them read those objectives and primarily that could not only accelerate, but increase the size of our renewable footprint going forward.  We're in the early stage of assessing the size and timing of that, we will be laying out more as we go, but it would be rate base additions to me regulated utility sales for things like those using natural gas compression on a pipeline today, electrifying that or using fossil fuels to -- for compression in LNG process that can be electriﬁed. If they're co-generating with highly ineﬃcient and high emitting generation on site today that could be electriﬁed by us or utilize in green tariﬀs or to the extent that we develop hydrogen over time with that going to be part of things as well. So it's a pretty signiﬁcant opportunity that we're in early stages of investigating, we're having lot of discussions with our customers about what their needs are."
"Okay, great. And just one other question on just the change in the equity plan. So obviously it's great that you're targeting, seeing things now in the upper half, but       actually the amount of equity just that diﬀerence to get you in the upper half by 20 in these years is actually, it's only I don't now maybe $300 million plus equity and you talk to potentially 1.72 billion of more capacity. So could you just try to kind of tie that together in terms of how to think about that is it -- how should I just think about that?","Well, this is Drew. Yeah, I think that we are early in our assessment is properties the best way to think about that. So we got -- we have the news that we got the recognition last week. And so we had completed our assessment about what this might mean for us going forward. And I think when we -- we wanted to get you early out there that we see ourselves in the top half of the range, we have more work to do around that. We have a couple of things that be the factor into the analysis like you just discuss with Leo around the growth potential that's out there. There are a couple of risk guidance out there that we want to make sure that we have to manage and if we can manage through that without using that capacity, that's incremental capacity is available for us, but I think you're looking at the right thing. There is a good opportunity for us out there going forward."
"Okay. So it sounds like you're close obviously you got update balance sheet, but also almost really a full refresh of the capital plan to for some of these things that Leo just mentioned?",That's right. That's then opportunity out there that we're still framing it up.
"Thanks and congratulations. I guess my ﬁrst question is, should we assume that the longer-term FFO to debt target now is going to be 14%?","Only to that, no, not right oﬀ the back, because we still have some expectation of having some capacity to manage risks that are out there, but I do fully expect us to utilize some of the capacity for sort of the capital formation changes that we were     just talking about and for some of the growth opportunity that we're talking about. So I wouldn't say it goes all the way down to 14 unless some of those risk further materialize, but that's not what we are trying to do right now. The idea would be to get pass some of those risks and then maybe we would reassess whether we go down to 14, but I don't think it would go all the way to 14 right now."
"So at some point, you'll provide sort of an amended FFO to debt target?","I think I'll add one thing, from an Entergy perspective, I don't know that we're going to change Entergy's perspective, I mean I think we're talking about going from 15 to 14, our Entergy view is going to be well above 15. I think we may still actually stay above 15, even Moody's dress down closer between 15 and 14. But we may not actually amend the Entergy target, we're still working through that."
And then do you need clarity on SIRI and in water to sort of determine what your ultimate equity needs are going to look like and when would you anticipate a ﬁnal SIRI order?,"Well, I mean we'll talk about the SIRI order ﬁrst. Yeah, I could -- the ﬁrst part of that uncertain tax position in the sale leaseback we expect possibly by the end of the year, but more likely into next year. Yeah, it could be in the ﬁrst quarter, could leak into the spring. So we're getting closer on that, but I don't think we need that to start thinking about what we might do diﬀerently. We might be mindful of that as our ability to continue to hit our marks, but I don't know that we necessarily need that to get started on our changes in our capitalization plan."
So it's more likely that you'll have a better feel for the equity mean around the end of the year around EI right?,"Yeah, when I said earlier was that, I would think EEI the latest hopefully sooner."
"Managing through, just I think I got everything. So around I know we're going to be getting an update, it sounds like on all these opportunities is that how we should think about -- are you guys in early assessments right now, but we'll get more of a picture sort of what these opportunities and how folds into the capital plan everything is that the timeframe we're looking at?","Certainly we'll have update on what opportunities set looks like, what we're thinking and how it's evolved by then. The good news about that opportunity that we are just talking about is that it's a pretty long runway opportunity, it's signiﬁcant opportunity that's got a long path. As you imagine our customer base is going to be reducing their emissions over time, some of them have for example, their own net zero objectives, some of those might be as early as 2035, some of those go out to 2050 that sort of thing.  So it's a signiﬁcant opportunity that's got a long runway, so we'll get you the early parts of it as it develops, but we -- it's kind of thing will continue to update. And as I said in the answer to Steve's question, it's really a low growth question and then the resource mix that we acquire to meet that load, which again the objective is clean energy. So it will probably have implications for what you see in the generation mix."
"Okay. And just to sort of clarify this is basically because of the -- just to make sure I understand, the customer footprint that you guys have, their ambitions and their decarbonization ambitions and the potential to help. Is there any cost advantage that you think these customers might get, is it just purely decarbonization or is there anything else that would be driving this is just basically look where the utility, they want to do this that would mean electriﬁcation and we're in a pretty good position to do that or is this the deployment of new technology or anything that we should think about that would be true supercharging if you follow me?","Well, it's -- obviously cost is going to be a factor. Our low rates factor into it and we certainly need to continue to help our customers be competitive as they go forward. It's going to depend on the process, look for example, Shore Power is the exact same opportunity where you've got a ship pulls into dock, it's burning diesel fuel to keep the lights on while they do maintenance on the ship before they go back out, I mean in to the Gulf of Mexico, for example to be to help with oil services out there.  When we electrify that ship, we not only reduce their emissions, which was the original discussion around it, but it does lower their cost because the trade from our electricity to diesel fuel is positive one. So it does two things, one lowers their cost and improves their emissions, both of which make them more competitive as they bid for oﬀshore work. So it's going to be a combination of all of those things."
"Also, well, it sounds like a great opportunity. Look forward to hear more about it.","Great. Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you.
