Question,Answer
"Just a quick question here. Starting maybe high-level, Leo if it's okay, with kind of the regulatory complaints from New Orleans. Do you have a sense for how the council wants to proceed at this point? I mean, obviously they're looking for input into everything from operational response to ultimate ownership of the assets. Do you envision a path where you don't own the assets anymore or on the contrary is there a negotiated outcome where the city authorizes incremental spending like more transmission interconnection funded by ENO customers to address their concern?","Thanks, Shar. I'd say ﬁrst of all, obviously what we've been doing recently with the council is we've got through the formula rate plan and got those rates in eﬀect. Both council as well as the LPSC and others as I had mentioned were all aligned on approaching the federal government for oﬀsets to customer costs through potentially CDBG funds. And then even in the future in terms of storm-hardening as it relates to infrastructure. So that's really been where we are in terms of what's been going on recently, our focus has been really on how do we get the next steps done in what's a logical progression to what we want to do and that is to support the credit of ENO.  As it relates to those other items, they're still out there and we plan to cooperate with the council as they go forward. In most of those instances, we're still wanting to hear from them in terms of what their objectives are as it relates to whether it's the ownership structure or what have you. So those are processes that they began and to the extent that they have objectives will work collaboratively with them to meet those needs. And we think that however it works out, it'll work out ﬁne for us and for them."
"Got it. Perfect. Thank you for that, Leo. And then just lastly for me and then I know you sort of touched on it a little bit around your prepared comments and it's been obviously an immediate question with investors is just around the storms and maybe the expenses that were incurred. Can we just maybe get an update on some of the other mitigating factors for customer bill headrooms and you obviously talked about volumetric growth and the macro backdrop. But there's obviously and also there's work you're doing with the LPSC in New Orleans to get federal support. But how are you I guess thinking about other charges rolling oﬀ and potentially having the bill headroom to continue kind of investing in CapEx, especially as we're seeing the 24 numbers in line with the 6% midpoint growth in '24? So, we assume this run rate remains healthy despite some of the near-term concerns around build pressure and escalating storm issues?","Yes. Shar, this is Drew. I'll tackle that ﬁrst and then I'll let Rod and Leo pitch in. So I'll mention a couple of things. First of all, the securitization is what we're moving forward with in Texas and Louisiana for the recent storm. But there's also a bunch of securitization is also still rolling oﬀ and that includes costs associated with Ike in Texas. I think that comes rolled oﬀ next year. Similar in Louisiana, Gustav and Ike are rolling oﬀ and even Isaac costs are going to start to roll oﬀ maybe in 2024. So those are relatively near-term that can take some of the pressure oﬀ of the securitization costs.  Also natural gas prices, there's been a lot of discussion about natural gas prices. Obviously, a lot of people are experiencing higher natural gas prices, it highlights some of the investments we've made in high-eﬃciency CCGTs, the diversiﬁcation in our ﬂeet for nuclear, it also highlights the stronger business case for solar. But the forward curve for natural gas is somewhat, as you know, backward dated and the prices get pretty low. In fact, if you just go out a couple of years our internal forecasts are higher than what the NYMEX curve would say by the time you get out to something like 2024. So that's -- we don't necessarily view that as a long-term problem. Certainly it's a challenge for our customers right now starting with winter storm Uri and the price spikes then. But we've already recovered all of those costs and we're moving forward.  And then ﬁnally for some of the growth capital that's out there, we highlighted the three areas associated with signiﬁcant potential investment. Starting with resilience and accelerating our resilience program, that's really kind of in lieu of future securitization to the extent that we can put more resilience in place than what we were already planning that would oﬀset these future securitization costs. So that's a diﬀerent portion of the bill so to speak than we would normally see. And then of course with renewables, the fuel costs the O&M associated with that and if you look at our capital plan we'll talk about this at EEI. There's been quite a bit of rotation in our capital plan in the generation space from CC -- future CCGTs to renewables.  And so, that's taking up bill space that we are already planning to use. And then, ﬁnally, the clean electriﬁcation as Leo mentioned in his remarks that includes incremental sales and that should provide space for that incremental investment. So, we believe that all of that should -- there are spaces for all of this to happen and even accelerate as we go forward in the next few years."
"Got it, got it. I think that was helpful. Thank you for that. Appreciate it guys. I'll leave it at that.","Thanks, Shar.    Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan."
"Hi, this is actually Brandon Travis on for Jeremy. Thanks for having me. First question, I'll follow up with the second one. Can you just comment on the build back better framework and the implications it may have on Entergy's in its current form? And then just particularly as it relates to nuclear hydrogen renewables ahead of your plan refresh at EEI?","Sure, sure. And there's a lot in there. Certainly as we look for support for things like hydrogen and support for things like existing nuclear, we view all of that -- in addition to continued support for renewables, we view all of that as positive towards our ability to keep a low cost proﬁle of the future beneﬁts associated with our capital plan. We're really -- really, I guess, I'll start by saying I'm cautiously optimistic that there will be an infrastructure, infrastructure bills that will be passed. It's -- every day there's new news, one way or the other in terms of how that's going, you here from.  But as you know, we are pretty well-positioned in the hydrogen space. We have a signiﬁcant ﬂeet of existing nuclear plants. We're deploying a lot of new renewables. So all of that focus on tax credits, particularly production tax credits is really we view that as highly supportive of what we are already planning on working forward with. And we would anticipate having the capability at least as we're interpreting things today, and I know there's a lot of devil in the details to come to be able to utilize as much of that as we can for the beneﬁt of our customers. But again, as you know, we're very excited about the hydrogen space.  As I mentioned in my remarks, we made ﬁling associated with getting the Orange County Advanced Power Station, which will be hydrogen capable approved in Texas, with all the hydrogen infrastructure that's around us that'll be very, very important for not only us, but for the industry as we look to utilize long-duration storage critical fact -- factor in anyone's ability to get to net zero by 2050. And I'd also say that's well supported by the fact that the industrial gas customers in our service territory are all exploring green, blue and pink hydrogen as well. And so, I think, speciﬁcally we'll have to see exactly where everything ends up, if it gets done. But we see it as really a wait for us to accelerate what we're already trying to do."
Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then was just curious on what drove the delay on the Sunﬂower Solar project. If you could say that it was maybe supply chain related or if there's anything else speciﬁc that you can point to there? Thanks.,"Yeah, it wasn't really supply chain related, it is just some on-site challenges that our partner ran into. But we expect it to be constructed early next year and then we'll proceed on with it."
"Yes, the refundability and how that improves your credit metrics hopefully.","Yes, that would certainly help. It will also potentially change some of the investment proﬁle that we have because right now we're assuming tax equity partners for all of our own transactions to facilitate the investment tax credit today. And to the extent that there are refundable PTCs that are available and it's more economic for our customers, then I think that we would be moving more towards 100% ownership instead of something that looks like 70%, 75% ownership of each facility."
Got it. Right. So it's both capital opportunity and credit metric enhancing or you're saying it's not decisively credit enhancing because of the higher capital and you haven't updated the equity component yet either.,"Yeah. I mean, it probably helped a little bit but it's I don't know if it's going to -- it's more neutral I would think for us right now."
"Got it. Okay, that's good color. Thank you. And then separately a little bit further aﬁeld here. Any progress on transmission here and SIRI? I mean, I know that's been out there for a bit. Obviously we've got some others in the sector resolving or settling their issues here. Any thoughts?","This is Rod. Good morning. On the SIRI front, short answer is no. The litigation matters that have been pending for some time as we shared before, FERC doesn't have any speciﬁed timeline. We are hopeful that between the end of this year, beginning of 2022, we'll begin to see some resolution. I think, starting ﬁrst with the ROE cap structure matter. But the short answer is no, material changes because it's all in FERC's domain at this point."
"Alright. Excellent. Well, I'll leave to EEI to follow up with you further guys. Best of luck. See you soon.","Thanks, Julien.    Operator  Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI."
"Hey, I'll cede it back to someone else. My questions have been already asked and answered. Thank you.",Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"We've got two graduates. So just, ﬁrst on the support from the federal government and could you just talk a little bit more about the path to kind of is there certain bills? Is this just going to be an executive order, just -- can you just talk a little bit more about how we'll learn about this?","Sure. So, I'll start and let Rod jump in, because Rod has actually been down this path before -- post Katrina as it relates to the CDBG funds that were required for New Orleans. As you know, governor Edwards has made an appeal to the government for funds to support recovery for a variety of reasons as a report -- as it relates to 2020 storms as well as Hurricane Ida. And in those requests of the administration, he's put in play -- he's put in about $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for utility restoration oﬀsets for our customers.  So the process has been for us to work with our congressional delegation to the LPSC, that city council and the governor is trying and convince eﬀectively the federal government to appropriate dollars to go. They would go through HUD to the state in the form of community development block grants. And then we are also positioning for HUD to provide an opportunity for a waiver so that the governor can actually allocate those dollars to investor-owned utilities in addition to what munis, co-ops and housing and other things that obviously are very, very important. So we're working through that process right now. A lot of us have spent time with our delegations. We've spent time at the White House, we're spending time with agency secretaries. So all of that is in place to try and work toward oﬀsetting the costs associated with not only Hurricane Ida, but this would also go back to 2020 storms, which was also part of the governor's request. I don't know Rod, if you have anything to add --?    Yeah, and I guess the only thing that remains uncertain is the timing, just like I made reference to FERC and some of the SERI things before. There's no speciﬁc timetable for the administration Congress or HUD to act on the governor's request, it's now in their hands. I think the most signiﬁcant development from our vantage point is that we have clear alignment amongst the delegation and express support from the White House and our governor for the utility customers.  That's a big deal. As we think back to our experiences during Katrina, it took a while to get that alignment that the objective of oﬀsetting on dollar-for-dollar basis. The regulatory compact impact of storms on customer bills, there's no lack of alignment around the desire to achieve that. So that part we've been able to close the gap on quicker than in prior storm or disaster events. Now, comes the ultimate decision     making process of allocating those funds to the state so that the governor could -- timeline is uncertain, Steve."
"Okay. And then the same alignment as you talked about focusing on better resiliency, I mean, I think you've talked about how your newer poles have held up well to these two storms. And but this is just a huge amount of pole replacement that could be needed to broadly do that. So just as your -- as we're thinking about this, is this something that would likely end up being done through kind of a rate base type mechanism or something diﬀerent than that?","If we were to accelerate the capital program, the short answer is, yes. That if we are -- obviously we're mindful of aﬀordability in this conversation. But if we were accelerating a resiliency build-out, you would expect that we would seek some type of alignment from the regulators with some type of recovery rider that might operate outside -- might have to operate outside of an existing FRP or some adjustment to the FRP to attack this speciﬁc asset kind of renewal and resiliency plan. So, it play out on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, as you know. But yes, I think the answer to your question is, yes, it would play as a rate base play. But on the accelerated basis outside of the normal rate making."
"Okay, and that's helpful. And then just on the as you mentioned you lowered the equity ﬁnancing need by more than half when you did the update a month or two ago. Just any better sense on timing and are you still looking at options other than just straight equity issuance to facilitate that?","Yes. This is Drew. So we haven't updated anything except what we've said before that's through 2024 and we've also said that we could accomplish all of this through the ATM program. It's -- that doesn't mean that we aren't looking at blocks or preferreds, those are still out there. But we would look to do those opportunistically depending on market conditions and we've been executing successfully with the ATM over the last several months. We'll continue to do that unless like I said an opportunistic point comes along and we can execute with the block. But otherwise, we'll just continue to complete with our ATM and we should get it done fairly quickly would be my guess."
"Just a couple -- from your comment, Leo, at the beginning, there's no sort of outstanding issue with the New Orleans City Council, it was good to hear. I recall at one point they were -- they sort of prevented you from implementing the formula rate, does the decision eﬀectively last week just really move you beyond that? Is that what you were saying?","Yes, this is Rod. Yes, the decision to implement the FRP basically obviates the conversation around any pushback on the normal operation of the formula rate plan as we had settled with the council. So that is net positive in the continuing discussions with the council."
"Great. Thank you, Rob. Just more broadly, there started to be I feel some noise around the cost beneﬁt of Entergy's membership of MISO in some of your jurisdictions. And I'm just curious whether you have any perspective as to whether we might see any changes and then what kind of -- what venue sort of forum?","So, Jonathan obviously, our participation in MISO to-date has been very valuable to our customers. We've saved about $1.75 billion normally over the period of times since 2014 when we joined, end of 2013. So certainly there's been a beneﬁt to MISO, where we see our regulators taking issue and we're actually -- we're supportive of them, it's just making sure that we get the allocation of cost of major transmission projects done correctly and making sure that as we would like to see that the people get the beneﬁt to major transmission upgrades are the ones who actually bear the cost of major transmission upgrades as opposed to people who don't get any beneﬁt bearing that cost. So we are aligned with our regulators in that concept, in that theory. We're certainly not in a position where we're looking to exit MISO at any point in time. We entered MISO because of the beneﬁts, we've obviously seen those beneﬁts. But as the world evolves, and as capital plans evolve, and the transition to renewables evolve, and diﬀerently North versus South, we just need to make sure that we continue to evolve the process cost allocation in a thoughtful way, that's all."
