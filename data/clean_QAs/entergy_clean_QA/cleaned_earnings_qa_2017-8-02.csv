Question,Answer
"Morning. So, quickly on nuclear O&M, saw the nuclear O&M was higher the Utility side as well. Just wanted to understand, is that related with the improvement in nuclear operations? And also wanted to understand, for Entergy Arkansas, what's the process in terms of recovery of that, or getting that as a part of the regular proceeding on the regulatory side?","This is Drew, Praful. And I'll take the ﬁrst part, and turn it over to Rod for the second part. So, yes, it is related to the ongoing improvement eﬀorts that we are making within the nuclear organization, and they are the same dollars that we highlighted last fall at EEI, when we talked about the expectations for spending within the nuclear business going forward. So they are the same thing.    Hey. Good morning, Praf, it's Rod. And on the process of an NSP recovery and the Arkansas FRP, the ex parte rules are in eﬀect, that FRP process is undergoing, with an expectation that a December decision is part of the procedural schedule, discovery is underway. And both the NSP and other costs associated with Arkansas that drive our point of view on revenue requirements are well-supported by the record.  And so we expect to get resolution, on your question, with NSP by year-end, alongside the rest of Arkansas' operating costs."
"Got you. Thanks. And then, secondly, on the tax part, there was a meaningful, I guess, beneﬁt, tax deductions on decommissioning liabilities, Drew, that you talked about. Could you just give a little bit more color of what that is and how – again, I guess, what's the way that you get that beneﬁt?","Well, Praful, essentially, it's an acceleration of the decommissioning liability to become a deduction today. And the way it happens, it's very similar to the same       transaction that we had last year, only a little larger, because the decommissioning liabilities are larger this year.  There's a lot that goes on in that transaction in addition to the deduction. There are oﬀsetting gains, there are basis step-ups, there are reserves, but it doesn't all net back to zero, and that's where the earnings comes in.  So we have certainly worked with the IRS. We've worked through external counsel to make sure that we have the interpretation of the Code correct. And we're comfortable where we are. And I think those are sort of the main drivers. Just that decommissioning liability recognition is the main driver of the deduction today."
"Good morning. Just a follow-up on the last question on the Arkansas FRP. You said kind of by year-end, you would expect a ﬁnal decision there. Have you had any conversations with intervenors or other parties to get an indication as to whether the nuclear cost issue would be settled or agreed upon in this exact schedule, or if that would get deferred again? And kind of what are you thinking there?","I think one of the reasons I think I stated ex parte rules are in eﬀect is that we're not allowed to engage at least on the commission staﬀ side of the equation. And so it's early. And I would expect, looking at the procedural schedule, that we get some indication sometime in the October timeframe as we begin to get our responses to the positions we've taken from some of the stakeholders.  But everything right now is happening on paper, with RFIs consistent with the procedural schedule, RFIs being request for information amongst the parties."
"Okay. And then transitioning to EWC, you mentioned, Drew, I think that the multi- year cash ﬂow outlook was slightly positive now versus roughly neutral before, excluding any kind of decommissioning activity or funding needs. What has really       driven that change and kind of has anything changed on the O&M expense front there speciﬁcally?","A little bit, but that hasn't been the primary driver. Yeah, and we've also been able to reduce our capital expectations and reduce some of our fuel cost expectations. Those have been probably much bigger drivers than the O&M side. But those have been oﬀset a little bit by the fall in market prices. So we didn't make as much progress as we hoped, but it was still enough to say that we are a bit ahead of neutral at this point."
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about a couple of the regulated subsidiaries. First of all, in Arkansas, if I understand correctly, you're asking for almost – you're showing that your revenue requirement request is almost $130 million, but due to the caps you can't actually get that much in the way of new revenue increases?","Yes. Yes.    Yes. That's correct, Michael. Yeah. You have it exactly correct."
"So we should assume that, at least for 2018, there's probably a little bit of under- earning in Arkansas just due to the ballpark $16 million spread between the two, unless you are somehow able to manage O&M down or you get above average demand growth?","Michael, it's Rod. I think, directionally, you're right. We expect to get substantially close to the allowed ROEs by 2019 and beyond, as we work through both the 4% cap and the true-up mechanisms that will take us through that 2017 and 2018 timeframe. But keep in mind that we aﬃrmed our outlooks. And in doing so, we contemplated the allowed ROEs and the earnings for Arkansas during that period. So it's consistent."
"Got it. And then, in both Louisiana and Mississippi on the electric side, in the formula rate plan process, you're not asking for revenue increases. Do either of those subsidiaries see the impact of some of the higher nuclear costs? And if so, why wouldn't those costs kind of ﬂow through and, therefore, you deem recovery of those expenses?","In Louisiana, we are ﬁling to renew the FRP process that expires with the 2016 test year. And we're not seeking speciﬁc recovery of the nuclear costs outside of the normal ratemaking process. And so, it is with Mississippi, where Mississippi – despite the fact that we have Grand Gulf sitting in the State of Mississippi, Grand Gulf is a FERC-regulated facility that's not a part of Mississippi's rate base recovery mechanism. So, Mississippi recovers their Grand Gulf associated costs through recovery rider."
"Got it. And I guess, last thing, you mentioned the Grand Gulf and kind of the FERC oversight of Grand Gulf. Just curious, what's embedded in guidance for the ongoing rate case or rate complaint that's underway there?",This is Drew. We have contemplated something diﬀerent than our expectations or I guess the current ROE. But we haven't published what that is because we have that ongoing proceeding. But it is baked into our outlook.
Are you actually currently baking in your earnings numbers? We've seen this in some of the transmission cases where companies went ahead and started booking for earnings purposes a lower ROE. Are you actually still booking the original ROE for SERI or are you booking something lower than that due to the complaint?,"We're booking something lower, Michael. We're not booking the full amount at this point."
"So let me just ask on the decommissioning activities in the sale process. It's been going on for some time. Can you just maybe elaborate on sort of the interest level there and what the process looks like? Are you still looking at Pilgrim, Palisades and potentially Indian Point? Or is this just as simple as saying NorthStar hasn't made an announcement and that you expect it to make something where you're at. Just a little bit of color on that process would be good.","Sure, Shar. We're continuing to work down the path on that front. So, that is still a key objective for us. But as we talked about on the call last quarter, it's a pretty involved process. And as we've gone along in Vermont, Vermont has been very engaged on the discovery process. It's been more than probably we were all anticipating in terms of the volume of information, but we continue to believe that we are making good progress on that.  But because of the engagement level and the processes likely going to be a little bit slower than what we anticipated, we don't think it'll change our expectations on a close day because we weren't planning to close until the end of 2018 anyway. But it's slowing down the regulatory process. And in turn, that's slowing down our     expectations for where we might go with Pilgrim and Palisades, and ultimately Indian Point.  So we are thinking about that and we're working down those paths, but these are ﬁrst-of-a-kind transactions and they're probably taking us a little longer than anticipated, but they're still an objective for us."
"Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the same topic. It's good to see that you're modestly cash ﬂow-positive here, despite the dollar moving on the power curves. But do you expect that if there is a sale process with the remaining three assets from the decommissioning activities that it would have a material impact to the cash ﬂow trajectory of that business?","We are assuming some cash in our current outlooks to be used for that purpose. And so I don't know that it should have a material change in our outlook. But that process remains to be seen. What we have out there is based on our expectations for the decommissioning costs, not necessarily a third-party. So there could be a little bit diﬀerence.  And we are aiming through these processes to try and bring our expectation down a little bit. So we do have something built into our outlooks already, particularly it's going to be reﬂected mostly in that parent debt to total debt number. But I don't know that we have an expectation at this point to be too materially diﬀerent than that."
"Just had a quick question on scheduling with the Arkansas FRP. I believe the procedural schedule had a ﬁnal decision sometime in January and, I guess, you guys are assuming that you're going to get something in December. Just wanted to understand the discrepancy and when you think that could ultimately play out and if it actually matters if it's in January versus December?",This is Rod. We had the procedural schedule with a hearing and the decision in December that where the rate adjustment would take place in January.
"Oh, okay. So the ﬁnal decision would come in December and then the actual range change...",The actual rate impact or adjustment would be made at the beginning of the year.
"Okay. Great. And then could you kind of remind me on a rough percentage level the nuclear sustainability plan? In each jurisdiction, how involved it is, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, et cetera?","This is Drew. I think the easiest way to think about it, and I don't know we have any updated disclosures around it, but it's almost by site. You have two units in Arkansas. You have two units in Louisiana. And then you have Grand Gulf, which is in SERI and then sort of allocated amongst a few of utilities. So I think that's probably the easiest way to think about it, Neel."
"Now are there some sites that are going to require more capital spending and O&M than others or, for our purposes, should we kind of just weight it equally?","I think it's weighted more or less equally. There aren't any – and we have sort of like digital controls and condenser-type projects in most of them. And so there's not a project or a plan in particular that has a very large capital expectation.       And then the O&M, it's pretty much the same increase. It's pretty much the same across each unit."
"I'm just curious, I mean, one of your fellow utilities that I think overlaps with you in several states, just announced a major rate base wind project. I'm curious whether you think that's something that might be an opportunity for Entergy, or something along those lines?","Jonathan, obviously, like everyone else, we're watching what's happening with the price points in renewables, storage, new technologies. We've deployed renewables from a solar standpoint, which is more applicable in our service territory, if it's going to be sourced in our service territory, without a lot of transmission infrastructure to come in. And as I mentioned, as part of our New Orleans ﬁling, we have also made a commitment for 100 megawatts renewables there.  We see them playing a bigger role in our strategy going forward. The majority of what we add in the future will be natural gas and then transitioning into renewables, and then other technologies as they become cost-competitive. Big wind farms like that, for us, we haven't found any that make a lot of sense. Wouldn't rule it out but right now, our focus is probably on smaller, more targeted projects within the footprint of our service territory itself."
Just a quick question on the quarter. I think there were a lot of nuclear outage days in the quarter. Should we view that as primarily being doing the work on the nuclear sustainability plan or operational issues?,"Yeah. I'll let Chris give some color, but I will say, it's probably a little bit of both. The biggest outage I think we had at EWC was related to the (46:22) but then there was a lot of work that went on with the nuclear strategic plan in the Utility.    Yes. Steve, I'd characterize it the same way. This is Chris. The seven outages were planned normal refueling outages and in those outages, we do take some extra time to improve the safety and the reliability of the plant. So it's a combination of the two."
"Okay. And then, Drew, at the end of your comments, you mentioned that, and please re-characterize this. I think you said you kind of better ﬁrmed up with these plan approvals to 2019 and beyond outlook for Utility, Parent & Other, but then noted some pressures, I thought on 2018, from sales and pension.     Could you just give a little more color there, and what should we expect at EEI this year? You're going to give some of the drivers like you normally do?","Sure. We'll probably come out with the same type of drivers that we typically do, Steve. The 2019 and beyond comment was, I think, analogous to what Leo was talking about with continued execution on the major capital projects that are going to lead us into the future, in terms of rate base growth. And so our earnings growth should follow that rate base growth over time.  But any given period, what I wanted to say was, we always have risks around, both positive and negative, for sales growth and pension. The pension risk I highlighted at 4.5%, we might be 25 basis points below that right now, so $0.05 to $0.10 of risk for 2018 sitting there, and then, kind of using the rule of the thumb, probably the same kind of risk or opportunity on sales right now.  So, I just want to make sure that everybody is aware that those risks on a near-term basis are always out there. But, over a couple of cycles and the regulatory process, those should smooth out, and the main driver is, over the long-term, going to be the capital growth in our rate base."
"Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. And pardon me if I missed this, but I know that you continue to say, as you did in the ﬁrst quarter, that you're doing better on O&M relative to the baseline expectation and guidance. Can you refresh our memories, speciﬁcally, what areas you're doing better than budget?","This Drew, Greg. So the main areas where we have been doing better are in Utility- related. I'm talking about year-to-date. There a little bit diﬀerence on second half of the year, because some of it's project-driven.    But the main things year-to-date have been expectations around, primarily our power generation business, it was primarily our fossil generation. We have been able     to operate at lower costs year-to-date there and capture some of that. And we've also seen some lower insurance costs. We were anticipating lower insurance costs this year, but some of the premiums have come in even better than what we were anticipating. So, that's been helping out. And those are things that we would continue to expect to see through the balance of the year.  Some of the other pieces are timing-related costs that we thought we were going to spend, like, the second quarter, but they are now in the third quarter, that kind of thing. And those we are anticipating in the second half of the year, as part of what I laid out. But the main things have been in our power generation business, not including nuclear, and in some of our traditional sort of overhead costs."
"So, going forward, lumpy. But you're still seeing that same growth trajectory in the Mississippi Delta, correct?","That's correct. For the next couple of years, next few years."
