Question,Answer
Congratulations on a solid quarter. I was curious actually to get a sense -- can you hear me now? First on the sense of forward New England prices here. I know you realize a lot of the quarter (inaudible) has gone through forward here with       representing the upside resulting from the cash shortages. Do you see that as being fairly characterized?,"We certainly saw an uplift in those markets from both the real-time and the forward perspective so, yes I think you're right, Julien, that has been driving that and so that's had an impact on an improved pricing for that area."
"Great. Secondly, here, just thinking more structurally, as you think about the Indian Point asset, how much upside -- how do you think about quantifying lower Hudson Valley next year? When are you thinking that implementation realistically takes eﬀect? How do you think about the downside here of the contingency planning? How do you put that all together here?","Let's take those two separately. So, as you think about the LHV zone, we are cautiously optimistic that, that is going to be put in place in the summer of 2014. Obviously there are some steps to follow through on and that's not ﬁnalized but we remain optimistic that will happen. We see that as obviously providing an uplift in those capacity prices for that zone. It is really hard to say, but we are probably looking somewhere in the range of $2 to $4 a KW month as it relates to that. So, we are bullish on that issue. As it relates to the reliability contingency plan, obviously, we are engaged in that overall eﬀort. Our point of view quite honestly is that Indian Point remains the most cost eﬀective resource to meet the reliability needs for the state and especially for New York City. We've seen a lot of projects that are being proposed. Obviously, we are looking at each of those. A couple of things you have to keep in mind, all of those projects are going to be more expensive than the alternative of continued operation of Indian Point. And the majority of those projects are in the early phases. So they have to be permitted, they have to be licensed, they have to be ﬁnanced, and they have to be constructed. So, we will continue to work down that road, but our point of view is, the best option out there is Indian Point."
"And tying those two together, is there an opportunity for a conversation with the state about Indian Point's future at any point? I know you've kind of alluded to that in the past. Is that on the table in any sense here?","Well that is always on the table. So, we are always willing to engage in discussions that are mutually beneﬁcial, but obviously, we can't comment on any speciﬁc discussions at this point in time."
"Great. And then perhaps same vein of making looking at the southeast portfolio, from Louisiana there's been some discussion about a so-called trust structure. I'd be       curious, what does that mean to you as you think about any potential middle points or consensus if you will? Is that at all on the table here in any sense?","Julien, this is Theo Bunting. What it means to us, if you read the context in which this was discussed, it was really about jurisdictional concerns which obviously we knew going into this there would be jurisdictional concerns. We take this question much as we have all other questions around jurisdictional concerns and issues that have been raised in that context. That result at best from a procedural perspective was that it extended the discovery period but did not extend the overall end date in terms of a decision from the Louisiana commission. As we go forward through that process, we will obviously address any additional questions that may be raised as a result of this and respond accordingly. But, again, it's not something that quite frankly we view as an issue that is dealt with any diﬀerently than all issues within the context of this proceeding. We will address it, we will answer the questions, we believe the transactional structure is the right structure, we believe it's the right party, we believe it's the right time. So, we continue to appreciate the beneﬁts and value associated with a transaction structure. And obviously that is something we will have to continue to work through and convey the beneﬁts associated with that structure to all parties and ensure that they understand that."
"Just stepping back a little bit on the guidance transaction, but when you guys announced the deal and there was an awful long time between announcement and ﬁling because you wanted to take the time to work with this diﬀerent parties involved in each one of the states and understand -- explain the merits of the deal and understand their concerns to try and ﬁnd a good compromise before the following process started. We now look at intervener testimony coming in and there is probably the expected opposition still showing up and points being made. Is there a bridge too far to cross from where their positions are relative to what you guys try to educate them on before hand? Or is this a posturing negotiation exercise and if so what do you guys think of the key hinge points to resolve for these parties?","Dan, I wouldn't characterize what we did in the process. When we were reaching out to everybody after we announced as trying to ﬁnd compromise. The way we would characterize that was to get a good handle on their concerns and I think we did. As I pointed out in my script, the kinds of things that we see in the testimony that has come in so far, are the kinds of things that we would've anticipated and actually they are the kinds of things we talked about with you and others over the course of that     time. So, there really -- it really wasn't trying to ﬁnd a compromise, it was trying to make sure that we were listening to them and that we understood what they were going to be concerned about. And as it turns out, we've got I think a pretty good handle on that. We don't think it is a bridge too far, obviously. And the bottom line here is at the end of the day, we believe that this transaction will provide lower-costs of delivered energy to our customers and you can read that to mean lower rates for customers over time. That is going to come about based on everything that I mentioned in the script as it relates to limiting congestion, improving reliability and access to more generation that would've happened in the alternative. We realize it is diﬃcult to paint the picture here versus what we painted in MISO, because MISO is based on the system that exists today. If you think about all of the types of issues we had to deal with when we were trying to prove up the case with MISO as it relates to the transmission system that exists and the limitations around that, the single path through which SPP was trying to argue we couldn't get to MISO. All of those things were because the transmission system that exists today is what you are dealing with. And while it has with it inherited problems that people can point to the transmission system that exists today and how that works, it's easy to look at. You can model it. It is there. The intent of the ITC transaction is to put in place a structure that will create a diﬀerent transmission system. The beneﬁts that arise to the customers of Entergy and across the region are because a diﬀerent transmission system will exist at the end of the day. So, it is a little bit more challenging to convince people, because you can't run a model on today's transmission system with today's generation and come up with the $1.4 billion of beneﬁts. But, it is not impossible to see that future, because that is exactly what Congress and FERC intended when they put in place the structure that brought about a company like ITC coming into existence. So, it's very easy to see where those beneﬁts come from. It is very easy to see that a new, diﬀerent, constructive transmission system across regions planned a little bit diﬀerently by people who are not market participants will create the kinds of beneﬁts that we talk about. The diﬃculty is that we cannot point to the system that exists and run the models. That is the whole point is to get a new system. So, it's not a bridge too far, it's just an education process that we have to go through. It is a regulatory process we are going to have to go through. I think what we've seen throughout the process is everyone is open to hearing what we have to say, the technical conferences, the stakeholder outreach, all of that has gone very well. We had great questions from everybody. We've got testimony, now. And now, as I said in my script, begins the real process of ﬁguring out how we bring it across the goal line. But, we do not think it is a bridge too far."
"And just going in to Congress, if a deal didn't get done, or didn't get approved, how much of the beneﬁts you would see from ITC, the reliability, the congestion, those sorts of things, would be gained or lost relative to ITC operating the entire system?","Well, if we don't -- if ITC does not operate the system, if they don't own the system, then all of the value that comes from true independents, that interaction with market participants that is diﬀerent than what we would do, that planning across seams which is diﬀerent than we would do, that planning done by a -- we would describe a super regional transmission organization, it is just not going to happen. The     transmission system of the future that Congress and the FERC envisioned when they put all this in place is not going to come about. And so, that's -- those are customer beneﬁts that would not be realized. But because the system is going to be planned in large -- it will be planned diﬀerently than we do it today under MISO. But MISO doesn't own the transmission system, so they don't do the actual bottoms up planning and they are not in the same position to have the desire to create that cross customer boundaries, cross regional boundaries, cross RTO seams that ITC will."
"No, I hope not. But, just wondered if you could give a quick update on the New York water quality process in terms of things we should be looking out for from a process timeline point of view or anything else that is going on New York water quality?","Sure, Bill?    Sure, we've got obviously two paths in that, so we've got the actual certiﬁcation docket that is before the NYSDEC at this point in time. And we expect a decision on that probably sometime in 2015. But also remember that we have the waiver argument in front of the NRC that we probably wouldn't get a ruling on that until all the renewal litigation comes to a close, so that would -- it's probably even beyond 2015."
"Okay. Understood, and just to follow-up on the accident in Arkansas Nuclear One. Is there an NRC process there that we should be thinking about or just as you go       through the assessment process -- I know it's early days -- but should we be thinking about an NRC process that plays into that review that you're doing?","Stephen, I'm going to let Jeﬀ Forbes, our Chief Nuclear Oﬃcer, answer that question. I do not know that Jeﬀ has had the opportunity to talk to you before but --    There has, there has been engagement on the part of the NRC throughout the entire time frame since the event happen. They've had inspectors that have been on the ground reviewing the operator response and the actions that we've taken to address the event. And I really don't see any risk moving forward with that."
"Okay, is there an NRC review process that you need to go through in terms of coming forward with a proposed remediation or some sort of review before you're given the oﬃcial approval to take whatever steps you want to take?","Yes, I wouldn't characterize it as we need their approval to restart, but absolutely, there are steps to -- we will review the data that we have compiled and our approach and strategy to ensure that there is no lasting eﬀects on this and we have reviewed that with them. We have conducted some of those reviews already."
"You mentioned earlier the importance of investment grade rating and I'm just looking at the slides and it looks like your EBITDA is declining at the nuclear business. Yet the capital requirements in that business are increasing. I was just wondering, do you see any required actions at this point to oﬀset that decline in cash ﬂow to maintain the investment grade rating?","Well, as Leo mentioned, we've undertaken a number of diﬀerent eﬀorts to try and ﬁnd ways to operate those plants more productively and eﬃciently going forward. And so that's been our key focus while we maintain safety and security of those plants. So, we are examining every process up there that we can right now to see if there are opportunities to change those trends you're talking about.     And, Scott, just from a historical standpoint, obviously, we always have planned liquidity, capital structure and all that, not on a single point estimate, but with the idea that things could turn out better than we thought or worse than we thought, et cetera. So, things like the way our dividend policy has been set out at the utility as opposed to out of total earnings and how we manage liquidity. As I mentioned, $3.8 billion of liquidity at the end of the First Quarter. So, I think the bottom line is, it's better when the prices are higher and the margins are bigger but we plan to be able to withstand when they are not. That doesn't mean we don't do anything about it when they are not, but that's, that's kind of a historical perspective."
"I wanted to touch base with you on the system agreement. It's rather complicated and we've gotten expiration here coming up with Arkansas and a little bit later with Mississippi and there some discussion in Texas. And I noticed the slides on SERI and what have you. And I was just wondering, how should we think about the expiration of the system agreement in terms of its potential ﬁnancial impact on theory or just in general, how should we think about it?","Theo, do you want to take that?    First, I would start by saying that I don't believe SERI is a party to the system agreement. So, from a theory perspective, the elements of a system agreement would not expect to have any impact. Obviously there is -- SERI owns Grand Gulf and there is a life of unit purchase power arrangement out of Grand Gulf back to various operating companies. But SERI in and of itself is not a party to the system agreement. The exit of Arkansas, as you said, is contemplated at the end of 2013. Mississippi, I believe, at the end of 2015, and obviously, as we've worked through the MISO process in Texas, there is a condition around system agreement notiﬁcation as part of that process in Texas. At this point in time, the agreement is a contractual relationship among the companies and there is typically an eight-year notiﬁcation period to exit. And, the agreement in and of itself has parameters and provisions. It provides basically tariﬀ schedules and that sort of thing. But, the companies will exit as the dates have been deﬁned thus far. We will continue to work through what is an eﬃcient exit timeline as it relates to Texas as part of our commitment under the MISO change of control in Texas. And we expect to move forward with that as we've said we would. And the change of control conditions in Texas."
"What I'm trying to ﬁnd out here is, just in terms of -- as the system agreement is unwound, is there any potential that, from a wholesale perspective, that we will see an impact on earnings one way or the other as this -- as these states begin to exit? Or is it set up that it is the last state that will be the impact? How should we think about it? Is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of this rather complicated -- it's just very diﬃcult to follow -- how if this expires, as it expires, should we think about any potential ﬁnancial impact is what I'm saying?","Paul, I can't sit here and tell you that there is speciﬁc ﬁnancial impacts that you see. Obviously the agreement is a FERC regulated document. The various operating companies have provisions in place today that allow the cost associated that result from that agreement to be eﬀectuated through the regulatory process. Obviously, as those costs go away they go away as you would see any other cost. So it is an agreement that, again, moves -- it governs these intercompany transactions and it is not an agreement per se that as companies exit, that we would expect to see a detrimental impact on Entergy Corporation."
"Okay, so we shouldn't expect to see a negative -- that's ﬁne I just wanted to clarify that there is no -- we shouldn't see any signiﬁcant EPS or earnings impact associated with this --","This is Leo. You shouldn't. It is really just a cost allocation. I appreciate your understatement of rather complicated, but it is a -- it really is more of the way system costs are shared, not and so it's not really anything where you should see an impact."
"Thank you, very much. First question would be, you talked earlier about not necessarily seeking compromise in the initial phases of getting the reaction of the intervener parties. Should we anticipate, given the number of jurisdictions, that this is more likely to go to a litigated order or how would you describe the possibility of settlement in the ITC proceedings?","Paul, if -- it's just like any regulatory process. We all -- we're starting to see what everybody else is putting forward. If there is room for settlement, that is always more expeditious and sometimes more eﬃcient. So, if there is potential for that, it is certainly something that we will pursue and then, so, at this point I wouldn't say that you can make a call that it's more likely to go to litigation -- to a fully litigated proceeding or not. We are just starting to see what everybody's position is, but selling it might be the more eﬃcient way to go about it. And certainly, that is something that saves time, eﬀort, money on everybody's part, if you can get that done and you don't have to go through the whole process all the way to the end. And I think quite often all parties have a desire to see that occur."
"And my second question has to do with NRC talked about embrittlement, the initial ﬁnding using the old calculation. And then they raised the option of using a diﬀerent calculation, which is a voluntary calculation that the Company can do for Palisades. Have you been able to go through the math of the revised calculation to see -- to get an indication of where Palisades would stand under the alternative test?","Jeﬀ?    Yes. Thank you. First of all, I would say just to put this in the proper light here, this is not a new issue that is unique to Palisades. It is a generic issue for the industry where all pressurized water reactors are monitoring the reactor vessel. The public information, I think, has generated confusion on the risk here of the premature shutdown of Palisades in 2017. I would just say that is simply not the case. There is a very structured process, as you referred to, the alternate methodology, and we are following that. We will be doing inspections on the reactor vessel in the fall of this year and then folding that into our calculation. And we -- our preliminary look at this would indicate that there is a very low, extremely low, probability of there being any meaningful technical issues with that process."
"Okay. And the last question I have is, there seems to be a lot of regulatory proceedings in Louisiana. If I take also the ITC proceeding, is just the size of the case load going to represent diﬃculty in getting answers, timely answers in all of the proceedings that are in front of the Louisiana commission?","Theo?     Paul, that's a hump of coming regulatory proceedings -- we are a regulated industry, that is what we do. Regulated company. We have procedural schedules around the ITC transaction. We are working with the staﬀ. As a matter fact, we had, I believe, a scheduling conference yesterday around the Louisiana rate case and I think we have a schedule to move forward relative to that case. There are also speciﬁc time lines around the EGSL, ELL rate cases in terms of getting a decision out of those cases. So, we don't believe that the workload itself probably is challenging to all parties involved. But thus far, we've seen a willingness of parties to work through various cases and work through what we do as eﬃcient timelines as it relates to getting decisions within a meaningful timeframe."
"This is Neil Mehta stepping in for Michael. After acquiring the Rhode Island gas plant a year or so ago, how do you think about the size and scale on the merchant business and whether, from an asset perspective, this is a business you would rather seek to grow or reduce in the coming years?","Well, I will start but I will let Bill ﬁnish oﬀ. The intent is to improve the results of the business, that can come from growing it, that can come from a whole host of structural things like we've talked about quite a bit in the past. And as far as the Rhode Island plant, in addition to the ﬂeet, I think I'll let Bill talk about this, wouldn't necessarily add to the size of the ﬂeet as much is it adds to the size of the New England ﬂeet. Bill?    That's right, we are able to use that asset, not only to hedge ourselves with the nuclear ﬂeet that we've got, but it's also provided some good opportunities especially with what we saw in the First Quarter of this year to be able to capitalize on that market up there. So, I think Leo is right. We've got to focus on getting the portfolio to a position where it looks like it's sustainable from a long-term perspective. And then we decide what the next steps strategically are, whether to add to that portfolio or to potentially somebody else to add would consider that portfolio. Those are the options that we constantly look at. Each and every day we     are looking at how do we make it more eﬃcient, how do we make it more proﬁtable and what are the options on the table to achieve that."
