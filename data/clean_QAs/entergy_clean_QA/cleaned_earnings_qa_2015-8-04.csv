Question,Answer
"Thanks. I have two questions. At what point, and when we're looking at the 2017 midpoint outlook, do you re-assess the ramp rate on the industrial projects that were already up and running and the expected in-service date of those that are still in queue? And give us a full update. It would seem that you really wouldn't have visibility with any degree of certainty until some point in early to mid 2016, is that fair?","Theo?      Hey, Greg. This is Theo Bunting. As part of our planning process, we try to get as much information around it as we possibly can. And I think in terms of when you would expect us to see some updates relative to that, we'd probably be pointing toward EEI in that timeframe. And as you said and as Drew has mentioned in his opening comments, that information does change from time to time and our expectation is we'll try to stay abreast with that as best as we can and continue to update it as new information becomes available so that we can relate into our overall expectations.    Greg, this is Leo. I'll just add while – and we've said this since the beginning as it relates to the addition of these customers, they're big projects, $1 billion investments; some cases, $10 billion dollar investments. Schedule is always an issue in that kind of thing. Our sector has the same issue when we build big projects that are ﬁrst of a kind or unique or whatever.  The issue here is while it's common and some may come early, some may come late, they may ramp diﬀerently the investment proﬁle that we've got between now and then, it remains intact. And as you recall, the way the business model works, rate base growth is kind of what we're targeting here. And so, if you look out there, whether they come in a little bit late or a little bit early doesn't really change when these power plants come. The only changes we've made – I think Drew outlined them in a little more detail , so did I in the script – is a couple of the capital projects that we had are actually coming up earlier than we had originally planned, just given the timing and the need. And it's a combination of this growth from the sector, but also the need to replace the aging infrastructure that we have and the opportunity to get these things done and constructed.  So it's not just the sales piece of it that we need to look at it from a timing standpoint. It's coming; some of it's coming later because of the size of the projects and other factors, but the investment proﬁle that we've got over the next several years and through the ﬁrst part of the decade is pretty much on track.    Okay. Understood. So to get your guidance aspiration for 2017 then, if we ﬂex expectations for top line revenues from industrial, you'd have to either readdress your expectations for revenue requirement from other customer classes or ﬂex your costs then?        Yeah, I think that's true in a short-term basis. As we have said, these productive investments, we would expect to ultimately get into rates. And if the sales aren't where we would expect them to be in any given period, you're right, we would have to adjust in another area.    Okay. Second question is on EWC. Obviously, the power curves have come oﬀ quite a bit in New York and New England. Can we attribute that to winter premiums coming oﬀ or is it summer discounts getting steeper, some combination of both? And do you think there's any market activity that you can see in the foreseeable future that might reverse that trend?    Greg, this is Bill. A couple of things. I mean, obviously, we've seen gas prices come oﬀ tremendously, probably $1 since last summer. We've also seen some folks take some steps to try to mitigate gas supply issues, that type of thing, in terms of using LNG facilities for base loading of plants, that type of thing. So I think there's a number of issues in the market that have driven those prices down.  As we look forward, we are slightly bullish gas prices. As we look into 2016, that increases a little bit over time. But we are seeing some movement in New England in terms of some market structure improvements that would come on in the 2017, 2018 timeframe and some energy price formation issues that could be constructive. I don't anticipate at this point seeing the numbers we saw in 2014. I mean that was largely driven by the polar vortex and kind of the aftermath of that, but we do see some constructive positive steps from an energy price point perspective.    Yeah. And the reason I asked is because you moved your hedging – the construct of your hedges around a bit for next year and hedged up just a fair amount more, but there were no demonstrable changes in your hedge proﬁle beyond 2016.  Yeah.    Is that a fact? Is that a function of your point of view?      Yes, that is a function of our point of view. And to be frank, what we're seeing out in the market as well. There's little bit less liquidity out in the market, and obviously we don't want to put ourselves in a situation where we're locking in at these low prices at this point in time. So we're evaluating that as we go, and we think there's some upside.     Thank you.    Thanks, Greg.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open."
"Just, I guess, I wanted to sort of follow up on that letter that you mentioned from Murkowski and some other Republican leaders regarding market reforms. And I noticed it as well. And I guess what I'm wondering is, I mean, how quickly do you think anything from that will actually come about? And I mean – I don't know. I mean, they also sort of threatened legislation if they couldn't get it done (36:05). I don't know. I mean I just was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more what you think the practical beneﬁt of that would actually maybe be?","Sure. As it relates to that letter, I think it's on track with our general thoughts in terms of what needs to happen in the market. We've had similar discussions with the ISOs and a number of other stakeholders. We think that, in general, depending on what gets implemented, there is upside potential of, say, $3 to $6 a megawatt-hour as a result of these changes to energy price formation.  Now the question on timing, this will come probably in increments. And as you look at the timing of being implemented, you're probably looking at a timeframe of 2017, 2018 before they could actually make those changes to their systems and get those in place where we would see that uplift.  Now the exception there is what we've got going in ISO New England as it relates to the Winter Reliability Program. That's currently being reviewed by FERC as we speak,     and we could see some uplift there in the upcoming winter if we get a decision in our favor as it relates to that. So it will kind of evolve over time, but we see that happening across the next ﬁve years or so, three to ﬁve years."
"And it will be series of steps is what we're talking about, I guess, as opposed to one sort of...","That's what I would think, Paul, is it's -- I think just having discussions with the ISO, there is some practical issues you have to deal with in terms of how you can change the systems associated with that, and so they're more than likely would be steps taken along the way as opposed to one just big massive change."
"Okay. Great. And then just on Friday, there was a order out of FERC that denied the authorization that some of your subsidiaries were seeking for to issue and sell securities and what have you. And I can't recall seeing that before with FERC. I think of it as kind of run of the mill; maybe I'm wrong. So I was a little surprised to see that they rejected it.  I know that you guys can – it's without prejudice, you can re-ﬁle. Just wondering, is there any signiﬁcance to this? Or is this just sort of a hiccup that happened because of the format which they seemed to be unhappy with or how you guys reported it? Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?","I think you hit on most of it in terms of the format. They have a way of using backward-looking results to assess what the coverage ratio ought to be, and we had suggested some changes to that and they didn't want to put them in. So, I think it is a bit of a technical challenge, but we should be able to put the new ﬁling in and get that complete fairly quickly."
"Bill, perhaps ﬁrst question just as it relates to Texas and the station and the decision to pull that out, just being curious, could you jive that with the RFP and what the ultimate thought process is around pursuing self-build options or acquisitions under rate base, I suppose? What drove the decision? Provide a little context there and ultimately next up.","Theo?      Hi, Julien. This is Theo. As Leo indicated, I mean really in Texas, it came down to – it was clear that a clear path in Texas that the parties really preferred a long-term capacity solution located in the State of Texas. And as he said earlier, our Western RFP is seeking just that.  Our objective in Texas is to obtain support of the staﬀ and other customer groups for approaches that meet the generation resource needs in Texas. And I mean, clearly, as the record indicated, as it relates to the Union transaction, that was not the case. And as Leo mentioned in the script also in his opening comments, there's been an interest expressed in the New Orleans and we'll pursue regulatory approvals in New Orleans with the City Council relative to that.  The second part of your question, I'm not sure I understood when you said kind of what's next."
"Right. I suppose fundamentally, there's not necessarily any opposition to doing rate base or self build (41:06) option per se, right? This was more about a locational angle on the plan rather than your ownership of the unit per se, correct?","We don't believe there's any opposition to self-build. Matter of fact, if you go and explore the record, there were mentions by the other parties around another option being a self-build option in Texas. So we don't clearly believe there's any opposition       to it. It was just a preference from the interveners and other parties in Texas. And clearly, I think that our views and comments relative to other options made it clear that a self-build is something that could be pursued in the future."
"Got it. And then separately on transmission, I know you've provided some background here, but I'd be curious. I suppose MISO did an out-of-cycle study on MISO South(41:56) during the quarter. Could you elaborate on that and as it relates to the studies that you discussed yourself at the various utilities and ultimately how that jives with your capital budgeting process and if that's already reﬂected in your CapEx expectation?","Sure. I mean, we had one out-of-cycle project, I believe, which was the Lake Charles project. But in terms of just transmission and MISO, in general, I mean as you know, we have a fairly robust transmission investment in 2015 through 2017 capital cycle. We really nearly doubled in 2015 versus 2014. And as Leo went through his opening comments, he mentioned a number of transmission projects that are currently in the process of being approved and will be on the way shortly, approximately almost $800 million of transmission projects. So, we feel good about the fact that we've got transmission opportunities.  In terms of the MISO study, the BOR (42:59) study in that MISO accelerated six projects into MTEP15. And largely, most of those projects were already in our plan, but what we do see potentially is an opportunity for acceleration of some of those projects. And the fact that MISO was moving forward in that process give us higher conﬁdence that these projects will be approved by MISO."
"Leo, just on the industrial outlook and kind of maybe the longer-term prospects, can you share a little bit about how much time you're spending on economic development and kind of courting industrial customers, you're pretty busy last year. How was that changing, if at all, right now?","I'll let Theo jump in, but we continue to work that process across all of our jurisdictions. Seeing a lot of success, obviously, with things that are under construction in the near term in the Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and others. But as we've mentioned earlier, as we went through our reorganization last year, one of the things that we had done was beef up the business and economic development functions and we continue to have those folks out working the process, things like the region designation here in Louisiana, other things we're working to make sure that we help continue to promote the region.  So I guess how much time we spend? Quite a bit. Some people it's their – we have a department that's their full-time job working with the states and obviously the states aren't backing oﬀ of this either. All of them are working very, very diligently to try and help bring economic development.  So that includes we continue to utilize our site selection database. We continue to try and pre-certify sites. We continue to build transmission into areas that could house more manufacturing, but for the fact that they're not necessarily ready yet. So all of those things, both in our activities from economic development, operationally, and also from the regulatory process, we're continuing to push forward on all of that.  Now, Theo, I don't know if you want to add anything.    I guess, Dan, one thing I'll add in addition is we continue to work very closely with states in which we serve. And as Leo mentioned, we and the regulatory environment itself, I mean, if you'll look at some of the transmission projects you mentioned that we've done, some of those transmission projects are speciﬁc around working to foster economic development in the regions. And so we have a lot of people dedicated full-time to helping the regions that we serve grow. That's part of our growth story."
"Okay. So, I guess, if I think about the economic growth from here, maybe I'll say it diﬀerently. If you look at the industrial demand – or industrial recruitment today, are the whiteboards more full or less full than they were six or nine months ago? I mean, is the population of opportunity changing as you talk to customers?","I would say we are continuing to pursue more opportunities and try to keep that pipeline growing. I mean, that's our objective quite frankly is to do as much as we can to continue to see a growth in the pipeline. In terms of kind of where we are now versus six months ago, I'd have to go back and look at the data speciﬁcally, but it is something we focus on. And we understand that having a strong pipeline is really a key to having success in the economic development area."
"And I guess, Bill, separate from market reforms, when you guys think about your model and your point of view, do you see gaps against the $4 where you think New England, New York prices should be today and maybe help quantify what you think the delta is with the sell-oﬀ in power prices?","Yeah. I think what we're seeing obviously from a supply perspective is continued growth in the supply in Marcellus. Obviously, that is creating a discount to Henry Hub. And as we look forward in terms of our pricing, we don't see those numbers going above $4 anytime in the near future. I mean, we see that staying fairly consistent with now, but again I said we're bullish.  So we see it rising, but not getting above that level. So, that's kind of where we sit and obviously, the power prices are commensurate with that, I mean, as you look at     that from an energy price perspective.    And that's true. I'll just add that once you get out a little further on the curve, and Bill mentioned this earlier, there's a bit of a liquidity discount that's out there. And we've seen this in the past as you roll the prop (49:12), some of that comes out of the market and improve things a little bit. But some of that had gone away last year, but it seems to have reasserted itself again."
"So I guess but for some backwardation because of liquidity, you think the curves are pretty realistic to where the fundamental value is?","No. I said we're still slightly bullish. For 2016, we're a little bullish and that kind of increases as we go out over time, but it's relative to where we were a year ago. It's obviously a lower price level."
"Leo, could you just help us kind of parse your statement about the dividend still being potentially up for discussion in the full? When we look at your Utility, Parent & Other, the low end of guidance for 2016 would put the payout ratio above the 65%       to 75% target a little bit. So are you going to be thinking about other things beyond payout?","What we're looking at is a long-term perspective, Jonathan, in the growth in the business. So I think that the way I've characterized it in the past is that we're looking out several years, we're looking at sustained dividend path. We're not going to jump around with it to follow when earnings go up a bunch, when you raise it a lot. When they don't go up raise it a little, we're trying to get ourselves more of a glide path view about the long-term prospects of the company.  And as we've said, we look at the investment proﬁle that we have for the aging infrastructure, for the reliability requirements, for environmental needs, as well as the growth we're seeing in the business and that helps facilitate all of that. And we see an upward sloping long-term trajectory that would indicate to us that the time is right to look at when to start to follow that earnings path, and that could be as early as this fall."
"Good morning. Just two quick questions. I wanted to follow-up on Dan's question. Your view on gas, I mean is it closer to the $3 number or the $4 number? And second, in your comments, Leo, you had stressed or stated that EWC makes up roughly 15% of the consolidated company's earnings. Where is the sweet spot there with EWC?","Do you want to talk about gas?    Yeah. I think on the gas price, I mean you guys know where it is right now. We're closer to the $3 level than the $4 level at the front end of the curve.      As far as the sweet spot, I mean I wouldn't say there's a sweet spot or not. It's just a fact of the matter is right now, the investment proﬁle that we have in the Utility is very, very robust. The opportunity for returns are very good there, the need for the     investment because of, as we've mentioned before, 75% of our non-nuclear facilities in the Utility are over 30 years old.  I mentioned MSU plant, for example, in my prepared remarks. That's a plant that's been online since 1960s. And there are more eﬃcient ways currently, once we beef up the transmission system and meet the MISO requirements, to be able to serve that load and deactivate that unit. We've deactivated 25 units since 2010 and we continue to go on a path to have more and bigger units in that realm as we add to the system.  The risk/reward trade-oﬀ is just better at the Utility than it is at EWC for our deployment of capital. So, it's less than 15%, and I'm being generous with that because I take out the tax beneﬁts that were showing up in the 2015 numbers before you get close to 15% in 2015. And if you just project out forward what's happening with the Utility business and the growth proﬁle we have there, 15% becomes smaller. The 15% becomes smaller and smaller as we go through time given that trade-oﬀ.  So there's no sweet spot; it's just a fact. And as it relates to the business itself, it's a diﬀerent business, should have a diﬀerent investor mix, should have a diﬀerent dividend proﬁle, should have a diﬀerent commercial reality. And so our objectives right now are to grow the Utility business, and we have no plans to grow the EWC business, the merchant business given that risk-reward trade-oﬀ and the diﬀerent investor base. But the fact is over time, between now and 2020 in particular, we're going to become more and more and more a utility. That's just a fact."
"Hey guys. Just – I wanted to make sure I understood something on the Utility capital spending levels and the Utility demand trends. It strikes me that your tone today was that the demand trends, a little bit softer or maybe a little bit more delayed than expected, but then when you talked about the capital spending trends and the generation, it seems, as if several new projects have moved forward a year or so. Just curious, it seems like if demand were pushed out a little bit, maybe projects would get pushed out, not accelerated, but can you just kind of walk me through the diﬀerence there?","Well, I'll start and let others jump in, Michael. But the – remember, for almost a decade, we've had a, I think we called it the portfolio transformation strategy, where we've been working to replace the generation ﬂeet. Over the course of the last several years, maybe not quite a decade, but maybe close, we've seen an ever- changing landscape of reliability requirements out of the NERC, and certainly a continuation of environmental policies, et cetera, whether it's MATS or now CPP or what have you.  All of those things have created a real need for us to continue to modernize our generation ﬂeet, to add new transmission facilities, and to make investments in environmental compliance, and we're going to continue to do that. We're at a point now where we – as we change out that generation ﬂeet, it's turning more and more, absent the Union projects, turning more and more to the construction to replace that aging ﬂeet.  So that, that part of the process is reasonably agnostic to what the demand growth is. You're changing out a megawatt for a megawatt because you're getting a more eﬃcient new power plant in place versus one that where the O&M's creeping up, et cetera, because of its age, and that just happens over time. So, that's really not changed one way or the other. The growth, whether it's a little bit delayed or not, is still pretty crisp, and we're making plans to build generation to replace the aging infrastructure as well as meet that new demand. If a plant slips a year, that doesn't really change the capital program. And in fact, even as long ago as the Analyst Day, when we were asked, ""so what could beef up your capital program?"" we said, ""well, not very much because it's a long – you got a plan this stuﬀ in advance."" So even back then, we had mentioned that the capital program around the edges wouldn't change a lot as long as the demand growth stayed in a reasonably close proximity to what we were seeing. And so delays one way or the other were what we mentioned back then might have some impact, that projects might move around, but that they were still going to show up.  So, all it is is sharpening the pencil on the need for the facilities and when we can get it done based on age of the ﬂeet, the interaction with the transmission system and when this stuﬀ is showing up. And right now, there hasn't been big enough shifts in anything to change the construction program versus where we were. Yeah, a couple of projects we're going to market test for an earlier project. We are bringing the new – the new generation here at St. Charles project online a little earlier. We brought Ninemile 6 online early, and I think we've learned from that in terms of the timing it takes. So we were embedding in some of these projects how long it would take to go from planning to development to construction, and we've proven we can do it faster and at lower cost. And that's what happened at Ninemile, and that's what we'd anticipate what happen at St. Charles project and likely happened in some of the other stuﬀ as well. So, we are – the construction program meets many needs. Sales growth is one of them and an important one. We have to be ready, willing and able to serve these customers when they show up, and if they show up six months later than they had planned, we still want to be there with a reliable system when they show up. And that's really all we're doing."
"Got it. And then one question on the EWC. What do you see as the impact, and do you think it's already embedded in market expectations for some of the new pipeline projects, maybe Constitution, which is coming online in New York. There's also some smaller pipelines that actually came on in New York pretty recently, as well as some of the more longer dated projects, the Eversource and Spectra project or the Kinder Morgan one to get new gas up into New England.","I think, the Eversource-Spectra project is one that is kind of included in the current market expectations. Obviously in New York, I think, those are progressing well and are also kind of already included in the market. I think, the issue is going to be, how did some of those get paid for speciﬁcally in New England, and how -- what is the cost recovery mechanism going to be and how is that going to work? Is it going to go through the legislative process? And then, yeah, but I think a lot of that is built in to expectations kind of going forward."
"I believe your 2017 Utility outlook expected 3.25% or a 3.75% retail sales growth on average. Just want to make sure, is that still – does your outlook still expect to reﬂect that CAGR?","Well, I mean, we have continued to look at them, and as Theo mentioned, we'll have a fuller update later this fall probably the EI, but our expectations given a number of changing variables are that we're still in the middle of that range."
"Great. And do you just – do you have – I don't know if you have given this before, but have you – what would every 100-basis point change in that CAGR do to your 2017 target, all else equal?","I don't know that we published a rule of thumb on the growth rate of industrial change. Certainly, yeah, a 1% change in our existing base is about $0.11.    Or total (01:02:19).      Yeah. So it's like $0.02 for industrial $0.04 for commercial, $0.05 or so, $0.06 for the residential piece. So I think – and that's a 1% change across all segments. So on the existing piece, but I don't know that we've published a rule of thumb around sensitivities for the industrial change in the growth piece 1%. It will be a little diﬀerent than the existing piece because the existing piece has the demand charges built into it already. And so you would only be seeing the variability around the energy piece that we – that we actually sell the customers. So – and that's about 50% of the margin for the industrial piece. So, I don't know – it seems like that might be about $0.04, but I don't have those numbers in front of me."
"Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And I would like to turn the call over to Paula Waters for any closing remarks.","Thank you.
