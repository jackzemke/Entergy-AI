Question,Answer
I am just wondering as we look at the magnitude of the rate actions that you think you're going to be able to recover over the next several years associated with the increase in nuclear spending. How we think about the prudence of those – that spend and the recovery? Can you explain to us what your benchmarking looks like in terms of your current spending on those plants? And with the increase in spend then     where that puts you relative to other nuclear operations across the country and how you are going to show that those recoveries are necessary and prudent for customers as opposed to being a function of some level of mismanagement historically that should be borne by the shareholder?,"Greg, that's a good question, because, as you know, customer bills, customer rates is an extremely important factor in our business and something that we spend a lot of time trying to maintain. As you know, we already have some of the lowest rates in the country, 20% to 25%, and below the national average. And as far as the expenditures go, if they weren't prudent expenditures to make we wouldn't make them. Between our mitigation actions, as well as other items that are rolling oﬀ like securitizations that I mentioned in this $50 million, $55 million in 2018, we have roughly $1 billion of securitization bonds rolling out of the Louisiana jurisdictions and that in utilizing our normal regulatory processes.  We do believe that all the prudently incurred expenditures will be recovered. And you also keep in mind here that when we look at the jurisdictions that are most impacted by the nuclear spend, namely obviously Arkansas and Louisiana where the plants reside, you put everything together, not just the spend that we've got, this addition here, but everything. And, over the period that we're talking about we wouldn't expect the customer rates to increase by much more than 1%, including everything so far less than the rate of inﬂation annually.  And so, the impact here we're trying to manage as much as we can. All of the expenditures will be prudently incurred. We're putting all of our operations in line with what the industry is. As you know, every plant in the country is diﬀerent. But that's certainly something that we've kept in mind when we've outlined this plan in terms of amount, in terms of timing, in terms of what we need to do to balance the equation, not only for the operational side of things, but for our customers. And, again, we would envision we come out of the back side of this. By the time we get to 2019, we'd be still having some of the most competitive rates in the country."
"Okay. Thanks. One follow-up. As I look at the numbers in the just rough math at this point for EWC net of the reduction in EBITDA as a function of the increased operating costs, but also the increased CapEx, am I right that it looks like you're actually cash ﬂow negative over the next several years at EWC or are there some – is there some mitigation happening here that will allow you to maintain sort of at least the neutral value proposition there as you unwind that business?","Hey, Greg. This is Drew. And we haven't ever discussed kind of speciﬁcally, but you can do the math, like we can. And so, as Leo mentioned in his remarks, we continue to remain vigilant and disciplined on our approach to reducing the footprint in that business. And so I think that you could count on us to continue to maintain that posture."
"But to the extent that the business is cash ﬂow negative, how would you fund that?","To the extent that it is in any given period, it's going to be mostly from the parent. And, as you look at this overall forecast, including the changes at EWC, the incremental investment at Utility, we have a parent debt level that could go up about 150 basis points from where we were originally targeting it. So we would – which is slightly above our target range. Our target range is 18% to 20%. And we were talking about a forecast that got us around the neighborhood of 21% that we were working on. Obviously, this adds, as I said, maybe another 150 basis points to that. And so that's not going in the right direction and that's if we ﬁnance everything with parent debt. And so we're thinking about other options around how do we manage it starting with the business itself and can we continue to ﬁnd ways to be more eﬃcient."
"Just again on the mitigating rate actions that Greg was asking about, can you give us a little bit of a sense of where the trajectory there is coming from, which jurisdictions,       which kinds, which is formula, which will be actual rate cases, just so we can get a sense of what we should be tracking to see that oﬀset come in?","Well, I'll start and then Theo can follow up, Greg, or Jonathon, sorry about that. We're not planning on using any special regulatory mechanisms at this point in time. Everything would just ﬂow through the normal mechanisms. So, for example, Arkansas would ﬂow through the FRP, Louisiana'd ﬂow through the FRP in the near- term, but we do have some reset capability by the time we get out to 2019. Those are the major implications in terms of where the plants reside.  And, again, from a – you asked about the trajectory and if you look at the plan as we've laid it out now and not just that spend, but everything together in those jurisdictions, we're talking about a trajectory of about – that we wouldn't expect to be more than 1% a year from a rate standpoint. And remember, it's not only our mitigating actions that Drew outlined that are on the slides on your deck, things like the securitizations, rolling oﬀ the load growth that we have, the continuation of the investments that we're making.  As I outlined all those investments related to the new power plant, et cetera, we envisioned that those are going to provide production cost beneﬁts, as they're more eﬃcient, et cetera. So, all that kind of works together to keep that trajectory still in line with one of the best in the industry. I don't know if, Theo, if you want to add to that.    Yeah. Jonathon, this is Theo. Just a couple of other points. The other plant, clearly what we're making investment is Grand Gulf which is owned by SERI, life unit PPA, about two fully (35:20) operating companies. That plant is subject to FERC formula rates cost of service base rates. Also, in Louisiana, just additional clariﬁcation, we've got a opportunity for FRP reset in the 2018 timeframe. And we would expect that reset to occur such that rate changes would happen within the 2018 calendar year. So you'd see a full impact of that in 2019.  Also, in Arkansas, the forward-looking test, the FRP with the forward-looking feature also has a true-up mechanism associated with it. So if in fact our forecasted test year is diﬀerent than actuals, we have the opportunity to come back and implement rate changes to true that up to the actual cost within the context of that particular test year."
"Great. Thank you. And then might I just ask on the mitigation sort of expense line where you have it at $0.25 already in 2017 and then sort of holding more or less at that level through the period, how much of that have you sort of already identiﬁed and/or implemented?","Hi. This is Drew. And pretty much all of it we've already identiﬁed and implemented. So a lot of that – $0.10 of the $0.25 this year or in 2017 would be associated with interest expense. And so, that all the ﬁnancings that we've done this year would contribute to that. And then, after that, the other $0.15 are various elements from the long laundry list of things that I read oﬀ that have already been put into place."
"Great. Thank you. And then could I just follow up. You made some comments about dividend growth and talked about giving us more of an update at EEI. Last year, I think, you had a dividend increase right at the end of October. You're coming up to the – can you give us some thoughts about how does this sort of dampening of the trajectory in the short term kind of feed into your thinking around dividends? And obviously it seems to be the timing of the year where you last raised it?","That's another good question, Jonathan. Obviously, the dividend is a board of directors' decision that they'll make in due course. You're right on timing. Traditionally the fall is when we make that determination. As far as what this has done to our trajectory, again, the earnings trajectory here through 2019 is pretty similar to where we were before. It's the same number by 2019. We still see growth in 2017 and 2018.  So while obviously it's a consideration through our mitigating actions, the rate levels that we have, the regulatory constructs that we have and the work of a lot of really talented people here at Entergy, we still see the growth outlook that we've been on for that Utility, Parent & Other earnings that supports the dividend growth. So our objective to continue to grow the dividend is still out there. It's still something that we take very seriously. Steady predictable growth in earnings and the dividend that's our objective."
I wanted to focus on slide 10 and the revised retail sales growth. Could you just layout what's your revised growth rate is and what the sensitivity is? You have a appendix slide that shows the sensitivity near-term so 1% change. I just wanted to conﬁrm sort of sensitivity to changes in low growth assumptions in the out-years.,"Yeah. This is Drew. So you're referencing the slide in the back. Is there anything in particular, Stephen, that you wanted to discuss on that sensitivity slide? I think that's slide 42."
"Sure. Yeah. I guess, so on slide 10, what's the revised retail sales growth percentage for residential and commercial and what was the 1% movement in that assumption to? I think the appendix would imply a $0.11 for commercial and residential commodity. I just wanted to conﬁrm that.","Yeah. I think that's still fairly correct, Stephen. So we saw two quarters or three quarters of this year were down about 0.06% versus a 1% or so, just below 1% expectation for this year. And so we have a diﬀerent starting point going into next year than what we're anticipating. That's the ﬁrst thing. And then the second thing is the growth rate going forward. And we've brought that down, as I mentioned in my remarks. But I think it would be probably closer to about 0.5% rather than almost 1%."
"Okay. Understood. And then just shifting gears to the sale of nuclear assets to Exelon. I know there were several conditions that were listed in the release in terms of approval by federal and state agencies. There was recently a lawsuit ﬁled in court opposing the credits provided in New York. In the event that in court the credits were overturned, what would be the impact to the sale of those assets?","Stephen, it really depends on the timing of the court actions. So our point of view is that that is unique and that it places a value on the carbon-free attribute of the units. So we feel pretty strongly that we will survive that legal challenge, but it really would depend at what point in the transaction that occurred. So, right now, we're anticipating approval by the PSC on November 17, approval of the NYSERDA contracts November 23, and then NRC approvals to follow and closing of the transaction in the second quarter of next year."
"Okay. And if the actuarial return to ﬂoor second quarter of next year, would that trigger a cancellation of the transaction?","Well, certainly, it could be a consideration there and then it really depends on who has taken responsibility for that. And so the contract has some commercial terms which deal with that speciﬁc issue. So, it really becomes more of an issue of can you close and then who has liability for the investments and the refueling, et cetera."
"Hey, guys. Couple easy ones. First, does your Utility, Parent & Other guidance incorporate any external equity or equity like security issuances over the next few years?","It is true, Michael. It does not incorporate anything like that."
"Got it. Second, on the EWC side, when you look at Palisades and Indian Point and kind of the guidance of increased cost, how do these plants look from a cost structure relative to what you would consider their benchmark peers?","This is Chris Bakken. The Indian Point cost structure is reﬂective of the marketed operation, which is the high labor cost. But the product spending, we believe, is appropriate for the remaining life of the plant. In terms of Palisades, I would say, it's consistent with the industry. And, again, we're making prudent investment in the plants given the remaining lifecycle of the plant."
"Got it. Last thing, back to the regulated side, can you put some numbers around the size and scale of the AMI program ﬁlings in Arkansas and New Orleans? And how should we think about what kind of size and scale through 2019 or 2020 or so you anticipate in some of the other jurisdictions?","Yeah, Michael. This is Theo. I don't have the speciﬁc numbers in front of me in terms of Arkansas versus New Orleans. I know when we talked about this initially we've talked about on a system basis, the investment being $900 million or so when we think about it as it relates to, again, the entire system. In terms of timing, as you can see, as you go through the ﬁlings, you will see that there was some costs we are asking to defer that will get fully incurred prior to the full optionality of the meters themselves. And we believe that's consistent with the matching of that cost with the beneﬁts that you will see that are going to be implemented as a result of the implementation of the meters themselves.  There is also, I think, as you recognize, as Drew mentioned, some asset investments that's made in advance of either deployment basically to develop the backbone to support the meter deployment. And our view is that asset investment is consistent with what we've seen from kind of a timing perspective and the necessity to get it in place in order to allow the eﬃcient use of the meters themselves once they are fully deployed and to recognize the full beneﬁts of it.  We also believe that infrastructure which you spoke for other – a lot of other systems as well. I think our perspective is the cost is consistent with what we've seen in implementations across the country and it would be supported and supported well with the beneﬁts that Leo mentioned as we think about implementation overall. I'd have to get the speciﬁcity for you in terms of years, but we don't view that investment to be a signiﬁcant investment and risk in advance of the meter deployment."
"Hi. So, ﬁrst question is more strategic which is there seems to be a lot of defense right now which is both on EWC, where the focus is just to kind of reduce the size. And even on the Utility side, things like retail sales growth isn't coming out where you guys expected. So, I'm trying to ﬁgure out from oﬀense perspective or future growth, how are you looking at what are the dimensions that you can kind of push and grow going forward coming out from the defensive kind of view right now?","Yeah. We don't view ourselves in a defensive view at all, Praful. So, we're on oﬀense here. We had a signiﬁcant amount of investment that I outlined that goes into the generation of transmission footprint of our regulated utility. That has not changed. I mean we continue to make those modernizing investments. That lower production cost provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts to our customers, improve the reliability, reduce our environmental footprint, which is continuing to grow service territory, particularly as it relates to what we see on the industrial side, all while we maintain some of the lowest rates in the country.  In addition to that, what we just – in response to the question from Michael around AMI, AMI is the ﬁrst step. We've just now started to make regulatory ﬁlings. But, ﬁrst, we'll get the back-oﬃce and the backbone of the systems and make it smart. We don't want to deploy the meters until they will actually have something to do for us. So, we're putting all of that in place in advance of actually beginning to deploy the meters in 2019. There are other technologies that we will deploy on the system then that we're looking at today in terms of asset management technologies and other things that will go from that point and forward. That will provide even greater beneﬁts, savings, helping us to manage the load for our customers and provide that immediate investment that will provide us earnings opportunity, but at the same point in time it will help customers manage their bills through the ability to manage how much they use, when they use it, et cetera.  So, that, for us, is again total oﬀense and extremely exciting for us as we look to the future. When we look at EWC, our objective has not changed. It's always been to separate that business from the Utility. And we continue to execute on that. We sold wind assets or are in the process of selling those. We sold the (49:31) plant last year. We made decisions unfortunate as they are, to shut down – Pilgrim shutdown Vermont Yankee. And we're going to continue on that path albeit with a diﬀerent price deck that we see continues to erode. But we're still working as diligently as we can. And I think the proof of that is in our discipline around ﬁrst making the decision at FitzPatrick to seize operations there, but at the same time never giving up and     never wavering from the idea that we might come up with something better that resulted in the creation of the working with Exelon in the state to come up with the sale of that plant, the continuation of its economic beneﬁt and its reliability beneﬁt in the state of New York and certainly to our employees in the community.  That, for us, isn't defense at all. It's all oﬀence. Like everyone else, we're in the merchant market and gas prices have been low, particularly in the Northeast. And we've got to manage around that. But it doesn't change what we're doing or how hard we're working or what we think we can accomplish there. And we've accomplished a lot. And we would anticipate over the course of the next couple years we'll continue to accomplish a lot. So, all that said, we're pretty excited about what we have the opportunity to accomplish here. And, again, just going through all that we just talked about with the sustainability of the nuclear ﬂeet, the investment in AMI, the investment in the generation business, the investment in transmission, going through the normal regulatory constructs that we have today and still maintaining our 2019 outlook, sounds like oﬀense to me. But strategically that's where we're headed, the same place we were headed before. And we just updated some of the information for you. That's all."
"Got you. Fair enough, Leo. Thank you. And on slide 16, just a more detailed question. With the increased CapEx around EWC, you also made the point about your remaining useful life of – consider remaining useful life of assets. Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about remaining useful life for both Indian Point and Palisades. Is there any change in view? Obviously I understand the relicensing. But, apart from that, is there any change in view around that, given the CapEx spend?","There is not a change in view around that, Praful, other than what we always do is we continue to evaluate those facilities. But, right now, there is no change in point of view around those plants. Palisades, we've got the contract through 2022 and then we've got the ability to see where we think the MISO market goes. At that point in time – and Indian Point continues to be a very, very valuable asset. I think the ISO just came out with their study showing that it was required for reliability in the region. So it continues to be needed in that region. So there is really no change in outlook for those assets at this point. That said, we continue to be disciplined in how we look at these on a regular basis. And we'll look at them – we're always reﬁning our point of view about them. That's all."
"I wanted to go back to an earlier question about the court challenge to the Zero- Emissions Credits proposal. If that challenge is successful and the court overturns, I think you made reference to it's possible under certain conditions that it might impact the sale. Did you mean that to say that those conditions are spelled out and there is one party who might be at fault at that? Can you just give a little bit more clarity on what exactly you meant?","It's diﬃcult to predict what the impacts of it could be without understanding kind of what the speciﬁc ruling is. But we have put terms in the commercial agreement that try to separate those risks. I really can't tell you what the eventual outcome of that would be. I mean, typically, we don't discuss litigation, especially future litigation, but we have tried to address and mitigate those risks in our sale agreement with Exelon."
Got you. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. That's all I got.,All right. Thanks.    Operator  And our last question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Your line is now open.
"Just I have a simple question – hey, Leo. Could you just be clear kind of what is not working right in the nuclear program right now that you are spending so much money?","The ﬁrst and foremost the plants are safe, Steve, or we wouldn't run them. I'd say that the challenges that we face stem from a desire to run a lean operation and that lean operation to beneﬁt our customers and getting the right balance between operational excellence and the cost structure. What we've found – obviously we've had a couple of situations with plants going into Column 4. What we've found is that we potentially can get the balances right as we want. And so to get ourselves up to the standards that we hold ourselves to and to the standards of the industry, we've got to change our strategy around how we operate the plants.  As you know, we made organizational changes last year, six months ago, that we brought Chris in and Chris has been responsible for developing what that strategy is. We've changed not only who it is, but where he reports, where – he used to report into the COO and now reports in directly to me. And so Chris and his team, along with his discussions with people in the industry and with our regulators, et cetera, has devised this change in strategy to get ourselves up to where we need to be to meet our own standards and the operational excellence standards of the industry."
And will there be some ﬁling at the NRC that kind of goes through the kind of the full plan or is it going to be like plant-by-plant?,"No, no. There's no ﬁling. We're just – the only ﬁlings would be when we include these in our retail regulatory – these costs just like the cost of the new CCGTs and CTs and AMIs. These plans are vital to the reliability of the system. They provide over 30% of the energy used on our system. They are large baseload, zero-emitting resource that's very valuable. They're anchors to the community in terms of the tax base and jobs and community support.  So, these are very vital assets. They limit fuel volatility when you look at what could and has happened in the natural gas markets and the reliance on natural gas of us and others. So, they're very, very vital. They ﬁt right in with the strategy that we've got everywhere else, whether it's investing in CCGTs at reduced production cost and     improve air emissions or whether it's looking at something in the gas and ground kind of investment that would limit fuel volatility.  So, these assets ﬁt right into our strategy, right into the need for our communities or customers. And we just, again, have to kind of change the strategy from that lean operations into one more focused a little bit more on the operational excellence side of it. And then we'll get right back on track. And, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're not going to use any special regulatory mechanisms in those special ﬁlings with the NRC; it's just us working through this process and getting it right."
"And just one last thing. Grand Gulf, can you just talk about what the outage is related to?","This is Chris again. First and foremost, I would stress the Grand Gulf was and is safe to operate. However, reﬂecting on some of our equipment and human performance over the last several months that didn't meet our standards of excellence, we've taken a decision to take the unit out of service, systematically understand the performance shortfalls of excellence. We have training programs and some maintenance plans to correct that. It's well understood and we're in the process now of working through those issues and expect to have unit back in service early part of the next year."
