Question,Answer
"I wanted to start oﬀ on the strong results for the quarter and some of the changes in assumptions for '22 guidance. You're now in the top half, obviously, and you have a big EPS oﬀset for the remainder of the year in the O&M ﬂex category, but whether it keeps looking strong. And how does that potentially set a base for growth in '23? And maybe just curious on the recurring elements in this slice and how that carries into '23 assumptions and contingency.","Sure. This is Drew, and I'll start, and Leo can add in. So I think we're planning to -- as you say, we would expect to be in the top half of the range as we're thinking about the impact of that and the things that we are doing, certainly, it's encouraging to see a lot of the growth from our customer base. Not all of that, I would say, is growth that we would expect on a continuing basis. As I referenced in my remarks, some of that is cogeneration. And we would expect a more normalized cogeneration rate on an ongoing basis.  In terms of the line items, you speciﬁcally referenced the O&M, obviously, we do have much more sales. We do have some higher costs that come along with that. That's a chunk of what you're seeing there. We also talked about customer initiatives last week. We had the press release talking and Leo referenced some of the things that we're doing to help our customers out. That is in the works and is part of what you see reﬂected in the '22 outlook and guidance there.  And also in the O&M, we have a couple of other operational items. Visitation management is a big piece of it as well as some investments to help for reliability, the O&M components of those incremental investments as well as some investments to improve our customer experience, working in the contact centers and things like that to help our customers out, particularly at this point in time.     So there's a number of investments that, while I would say, aren't speciﬁcally pulling out 2023, although there is a little bit of that, they are working to continue to derisk 2023 and beyond by creating more continuous improvement opportunities today that should be lasting on an ongoing basis.  And so -- I don't know, Leo or Rod, if you don't have anything you want to add to that?    I think that's fair. We're encouraged by the beginning of the year. We're using that -- those results to make sure that we're doing the right things for our customers here and now and certainly, see a lot of reasons why that industrial load growth should continue not only this year but for years to come to support our outlook."
"Excellent. That's helpful. And on the litigated process for SERI at FERC. The Mississippi settlement obviously took care of a large portion of the dispute. I think they're one of the major parties, but other parties are less willing to accept those terms in their comments. How should we think about the process and kind of options going forward here? Where the settlement currently -- has currently structured ﬁt within that longer-term 6% to 8% guidance, are the impacts kind of above or below the midpoint as they're currently set?","Rod, why don't you give them the process and then Drew, you can help out on that.      Yes. So from a process standpoint, the conversations and negotiations with the other jurisdictions are ongoing. And they took their -- they made their public stance in response to the Mississippi ﬁling, but we're not in a position to opine or disclose anything further as it relates to where those negotiations stand, but you should know that we're in active conversations with each of those jurisdictions, notwithstanding their public position on the Mississippi settlement.  I will note that the FERC trial staﬀ and we thought this was constructive, stated that the settlement was fair and reasonable and in the public interest. And it is our position that that's a constructive framework for our ongoing conversations with each of those individual jurisdictions.    And then regarding the ﬁnancials, we have -- in our outlook, we've reﬂected the collective of the Mississippi settlements on an ongoing basis. And once we do have some -- since we're ongoing discussions with everyone, we wouldn't comment on ROEs or capital structures or anything else beyond that at this time."
"And just to make sure I understand correctly, it sounded like under the draft IRA, you believe the regulated nuclear assets will be eligible for the production tax credits. And just if you could talk about how that could work in the regulated construct. That would be helpful.","Sure, Paul, this is Drew. We do think that they are eligible based on our reading of the act. As you know, our nuclear units do compete in the MISO markets. They bid their power in every day. And so we have a busbar price -- wholesale market price, and that's the revenue that comes to the company every day because it ultimately gets netted oﬀ in rates and stuﬀ like that through the normal regulatory process. But we do participate in the wholesale power markets every day. And so that's how we believe we'd be eligible."
"Okay. I understand. That makes sense. And then shifting over to coal. And if you could talk about the Texas rate case ﬁling and the new target dates for Nelson and Big Cajun, it seems like you're accelerating there. And just broadly, how could some of the more stringent EPA NOX requirements lead to changes in coal timing, renewables and related? Thank you.","It's Rod. I can frame up the Texas rate case ﬁling. Between October and through the end of the year, you'll see the procedural schedule laid out and I'll direct you to Page 34 of our materials just for some context. But it's about $131 million base rate change     in our case and our proposed ROE is 10.8% reﬂecting a 10.5% midpoint with the 30% -- I mean the 30 bps performance adder with equity ratio around 51%. And the procedural schedules laid out as is and certainly reﬂects the continuing beneﬁt of our transmission, distribution and generation riders as we move to incorporate OCAPS and other assets in our capital plan.    Yes. And this is Drew. On the coal piece, I'll say it's not really much of a factor in the Texas case right now. And of course, as you know, Paul, with high gas prices, there's not a lot of economic appetite to accelerate retirements right now.  But I would say that -- and you referenced that the new rules that are -- that could come out soon that could cause us to make some signiﬁcant investments in our coal facilities in order to become compliant with that. If those do materialize and they come in within the timeframe that we're already contemplating that, that could be an accelerator of retirement. We certainly wouldn't make signiﬁcant large capital investments in those coal plants to satisfy those things on a very short timeframe of beneﬁt. So that would be a consideration on the time line of our coal plan if and when those rules come about."
Just want to start oﬀ with Entergy New Orleans and the resilience ﬁling there. Have there been any initial reactions that you could share with us or other takeaways especially as we think about Louisiana and Texas on this front?,"Hi. It's Rod. Initial reactions to the actual ﬁling has been constructive. Obviously, the details are all in the pace of the investment. And certainly, given the current economic environment, what's the build impact. We expect the council is going to set additional technical conferences, if you will. We have one schedule later, I believe, on the 18 of this month. But the council will ultimately direct us to make a ﬁling more in line with where the thinking is that might show up later on, probably in the end of the third quarter into the fourth. But the reaction has been constructive.  But let's be clear, our eﬀorts right now are focused on addressing some of the near- term challenges that our customers are facing with inﬂation and the impact of the gas prices in New Orleans. And that's taking up at least the near-term mind share for the council. But we're -- we think it's a constructive reaction thus far and you'll see in the fall, the council's procedural schedule kind of laying out where we go from here."
"Got it. Yes. That was kind of the next part of the question here. Just conversations in Louisiana talking about higher customer bills, as you talked about in your prepared remarks there. And so do you see -- what type of role do you see this playing against conversations for CapEx at large and particularly on the resiliency front given the inﬂationary pressures that you talked about there?","We are aligned on the objectives and why we're -- why we've been focused on the resiliency conversation, we moved back the resiliency ﬁling in Louisiana to October to give us an opportunity to better reﬁne the beneﬁt case that we expect to make to with the commission. But Louisiana, the same with New Orleans and our other jurisdictions, they are very much focused on providing relief to our customers in the near term, but we are very much aligned with the commission on this resiliency conversation.  And also, I'll make this point. There's nothing about the timing of our October resiliency plans for Louisiana that changes our current plan. So both the timing and the way in which we laid out our capital plan for near-term resiliency spend in Louisiana is unchanged by then. So more to come as we work through the summer and get further into through the rate -- the formula rate plans and hurricane season, but the early indications are we still remain very much aligned with the regulators on the objective of resiliency."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And just a last one, if I could here as it relates to equity needs in '25 and '26. While the ATM can satisfy these needs here, just wondering how you think about asset recycling at this point, if this is on the table? Or could you speak to broader considerations here?","Yes. Well, we talked to -- thanks, Jeremy, it's Drew. We talked about that at Analyst Day. So I think there's not really anything diﬀerent than what we discussed at the Analyst Day. There's a valuation diﬀerence between the private capital markets and the public capital markets, which causes us to explore this idea. And -- but it's not an easy track to go down as we've discussed in the past. It's not like depending on how you go about it, it's not necessarily like ﬁnancing equity in the public capital markets. So it could take a lot longer, there could be more risk to it. So those are things that we're thinking about when we think about what we're calling strategic ﬁnancing because they have to line up more strategically at the same time."
"Can I just ask about the -- you mentioned that you've deferred $300 million of fuel, I think. Is that the extent of what you're proposing to do on that particular tool or is that just what you'd recognize through second quarter, this June balance sheet?","That's what we have proposed to the retail regulators in terms of delaying collection of deferred fuel. So on the balance sheet, you have at the end of the second quarter,       all the incremental $600 million of deferred fuel. And so -- some of it being delayed until the fall, some of it might be delayed until next year. And a bulk of it is in Louisiana. I think we're about $130 million-ish in Louisiana and smaller amounts in other jurisdictions."
"So that's sort of the current proposal across the portfolio and to the rest of the deferred fuel from -- in ﬁrst half of the year, we should see that sort of catch up a little quicker?","Well, I would say that, that is pretty recent. That's June and July deferrals. I think maybe there's a little bit of August even in there. So we are pretty current on how we're thinking about that. I'm not -- I guess, Jonathan, you're asking, are we going to see a whole bunch more of delaying, I think we're most of the way through the summer at this point, and I would not expect that to continue on into the fall."
"Okay. And then could you just sort of maybe help frame for us a little bit some of the other things you're doing to try and mitigate pressure on customers, maybe sort of put some quantiﬁcation around that in the context of the fuel deferral number? Is that the biggest thing? I'm guessing it probably is, but just curious about what are the other pieces of the strategy.","Yes. And this is Rod. Leo made reference -- the fuel deferral would be, I believe, the biggest by way of single ﬁnancial impact across customer classes. But what we're oﬀering to do is, as Leo mentioned, $10 million towards bill assistance programs across our jurisdictions. There's a moratorium on disconnects coming out of New Orleans. We're voluntarily oﬀering that up for our other jurisdictions.  There's a credit card fee waivers, late fee waivers that we're working our way through in diﬀerent jurisdictions on top of the bill payment programs that Leo walked through in his opening comments, the objective being to give customers some relief during what we see as this convergence, particularly in Louisiana and New Orleans, where the high usage is intersecting with the high gas prices and where Louisiana and New Orleans are perhaps diﬀerent than some of the other jurisdictions is the fuel recovery mechanisms or capturing that impact, that high gas impact on a monthly basis.  And so these are short-term relief eﬀorts on our part to answer the call for our customers with the support of our regulators and we expect that to sort of play itself out through the end of the cooling season. So in that October, November timeframe, we'll revisit with our regulators where we are on the relief package. And I don't want to understate the signiﬁcance of what Drew referenced in terms of our ongoing investment strategy on behalf of customers that have far greater long-term impact     that lower customer bills in addition to the robust growth story in the industrial sector that also beneﬁts that bill path for customers over the long haul, so.    The only thing I would add to that, Jonathan, is certainly for Mississippi customers, the SERI settlement is probably the biggest bang for the buck that we've had in terms of near-term bill relief."
"Leo, could you just remind us the SERI (Technical Diﬃculty) --","I was going to add, Jon, the securitization that we did, we got $100 million of beneﬁts to Louisiana customers. I mean there's a number of things that we've done that have some big dollars associated with them. We haven't really talked about our gas hedging program that's been beneﬁcial to the customers in these high gas price environment. So there's a number of things that we've done to help mitigate customer bills."
"Great. Thank you. Could I just ask about SERI, that, that settlement goes into eﬀect regardless of not having reached agreement with the parties, correct? And then what's the timing on when that beneﬁt ﬂows?","Yes, that is correct. We're seeking -- we're asking FERC essentially approve and ratify that settlement by November, but Mississippi is already taking steps to put that -- the beneﬁts to customers in place. So -- but November is the time frame from a FERC perspective."
"Okay. And then just maybe ﬁnally, you -- well, you reﬂected the Mississippi aspect of this settlement in guidance. Is that the gross impact, assuming others sort of went down a similar trajectory? Or is it sort of just the discrete Mississippi piece?","Right now, it's assuming sort of a grossed-up element, an inclusive, everybody got the same as Mississippi, but we're not commenting beyond that about where it might end up given we have ongoing discussions."
Good morning. I was curious on the Inﬂation Reduction Act. Do you have a view at this stage just how much that could improve your competitiveness on the renewables front and whether it could unlock additional opportunity to rate base renewables within the play going forward versus the proportion that you've been assuming thus far?,"Yes. I don't have numbers that I can tell you right now, David, but I will say that we do believe that it does level up the playing ﬁeld for us. We don't have to go through the normalization eﬀorts. We can ﬁnd -- assuming this all goes through, we might not have to do the tax equity partnerships that we do, it eliminate some of the friction associated with that and allow us to go ahead and deploy more capital.  So I think those are all positive from a utility perspective, from an ownership perspective. The customers, as I said in my remarks, will also beneﬁt from that because they'll get the beneﬁt of ongoing operational improvements that we come up with. Those wouldn't necessarily accrue to a third party; they would accrue to our customers. It creates optionality around the assets increases the operational ﬂexibility. If there's a problem with the assets, we can respond more quickly, don't have to work through a third-party storm situation, the like.     So there's a lot of -- there's a lot of beneﬁts associated with utility ownership that are harder whenever we were structurally disadvantaged before. But now the customers will get the full beneﬁt of those things. So we think that, that will be accruing to customers over the long term. But I don't have the exact number for you right now."
"Great. Yes. Thanks. That's helpful. And you had also mentioned on the cash ﬂow side of things. It sounded like it was neutral. Is the way to think about that, that you're already kind of planning to see a cash tax bill that's at least at the level of the AMT that's been ﬂoated out there such that there wouldn't be an incremental cash ﬂow drag as you see it?","David, this is Leo. I don't think that's the case. I think it's just the case that we'll be able to utilize the credits against the AMT plus the transferability of the credit allows for us to be able to get that to neutral.    Yes. And I will add that, that's an ongoing basis. I referenced the ﬁrst year. There is a timing element that's out there that we had to pay close attention to between the A&T starting in 2023. And the bulk of our tax credits would be from the nuclear tax credit, and those would start until '24. So that's -- there's that '23 gap that we'll have to ﬁgure out how to work through. The good news is it should be an oﬀset to deferred taxes. So that means our rate base should go up. But we got to work through that. We got to get the ﬁnal bill work through that with retail regulators, talk to rating agencies and the like."
"Just on Grand Gulf, according to the NRC data, it's been down since July 12. I just wanted to know why has it been down? When do you expect it to come back online? And then maybe just remind us in terms of the mechanisms you have in place for replacement costs and so forth. Thank you.","Yes. As far as operationally, David, I will get into the technical details, but we had a couple of pieces of equipment that had issues. So we had to take the plant oﬄine to ﬁx those issues, and that's ongoing. Plants should be online pretty quickly and ready to roll after the recent refueling outage is where we replaced a lot of equipment and on the backs of last year's record run. Kind of while we're talking about nuclear, I will just point out because it happened today, the River Bend station now had its longest continuous run online, too. So congratulations to them.  As far as the mechanism, Rod, I don't know if you want to --  Yes, it's a monthly formula rate plan where the ﬂow-through of cost of operating the plant are part of the FRP.      And the contracts back to the operating companies are unit contingent. So they would just replace the purchase power in the market as they do every day, and that would ﬂow through the fuel costs.  Of each of the individual --    As each of the individual operating companies."
"Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter, and thank you for taking my question. I don't know if this is a Leo or Rod one, but I'm just curious, process-wise, the grid hardening or the system hardening proposals in Louisiana and Texas, how does that -- how do you think that will look from a docket perspective? And how will -- what you're thinking about recommending there, how will that mature? How will that interface with the existing ratemaking structures that are already in place in those states, meaning the formula rate plans in Louisiana and the DCRF and the transmission recovery and the general rate case process in Texas?","Hey, Michael, it's Rod. We had a -- we covered it at an Analyst Day, but the point being, it depends on the timing of our agreement in say, in Louisiana, how the state of Louisiana thinks about the capital plan around resiliency is going to determine whether we think we can ﬂow through the capital cost through the existing FRP and recovery riders or if there's going to be a need for anything else.  And again, that's a function of sizing because what we talked about on Analyst Day for our capital program was that we would go from $2 million to $4 million around accelerated resiliency where a chunk of -- the larger chunk of that would be in Louisiana, and we would do it through existing mechanisms. And whether we needed anything diﬀerent would be dependent upon how the commission worked through with us around the pace and timing of capital spend.  Texas is a little -- and so that process will begin when we make the ﬁling that we currently planned in October. In Texas, the way that we sequenced the accelerated resilience ﬁling in Texas, we pushed that back into 2023 given that the timing around the rate case and OCAPS shifted a bit, and we want to sequence the resiliency ﬁling to fall in place behind both OCAPS and the rate case.  And the dynamic is not radically diﬀerent than the way we're thinking about it in Louisiana. Again, depending upon how the commission thinks through, and certainly, our customers think through the pacing of resiliency spend in Texas, then the question becomes, can we accommodate that CapEx through the existing T&D recovery riders or if there's a need for -- as we described it, a tweak, in the regulatory recovery mechanisms. And those remain -- that remains to be seen, Michael, but the thinking is the same.        And Michael, this is Leo. I'll just add that in addition to, as Rod said, kind of how do they ﬁt size-wise underneath pre-existing regulatory mechanisms. There is the nuance around assets that we want to replace that are not yet fully depreciated. And that's a tweak, to use Rod's word, that we might need to look at. And as you recall, that's the same tweak we needed in regulatory process for AMI across jurisdictions where we are taking out meters that worked, but we're replacing them with meters that we're going to lower cost and improve service levels to customers in the future.  The dynamic here is the same. We've got the $2 billion -- the $2.2 billion that we've got in the plan already that ﬁts under the current regulatory mechanisms along that sizing, as Rod mentioned, as well as fully depreciated property mechanism. But as you know, our regulators have been publicly supporting -- replacing equipment that was built 15 years ago to when the standards were diﬀerent across the industry with the new standard equipment, we need to get that placed out as to how are you going to recover the dollars for that existing equipment that's not fully depreciated. Again, precedent across every jurisdiction with the meters, same concept, but that's an added -- again, to use Rod's word, tweak, that we probably have to make sure we're getting throughout those jurisdictions."
"Can you -- thank you for that Leo and Rod. Just a quick follow-up on the Louisiana side. You have a lag right now in Louisiana, right? Louisiana, I would argue is maybe one of the harder places to earn authorized for you guys? Do you worry that if you don't get a change in rate making, meaning somehow a more forward-looking structure to the formula rate plan that's simply using the existing construct would simply add to the lag?","It's always a concern. And our primary objective is to match the CapEx for customer beneﬁts with the recovery mechanisms for the stakeholders, including you guys. So yes, that is a constant tension as we work through the forward-looking view of our capital plan and recovery mechanisms, Michael. So it is very much a part of the conversation.    And Louisiana has some good precedence around this. I mean Leo was talking about AMI and the AMI dockets in Louisiana, we were able to get more contemporaneous recovery. And of course, on the capacity side, we have a long history of getting generation assets into rates when they get to COD. So I think there is examples of how this could work diﬀerently in Louisiana, but we certainly echo Rod's concern."
"Hey, guys, good to hear your voice. Just procedurally, back to the SERI settlement, it seemed like no party. Well, at least none of the state commissions objected to the settlement at all. Is there any reason why the November approval can't happen any earlier? Or how should we think about that, the potential for the FERC approval, assuming that they approve it?","Yes. It's the FERC that drives -- we don't get to tell FERC and I say this respectfully. We don't get to tell FERC what their procedural schedule needs to be, but we're certainly -- they're usually sensitive to certainly us and other stakeholders when there's an objective to particularly in this instance where we're trying to reduce the overall noise around SERI and the risk associated with it and the potential beneﬁt for customers, that tends to resonate it.  So it's as soon as possible as far as we are concerned, but we're always weaving in our interest with those of our other stakeholders in ﬁrst docket, which as you might imagine, has more than Entergy to contemplate. So we're grateful for whatever FERC is able to do to accelerate the consideration of this customer beneﬁcial settlement in Mississippi."
