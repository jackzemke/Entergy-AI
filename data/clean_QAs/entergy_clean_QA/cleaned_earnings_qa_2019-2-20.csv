Question,Answer
"Hey. So, just a quick clariﬁcation here, obviously, well done on 2019 and onwards guidance but I wanted to understand structurally as you think about beyond even 2021, is this $0.10 sustainable in sort of the upside tied to the new eﬀective tax rate you all were talking about? I just want to understand how sustainable it is.","We believe it is sustainable, Julien. With the tax reform, there is a structural change in the way that that eﬀective tax rate is going to come out due to the protected excess ADIT. As you know, that's going to go on for many years and it will lower revenue, also lower the tax expense that you see and so it will be exactly dollar for dollar like the unprotected piece but it will eﬀectively be in there on an ongoing basis. And so we expect to see a lower eﬀective tax rate going forward."
"Got it. Excellent. If you could just quickly follow up, it seems like Utility CapEx went up a little bit from the preliminary guidance you guys all gave back at EEI, can you just elaborate a little bit on what's moving there? I mean it sounds like there might be some – well, I'll let you elaborate.","Okay. Well, thanks for noticing that, it did go up a little bit. The primary – there's two areas, it's primarily in the distribution and the transmission area. The distribution area is continuing to increase our grid mod investments speciﬁcally in the area of distribution automation as we continue to push into that. And then, on transmission, it's continuation of just needed transmission upgrades as part of the MTEP process. And so, those are investments that we recognized out of the MTEP process and so we've added into the new capital plan."
"Morning. So on the EPS outlook going forward, just wanted to understand the change is driven only by the eﬀective tax rate or also by the AFUDC going forward or is the AFUDC fall oﬀ only from 2019?","Yeah. So both of those are what we're citing as aﬀecting the eﬀective tax rate. The main change is the eﬀective tax rate. There isn't really much change in the AFUDC expectation, not in our guidance outlook. But as the AFUDC comes down from 2019 to 2020, the eﬀect that that has on the eﬀective tax rate is going to diminish. And so, it actually pops back up afterwards, but the protected excess ADIT piece starts to come oﬀ. So it's going to level out at around the $0.10 eﬀect. It's just a little bit more this ﬁrst year as we have three large combined cycle gas turbines under construction that are long dated construction assets. There's just going to be more AFUDC on the books this year."
"Got you. That's super helpful, Drew. And then, in terms of Grand Gulf, I know there was an NRC review ongoing, is there any update on the status on that?","Good morning, Praful. Yes. We have expectations of a formal exit with the NRC next week. We have two self-identiﬁed issues that are determined to be non-cited violations or the lowest safety signiﬁcance. We're very pleased with our operator response to the issue and we expect the formal inspection report in about 45 days. So, there's no signiﬁcant issues identiﬁed in inspection."
"Understood. And so, is this eﬀectively – is there any change needed, in fact, in terms of how you operate nuclear in general or do you see this within the plan of what was expected?","No, we believe we're on track with our plan and we don't see any need for change."
"Okay, understood. And then just the last thing on the credit side, Drew, the 15% target, obviously, you are much below that, obviously, driven by the ADIT in the short-term. How comfortable is the rating agency view around that metric and like how much time are they expecting you to kind to grow back into that 15% level? Are there any levers that you can pull if the metric is delayed in terms of the improvement? Just wanted to understand kind of what's the ﬂexibility you have on that metric.","Yeah. Well, the expectation is that we would get above the 15% by 2020 next year and we're still on track for that. We had ongoing conversations with the rating agencies. They're fully aware of the plan and they can see the expectation for the unprotected excess ADIT going back to customers quite rapidly. In fact, that's one of the things that they cited as positive is that we are getting that behind us so that you can see our FFO to debt measure move higher more quickly instead of drawn out. When we discussed it with them, the expectation was that if we're going to have to     deal with this on an ongoing basis, this – how we're recalculating it to show you the eﬀect of it to back to 15% in the materials today, if we had to do that on an ongoing basis, it would be much harder for them to get comfortable with our outlook. So they're very comfortable with it and they see the full depth of it and we all expect to get back by 2020."
"Couple of questions and I apologize if I'm making you repeat yourself. It's been a busy earnings morning. With the changes in the current EBITDA outlook for EWC, where do you stand in terms of your aspirations of sort of fully exiting on a cash neutral basis or cash positive – I mean, have the numbers moved around a little bit in terms of where you expect to exit on an NPV basis?","Yeah. Well, I mean, as the world turns that things are continuing to evolve, we have aﬃrmed our expectation that we would be cash positive from net cash back to parent out of EWC 2019 to 2022. And the market has moved around, the equity capital market has moved around. As you know, it dipped down in the fourth quarter, it's rallied in January. The rally in January, of course, was helpful for us and also allowed us to ﬁnish the de-risking of Pilgrim and that was very helpful in terms of getting us more comfort towards our expectation of keeping that cash outlook.     Now, we've also continued to ﬁnd ways to manage our O&M and capital costs and those eﬀorts are ongoing within EWC and some of those were realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 in the form of some signiﬁcantly lower O&M. And so, those things are helping us keep our expectation for positive cash ﬂow out of EWC net back to parent over the next few years."
"Fantastic. And then, I think you just answered my next question, which was do you expect to be very solidly inside your metrics through time here, so any signiﬁcant incremental equity issuance is probably not in the cards here that you're where you need to be.",Yes. No change from what we said at Analyst Day last summer. We will ﬁnish up our last year's equity issuance. We have that in escrow right now. We should draw that out sometime in the second quarter. And then we wouldn't need to look at anything until 2021 and beyond.
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually I have a handful of them. First of all, on the generation rider in Texas, can you talk to us just about the process behind that in terms of getting that ﬁnalized potentially and then whether it needs – whether is this enabling legislation and therefore, you need regulation to come with it that kind of outline how it will work?","Hey, Michael, good morning. It's Rod. From a process standpoint, we have proposed legislation in Texas at both the House and the Senate. And you are correct. It is enabling legislation that if passed would give the PUCT an option to enact a generation recovery rider or something to that eﬀect that would essentially match from a better timing perspective our investments with recovery. And so, they'd be at     the passage of the legislation if it was successful and then it would enable the PUCT to the regulatory process to implement a generation rider."
"Got it. And then one question on all of the generating plants that you have coming into service over the next couple of years, can you just remind us how those all get into utility rates? Meaning, do they go into rates as a special rider or when put in service do they go in only when the annual formula rate plan process is implemented like Louisiana, I think it's implemented and after the summer like in September each year and Mississippi is a diﬀerent timeline, like how should we think about the timing of when those rates step-ups occur?","One of the reasons why we were seeking to get the law changed in Texas was to allow Texas to be more like the future forward test years of Mississippi and Arkansas. And to your point, in Louisiana, our largest jurisdiction, at the moment the plant comes online and into service, it automatically goes into rates. And so, we're trying to bring Texas forward, so all of the other jurisdictions with the exception of Texas through a special recovery rider or through the formula rate plan, the moment that plant goes into service, we begin recovering through the rate regime. So, Texas is – we're trying to get Texas in line with the other three – really four with New Orleans.  And I'll just add, Michael, in Mississippi, we're not building a plant, we're buying a plant...    Yeah.    ... in Choctaw and it should act – and it should go the same way that Rod just described in rates when we're able to close."
"Got it. Last item just on Indian Point, when is the last, I don't want to use the word, when does the state have to make a ﬁnal decision about the Indian Point retirement       in 2020? Meaning, when do you reach a point of no return where if the state hasn't said, hey, do a refueling, get it ready, we need it to operate longer, let's talk contracts. When do they actually have to tell you that by?","I don't think that there is any process associated with the state, but in terms of a point of no return, I'll let Chris to answer that.      Yeah, we're at the point where Unit 2 was refueled for its last cycle and will operate until the spring of 2020. And Indian Point Unit 3 will refuel shortly and it will then run through the spring of 2021 and then that's it, I mean, we do not intend to refuel the units again."
"Got it. So if the state were to change its mind, it's got to happen within 6 to 12 months, before you'd have to do another refuel?","We would need considerable warning and that's something that we would have to discuss with the state but to be very clear from our end, we have not made arrangements to purchase additional fuel and have no intentions of doing another refuel outage beyond the one that's this spring."
"A quick question on just on the new guidance basis, am I – do we understand it correctly that – when you say that you will not include, I think, signiﬁcant tax items in there, what's the – do you have a threshold in mind that we should think of that you'll eﬀectively exclude from evaluating yourselves against this guidance?","Well, I think I can give you a framework for it. In 2018, we had about $1 of tax items over a couple of quarters. We had one in the fourth quarter related to the restructuring in Arkansas and then one in the second quarter, I think, related to IRS settlement. Those two things added up to $1, we would have excluded both of them. And we would have had an eﬀective tax rate in 2018 of about 21% excluding those items and the eﬀect of the unprotected excess ADIT."
"Yeah. Should we think about this as sort of the way you'll manage around your – having weather in the guidance, perhaps, I'm just trying to get a better sense of how you will evaluate your performance on this new metric.","Well, I mean, I think we are trying to build ﬂexibility into our business to help us do that, not use taxes. So we are actively working on ways that we can manage our business in light of the fact that we're going to have weather volatility in our numbers and I think that's the primary measure. You're not going to see a $0.75 tax item show up at the same time to kind of rescue us. That's not the plan."
"Okay. That's fair enough. Looking forward to seeing it play out. And just a second issue, Leo, you had used – I think you talked about working towards a post shutdown sale of Indian Point when you talked about the decommissioning transactions. Does that – should I take that to mean that you wouldn't anticipate a deal for Indian Point until after the shutdown or more that such a deal wouldn't close, obviously, till after shutdown? I just wasn't sure if you were trying to give us some indication of timing on reaching a similar agreement.","So the transaction would not close until post shutdown. What I was indicating is that we have begun work on the transaction that as we've mentioned before, we would expect to complete sometime between now and the end of the year."
Okay. So that is something you think is a reasonable prospect for 2019 because that was – I was also going to ask why it wasn't on the 2019 items?,"That's correct, it is something that we would – as we've mentioned before, in order to close a transaction post shutdown of the units, we would like to get into the regulatory process in such a time that we would want to have a transaction signed and announced by the end of year. Obviously, we've also mentioned we recognize from your standpoint sooner would be better than later but that's the timeline that we've got. But what I was indicating is that we've actually started that work."
"Good morning. Thank you. Can you just – for your 2019 and 2020 guidance, what your assumptions are for eﬀective tax rate?","So, for 2019, I think it's about 22%, 22.5% and for 2020 and 2021, it's a little higher. It's more like..."
And then just I kind of got lost on your comments about you will no longer weather normalize or you will continue to?,We will no longer weather normalize. We'll still report what we think the eﬀect of weather is on our results but we aren't going to adjust our results because of that.
"Got it. Got it. But we could sort of use – could you use the proxies for the existing assets that you have right now as far as we think about the return thresholds for this current transaction, given some of the other assets that are still operating, but the decommissioning funds were presold?","I'm not sure I'm following your question exactly. The de-risked elements around Pilgrim, they're going to return some sort of ﬁxed income element around 2% or so. The Indian Point, from a returns perspective, is unchanged at this point."
Okay. That's – that what's I was trying to get at. Thanks so much.,Okay. Thank you.    Operator  Our last question comes from the line Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Your line is open.
"Thank you. I have two questions. I know a lot of questions about the decommissioning trust for EWC assets. But when I think about Indian Point, in the past, you'd mentioned that given that it's a two reactor site, it could have some economies of scale related to decommissioning of these assets. So when you talk about expectations for EWC to actually return cash, do you already account for those eﬃciencies or is this based on the assumption of that minimum balances of those decommissioning trust as stated by the NRC?","Yes. Angie, this is Drew. So, when we're thinking about that return of cash back to the parent, we're thinking about basically operating cash ﬂows and working capital in the current business, in the operating business. And any associated retention payments and capital requirements, we still have one refueling left, et cetera, all of that is baked into our expectations for return of cash back to the parent. The decommissioning activities are strictly matched up against the decommissioning trust. And so we do anticipate economies of scale. We think that will be helpful. That helps us mitigate any expectation of actually having to put money into those trust. But other than that, it's mostly the operating expectations that are dictating our expectation that we would be positive cash ﬂow out of that business net to parent through 2022."
"Okay. And separately, on your new guidance and the eﬀective tax rate assumption, so does it matter where this tax beneﬁt is going to be realized i.e., if it's at the parent level or at the regulated utilities level? And if it's the latter, is there any risk that as       you go through your rate cases, some of this beneﬁt would actually be transferred to your customers, i.e., it wouldn't be retained in earnings because you would have to basically embed the lower eﬀective tax rate in your customer rates?","Yes. I think, actually, a lot of it hopefully will. That's one of the strategies that we employ to help keep our customer rates low. And one of the drivers, of course, is the protected excess ADIT, which is basically money that's going back to customers that we collected over time for the higher tax rate in previous years. So that's going to be kind of dribbling out over time. That's really the source of – or one of the two sources of the lower eﬀective tax rate and that is going directly back to customers over time.  And then the AFUDC piece, that is – AFUDC is recognized by books, it's not recognized by tax. So that's just a structural element that's in there associated with that. That'll get reﬂected in rate base ultimately. But those are the two main drivers of the positive change in the eﬀective tax rate. And then, of course, when we are deﬁning tax items, we're not including those in our numbers going forward but often we are working with retail regulators to share those beneﬁts with customers. And as we do that, those money would ﬂow back to customers as well."
