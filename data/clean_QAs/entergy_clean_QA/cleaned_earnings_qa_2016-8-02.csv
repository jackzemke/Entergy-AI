Question,Answer
"So, this may be a little bit semantics, but I thought at the Analyst Day you highlighted that expectations for 2016 should sort of be at the midpoint to top-end of expectations when you're accounting for the tax beneﬁts, especially when you think about today's results and relatively warm July, you still expect to come in sort of at the midpoint. So is there something that's coming in weaker than you expected since the Analyst Day?","This is Drew, Shar. I think at Analyst Day, we tried to guide towards the bottom end of our original guidance range absent the taxes. And I think if you add the tax back, you'll ﬁnd that – or I guess if you take it out of the new guidance range, you'll ﬁnd       we're kind of back down at the bottom of our original guidance range is where we've been talking about for a little bit of time now.  With the taxes, I think at Analyst Day, we tried to say that there were a number of things in the hopper that could take us to the top of the range or potentially even over the range, which is, I think the way we described it. But I think that's – outside of those things, I think we're still about in the same area that we were describing at Analyst Day."
"Okay. Got it. Super helpful. And then just lastly on the sustainability plan, it's great that you have a schedule – you sort of have a framework there and you're on schedule to provide kind of numbers at EEI, but since there's a framework there, is there anything that you can just provide directionally or sort of are the expectations still within the hundreds of millions of cost that you discussed at the Analyst Day brieﬂy?","Yeah, Shar, this is Leo. We're not really going to give any more detail about that. As I mentioned, we've got a framework. We've really got the outline of the plan really well in hand. Chris and his team have been working it. It passed their peer review check as he had mentioned in his outline at our Analyst Day, and we're on track to be able to provide you the numbers as well as what we think the impact is going to be based on our mitigation strategies and regulatory recovery, et cetera."
"Hey, guys. Want to dive a little further into the nuclear sustainability program, and the only reason why I ask is, when we talk to other companies, a lot of other companies – and in fact, the Nuclear Energy Institute at its annual brieﬁng, spent a lot of time on this as well talking about being able to take costs out of the nuclear business, meaning to keep the reliability levels elevated in the 90%, 91% range, but     to be able to reduce cost, and that seems to be an industry-wide eﬀort. It seems your disclosure over the last six to nine months is actually in the opposite direction in terms of the cost structure. Can you just talk a little bit about what makes Entergy diﬀerent than the rest of, eﬀectively, the U.S. nuclear industry in that regard? Do you view this as a temporary issue? Do you view this as a multi-year, three to ﬁve, ﬁve to seven-year issue? And what got you to this point relative to where it seems like the industry trade group is talking about?","Yeah, Michael, I'll just brieﬂy – again, I'm not going to get into the sustainability plan until we're ready to give you the details of it, and that will be later in the year at EEI. And we are participating with the industry in all of those analyses of the nuclear promise, et cetera. And so, all of that will be part of our thinking when we look at the plan but with the situation we have with a couple of units in Column IV, our operations haven't been up to our expectations, and so we're working to make sure that we put in place a plan that sustains the ability for us, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to once again be considered one of the top performers in the industry. And that's really what we're trying to get to is move from where we are to top performer, but we are also obviously participating with all the industry-wide eﬀorts, nuclear promise as you mentioned, and other things as well."
"Got it. Do you view this as more capital intensive, or is this more kind of operating cost intensive?","Michael, as we said at Analyst Day, it will be some of both, but again, I'm going to defer giving any details until we get to November."
"Got it. Okay. Last thing, can you just – I want to make sure, Drew, I understood your comments when kind of going through some of the puts and takes on multi-year guidance. Pension, a headwind, I think that's a headwind for everybody in the industry that doesn't have a pension tracker, the nuclear sustainability program a headwind, the tailwinds oﬀsetting these are obviously your above average expected demand growth levels and the move to more formula rate plans and kind of more formulaic revenue increase programs. Anything I'm leaving out in those three or four items, kind of puts and takes?","I think we are aggressively looking for ways to oﬀset some of these costs with the other things in the business. I mentioned interest rates helping oﬀset some of the pension costs, right. That's a bit of a double-edged sword, but we are looking high and low within the business to ﬁnd other oﬀsets. And there's little bits and pieces here and there that are going to help us out. Insurances is helping us out a little bit this year and we think it will help us some going forward. There are other O&M areas that we're looking at. Depreciation's been a bit helpful this year. So, I think there's     just a number of things that are out there that we're trying to turn over every rock right now to make sure we mitigate as much of the expected headwinds as you're describing them as possible. And that's our objective, to make sure that we get to a point in the fall where we can update you and try to maintain those same guidance ranges.  And then, as I mentioned, and you were alluding to, we do have rate actions over the next few years planned that we think will get us back to a point where we can be a step – be on track for 2019 and beyond."
"Just a quick one. Can you remind us what the sort of critical timelines are on the FitzPatrick decision, the shut versus sale? And maybe if there is – is there a third path now that you have the CEC, which is stay open and not sell?","Well, let me just get to the last one. I don't know that there's a stay open and not sell option necessarily but the other two are certainly what we're working for. The last thing we need to do is create a third path for people have to start working down, but Bill, why don't you go ahead and talk about where we sit.       Sure. So, Jonathan, obviously, yesterday's order was a step in the right direction as it related to the CES and putting a value on the ZECs in New York. So between now and the end of the month, we need to be able to successfully negotiate a deal with Exelon, so a commercial arrangement, and then there obviously are a number of regulatory approvals that will have to take place in order to have assurances that the transaction will move forward, largely those our state-driven. If in the event that all those regulatory approvals are met, then we would proceed down the path with Exelon and then the plant would be refueled in January.  If we're unable to reach commercial agreements with Exelon, or we're not able to achieve those regulatory approvals, we will begin the regular decommissioning process and stay on the same path that we have previously been on. But as Leo pointed out, there are no plans to continue to run the plant under Entergy ownership as we've made a commitment to reduce the size of the EWC footprint and that would not be consistent with that strategy."
"So, the January refuel, hoping to reach an agreement by the end of August, that you need some approvals in the interim, is there a date sort of somewhere in the middle there by which you really need those approvals that's sooner than January?","Yeah, Jonathan, that's something that's still in ﬂux right now, so we're working through that and I really can't comment on the details."
"Okay, great. Thank you for the extra color. And then secondly, can I ask on the EWC? You said this was a tax election. Can you give a little more color as to what you've elected and what that cash impact is versus what it's meant for earnings?","Well, Jonathan, it's a restructuring for tax purposes and it builds oﬀ of work that we've done over the past 15 years in the tax area. And it's going to be part of the 2016 audit cycle, but based on private letter rulings that we received in the past, legal opinions that we received, audit settlements that we've made, we believe that this is the appropriate way to go about accounting for the restructuring that we have, and we'll work through that with the IRS over the next few years."
"I wanted to talk about the power demand outlook for residential and commercial that we've been seeing some fairly low numbers there, some negative numbers. In your view, what are some of the drivers, both negative and positive that you're looking at that could cause either surprise to the upside or the downside? What sort of the prospects for this change to be more supportive, more positive? Any big drivers that you see, or is it really hard to extrapolate just from a couple of quarters?","Stephen, this is Theo. I think your last comment probably ﬁts. And it is tough to extrapolate from just the last couple of quarters. I mean, clearly, as we've talked about on other calls, as other utilities also – we see the eﬀects of energy eﬃciency, both at the state level and through diﬀerent federal guidelines having impacts. And we feel like usage per customer starting – it's been on a decline again, I think consistent with what we've seen with the industry. We've started to see some ﬂattening out relative to that. And I think also you have the microeconomic impacts from a demand perspective. And I think as you go forward, the macroeconomic impacts clearly would be the ﬁrst that you'd point to in terms of positives as you could change that.     If you look through our region and you look at our gross state product forecast, we saw kind of a downward trend over the past year or so. We see that starting to pick back up. And clearly if that does materialize, you could see some positive impacts as it relates to that but we'll continue to see impacts around energy eﬃciency as we go forward. And as we get further through the year, especially the third quarter, because it's one of our largest quarters from a sales perspective, I think we'll have a better perspective and point of view around what we think the longer term trend will take us."
"Okay, understood. And then wanted to shift to Indian Point and just check on the status on the New York PUC investigation into the automatic shut down there. Would it be possible to get an update in terms of where that stands and what the next steps are in that investigation?","Yes, Stephen, this is Bill. That investigation continues, really have nothing new to report. We have fully cooperated with the state but I'm not aware of any speciﬁc milestones associated with that investigation."
"Hi, Leo. Just at a high level, any thought process on how the New York ruling might aﬀect your views on Indian Point? And maybe way out of the box, any thought on chances that something like this could happen in Massachusetts with Pilgrim?","Well, certainly, there's no push for something like this in Massachusetts at the moment. As far as it relates to what's going on with Indian Point, as we understand it,       the way the proposal has shifted, it went from excluding Indian Point to potentially including it. Meet certain criteria within the next couple of years, so we view that as positive. We don't think that clean air should be discriminatory about where it shows up in the state. So certainly, that could, down the road, cut oﬀ the bad tales as it might be in terms of pricing related to Indian Point, given the criteria that the plant be ﬁnancially challenged, et cetera, to qualify for the program. But other than that, it's really too early to say what it might mean for Indian Point. And again, there's really no push for something similar in Massachusetts that I'm aware of."
One other question with this rule. My recollection is that you guys actually challenged a contract with the Dunkirk plant in New York that might argue have some similarities to this rule. So I'm curious how you diﬀerentiate the legal support for this rule versus that Dunkirk plant?,"Steve, in general, we think it's diﬀerent because this order actually places a value on the attribute associated with zero emissions generation as opposed to more of a contact for diﬀerences that was associated with Dunkirk litigation."
"Okay. And then another question just on the kind of – Leo, you laid out a lot of the diﬀerent programs you're doing. Could you just remind kind of any of the things that you're talking about that may not already be in your current capital plans supporting the growth for 2019?","Yes, Steve. There's certainly not everything that we would likely identify associated with the integrated energy network. There is probably more out there associated with that. I think we referenced toward the backend or beyond the time horizon we've been talking at Analyst Day. We mentioned the $6 billion to $8 billion number at that point in time, but that, obviously, goes out beyond the period we're talking here now. Also in the world of gas price volatility, et cetera, well, there's nothing in there for anything we might do to hedge that volatility if we were to include investments and the like, and the potential for where we come out in some of the renewable RFPs, et cetera.  So when you get to the back-end and certainly beyond it, there's a signiﬁcant amount of other things that we're investigating that could be part of the capital program, in addition to what we need. And, again, as we've mentioned before, we've got a pretty solid generation and transmission capital program. And we're doing that from a position, as we've mentioned before, being short generation across the system. And we would continue to anticipate that, that we would be short across the system as we go forward, and these capital investments create a signiﬁcant amount of beneﬁts to our customers. And as it relates to reduced congestion, lower production cost, lower emissions, you name it, particularly given the age of our ﬂeet, these things are really, really beneﬁcial to our customers."
Great. One last quick one on the pension discount rate. My recollection from the Analyst Day is that was a – 50 basis point move is like a $0.14 a share sensitivity. Is that still correct? Do I have it right?,"I think our rule of thumb is $0.06 for every 25 basis points for Entergy overall. And so it's, I guess, $0.12 for 50 basis points. And then about three-quarters of that is Utility. The other quarter is EWC."
"Hi, guys. I have a quick question again on FitzPatrick. In terms of how we should think about the sales price, given the price of what the nuclear credit is pretty clear and for eight years, how are you kind of looking at what is the adequate consideration you should be getting from Exelon for the sale? Is it the value, the NPV of those cash ﬂows? Is there something else? Is there another threshold you're looking at in terms of the recovery of additional cost? Any kind of benchmarks we should be thinking about there?","Well, Praful, as you might guess right now, that's between us and Exelon. And I appreciate the question. There's just no way I can comment."
"All right. Fair enough. Okay. So, I guess on the tax impact that you had at EWC, I just wanted to understand, is there any reason why it's not excluded like from a one-time versus an operating earnings basis? Is there something we should be thinking about that item, the $1.33? Why it's not excluded from a one-time operating income perspective?","Well, I mean, we pointed out and tried to make it very clear where the number is and what the impact is, but taxes are something that we work on every day just like every other line item in the income statement. So we consider taxes to be an operational item. Now having said that, particularly in Utility where we are targeting steady predictable growth, we want to make sure it's very clear where the taxes are falling out. So we provide an adjusted number for you. But we do think taxes are part of operational earnings and we would never call them out as a special item."
"Got you. All right. And then ﬁnally just quickly on Indian Point, in terms of asset life today as we think about valuing Indian Point, is there any diﬀerent view today you have given what's happening in New York in terms of how you would view the asset life of Indian Point?","Well, Praful, we've always viewed that we're on a path towards relicensing of the plant. I think with what we've seen in New York, I would mention that what the CES does, if that goes through as planned, is it certainly provides a backstop for – against lower prices while – during the course of the program. So it's not really necessarily what the life of it issue is as much as maybe probability distribution of prices that it would receive."
"So perhaps to follow up on the last series of questions, if you will, for Indian Point, is there a potential here to eventually transact? Does this, call it, backstop against lower prices, make it more of a transactable asset or what do you see as the strategic ﬁt of Indian Point given the added visibility or certainty provided potentially here?","From a strategic standpoint, Julien, we're still – as I mentioned in my remarks and we mentioned at Analyst Day and we've been mentioning for several years now, our view is that the businesses should be separate. And we've been proceeding down that path for the last several years. The only thing that changes from time to time is the methodology we would use. So, for example, we look at New England and something like Vermont Yankee, for example, separation came about because prices didn't support the economics of the plant, and we were forced into shutting it down. To the extent that something becomes transactable as part of that separation, certainly that's a preferable route as it was with the Rhode Island State Energy Center when we sold that and if we're successful to be able to sell FitzPatrick.  So I'll say it again, it does impact, I would guess, the probability distribution of prices it might receive. We still believe that we're going to get the plant relicensed, so that we'd indicate a long life of the plant. And then the other aspect it has always been part of transacting, which was part of the spin was regulatory approvals that we would require to get something done. All those are the same. We're just incrementally changing the dynamic as we proceed down the relicensing path to be successful or if something like this occurs where, again, it changes the downside price risk."
"Got it. And just to be clear about this, the sustenance CapEx that's contemplated or that you're preparing for EEI, does the development in New York change that at all, either with respect to FitzPatrick and refueling and/or Indian Point, to be clear?","Those would be part of the mix when we look at what we're going to do, but again, we're going to save that more detail until we get there."
I just want to sort of follow up a little bit on Jonathan Arnold's question. I wasn't completely clear on what was the driver of the tax beneﬁt at EWC? Was there a revaluation of some sort or recognition of the liability? Just what is it that triggered this tax beneﬁt?,"It ultimately ends up being a stop up in basis for some of our nuclear assets and liabilities that are sitting at EWC, Paul."
