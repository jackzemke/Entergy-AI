Question,Answer
"Hi. Good afternoon, Drew and team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a great quarter. Can we start oﬀ with a question on the '23 planning assumptions and some of the moving pieces there? I see that the load stepped up from the prior ﬁrst look up to 1% and O&M seems to have a slight tick up. Can you talk about what drove those changes? And what other changes are now embedded versus the early outlook? And on O&M speciﬁcally, is that piece attributed to FLEX O&M or more recurring costs?","Sure. Thanks for that. This is Kimberly. As you pointed out, our '23 sales are up a little bit, and our O&M is up a little bit from EEI. As you know, that our early outlook, our preliminary estimates, and we've continued to reﬁne our guidance and our outlook. And as we did that, we found additional tailwinds both in conservative planning principles and additional opportunities in sales. There's some modest opportunities in interest rate expense, and that enabled us to add additional O&M for customer- centric spending like vegetation as well as call center support and things like that.  We will note that we continue to sit squarely in the middle of our guidance range, and we do plan to use FLEX spending or FLEX levers that we have to continue to manage 2023, both from a weather potential eﬀects as well as any other eﬀects that come along."
"Great. That's very helpful. And shifting to SERI. There's still a few proceedings outstanding. Just to clarify some of the new developments from the December order, how much additional refunds are retail regulators relating and more broadly on the process, given kind of the individual complaints kind of receiving orders and the settlement in Mississippi, does that provide some visibility to an ultimate resolution time frame? And is there any kind of more constructive settlement discussion positions at this point?","So this is Rod. I'll try and unpack the procedural aspects of SERI updates. And I think I'll let Kimberly address anything as it relates to any new ﬁnancial claims. But two primary matters to update around the uncertain tax position and the sale leaseback. One is the compliance ﬁling and the other being the opposing parties request for rehearing. On the compliance ﬁling, actually today, we're ﬁling our response to the regulator's opposition to our ﬁling. And there's no speciﬁc time line that FERC has to act on that. So that's one update.  The second, a week from now, there's the request outstanding by the opposition for rehearing on the decisions that the FERC made at the end of the year. There is a deadline there that FERC is imposed on itself of February 23rd. So it's actually a week from today. That's the request for rehearing ﬁled by the parties there.     So two updates there. We'll have to review the orders to determine what, if any, next steps we have in that regard. But those are the two primary updates for the SERI proceedings around the uncertain tax position and sale leaseback.    And just to add, as far as from a ﬁnancial perspective, as you know, we reﬂected the complete eﬀect of the SERI Mississippi settlement for all companies in June. About $235 million of that $550 million roughly charge that was taken last June went to Mississippi and the remainder is reserved. I think Drew mentioned, as I did, that there was about $104 million of refunds out of the decision that came in December, and those were paid by SERI to the operating companies in early January."
"And just a follow-up, does the information, does this kind of set you up for a better position for any kind of settlement discussions, just given the fact that some of these issues are starting to get oﬀ the table?","Well, I'll -- this is Rod again. I can respond there. To the extent that we're progressing with FERC being clear about its intentions, it does set up a clearer path to settlement. And I think what's upcoming and outstanding of that being FERC having an opportunity to clarify its prior decision in December, as well as addressing any of the issues upon which the rehearing is being requested. Again, it further clariﬁes those outstanding issues that may be standing in the way of settlement. Our position is settlement is in the best interest of our customers and other stakeholders, and we will remain aggressive in pursuing that. But it's in FERC's corner right now to clarify their end of '22 decision that I think will guide our next steps on settlement.    And I'll just add that -- this is Drew. Whenever we were back in December, we did have conversations going. Whenever the FERC did decide that they were going to put an order out, it halted those conversations to see what those orders were. And so, depending that information and clarity around that, as Rod said, and we would hope to be able to get back to the table with [ph]them."
That's very helpful. Thank you for taking the questions. I'll jump back in the queue.,Great. Thanks.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America. Your question please.
"Just a couple of smaller ones. Just on the -- you put on your slide that pension is less of an O&M drag year-over-year in 2023. Just if you could quantify that? And also, how much was the pension contribution that you made last year in 2022, I mean?","Paul, this is Kimberly. I may need to get back with you on the speciﬁc numbers. But in general, our pension expense is down, as you noted, as the funded status has increased about $500 million to about 85%. We did increase the contribution at the end of the year, but I'll have Bill follow up with this speciﬁc number on that.  Our pension liability came down due to the increase in interest rates, which was reﬂected in the discount rate for that liability, but that was oﬀset by lower-than- expected returns on the asset side of our investments. But on a net basis, we are in a better funded status position at the end of the year.  Yes. The liability was helped by a number of retirements along with the interest rates. I think the number for the contribution was around $400 million in that ballpark, Paul. But Bill can give you the exact number, and it's going to be in the K."
"Okay. Great. And then also, I noticed there's a $33 million depreciation adjustment for SERI that you had in your earnings release. If you could just give some information on what that related to?","Sure. As Rod said, the decision that came out in December had a number of components. And on the sale leaseback side, it had a component around recovery of the cost of the portion that's owned by third party and how that sale leaseback was. So when they play that back through, the net rate base that was charged over time have been depreciated when you apply the eﬀects of the sale leaseback changes that the FERC order judge determined or the FERC determined that depreciation is a turnaround of that eﬀect on that rate base that was depreciated over that time.  So it's kind of -- you have to take that piece as well as I think you'll see another sort of net liability there, and all those are adjusted out. But it's related to that. Those     items are all related to how you unwind the sale leaseback component that came out of that order."
"I was curious about -- so the Louisiana commission at least some of the commissioners seem to be focused on reliability and even outside of major storms. So wondering if there's a path to address that aspect of things, kind of areas that seem to maybe fall out of the speciﬁc 10-year resiliency plan, just maybe normal day- to-day outside major storm reliability?","Yes. Reliability is actually a part and parcel of our resilience conversation. They're very much connected. And coming out of the back-end of 2022, where our customers were experiencing ﬁnancial hardship because of rising commodity prices, high usage and the like. The regulators were looking for relief. And any disruption to our customers was viewed as a challenge for the regulators, but it didn't stop our stakeholder engagement strategy, around reinforcing the need for continued investment, customer-centric investments in reliability. And it will continue to be part of our resilience ﬁling, and it's part of the case that we've made and the case we'll continue to make to the Louisiana Commission. They're aligned with us on those customer-centric investments. And we expect to see improvements in reliability across the board. So they've been interested. It's been aligned with our engagement with them thus far. We expect to continue to have their support, especially around our eﬀorts to accelerate the investments.  And I'll add to Rod's comments that we had -- or we have a resilience and reliability program that we've been operating for the last years that has shown improvements       in our stats. And what I was mentioning continuous improvement moving over into the capital space in my remarks, one of the areas where we are focusing that is in this energy delivery space, because we have a reliability program, we are upgrading our resilience program. We also have customer eﬀorts going on integrating those three things, and making it much more optimized in a space where we think we can achieve all the outcomes that we're looking for and do it more eﬃciently.  So that's -- that is a place where all these things are starting to come together and are actually separate eﬀorts going on internally in the business."
"Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And you alluded to it in the prepared remarks. Obviously, the last securitization process was a challenging one. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate. Is there a way to lower the risk around storm cost securitization processes going forward in Louisiana? Just what kind of initiatives can you pursue speciﬁcally to kind of align parties more smoothly going forward?","I'll start, and I'll let Rod jump in. But I think the main thing that we can do is embark on a resilience program together. And that is big opportunity we have ﬁlings in Louisiana and in New Orleans. And as I said, we're planning to do that in Texas later this year. That's the biggest opportunity. And that will move all of our stakeholders forward in terms of preparing for storms and responding more eﬀectively to storms.  So Rod, I'll let you --    Yes. And I think that's the point. Our customers are agnostic as to whether the investment is a reliability investment or resiliency investment. And when there is a storm, and the customers interrupted, they're experiencing the hardships of that interruption. That's what was part of the driver for the heightened attention both in our -- from the regulators as well as our investment plans in pursuing accelerated investments and resiliency, because our customers had the recency of the experience with storms. And so, Drew's point is right on point that if we can get alignment around accelerated resiliency investments, our customers will actually experience better reliability experiences as well. They're quite connected."
"Good morning, Drew. Just clariﬁcation. What to expect on February 20 -- February 22? So is the FERC actually going to put out an order where they will kind of -- you have the compliance refund? Will they aﬃrm the compliance refund? I'm just trying to kind of ﬁgure out what to look for there.","It's a request we expect them by February 23, if I'm hearing your question correctly. We're expecting the FERC to respond to the party's request for rehearing. So any substantive aspects of that is unknown. But our expectation is that FERC will respond to the party's request to have certain of those issues reheard, not necessarily a substantive ruling one way or the other."
"I see. So if they basically say no to the rehearings then, I guess, does that clear way the path to you kind of going through other settlements and putting that to bed? Is that the right framework that I'm thinking about?","Well, the parties will have the opportunity to appeal if they are not satisﬁed with the outcome. I think from our vantage point, there were certain advantages to give an FERC the opportunity to reaﬃrm the initial position it took, and we had some challenges with the sale leaseback part of the order. And so, what we're looking for out of this water candidly is clarity. And we'll wait to see what -- how FERC responds in the next week to order our next steps."
"Understood. Thank you, guys. That's all I had. All my other questions have been answered. Thanks, again.",Excellent. Thank you.    Operator     Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Your question please.
"Thank you. So ﬁrst on FERC and SERI. So FERC scheduled hearings in that last challenge that talked about the prudence of the uprate of Rangold, which I mean on its own, frankly it's hard to believe that this challenge was outright rejected. So I mean, is there any read through? Are you hearing anything from FERC? Why those hearings were even scheduled?","Angie, it's Rod. I'm assuming you're talking about the orders -- the rehearing order that the FERC released today where they declined our motion to read here. Yes. So the order is procedural only as we read it and doesn't order any refunds or require any further actions. And they went so far as to explain that in setting the prudence complaint for hearing -- in settlement, it imposes no obligation on us. It doesn't deny us any of our rights, ﬁxes no legal relationships, but it simply initiates further proceedings. And they're withholding their right and ability to address anything substantive along the lines. It's not unexpected for us, but again, it's a procedural and not a substantive order. So there's not anything to read from it from a substitute standpoint.  And Angie, to be sure, we appreciate your sentiment.      Yes, yes. And the next step is the settlement pediment oﬀer March series settlement oﬀer to the parties on March 1. But again, Angie, taking it as a procedural matter, not a substantive one."
"Okay. And then completely changing topics completely here. So I mean, I was just wondering, there's this discussion in the industry overall about switching from solar ITC, the solar PBCs, obviously, from a regulated utility perspective, that's helpful given no issue with ITC normalization. But is there -- I mean, as you look at it, right, especially that your solar resource would be superior or above average. I mean is this shift, would that be actually in any way, EPS accretive? I mean I'm just thinking about the earnings recognition under the solar PTCs versus the ITC.","Yes. Good question, Angie. The way we think about the PTCs as they provide, and any IRA in general is it provides for incremental investment. We'll need to work with our regulators as we have over a number of years successfully to provide back the tax credits to customers in a way that provides them the value, but continues to support our credit and our balance sheet.     And so, we've begun those conversations early, but how those play out will be a matter of discussion with our regulators. We've talked about using those as credits against rate base as compared to direct credit, for example -- to customers as it gives us an opportunity to manage our balance sheet as well as ensure the opportunity to customers. And it also helps with the volatility associated with customers' bills on PTCs, particularly as it relates the nuclear PTCs.    And Angie, this is Drew. I would add to Kimberly's comments that we have a 50% planning assumption to the extent that this does help make us more competitive. There might be an opportunity for incremental investment over and what we're planning, but we still have to go achieve that. So we're continuing to work to get more competitive. And this is certainly helping level the playing ﬁeld for us as you said versus the ITC framework. But that's an opportunity for us that we'll have to go achieve out there in the future."
"Okay. And then lastly, you did make comments about changes in solar power curves and the quantiﬁcation of the nuclear PTC beneﬁt that would accrue to your customers. But we haven't yet received any guidelines from the IRS, and it sounds like it's not expected until the early summer. But is there -- have you been in discussions with the IRS about how they will potentially quantify the current energy stream that your plans are getting?","Yes. We're certainly working through EEI with our partners and with the other utilities on getting clariﬁcations on those nuclear PTCs. We'll obviously have to wait with the rest of the industry and what that actually comes out as. But we do believe that that's an opportunity for us, and we'd be eligible for those. And it provides, as Drew said, an opportunity for customers both to manage bills as well as an opportunity for incremental investment depending on how those come out. But we have deﬁnitely been in discussions with them through EEI.    And we did anticipate that they would be probably a little slower on this, because they have more time. It doesn't kick in until '24. And so we anticipated that they're going to cover a lot of other things like the corporate minimum tax and other important elements ﬁrst before they got to that."
"Hey, good morning. Hopefully, just two quick ones. You may have addressed them, but just curious. I guess there's two issues going on with SERI. What is a reasonable expectation when you think all of the challenges that it will play out at FERC? Like what's a reasonable assumption when all that is over? Is that within six months or do you think it could carry longer?","We can't say because FERC has -- on the issues we just alluded to, doesn't have a speciﬁc time line. They're in control of the schedule there. The updates that I've given was the ﬁling we were making today that where the FERC has no scheduled deadline. That's in regard to our compliance ﬁling. And the other was a week from today, the timing that FERC imposed on itself to reply to the request for rehearing from all the other parties. But it is in FERC's domain to decide when they make these decisions. So I could not give any -- give any expected time frames to resolve all of these. That's another one of the reasons why we're so aggressive in engaging with the regulators to pursue settlement to remove the uncertainty inherent in FERC's operations. No disrespect to our FERC commissions."
"Great. And just lastly, Slide 9 you go through some credit liquidity metrics there. You talked about maybe by year-end, you hope to be at the range or better. You have a debt especially with Moody's at trying to be at 14%. I guess, do you have a targeted credit cushion or a targeted level you hope to be maybe by '24 that you could share?","Sure. As you pointed out, we are trying to be above 14% by the end of '23 and closing out the securitization for Louisiana that was approved in January is a signiﬁcant help to enable that. As far as longer term, we are targeting 15%, and we're targeting that over the outlook period. So you'll see us continue to focus on strengthening our balance sheet over the outlook period to get to that target of around 15%."
"Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Maybe just to elaborate on the O&M targets and conditions that you're seeing. You kind of mentioned some of the costs escalating, but -- just trying to get a sense on what percentage of O&M is subject to some of these external factors? And how do those elevated costs play into regulatory relief just given the FRP revenue increase cap?","Sure. Thanks for the follow-up. As far as inﬂation, we do have some inﬂation costs in our '23 guidance. We've talked about costs like commodity costs and chemicals that have increased. We've seen some labor cost increase in our vegetation contracts, for example. But as I said, we have seen some relief on that, particularly on the commodity side as it relates to the resources that go into our capital plan, things like copper, nickel, steel, all those are down year-over-year. So there's some -- it's a blend, if you will, but we do think we have some FLEX levers in '23 to help us manage both our O&M and our overall -- where we are in the guidance range."
So no kind of impact of the regulatory release just given some of that FLEX that you have? I think the early outlook had like a 9% utility book ROE. Any change in thinking around there?,"Yes. So as far as Louisiana and Arkansas, where Arkansas certainly has an FRP, we continue to work to manage within that cap. Increased sales, which U.S. deal will come in over the outlook period will certainly help us in that regard. From a Louisiana perspective, as you know, in June is the last ﬁling of our FRP in the current cycle, and we would expect to have either a rate case or a new FRP ﬁling. Those modiﬁcations out of those outcomes would help us move up -- you'd see their ROEs move up, hopefully, depending on the outcomes associated with those rate mechanisms."
"Great. And a quick follow-up on the question around credit metrics. Just are capital market conditions changing your thoughts around the process for kind of capital allocation or dividend decisions? And kind of more broadly, how are you thinking about optimizing those ﬁnancing needs, especially as CapEx ramp up in the second half of the decade?","Yes. We certainly -- as we noted, from an equity perspective, we've met our needs through 2024, largely we have about $130 million left. We've talked about total need between '25 and '26. We haven't broken that out. But as we accelerate capital investments and we see additional renewable growth in the back half, we'll deﬁnitely have to look at how we are ﬁnancing that most eﬀectively. But we continue to watch interest rates as well as other mechanisms to ﬁnance. We don't have anything as far as alternate ﬁnancing or anything like that, that we have that's executable at this point.  And it's not changing our capital mix really either at this time. We're using the internal tools for continuous improvement and trying to ﬂex around those internal options rather than try to adjust what we're doing on an external basis at this point."
"Excellent. That's very helpful. Thanks so much, and great quarter.","Thanks, Constantine.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our ﬁnal question. And our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Your question please."
"Hey, everyone. Thanks for getting me in here. Just one for me today. In Louisiana, I know you're kind of in the last year of the FRP cadence. And I guess you'll either ﬁle for an extension in the third quarter or a rate case. Can you just give us a sense of where you're leaning there? And any additional thoughts around that? Thank you.","Well, we are prepared for both tracks and the ﬁling of a rate case doesn't prevent us from continuing to work with the commission and our related stakeholders on an extension or renewal of the FRP. So there are parallel paths, not inconsistent with the prior -- as I recall in my tenure two iterations of review. So the process will likely be the same.  Given the fact that we have the accelerated resilience ﬁling and any anticipated tweaks along those lines, we'd be looking to ﬁgure out with our stakeholders, what's the most eﬃcient path for us to incorporate the resilience components aside from the rest of the components of our capital plan and rate design. So more to come, but parallel pads."
