Question,Answer
"Good morning. So, I guess, ﬁrst question on the earnings guide for 2019, it looks like you reduced the O&M expectation for the full year from $0.30 to $0.20. Is that -- ﬁrstly, is that helping maintain your earnings guide and what's helping keep that or bring that O&M down from the original $0.30 resumption to now the $0.20?","Yes, Praful, this is Drew. That is helping us to maintain and amongst a couple of other things, that includes some eﬃciencies we found early in the year, our good operations have led to some rebates for insurance premiums. A little bit of it is timing into other periods like 2020. But, it's not enough to change in the expectations out there and we've also seen some oﬀsets in other areas like interest expense. We had a very active quarter, in $1.5 billion of reﬁnancing and new money issuances and since interest rates were lower we were able to capture some of that versus our previous expectation.  So the combination of all those things are what's helping us maintain our expectations for the year."
"Got you. That's helpful. Thanks, Drew. And then secondly on the operating cash ﬂow drop which is signiﬁcant, but it sounds like it's primarily driven by the ADIT which it seems like you front-loaded, even within the year, is that fair in terms of understanding how the ADIT will be paid out in 2019?","Yes, that's correct. And as you know, that's a 12-month kind of view. And so we would see, I am talking on top of the FFO kind of measures would be a 12-month kind of view. We do see it continue to trend down over the course of the year both on the 12 month rolling bit and in the quarters and you see our operating cash ﬂow continue to improve over the course of the year. We are about 70% done with the return of the cash, so far, to our customers."
I wanted to ask a longer-term question. So you mentioned that you might increase renewal part spending if the economics of wind and solar assets improve. I mean given some set of tax subsidies so those wouldn't be -- wouldn't you consider actually accelerating some of the CapEx?,"I'm sorry, the connection wasn't good enough for us to catch that."
"I'm sorry, I was just wondering about your regulated renewable power CapEx, you mentioned that some of your jurisdictions might consider more renewable spending going forward once the renewables become more economic, but given that there is some sort of some of the tax subsidies wouldn't do you consider actually potentially accelerating this CapEx?","I'm not sure really that we would see any acceleration in those, most of these projects will be showing up at the end of the plan in the 2021 and beyond timeframe and really wouldn't see us accelerating it much. We've got to work into this. So the resource plan where they make economic sense and serve the right purpose for the grid. So as the prices come down and as the technology continues to evolve, which we fully expected to do we should see it playing a bigger role in the resource plan as it competes well with other resources for the type of operational characteristics to payout.     Also that our NCR our low cost rates, make it a little less economic for some of these projects and of course we still have to go through the regulatory processes associated with, each of these transactions. And so I think we're going at a pretty good clip, given what we think the regulatory bandwidth is at this point. Of course, if the economics took a step change, certainly we would look at something diﬀerent. So we are looking at it, but we're not anticipating an acceleration like Leo said."
"Good morning. I know you kind of addressed this. Hey, Leo, could you maybe talk a little bit more about the impacts of the Texas legislation tier plan and what -- could it be impactful to your guidance or your capital plan?","Hey, Steve it's Rod [ph]. Good morning. The Texas legislation, while certainly positive is not material enough for us to change our guidance and outlooks. Keep in mind that it's really providing both the Commission, as well as the Company additional tools as we think beyond Montgomery County. So the answer to your question is not material enough in terms of ﬁnancial impact to change our outlooks"
"Okay and then the (inaudible) issue that you mentioned, could you remind what the investment there is and just, is there, -- is this a ﬁxable issue or is it a risk that you just decide not to acquire the (inaudible)?","This is Drew . Our planned investment there was about $400 million including some of the upgrades and other things that we have planned. At this point, we don't know exactly what the issue is. We just know there are some vibrations and other things, but we believe it's probably ﬁxable, and we'll be able to get to a transaction close before too terribly long."
"Sorry, I have a larger question, bigger picture question for you since the speciﬁc questions I had were just answered. We are seeing here, our macro view on the US economy continues to accelerate. The data just keeps getting better with the -- just notably with an absence of underlying core inﬂation in the economy as you guys have a particularly economically sensitive jurisdiction that is your region of the country is sort of, has a concentrated exposure to certain types of industries related to petrochemicals, et cetera.  I know that you guys, try to do really good job of sort of constantly evolving your thought process on underlying demand growth. Like, what is the current economic climate look like in terms of the risk of being sort of either over or under your base case demand growth expectations?","Yeah, Greg, this is Drew. As we look at our industry load we continue to see positive signs, frankly. So our industrial customers are looking at a number of spreads, commodity spreads, crack spreads, gas versus oil, geographic spread between Henry Hub and yeah, NBP for example or brent and so all of those indicators continue to be green for us. Inventories are reasonable and exports are picking up as the economy -- a low nature of just energy prices here on the Gulf Coast is extremely competitive worldwide.  And so we're very conﬁdent in what we can see, our current forecast is based on what we can see from an industrial perspective. And that includes petrochem, LNG, sub metals and not much core alkali, new at this point but core alkali has been a very strong performer for us and that market continues to get tighter. And as we look forward, we do see new opportunities in the core alkali space in the Petrochem space, there is potential for new LNG and other things.  So all of that bodes well for our industrial sales expectations and while that's good for us, the really important thing for us is it gives us incremental headroom to create investments and whether it's for those industrial customers or support distribution, operations in new ways, there is signiﬁcant investment opportunity within our business as we highlighted last July.  So all of that industrial opportunity may create additional headroom for us to make those investments."
Right. Thank you for the detailed answer. Have a great morning.,Thanks Greg.  Thank you Greg.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
"Can I just inquire, can you give us some -- an update on just how things are going with the discussions around Pilgrim for the transfer? There has been quite a lot of noise locally but hoping you could sort of cut through what matters for us.","This is Chris [inaudible] and as Leo said, we do expect the transaction to close before the end of the year,. We are following very closely the license transfer application and the other issues that lead to closure. And we're conﬁdent we can maintain that schedule."
"Okay. And so these kind of push for an approval at the state level, do you see that as a concern or not at this point?","I think we are quite conﬁdent we can work through that.  Yeah, and. Jonathan, there isn't any state approval required in Massachusetts it's just the NRC that we're seeking."
"Right I. I know, I heard some noise so people kind of pushing to have something. So it's good to hear that you don't think that's going to gain some momentum. And then just on the Indian Point similar, can you give us, is it suﬃciently similar to what you've proposed elsewhere that you see this as being reasonably formulaic or any sort of special considerations to think about as you move into the approval process there and I think to comment regarding local policymakers views around New York and timing?","Well, I'll answer this particular one. From the NRC's perspective I think it should be pretty straightforward. Yeah, of course, we'll be working with Holtec and the state to ﬁgure out what's the best thing to do there, but it's still early in the process and too early to tell exactly what will be required. there."
"Excellent, good morning. Thank you. A lot of questions asked already, but I wanted to come back to the Texas legislative side obviously, making good progress there, but wanted to understand a little bit the puts and takes on earned ROEs at the Texas subsidiary itself, just as you think about it perhaps, leaving aside the legislation itself, how do you think about the ability to earn your ROE, both the puts and takes over the next few years and what -- how you think about the cadence of the beneﬁt of legislation just year-over-year here, given the potential impact?","Hey, it's Rod. I think it's important note that the reason why we suggesting that the proposed legislation, keep in mind we still in the midst of negotiations at the legislature, does not change our outlook in terms of Texas is performance in large part because of the timing of the existing rate case process or rate case ﬁling in Texas. So, we made some headway over the last several years in Texas to reduce risk to improve the likelihood of us earning our allowed ROE through mechanisms such as the transmission cost recovery rider, the distribution cost recovery rider, with the objection -- objective rather of moving Texas closer to, as Leo mentioned the other jurisdictions that have more formulaic rate mechanism.  So, we view the proposed rider as a step in the right direction of reducing the risk in Texas, and improving our ability to earn and sustain our allowed ROE. So, while it's accretive structurally, it's not material enough for us to change our outlook. So putting that rider in some context, I think is appropriate."
"Got it. Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And then turning elsewhere, just wanted a quick clariﬁcations, if you can actually, back to Andrew's question. I think if I understand you're right, you're evaluating opportunities in the renewable side, but because it's principally solar type resources rather than wind, the timing element around PPC expiration just simply doesn't jive with respect to your own eﬀorts, in contrast to perhaps AEP's eﬀorts in Arkansas, for instance. Again I just want to make sure I understand some of the prepared remarks that you made.","Well, certainly, we already have quite a bit happening in Arkansas, in particular, we have the wind project up and running. We have another one that's proposed and then of course, we have all the other ones that we've listed out in more detail in the materials today. So we are very focused on that. I mean, it's 1000 megawatts of renewables, that's quite a bit for us to move through all of our various jurisdictions. Like I said earlier, we will continue to keep an eye on things. Yes, if renewable started to become much more economic and the window is still open on the production or the investment tax credits certainly, we would look to accelerate if we thought that was the right thing."
"Thank you. Leo, you mentioned in your opening remarks that annual dividend review will occur as it regularly does in the fourth quarter. Your payout ratio, based on your guidance should be in the bottom half of your range, you have the bulk of the risk with respect in the endpoint now behind you and then ﬁnally, your CapEx has got a little bit of a downward trajectory with some of the generation being completed, does this put the Board in a better position to increase the dividend closer to the EPS growth rate, and I realize you can't speak for the Board, but do I least have the right factors or is there something else I am forgetting?","Well, you're correct. I can't speak for the Board at this point, but I'll just tell you, kind of a process that we go forward through. Obviously, our objective is to get to the point where your earnings and dividend growth, more closely matched than they have over the last few years. That's why we started the dividend increases long before we got into that payout ratio target.  Certainly, tax reforms had an impact on that. One thing that I would say in your discussion, that is not necessarily true is the capital plan reduction. If you go back to the 2013 to 2015 timeframe, that three year period, our capital plan was about $6 billion over the three years. I think the one in the presentation today is $11.7 billion. So it's a doubling of CapEx in that timeframe. While we've been able to maintain some low straights [ph] in the United States. So, we would anticipate, if we can continue to manage the business with the rate levels as attractive as they are keep customers bills low, that gives us the opportunity to continue to invest more on behalf of our customers to improve technology to higher level of service at a lower price, that's our objective.  So, that piece of your discussion where CapEx should be trending downward is not necessarily correct, in fact, I would think it would be going the other direction. So all those things will come into consideration. You're right on our objective is to get to the point where our earnings growth and dividend growth look more closely match, it is something that will come up within the year normally, where the Board refreshes it's point of view on that and we'll take it up with them. But, actually [inaudible] the growing capital budget, where we are in the range, where we see earnings going the opportunities associated with that, will be factors that play into it.  And this is Drew, just to clarify what Leo said around the capital, we know what we showed you in July at our Analyst Day, was a capital plan that declined [inaudible], so by time we get out there we're not anticipating that would be at that level and we expect it to continue to grow."
"Yes, you know what my mistake was I was only looking at the generation, your D is going up in that RT&D -","Yes, distribution, we expect to grow with all of the investment opportunities that we have, our peers already into, but we have the distribution automation, the automated meters, million going in this year, up like that, which we think will begin to provide a platform for us to continue to invest into over the next several years."
