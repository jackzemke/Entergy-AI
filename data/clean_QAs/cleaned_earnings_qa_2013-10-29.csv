Question,Answer
"My ﬁrst question is on the expense outlook. I know the guidance midpoint of $5 is unchanged, but the components have changed signiﬁcantly, and speciﬁcally the guidance midpoint at the beginning of the year for parent and other was $0.50. It's been re-based to $0.85 in the context of the current $5 guidance and rises to $1.05 next year. Can you take us through the progression from $0.50 to $0.85 to $1.05? Then, I have a follow up.","I will let Drew handle that, Greg.    Okay. Well, as you know, the parent and other is primarily comprised of interest expense and taxes. Of course, there is the aﬃliate preferred expenses in there as well. That's certainly contributing as that's grown. The primary thing to think about is the tax piece of this, particularly as we move into 2014. We have historically used a     weighted average probability expectation of what our income tax is. We placed that into parent at the beginning of the year given the uncertainty of where it may ultimately on a shake out. This year, we have a better expectation of where it would probably land, and that's at the Utility, so we've highlighted some of those utility income tax beneﬁts that I discussed a minute ago. That's the primary driver that you see moving forward."
"Okay. Great. Then, my follow-up question is on the CapEx guidance. It looks to me, based on where your 2014 rate bases are going to end up based on looking at your rate case ﬁlings, et cetera, that at the level of CapEx spending minus level of depreciation you played out in your slides, that the rate base growth proﬁle looks like it's more or less the same rate, i.e. around 6%, that it had been in the past. So, assuming consistent rate treatment, wouldn't it be fair to assume that your earnings growth aspiration would be consistent with that through 2016?","You're jumping ahead of us a little bit on that, Greg, in terms of providing any kind of forward-looking outlook of -- we will discuss a little bit of that when we get to EEI in terms of what the opportunities are going forward and where we see the Utility, but right now we are not really prepared to go out beyond 2014."
"I'm sorry, but arithmetically it looks like rate CapEx minus depreciation, you're growing at about a 6% rate from 2014 through 2016 based on what your outlined. Is that fair?","There is other components of rate base, but the pieces you are looking at have -- but there is deferred taxes and other things that go into that calculation as well. I'm not trying to argue the math you and I apologize, I'm just not prepared to go beyond 2014 right now."
Just wanted to touch base on the depreciation study. It sounded like quite a signiﬁcant move in expected depreciation because of it. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more as to what went into that?,"Yes, Drew?    We use a group method of depreciation, which means that from time to time we have to do an updated depreciation study to reﬂect consistency with our actual experience. We alluded to it very brieﬂy on the last call, but didn't really give it a full discussion. Ultimately, the eﬀect is to take away large increases that we would expect to see towards the end of life for the nuclear assets and make the depreciation more ratable like you would expect under normal situations when you go forward. As you think about depreciation, it's a zero-sum game. By the time you get to the end of the life of an asset you're going to have to depreciate all of it. So, it's a little more ratable now with the new depreciation study. It doesn't it eﬀect the cash ﬂow at EWC."
"Okay. So, it would suggest that the detriment in value that we'd be seeing in later years is now being brought forward, and so I guess near term the EPS would be more conservative in terms of the value of those plants. Is that the way to think of it?","Yes, on an EPS basis, not on an EBITDA basis. I think it would be about the same that we are saying before."
"Okay. Moving to slide 18 on EBITDA basis, you guys show an increase now in 2014 versus 2013 versus last quarter. You mentioned a few things on the slide, one of which has to do with Vermont Yankee. I'm wondering whether or not the fuel expense is being reﬂected in EBITDA since the expense, I believe, is being amortized? That's number one. Number two, what's leading to those changes? I realize that there is a change in prices that would be beneﬁt. If you could just elaborate, give us a little bit more quantiﬁcation or sensitivity to that?",I'll answer the ﬁrst one and then I'll turn the second one over to Bill. Fuel amortization is in the EBITDA number for Vermont Yankee.
"So that is being reﬂected in slide 18, the non-cash expense of fuel?","Yes. One thing to think about there is fuel is part of the write-down. You write down all of the assets at Vermont Yankee, not just the actual plant itself, so it includes part of the fuel. You see the fuel going down as well there."
Was that a change from last quarter?,"Yes, I think last quarter -- we've typically been talking in a range of what we've expected. I think even on the last call, there was a little bit of confusion in terms of what was actually included, in terms of how much was included over rest of states. This is much more speciﬁc that we are including the $3 per KW month on an annualized basis for Lower Hudson Valley.    I'll just add, Paul, that we have historically used market views and there wasn't a market view of Lower Hudson Valley, and so we didn't have it. What we had was eﬀectively a rest-of-state view at our last call. This time we are explicitly pointing out that we are putting a point of view in place for Lower Hudson Valley, since there's no speciﬁc price targets out there. We'll go back to a market view once that develops."
"One question on VY. When you'd made the announcement about the shutdown, you'd said it was expected to be a negligible contribution to 2013 at the bottom line. Firstly, is that still the case? Then, you've given us on EBITDA number for 2014, but with all these and other moving parts, can you comment onto how much is the actual depreciation associated with VY in 2014? What would you are net income type expectation be embedded in these numbers in 2014?","I'll let Drew answer it. Obviously, when you say negligible in 2013, certainly, on an operational basis it is negligible. On an as-reported basis I wouldn't necessarily call the impairment negligible."
"Okay. You'd attributed $0.04 of the $0.25 depreciation delta to VY, but what is the number of refers to the delta?","I don't have the exact depreciation for total VY in front of me, but we can follow up with that oﬀ-line."
"Great. Just on one other topic, if I may? You have in the non-fuel O&M outlook slide, if we're reading this rightly, the 0.5% to 2.5% should be looked at net of the VY cost, ﬁrstly, is that correct?","Yes, what we were trying to point out is, you could take the $145 million of direct costs out of our base year, 2013, and you could still apply the 0.5% to 2.5%       compound annual growth rates to that. That would be a revised view of where we might get to in 2016."
"Okay, so if that holds, though, looking at the slide, you have the step down in the underlying costs? Then yet the CAGR is still up to 2.5% in2016. When you do the math on what looks like a somewhat quantiﬁable step down in 2014 to get to 2.5% growth CAGR for three years compound, by 2016 you'd have to have some much higher percentages than that. What kinds of things could drive you to the high end of that range? Is my question. Or am I missing something on the math?","Yes, I think the big things are pension expenses, could be a big driver. If we were to acquire more assets within the Utility, for example, that certainly adds more O&M expenses, those are the kinds of things that could drive it up. If there are additional regulatory costs, that is something that's certainly grown outside of typical inﬂation growth rates over the last few years. Those are the kind of things that could push it up. Given current expectation, 2.5% is probably on the -- it is on the high side, obviously. I don't think under normal operating conditions we would expect to get all the way back to 2.5%. Those are the kinds of things that we are trying to account for given the uncertainty associated with where the portfolio may go or where pension expenses make go, that kind of thing."
"So, it includes potential for portfolio additions that presumably would have revenues associated with them? At the high-end?","Using, yes, 2.5% is accounting for the possibility of that. That's not to say that that's what we are going out to do right now. It's just within the range."
"But in order for it to be that high, would it require that? Or that -- I'm just not sure how signiﬁcantly to take that as part of this answer?","Well, you are asking what could drive it up there. That is what we were thinking about when we put a number out there like that."
"Okay. Can you just share with us what you are trying to achieve, what your budget, if not much else changed?","You mean outside of the 0.5% to 2.5% growth area? I think that is where we are generally targeting. We are trying to achieve the low end of that range, and in an ideal world we might even beat it. That's where we were comfortable putting out our guidance on 2014 to 2016 CAGR."
"Leo, just catching on your ends of the EWC comments, it seemed like you made note of the idea of maybe trying to ﬁnd some sort of settlement or resolution on Indian Point, given the time horizons of license extension, that sort of stuﬀ. Can you maybe share some color on what the tone or interest is on that? Whether that is something you think can realistically get done in some timely fashion?","Really, Dan, all I'm trying to say is - nothing diﬀerent than what we said before. We really view Indian Point as a high-quality asset, very vital to the region, and certainly provides the majority of the beneﬁts that you would like to see in a power market, in an economic environment. It provides jobs. It provides tax base. It provides reliability to grid. It provides low-cost, clean energy. It provides all the things, from a public- policy standpoint, that you would want. Certainly, we recognize that there are some folks who would like it to not operate to the end of its licensed life and that's certainly not the opinion that we have. We think it's vital, not only today, but it will continue to be a vital part of that market for years to come. We're just acknowledging that we know other people have a diﬀerent point of view. If there is something there that could result in common ground, where we could come up with, as we've talked about before, the certainty equivalent of value and glide path for the market, we'd be willing to do it. But, there's no more emphasis on it than that. It's just something we are willing to explore."
"Okay, got it. On the ITC process with the Commissioner coming out on Friday and saying that a voter decision couldn't presumably happen until January given their scheduling and how that corresponds to a year-end merger agreement date. Would you guys need to formally extend the merger agreement to keep the deal going beyond December? Can you guys function in an at-will basis pending more regulatory action?","Technically, the merger agreement allows either of us to terminate the transaction after December 31. How we will handle going beyond December 31 will be     dependent on seeing the rest of the procedural schedules, seeing what comes out of Arkansas and New Orleans, for example. Then, obviously, something that ITC and us will have to consider, but we are not prepared to go there at the moment."
"First, with regard to the $5.20 at that regulated utilities next year, how do you think about that in the context of your earned ROEs overall? I appreciate that you have pending rate cases et cetera, but generally speaking would you say that you're earning your ROE in at 520? I suppose that was contemplated in your initial 6% growth CAGR?","I will let Theo talk about what's going on at each of the utilities to the extent that he can.      Hey, Julian, this is Theo. Actually, I think the last comment you made probably speaks to the best way to describe and respond to your question. I won't respond speciﬁcally to and what the assumption was, but obviously, the growth assumption in 2014 is consistent with, obviously, all of our other planning assumptions. As you look at 2014 and you see that our growth assumption hits the 6%, you would expect that if your planning assumptions are aligned, then that would produce something that would be relatively within the range of what we would expect to achieve from an earned ROE perspective as it relates to allowed ROEs. With that said, the 2014 rate cases, obviously, don't go in eﬀect at the beginning of the year in their entirety. Some go in eﬀect later in the year. Also, there is still some small element of regulatory lag, obviously, since you ﬁle the cases from the time you ﬁle until the time rates go into eﬀect. Obviously, when you see the 6% growth aspiration in 2014, achieving that, I think we would also say that moves us closer to our goal, obviously, which is to earn our allowed ROEs within the context of utility."
"Great, thank you. With regards to the latest update on guidance, I suppose in the preliminary release suggests that it was towards the midpoint now. Could you talk to what changes occurred in the quarter that led to that decision? I suppose speciﬁcally the district sale appears to be reﬂected in your adjusted EBITDA in 2013. Just perhaps the various walk, if you will, to get to that revised range within the 2013 range?","We didn't change the range, Julien. You're just talking about the fact that we said we should be around the midpoint?"
"I wanted to think a little bit about utility net of parent drag. When you look at the guidance for 2014, I guess you have a $5.20 utility $1.05 of parent drag, that's about $4.15 net? Is that a good clean base to think of a future growth for the core utility business?","Drew?  You are asking about the aﬃliate preferred element to that, Steve?"
"Not necessarily, speciﬁcally. Let me ask the question this way. Your 2013 initial guidance had $4.70 for the utility, $0.50 of parent drag, so a net of $4.20. Even though the Utility's gone up a lot, it's been all absorbed by, in the 2014 guidance, a much bigger parent drag. I just want to think about it moving-forward basis, is this a clean year for utility net of parent from which to really think about growing the Company?","Yes, I don't think -- let me answer this way. Beyond 2014, we should have a pretty good view of our rate cases, as Leo mentioned earlier. That part will come into play. The HCM program should be in full swing, and we are going to try and get a better view of what we can do, maybe even beyond HCM going forward, we're beginning to work on that. Then, a big piece of what the storyline is going to be beyond 2014, is going to be the possibilities with industrial growth at the Utility and whether or not our historical-load growth can actually begin to move at a higher rate than what we've seen, thanks to the industrial renaissance. I think we're going to talk a little bit more about that at EEI when we get there."
