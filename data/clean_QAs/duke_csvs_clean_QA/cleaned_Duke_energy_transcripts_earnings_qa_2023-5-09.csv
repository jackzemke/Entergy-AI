Question,Answer
"Good morning. Just to conﬁrm, the short-term cost cut measures Brian touched on, those are incremental to the $300 million ﬁgure that's out there. Are any of them potentially structural in nature? And I guess, the key question is, where do -- I guess, where do you guys stand within the '23 EPS guidance range under that normal weather assumption for the rest of the year? Are you still kind of comfortable within the range at this juncture?","The answer to that is yes, Shar, and let me talk about the various cost initiatives that are underway. The $300 million that we identiﬁed for last year, I would call largely structural. When we talk about 75% of this being achievable, it's because we're making fundamental changes in the way we're completing work, staﬃng work, prioritizing work, et cetera.  When we talk about the actions we're taking in response to weak weather, I would call those more tactical. This is deferral. This is reducing non-critical work, third-party spend, expenses. Those types of things that we have done so many times as you know. And so the combination of all of these activities, as well as the fact we enter any given year expecting a range of outcomes and establishing contingencies that are planning in case something doesn't work out   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   exactly as planned, we are conﬁdent in reaﬃrming the range of $5.55 to $5.75. And so we'll continue to update you as the year progresses, but we are conﬁdent in reaﬃrming at this point."
"Okay. Perfect. And then just, Lynn, commercial, obviously the commercial sale being in late stage is new language and you obviously took another $175 million charge. This is obviously the second charge to date. Could we maybe just elaborate why the expectations on the sale have come oﬀ more? I mean, what's driving the second revision? Is it capital markets? Is it buyer interest? Just some sense there. And I guess, when can we see something announced? Is it 3Q? Is it closer to year-end? Thanks.","Yes, sure. Appreciate the question. And we are continuing strong progress. We're in the late stages and expect to be able to provide more information shortly on where we are. Given the fact that we have placed the business into discontinued operations, we continue to evaluate whether we have the right recognition of net book value on the ﬁnancial statements and did take an additional impairment charge representing further progression of the process. I would say to you, though, that the estimated value that we see in this process remains within our planning assumptions. So there's nothing here that I would point to as a surprise for us as we've moved through the process.  As we have continued the negotiations, the marketing is complete, we're in discussions with select bidders, and we have made a decision to separate the process involving, for example, two projects that we are a minority owner of and concluded that the natural owner is the majority owner based on discussions and negotiations that progressed.  So you should look at all of this as demonstration that we're nearing the end of the process and we'll be anxious to announce and give you further feedback as soon as that's appropriate."
"Okay, perfect. I appreciate the extra color. Thanks, guys. Have a good morning.","Thank you.     Good morning.  Operator  Thank you. The next question goes to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julian, please go ahead. Your line is open.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Look, Brian, actually. Hey, good morning, Lynn. Brian, I wanted to go back to some of your comments, and you speciﬁcally said credit is at the forefront of many people's minds. In the last question, it was brought up about expectations evolving on the renewable sale here. Just want to be crystal clear about this, I mean especially following the aﬃrmation borrowing any changes in CapEx here, which you obviously do in a fairly annual cadence, can you just elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about the balance sheet it seems like you've got a target here to get back to 14% you talked about the 50 to 75 basis points, but very speciﬁcally here, your comfort level with the plan and the need to address any further equity or equity-like considerations to expedite getting to that long-term target.","Now, thanks, Julian. And, it's the right question, and it is top of mind for us and for investors. Thinking about what was the pressure we felt in 2022, it was really focused on deferred fuel. We under-collected nearly $4 billion of deferred fuel, we also had storm restoration costs of around $0.5 billion. So, the balance sheet were $4.5 billion of cost that we didn't plan for as we moved into 2022.  We're starting to recover that deferred fuel at DEP and at Duke Energy Florida. Duke Energy Carolinas will happen later this year, and we put in chart in the slides to show that balance come oﬀ over the next two years. And as we recover those deferred fuel balances, along with the proceeds of commercial renewables, we feel like the balance sheet is where it needs to be. The target of 14% FFO to debt is the right target with the right cushion to deal with contingencies that come year in and year out, and positions us for no equity through 2027."
"Excellent. Thank you for hitting that clearly and good progress on the fuel. And then separately, Lynn, if you can comment here. I mean, obviously a lot of diﬀerent utility assets moving around, potentially changing hands here. We'd love to hear your thoughts more speciﬁcally therein as you think about the options. You've got obviously a full plate in some respects on a lot of novel angles, especially in the Carolinas here. But can you elaborate at least your latest thinking around perhaps evaluating further assets here?","Julian, I would say our primary focus at Duke is executing what we think is one of the strongest organic growth plans around. As you look at the clean energy transition going on in the Carolinas, Indiana is beginning transition of generation as well with CPCNs coming yet this year. Florida is continuing to deliver strength with not only solar development, but also grid investment from the storm production plan.  So, we feel like we've got just a robust capital plan moving forward and strong jurisdictions. So, our primary focus is on organic growth. As you note though, assets do become available from time to time, we will look at them if they make sense for us, but we'll do so in a disciplined way   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   that maintains a focus on our balance sheet, maintains our focus on growth, maintains a focus on constructive jurisdictions that recognize the right balance between utility health and customer value. And I'll just leave it there."
"Excellent. And then if I could clarify earlier, just super quickly, with respect to the Indiana, obviously, you've got this IRP out there. I'm just curious, A, if that could change your CapEx intra year, and B, if you have any further thoughts about what that could look like here.","It's a really good question, Julien, because we have continued to update the IRP in Indiana. Our core retirement proﬁle remains largely the same, but we are seeing increase in renewables as a result of the IRA. And we're also seeing the impact of MISA's new planning assumptions and how we ought to be addressing that over time. So we are on the verge of CPCN ﬁlings that will include both intermittent and non-intermittent resources. We will update the IRP again in 2024, and continue to evaluate whether we're moving at the right pace around the energy transition.  I would say as we get into the back part of the decade, there probably is more potential in Indiana around that transition, but we'd like to work through this process to get it started in a way that makes sense for customers in the state. So more to come on Indiana. Really pleased with the progress we're making."
"So just on the North Carolina Settlement Agreement, is there any other parties in the case? Are they opposed to it or are they just not taking a position? Where's kind of the other parties, if at all?","Yes. Steve, I would say, we're really pleased with public staﬀ and the industrials, two important parties in the case in Indiana. The Attorney General will be there as well as some of the consumer groups, environmental groups, et cetera. But, we feel like the settlement is very strong with public staﬀ and the industrials. We also have a settlement on the performance incentive mechanisms, allocation and transmission, there are a host of things included. So, we believe it's a demonstration of strong progress, we're on the stand, starting, I guess, May 4, that's last week, and feel like we have a very strong case."
"Okay. Good. And then just in terms of thinking about a lot of the issue North Carolina over the years was just dealing with lag and the multiyear plans kind of helped hopefully deal with lag obviously ROE cap structures still need to be ﬁnalized, but is it fair to say the parts that you agreed upon here are kind of the pieces that would address kind of lag, regulatory lag in North Carolina in this settlement?","I feel like it's a really key step in that direction, Steve, because for the ﬁrst time we have approval of forward capital in a way that gives us some conﬁdence and the construct of the legislation is such that we have an opportunity to adjust price as that capital is spent in a way that way that as you know is really new in the Carolinas and will reduce regulatory lag. So I think starting back with the legislation, we've been making progress toward modernization, and now with the settlement, have approval of that capital or have a settlement around that capital, of course, commissioned to approve in a way that we feel like we're making strong progress."
Okay. Great. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Thank you.     Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question goes to David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. Your line is open."
"Morning. Let's see, I wanted to check in just on the Florida 10-year site plan. I just wanted to conﬁrm whether there could be upside to the CapEx outlook now that you've gotten that ﬁled.","David, I would say we're continuing it with our progress of about 300 megawatts a year. And as we get deeper into the plan, I think we'll consider whether we're moving quickly enough. The multiyear rate plan for Florida runs through '25 -- '24, the team is signaling me here. So eﬀective '25 will kind of reset that expectation in Florida and we'll continue to look at whether we're delivering the right amount of capital and customer value as we go, always focused on not only continuing to develop renewables at a pace, but also delivering value to customers along the way."
Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then also just wanted to follow up on the Carolina's settlement. I was just wondering what your current thoughts are about potentially achieving a settlement at the Duke Energy Carolina's rate case now that you've been successful in getting the partial settlement at Progress?,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   David, I think our posture is always to look for ways to achieve settlement. If you think about the calendar of -- or the procedural calendar of any rate case, typically, parties ﬁle their positions and then you have an opportunity to sit down and discuss. We will, of course, pursue that in the DEC case as we did in this one. And we'll keep you updated as the summer progresses."
"Good morning. Some additional color around the sales trends, I know you commented that when you have the extreme weather, it can distort the weather normalization trends. But maybe just some more color around why you feel better about the trend you saw in March and April.","Brian, do you want to ?     Deﬁnitely. I'll take that, Bill. Thanks for the question. And I want to remind you that Q1 of 2022 was a robust quarter. We had 6% year-over-year growth that quarter, strength in all sectors as we were coming out of the COVID rebound. That was the peak point. And so we're comparing to a high watermark, and volume trends normalized to our expectations over the course of 2022.  And when we looked at this year with extreme weather in January and February, as I mentioned, it's really hard to pinpoint what the true weather normalized volumes are in those situations.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And when we analyzed March and April results, weather was close to normal in both those months, and the volume trends were on track with our expectations for the year. So we do feel like this is bracketed into January and February as far as the weakness. And we feel conﬁdent that our 0.5% load growth in 2023 and the long-term outlook around a 0.5% is right for us because of the customer growth we're seeing at 1.7%, as well as the industrial expansions and economic development activity in our regions."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one other quick follow-up. On the corporate and other, there was a $0.08 pickup year-over-year. I know you cited some investment gains. Can you just provide some color around that?","Yes. Bill, we have investments in beneﬁt trusts and other types of investments like that are captive insurer and market returns go up and down. We obviously had a strong ﬁrst quarter. S&P was up around 8% and that was reﬂected in the market returns in that section."
