Question,Answer
"Yeah. So if we look at the $25 billion, would the $4.9 billion sort of scale proportionately?",So it would not scale exactly proportionate. This is Lee Mazzocchi with the Grid Solutions group. We found that our heaviest concentration of densely vegetated lands that cause outages are really preponderantly in the Carolinas. We do have investments in Florida and the Midwest but they're not quite to the scale and the magnitude of what we're seeing in the Carolinas in the $25 billion.
"Okay. So it's almost 40% of the Carolinas plan, that's what prompted the question.",You would see it less than 40% in the other jurisdictions.
"Okay. And then just conceptually, how are you proposing that that would be socialized? Is it locally to the communities that sort of beneﬁt from it or is that more across the whole system?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Jonathan, we think there is a basis to treat this like any electric plant and service, and treat it as a rate base item. And what we're planning to do or are doing is using data analytics to identify the sections of our service areas that are aﬀected by this, and that then has an implication to lowering our outage and outage costs which we believe all of our customers will beneﬁt from. So it's a long-term investment around the improved reliability of the total system and we believe it brings great customer beneﬁts and, of course, beneﬁts to investors as well."
"That makes sense. Great. Thank you. Other than FERC, what else do you need to move forward on ACP, if anything?","So, Jonathan, there are other permits. Water processing permits, for example, in the states and we are working actively with all of the states to progress those permits on a timeline consistent with the FERC approval. And so we feel like we're on track with the timeline that we've laid out for you."
"Okay. And then if I may. I think last quarter's call, when you sort of hinted that if you execute well on the plan the upper end of the guidance range could be in scope, I think the growth rate is based oﬀ the midpoint of the 2017 guidance. Having had this slower start to 2017, is that still something you think you can get to with cost oﬀsets and the like or that's the case now?","Jonathan, we remain on track. I mean, this is three months of a year against a ﬁve-year plan. The actions that we've identiﬁed for 2017 are really consistent with actions that we've taken when you have variability around weather. And so we've identiﬁed about $100 million and we'll continue executing on that on 2017. And then the investments that will ultimately drive growth are something that'll build over time, and we've given you some visibility on what those look like and where they're located and we're executing on all them."
"Steve mentioned some of $100 million might ﬂow through would be sustainable, I think was the word he used. Can you be sort of more speciﬁc as to what percentage of it?","At this point I think it's pretty immature to get that granular, Jonathan. So when we go after costs, we're always looking for things that can be sustainable but also recognize just ﬂexibility   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   within the year can be helpful. So it's a combination of both. I don't have any more speciﬁcs that I'd share with you at this point."
"Hey. Perhaps just to elaborate a little bit on the last question. On the cost oﬀsets here for the ﬁrst quarter, I think you said about $100 million or so. Does that have any kind of ongoing beneﬁt or is that really kind of a transient phenomenon? I think you suggested the former.","Well I think it will have an ongoing beneﬁt. I think many of these costs are accelerations of the cost eﬃciency eﬀorts that are underway, so I think many of them will be sustainable. It's hard to deﬁne precisely at this point. But I would also discuss and mention last year, in 2016, we came out of the gate with storms and low volumes and we accelerated cost reductions of $100 million. Then when the weather came in the third quarter, we moved some work into 2016. So that type of dexterity can go both ways but, certainly, many of the cost reductions in 2016, and I think many that we're doing in 2017, will be sustainable throughout our ﬁve-year plan. It's hard to be granular at this point given the ﬂexibility that we try to exercise."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Right. So just to be clear about this. This is basically fungible with the wider cost reductions you've been contemplating in the ﬁve-year program, right?","That's certainly part of it. Absolutely.     Julien, what I would add to that is I think this point of cost ﬂexibility is what we want to emphasize with this. So we believe we have the scale and the expertise from the work that we've done over a number of years to be ﬂexible with cost management. And every time we go after cost in a given area we're always working to make it sustainable, and in that event it could be incremental to some of the things we've shared with you previously. But I think the expertise that we're developing around cost management is really fundamental to the business, and we had a good track record of executing."
Got it. Follow-up question here on coal ash if I can. Really just kind of curious. Are your plans at all changed given the shift in what seems like ELGs and CCRs at the federal level? I imagine not but I just wanted to clarify that.,"At this point, our plans are moving forward, Julien, and you can think about at least the North Carolina business is having an implication not only from CCR but from CAMA, the laws in North Carolina. And so we're on track. We don't have any speciﬁc change of plans just to resolve all of these new executive actions."
"Got it. And lastly, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what kind of size of rate increase that we're talking about as a function of the forthcoming cases in North Carolina? Do you have a sense yet and how that might net against cost?","Well on the increase, and maybe get to that second one in a second, Julien. On the increase, we'll share more speciﬁcs when we ﬁle for the increase which will be in about a month for DEP and then there'll be a notice and then a ﬁling for DEC. So we'll, at that time, be in a position to give you more speciﬁcs on the composition of the ﬁling as well as the percentage increase."
Got it. All right. Fair enough. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thanks.     Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Good morning. Hey, I was wondering if you could give kind of an update on legislative initiatives within the Carolinas especially as to how they might be interacting with your presenting of this plan on April 12. Is it all integrated into one kind of public push with legislators to get more riders in place going forward?","So, Mike, we continue to engage with our stakeholders here in the Carolinas about our priorities and, certainly, regulatory modernization that ﬁts the nature of the investments we're planning to make in the delivery system are a part of those discussions, as are renewables and integration of renewables into our system. So it's really early in the legislative session at this point, but there could still be some opportunities in the current session and we'll share milestones when appropriate. And in the backdrop, as you know, of all of these, the rate case ﬁlings that will also occur in 2017 in the Carolinas."
"Right. I guess with 13,900 jobs projected for 10 years, are you getting support from any speciﬁc groups enough for that kind of program or...?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Mike, I think there's a lot of interest in infrastructure investment and job creation. I think that's in the Carolinas as well as around the U.S. And this represents really important infrastructure and gives North Carolina an opportunity to lead the way on infrastructure investment. And I think job creation particularly in the eastern part of the state that has been hampered economically is very attractive. So we believe this plan is a win-win for customers, for investors, and for communities."
Great. And just one last question. Is there any change to load growth guidance at all for electric load growth or even on the gas side?,"No. Our growth assumptions, I think, for our ﬁve-year planning horizon of 0.005%, I think those are still the viable and right place to be at this point in time."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Switching gears. You've made signiﬁcant proposals in the state of North Carolina with regard to how PURPA is being used by solar developers to get contracts for large utility-scale solar. I'm not sure whether the commission has actually made a decision on the things that you've requested be changed in the way that you're forced to sign these types of PURPA contracts. Can you review for people because I think this is a little under the radar for some? What has been going on with regard to PURPA as it relates to solar in North Carolina, what you're asking for to be changed, and where will we stand in that process?","Sure. So, Greg, there are couple of things going on. In the regulatory arena, we made an avoided cost ﬁling which addresses the price, the term, the size of these facilities, and that went to hearing in mid-April. There is, of course, the position of the other parties and the public staﬀ in North Carolina has testimonies that I think would be helpful for investors to take a look at. And really what's being proposed is an opportunity to move this development of renewables and solar in the state into a more sustainable model. So in addition to size and price that we're pursuing on the regulated front, we're also having discussions in the general assembly about the development of a competitive process on an annual basis with a determined size that would give solar developers and also the utility an opportunity to plan. We also think a competitive process would impact price to customers and believe that better planning and better pricing would create a more sustainable market.  And so there are two things to track here, not only the regulatory proceedings, avoided cost, went to hearing in April – that's moving through as procedural process – but also continued discussions in the legislature about sustainable solar development in the state of North Carolina."
"The bottom line is that – and this is me summarizing it, not you -the solar developers have been using PURPA as an opportunity to get above market contracts and you're looking for a process that's more transparent so you can be more comfortable, that you're not burdening your customers with solar contracts that are not economic relative to market. Is that fair?","Greg, I think that's fair. We've done some calculations of the prices implied in these contracts, and we believe it's costing customers about $1 billion more than a market price would cost them over a 12-year period. And this notion of better planning and better pricing, we believe, can create more certainty not only for the solar industry but better pricing for customers, and I think that's important as this market continues to develop."
"Real quickly. On the capital budget for the next few years, you've made a few announcements in just the last few months, even one or two since you reported fourth quarter of 2016. Just curious, any signiﬁcant changes to the capital budget over the next few years? And if so, which jurisdictions?","No signiﬁcant changes, Michael, over the next ﬁve years. Some of the timing may be a bit diﬀerent. But we've got a capital plan, $45 billion to $50 billion over the ﬁve years, and that's where it's going to be at at this point."
"Got it. And then just curious, Lynn. How are you thinking about the opportunities at the renewable business, and how the growth over the next couple of years will look relative to the substantial number of megawatts you added over the last two to three years?","Michael, when we put forward our plans in February there's a shift in the renewable investment more toward regulated investment than commercial, and we think that just makes good sense for not only investors but customers in our jurisdictions. So we have about $2.5 billion in the ﬁve-year plan; about $1.5 billion sits in the jurisdictions and $1 billion in commercial. And so I think we've shared with you that we're looking at that commercial investment very closely. Returns are tight, the tax position is uncertain for us at least over the next couple of years, and we'll continue to make the right decisions about deploying capital in that commercial business as we see returns that ﬁt our expectations.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"And are there opportunities with that renewable business regarding either, potentially, to add more via less on the development side and more via on the acquisition of whole portfolios? Or on the ﬂip side, is your portfolio potentially more valuable and have you assessed that in the hands of, maybe, other parties?","Well, Michael, we continue to look at what we own, its value and contribution as well as what it might command on the outside. So those are ongoing assessments that we do. We feel like we have a really strong portfolio of 3,000 megawatts wind and solar, backed by a long-term contract. And so those are assessments that are ongoing but nothing speciﬁc to share with you today on a strategic analysis or initiative that we're considering."
"Hi. So ﬁrstly on the holding company debt. You continue to have a target of about 35% holdco debt to total debt for 2017. I just wanted to understand. Given tax reform expected to come at least, is there any view that you want to, over time, reduce that number or how are you looking at that? And if there is any goal to reduce it, what levers or tools do you have to bring down that holding company debt over time?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Well, Praful, when you look at our ﬁve-year plan, you do see over the ﬁve years the holding company debt level does decrease. Our credit metrics improve over the ﬁve-year plan. We're still issuing holding company debt because we're growing over that ﬁve-year period but the ratio to total debt does decline. So that's part of our ﬁve-year plan that we've baked in under current tax laws.  Now regarding tax reform, it's hard to say where that's going. Proposals are still in very early stages. It hasn't gotten very far. We'll continue to keep our eye on that and we've been assessing other scenarios and other ways to ﬁnance if that were to change signiﬁcantly. But overall, we feel good about our balance sheet and our ability to deal with the holding company debt."
"Got you. Thanks. And then secondly in terms of the cost saving initiatives. It seems like it's almost dry powder that you used to oﬀset any weather impacts. I wanted to understand if that's a fair characterization, and if it is why not do more? As in, why not do more rather than wait for weather and use it as dry powder? I'm just trying to understand how you kind of think about the cost savings.","Praful, I would suggest that we've been very aggressive on cost savings. If you look at the track record of Duke, we've had ﬂat O&M for a number of years and are projecting ﬂat through 2020. We think that's aggressive and we continue to focus on ways we can drive costs out of the business, and that is our job every day. But what we're talking about here is ﬂexibility as a result of weather where we may make some decisions in a short-term basis in order to oﬀset weather. It could be holding a vacancy, it could be working with a contractor diﬀerently, things of that sort. But you should take away that we understand the assignment of being very aggressive with our cost structure and we are achieving that with initiatives throughout the company."
"Thanks. First question, Lynn or Steve. Can you remind us? When you talk about the 4% to 6% CAGR in earnings, is that fairly linear? Or given the timing of rate cases and rate increase, there is a lumpiness factored into that as well?","Ali, we shared in February that every year we'll be within the range, that we've developed a plan that puts every year within the range. And so I think that's the way I would respond to that question. And we will have rate cases in 2017 that are important to 2018 and we'll give you more update on those milestones as we go forward."
"Okay. And then overall, just remind us, perhaps, on an LTM basis as well what's the current regulatory lag in the system and where within your jurisdictions are you seeing the biggest lag right now?","Ali, we had talked about regulatory lag over the past couple of years, and it'll vary depending upon the timing of base rate cases that we'll see. But we see most of our regulatory lag in the Carolinas jurisdiction where you have recovery mechanisms through riders or decouplings, similar to what we see in our gas business at Piedmont, you have less lag. And we're trying to work to minimize lag through various initiatives in our regulatory jurisdictions. Most of the lag, I would say, is in the Carolinas jurisdictions at this point in time. Again, it's hard to put a speciﬁc number on it in terms of how much it'll pull down in any given year. Speciﬁcally, it'll just depend upon the timing of rate cases."
"Yeah. And, Steve, as you look at that ﬁve-year CapEx plan and the funding of it, when at the earliest should we be thinking about equity coming back into the picture from a funding perspective?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Our ﬁve-year plan contemplates the use of a DRIP starting in 2018 throughout the remainder of the plan, and we estimate that to be in the ballpark of $350 million a year. So that's in our base plan."
"I see, okay. And last question, also remind us. Within the commercial earnings and net income right now, roughly how much of that is recognition of tax credits?","Ali, I would say the majority of the tax credits. If you think about it, it's primarily a renewables business. PTCs are the lion's share of it because our portfolio is primarily wind."
"Still kind of spring winter. Hey, just a couple of very, very quick questions. On the cost savings that you did this quarter, is there like a breakdown? I don't expect you to have it speciﬁcally, but is the majority in a certain jurisdiction or is it kind of across the board?","The delta on the O&M this quarter, Andy, I would think about as being across the board. But the one thing you should note, that ﬁrst quarter of 2016 had a lot of storm restoration in it. That was primarily Carolinas, so the delta over the quarter is being inﬂuenced by that. The $100 million as we go forward over the balance of the year, you can think about that as being across the company."
Okay. But the $100 million is exclusive to the storm restoration change? Is that correct or not?,"That's not correct. So two things I would point to. If you look at our actual versus actual announcements for the ﬁrst quarter, O&M is the positive driver. And that positive driver is   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   primarily the result of the fact that 2016 had storms in it and 2017 doesn't."
"And then you look at, like, PPO kind of decided to ﬁx their balance sheet a little bit because their stock price has been doing well. I guess it's one of the reasons. There are other reasons, too. And the stock actually is up 13.5% this year even though they decided to issue incremental equity. And so I guess what I'm trying to get at is because if I kind of ran the numbers and doing a mid-sized equity oﬀering now would actually help you on your credit metrics – and I'm talking about more of the balance sheet, not your FFO and the debt, obviously – and it would be kind of a one-day type event. Why not kind of go now and try to kind of take down some of that parent debt and issue some equity since, obviously, you have a lot of CapEx? I mean, you understand what I'm getting at. I'm not going to just keep going, but just kind of what's the big thinking of that, with the stock prices so high?","Yeah. Steve may have something to share on this as well, but we are very comfortable with our balance sheet. We believe the portfolio transition and the businesses that we own are very low risk. We have an improving proﬁle in our balance sheet as a result of the strength of this plan. We believe the DRIP is an eﬀective way to issue equity that matches the deployment of capital over time. So we always evaluate ﬁnancing techniques but believe this is the most appropriate one given where we are."
"Have a great Mother's Day, Lynn.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Thank you, Andy.  Operator  And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Well thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your interest in investing in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you over the next several months, and we'll continue to keep you updated on our key milestones. Thanks again for joining.
