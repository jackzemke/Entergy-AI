Question,Answer
"Good morning. Good morning. So then just starting on the Commercial Renewables, it's good to see obviously you guys reiterated '23. Obviously, the range assumed midyear cash in the door, just remind us on the EPS sensitivity per quarter from the delay. And I guess, where does this put you within the '23 range?","Shar, we're continuing to target $5.65 and feel very conﬁdent with that, as you can expect, as we entered the year, we had a range of expectations around both timing and proceeds from the sale. And what I see now is being kind of a modest delay from midyear to later in the year. I don't see an impact.  I think it's important to recognize that the growth is primarily driven by our regulated outcomes and the cost mitigation that's oﬀsetting some of the external headwinds and those are on track, as we expected and shared with you third quarter, so conﬁdent of the $5.65."
"Got it. And then just a follow-up. I know, obviously, the $1.3 billion charge you took for commercial, you're obviously not the only utility that's done this, we had a peer, took a charge yesterday, is there anything to read on the ultimate sale price for the assets, I mean, obviously we noticed the word robust quote-unquote fell oﬀ the slides, I guess, how do we take that charge relative to the ultimate sale price?","Yeah, Shar, I appreciate the question. I also appreciate how closely you all read the slides. We weren't intending to signal anything with the word robust. We feel good about the process,   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   there is strong interest in the portfolio and we're moving forward. I think the thing to recognize on an impairment charge, it's just an accounting adjustment that's really driven by the earnings proﬁle of renewables, where a lot of the proﬁts, it's in the early part of the life, even depreciated over a longer period of time. So when you make a decision to exit before the end of the useful life, you've kind of set yourself up for an impairment. So I would look at it that way.  The takeaway is the strategic decision around exit remains unchanged and we are on track for proceeds later this year."
"The prior plan had at 14% FFO-to-debt over ﬁve years. And now you guys kind of state quote- unquote over the long-term, '23 target is 13% to 14% from obviously, the deferred fuel balances and 13% is a downgrade threshold. I guess, can you just talk on how the rating agencies are treating these deferred fuel balances and how you're thinking about future balances, I mean could another event trigger a downgrade as we're thinking about the balance sheet capacity? Thank you.","No, you deﬁnitely hit that, Shar, and thanks for the question. We are working through the deferred fuel balances through the regulatory mechanisms in place, and that's what the agencies are looking for, looking to see are you ﬁling in-line with the regulatory recovery that is established, or are you making exceptions and spreading that recovery longer. We've had really good success so far in North Carolina and South Carolina, and we have a couple more ﬁlings in front of us both in Florida and Duke Energy Carolinas, North Carolina. But these are -- these are working the regulators understand our need to recover this in a timely manner from a credit position and the rating agencies are liking what they're seeing -- are liking what they're seeing and how we're executing these plans in accordance with the tools in place.     And Shar, the only thing I would add to that is, we look at this and the agencies look at this as a temporary issue because you can associate it completely with the deferred fuel. And the fact that we have been able to work constructively through recovery mechanisms, and we can actually forecast how that balance is going to decline over '23 into '24, it gives us a lot of conﬁdence on the metrics. And of course, as you would expect, we're in conversations with the rating agencies every step of the way.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   This regulated portfolio that we have with the cash ﬂows and constructive jurisdictions is really what underpins the credit ratings of the Company, and nothing has changed around that risk proﬁle."
"Terriﬁc. Thank you, guys. Very comprehensive. Appreciate it. See you soon.","Thank you.     Thank you, Shar.  Operator  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. You may proceed."
"Just following -- Hey, Lynn. Thank you. So just with respect to the carbon plan here and obviously, the development's late in the year, you guys -- you addressed it in part in the comments, but I'm just sort of curious as you think about addressing some of the follow-up items here through the course of this year, again, what is the ﬂex in the capital plan, what exactly are you assuming today in some of the updates in the multiyear outlook? And speciﬁcally, as we've talked about before, how could the subsequent updates here impact probably more of the '24 outlook, as you think about puts and takes in the CapEx budget? What could come out of this next year[ph]?","Sure. Thanks, Julien for that. I regard carbon plan order is a very constructive one, that is giving us real clarity on the near-term investments. So when you think about 3,100 megawatts of solar, 1,600 megawatts of battery storage, that capital plan, it's pretty well locked-in for the Carolinas. We may see some marginal changes, but I would think about those later in the ﬁve-year period and really in connection with the next update. So I feel really good about the Carolinas.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Florida is also on track with the 10-year site plan in SPP and grid modernization. I think where we have potential and even potential upside is in Indiana, where we are earlier in the clean- energy transition moving through that process. We have estimates in the capital plan, but we'll be ﬁling for CPC later this year and have more advanced dialog about timing and approach.  So I'm very comfortable with the capital plan and if anything, see a bit of upside in Indiana as we continue our clean-energy transition."
"Got it. Actually, since you mentioned it, just to probe a little bit, you said a moment ago, you assume a certain baseline in Indiana already in the latest plan. But as I heard you say a second ago, you were saying that there is more likely than not upside bias within it, but you have assumes something in Indiana?","Yeah, we have an estimate. That's exactly, right. We put an estimate in there Julien, but we're ﬁling an updated IRP later this month in March, then we're ﬁling for CPCN. So that will crystallize more speciﬁcally towards the end of this year, into 2024, much in the way that the Carolinas has matured, as we go through IRP ﬁlings.  Now we have an order on the carbon plan. So that's the way I would characterize it. And if anything, I would say our estimate has been on the conservative side."
"Got it. All right, excellent. And then any developments or any thoughts around South Carolina here, as you think about the opportunities that may exist there. I know obviously, carbon plan 03 04 principally, we think about North Carolina here, any crystallization of a further alignment here in South Carolina, if I can call it that at all?","Well, it's a good question, Julien. I guess I'd like to step back and just point for a moment to a very constructive and comprehensive settlement that we were able to reach on the South Carolina rate case. I think that's an indication of just the incredible work that we have been doing with the state, with stakeholders to continue constructive dialog about where the Company is going and what we're trying to accomplish. And I appreciate your sensitivity on the word alignment because what we are trying to accomplish is giving both states the ﬂexibility to put their ﬁngerprints on an energy plan going forward.  And we believe we're making progress on this. We actually had testimony in the carbon plan that laid out a structure that would allow states to opt-in or opt-out depending on their energy policy. And that is beginning to take some discussion in South Carolina, but that will progress over time. We believe we operate an incredibly valuable system and we will work with both states on how to add resources to meet their needs, customer and policy needs going-forward.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hi. So. Just a follow-up question on the commercial renewables impairment. I think you announced it was for-sale in the Q3 call, so is there a reason the impairment was not taken then and is being taken now? Is that because you have more information, is that something else?","So Steve, we actually made the decision, ﬁnal decision to sell in early November and announced it on the third quarter call. So that decision went through a governance process, Board approval, etc, in the fourth quarter. And as a result, the impairment goes in the fourth quarter."
"Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And but it does sound like the impairment, the value that you have on now is consistent with the ranges that you've been expecting for the sale process.","That's exactly -- within our planning range, absolutely.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"And then my other -- okay, thanks. My other question is on the rate cases in North Carolina, under the new law and the new multiyear rate plan. How are you thinking about whether you'd be able to settle those cases or that they likely need to, because of the kind of the ﬁrst under the law, need to go through a fall, litigated process, most likely -- it's likely?","You see, I think it's too early to tell exactly. And you may, if you think back on our history, we have from time-to-time entered into partial settlements, where you feel like there are elements of the case that can be agreed and then there are others that the parties believe it ought to be put in front of the Commission. You should know, we'll explore discussions with all intervening parties through this process. And as we get closer to dates when testimony is ready to be heard and testimonies are ﬁled by all the parties, we'll begin those discussions, but it's too early to tell the shape that it will take."
"Just on that toughness of cost management, could you give your latest level of conﬁdence in hitting the $300 million this year, what you're seeing in the backdrop in terms of it becoming more challenging easing up of any of those inﬂationary pressures this year so far?","That's a good question, David. This is Brian. When we looked at the opportunities across the board last year, to really position 2023 in a good spot, we identiﬁed areas in our corporate costs and business support, that we felt like we could really align service levels with work prioritization. And we did that across the board, a good example is in IT, we have about 1,300 IT systems, well not all are mission-critical, and don't need to be -- have the same level of support as others. So we really stratiﬁed our support levels and we did that across IT, HR, legal, ﬁnance, we looked at across the corporate areas and found really structural opportunities that will remain for the long-term. And that's why we feel like a lot of the 75% of the $300 million is sustainable.  And another area that was also very important to the cost reductions was our real estate footprint. In Uptown Charlotte, we're moving from four buildings into one new tower that's reducing service costs on those assets as well as lease costs and depreciation. So inﬂationary   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   pressures are not impacting our ability to hit that $300 million target. We've contemplated inﬂation in certain pockets in the portfolio, as we look into the spend in 2023 in our planning horizon and feel good about the $5.65 target we have."
"Okay. Understood. Thanks, that's helpful. And then, I was wondering if you could just talk to -- what gave you the conﬁdence in knocking up the CapEx plan for the '23 to '27 period? But then also on the rate base outlook, it looks like the 2027 rate base forecast had -- had ticked up a decent amount versus the prior expectations, I'm wondering if there any other drivers behind that too?","David. As we come to capital planning every year, we take into account where we are with regulatory approval, where we are with integrated resource plans, etc. And so, we have seen an increase in transmission and distribution investments. If you look at the carbon plan in particular, there is transmission that's been approved in order to open up more potential for renewables. And as we get-out into '26, '27, those numbers also reﬂect what we expect to mature in subsequent IRP updates and subsequent regulatory approvals. So that's how I would answer. I don't know Brian, would you add anything further?     Now, I think as we move deeper into the clean energy transition, we expect the capital plan to increase year-after-year as well. So this is in line with our expectations as we move through the '20s.     Well, I think that's an important point. As we were talking, I was thinking back to the generation transition day, kind of showing those charts about the 10 years. As we get deeper into the plan, more generation investment begins to show-up, earlier in the plan, more transmission and distribution. So you're beginning to see that and you'll see more of that in '28, '29, '30."
"Hey, good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question and a lot of good questions so far. So. I guess, conceptually, Brian, when you updated this plan in the third quarter, we were kind of at the height of inﬂation, interest cost, gas costs etc. And now, we've obviously seen some of those things roll over here since you've given the 5%-7%.  Does that put you in a better spot in the range now, given that dynamic, I'm just thinking long- term through the plan here, any comment that you can give on that?","Yeah, Nick. It is a good question around long-term growth rate. And we feel good about our 5% to 7% growth. And we have a lot of things to ﬁgure out. I mean, interest rates have moderated to some degree, but they're still moving up, the Fed's still moving bit, fuel costs have been on the downward trend and we -- that's really good for our customers, but they can move up just as fast as they did in 2022. So right now we're sticking to the 5% to 7% growth range and not signaling inside it anymore.     I think the commodity prices coming down, Nick, is a real positive for customers because you think about, we still have deferred fuel to collect. But our estimates for cost of fuel in 2023 is coming oﬀ and that's a good thing. So we're pleased to see that it's good for customers, that also takes a little pressure oﬀ of interest and ﬁnancing. So we'll continue to take advantage of every bit of that."
"Hey thanks. I appreciate that. And to your point on the deferred fuel, 80 bps hit to the FFO and the '23 timeframe here, and I acknowledge, you have a path 04 05 to get back to the 14% long- term. I guess my question is, do you see suﬃcient headroom in your metrics at this point for unforeseen events, like storms and just how should we kind of think about the ability for the current plan to just handle any more kind of transient credit hits here?","We feel very comfortable, the fact that we've absorbed $4 billion of deferred fuel and $0.5 billion of hurricanes in 2022 alone, I think is a strong testament to where we are, our scale, our ability to manage resources, etc. So we feel comfortable with it. We care deeply about maintaining these credit ratings. We think they are important and at the right level for the degree of risk in the business. But this is an opportunity that presents itself with the size and   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   scale of our Company, where we can manage our way through blips of this type. More than a blip, actually, it's $4 billion.     Huge.     Thank you."
"I just wanted to round out the commercial renewables conversation a little bit, if I could. If there is any additional color you could provide on the sale, such as where book value stands right now, portfolio tax equity position, asset levels debt, just trying to piece together more on our side. Appreciate that it's a sensitive time, given that you're selling the assets, I'm wondering if you could share any more details, particularly as it relates to book value?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   No, and you know, Jeremy, let me comment on -- we feel good about the process, a strong interest in the portfolio, we're not going to talk any more speciﬁcally around valuation. I hope you can appreciate that, given where we are in the process. And I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to --?     Yes, Jeremy, we referenced a $3 billion book value, excluding the tax attributes midyear. And we had some projects we continue to invest in for the balance of the year, and then took the $1.3 million right down at the end of the year. So you can kind of walk it down that way if you want to think about book value."
"Got it that's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just want to kind of pivot a little bit Duke is involved with a number of emerging technology partnerships, including Honeywell battery, battery tech (inaudible) hydrogen pilot. Just wondering which technology here you're most excited about and if you were going to move forward. 10, 20 years down the road, which one do you think is a larger part in the Duke portfolio?","Jeremy, it's a really good question. It's a really good question. And one of the reasons we are involved in so many diﬀerent things is the obstacles for full-scale adoption has a lot to do with which technology can reach commercial scale with a supply chain that will support how much of it we need. I think about our (inaudible) Climate Report through 2050 has us in need of somewhere between 10,000 MW and 15,000 MW of what we call zero-emitting load-following resources, kind of in that late '30, '40 range. So that could be hydrogen, it could be small modular reactors. It could be CCUS, it could be longer duration storage.  So, the key being, again, we're not going to invest until they are aﬀordable for our customers and we can invest at the commercial scale necessary to make a diﬀerence. The small modular reactor is something we're spending time on, and you would expect us to, we are the largest regulated nuclear operator in the US. Sitting in a part of the world that embraces nuclear as part of the solution. But we also joined with a collection of Southeastern utilities to pursue a hydrogen hub, because without that carbon-free generation and all the solar, we're going to have in this area, we think that's something worth investing in, really as part of maintaining and preserving the natural gas infrastructure that has been so important to this region.  So, I know it's a, it's a around about answer to the question, but we're not ready to put our ﬁnger on any speciﬁc technology as the solution, but we are advancing our work, piloting, advising, working as actively as we can to make sure these technologies are developing at pace. So that when we do need them and are ready to invest, there will be something that makes sense for our customers."
Got it that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.
"Good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Brian. Just all my other questions have been answered. If I may, I just had a quick clariﬁcation on the tax leakage portion of the commercial renewables sale, Brian. Does -- so the message on the Q3 call was tax leakage is manageable, given your other tax losses, I'm thinking about with this write-down, does that impact your sort of tax spaces and are you still saying -- or is the message still that the tax leakage is manageable or does that -- does the impairment charge change that dynamic?","Yeah, there's no change to the tax position or tax basis as a result of this impairment charge, no no change in the message, we can manage it."
