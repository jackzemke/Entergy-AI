Question,Answer
"So just touching on the grid mode, the $3 billion proposal in South Carolina, is this kind of incremental to plan? Is there any status on the $13 billion opportunity in North Carolina, maybe just from a legislative standpoint and when you roll in this $16 billion in potential opportunities, how does that sort of ﬁt in with your 4% to 6%?","You know, Shar, we have included in the plan we shared with you in February, grid investment that is generally consistent with these programs that we're talking about. We'll of course ﬁne- tune those in February when we give you an update on the ﬁve-year plan. And the approach that we've taken, both in North and South Carolina is to complete the economic impact studies for the beneﬁts of these investments, also customer beneﬁts that will be delivered directly. And we're in the process of discussions with stakeholders throughout both states on what this investment potential could mean. We have a couple of Pow/Fs on recovery, which we've talked about. Of course our ultimate goal is modernization of the regulatory framework in North Carolina to allow more timely recovery of these types of investments. But in parallel, we're also pursuing recovery of grid investment in our rate case for Duke Energy Carolinas. We'll pursue a similar path in South Carolina, probably approaching ﬁrst through the regulatory process and determining whether anything further is required. So I think this represents you know just further underpinning of the growth that we've laid out for you and why we have conﬁdence in our ability to deliver at 4% to 6% reaching to the higher end of the range as these investments continue to grow and accumulate."
"Okay, higher in the range. Okay, that's helpful. And then Lynn, you've addressed this publicly in the past, but I'm going to put you on the spot anyway because I know it's been on investors' minds. Is there any interest in the South Carolina nuclear plant or even expanding your footprint in the state, especially since you already very active there from an economic development standpoint, if you could just address this dead on, if you could?","Sure. You know, Shar, we have no interest in the new nuclear plant in South Carolina and we've been clear about that. Given the risks and the uncertainties around completion of that plant, we don't think there is a ﬁt either for customers or investors and we've been very candid with the state about that. As you indicate, South Carolina is incredibly important to Duke Energy. We operate important businesses and important assets in the state. We are announcing today our willingness to invest another $3 billion. So we are continuing to operate well within the state, we're engaged in supporting our businesses in a way you would expect, but no interest in pursuing new nuclear."
I wanted to just touch base on coal ash spend and wondered if you could remind us in terms of the precedent with Dominion in the state and just your position on the treatment just as a refresher in terms of where we stand on your point of view on recovery of coal ash spend?,"Sure. Stephen, let me take the Dominion question ﬁrst. There is a precedent in the state of North Carolina for recovery of coal ash in the Dominion case with return of a known [ph]. And similarly in South Carolina in our own case, we received recovery of coal ash in return of a known [ph]. As you know, this is an important topic in the North Carolina cases and we are in the process of reviewing the arguments that were presented by public staﬀ and the intervenors and we'll be responding to those very comprehensively with our rebuttal testimony on Monday. We believe that these costs are squarely within the law, they represent environmental compliance costs, and we have pursued our approach around closure of basins and around the science and engineering necessary to support compliance with the federal and state law in a very appropriate, aggressive way with science and engineering underpinning our decisions every step of the way. We believe we have a very strong case that will put forward on cost recovery for ash."
"That's helpful. And when you think about the period of time over which you do recover the costs, you know, as you show in one of your charts, coal ash is a very signiﬁcant portion of the revenue request. Is there a potential to think about a longer time period over which to have these signiﬁcant costs spread just as we're sensitive to thinking about overall customer bill impacts or are there natural limits around thinking about duration?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Stephen, I think there's an opportunity to look at methods of recovery. If you look at our ﬁling position, we put forward a couple of ideas for consideration by the commission. There is a traditional deferral and amortization for costs incurred today and we proposed recovery of those over a ﬁve-year period. And then we also proposed a run rate, which would be to say, including a certain amount in customer rates on a current basis kind of matching the spend, which results in a lower overall cost because it's without a return, right? It's as you'd spend it. We think that provides a fertile opportunity for discussion about what makes sense to customers and that will be a part of this case as you know. But ﬂexibility around timing always is an opportunity."
"Understood. And then just shifting gears over to tax reform, I know we're all trying to very quickly absorb a lot of information in a short amount of time. I wondered if you might have any commentary on just the impact on holding company leverage in terms of your read of the proposal as it's laid out. I guess, on my mind, it's just thinking about whether or not that interest is also exempted under the utility exemption that was included or if it's not exempted, if you could include the EBITDA from the utility businesses themselves because they themselves are exempted. I just, I'm a little confused honestly in terms of thinking through the Holdco level impacts, I was curious if you had any sort of preliminary thoughts on that.","Yes. Stephen, you're raising a question that we're looking very closely at and we are evaluating, reading it closely not only at Duke, but as an industry. I think it's important to recognize that this was a positive step. And I think there is clear recognition in the language of the capital we spend, the impact to customers, the importance of interest, forgoing capital expensing normalization, excess deferred taxes or transitions in an appropriate way. And so, when we look at the holding company, the area that we're focused on is this allocation to a trade or business and a regulated utility and we'll be looking very closely at that. We believe -- and we will also be engaged in discussions around intent and clariﬁcation and will be closely pursuing that over the next several days and coming weeks. But I think the important thing is there is a clear recognition of our industry in this framework, the importance to infrastructure economic development and we believe there could be a path forward on this."
"That I fully agree, it was a helpful overall result for the industry. So thank you very much.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Good morning. Just to be clear, the $3 billion grid modernization plan for South Carolina, is that -- that's incremental to the previously disclosed $13 billion power/forward plan or is that part of it?","That's really part of the overall grid plan that we've got in our ﬁve-year planning.     But it's incremental to the 13 million, Michael, because 13 million was North Carolina.     Just North Carolina."
Got you. So but it's not added into the $37 billion CapEx plan that's what you're saying. right?,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   That's correct, that's part of all of our total cap growth capital in our ﬁve-year plan."
"Got you. And given that there's -- the no settlement in the DEP case at this point in the process, do you think it's more likely than not that the North Carolina cases are fully litigated rather than settled, and how would you characterize that?","You know Michael, we can't comment at this point on whether we're engaged in settlement discussions or whether we will be engaged in settlement discussions. We are in a tight and important time period over the next couple of weeks. What we can talk about is rebuttal testimony on Monday, on November 6. I think that will give you a very clear view of our response to the arguments that have been put forward. And then the hearing is scheduled for November 20."
"Hi Lynn, thank you. Just to clarify, so I think you just answered the 3 billion South Carolina plan is in your capital plan and 4% to 6% growth rate?","That's correct.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Yes, that's correct."
"Okay, great. And then, I think you also had a plan that you've at least talked about for North Carolina in terms of grid modernization and where does that stand and is that in your capital plan too or is it kind of same thing, it's part of the mix of diﬀerent options?","It's in the plan, Steve, in the same way I just described for South Carolina and we are pursuing it on a couple of courses, right, the legislative initiatives that we've talked about, it's also the DECPs is also in our Duke Energy Carolinas case, which we'll proceed in early 2018. So we'll continue to update as we go. We're obviously looking for ways that we can continue to accelerate that investment for the beneﬁt of our customers and achieve the appropriate regulatory outcome."
"Okay. One clariﬁcation and also what is the renewables impairments, the adjustment that you made, what assets did you impair there?","Yes. The impairment was of some wind farms in West Texas, the Ocotillo Wind Farm that had been acquired quite a while ago, roughly 10 years ago and as we look forward, we see a lot of exploration of the PTCs because these are older facilities and those are uncontracted asset selling into the merchant market and some of those prices are projected to be pretty low. So those factors led to the impairment of those assets. Most of our facilities are renewable facilities are contracted with third-party oﬀtakers. This is one of our earlier ones that was not."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay, great. Thank you.",Thank you to you.  Operator  And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hey Lynn. Just curious how you're thinking about once ACP comes online, so think in two years from now in South Carolina, whether there is a need to have new gas midstream infrastructure in the state, especially since it seems that with new nuclear plants now not moving forward in that state, you're likely to see an uptick in gas-ﬁred generation burn?","You know, Michael, I believe there's a keen interest on the part of South Carolina for expanded and continued investment in gas infrastructure for the reasons that you talked about. You know, our focus obviously is on the project as its deﬁned and constituted today. So it's been on, we're pleased with the FERC approval, we're moving forward with state approvals. But as the construction progresses, we'll of course be looking for ways that we can continue to deliver value to customers in the states in which we operate."
"Got it. So you're not seeing, and I want to make sure I kind of understand what you're kind of saying there. You're not necessarily seeing an immediate need, meaning 2020 to 2025 timeframe to have new midstream, sizable new midstream into South Carolina yet?","I'm just not prepared to give you speciﬁc timing, Michael. So the timing that you talk about is certainly within our planning horizon. We want to get ACP in ﬁrst, which is late 2019. So we'll talk more speciﬁcally about expansion opportunities as time progresses here. So I wouldn't read anything into when or where it falls in that timeframe, but we do believe that additional infrastructure could be important to our customers into the states in which we operate.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Got it. In coming to the Carolinas on the electric grid modernization program, both in North Carolina and South Carolina, do you need legislation to get trackers or kind of more real-time recovery or is that in your view something that each of the two commissions could do without actually having to get new legislation?","Michael, I believe the commissions could provide tracking recovery in both States for this type of investment. And you see us making a request for that in the Duke Energy Carolinas case. I would also say that the commission will give us feedback on that and if they believe additional clariﬁcation is required to the legislature, we could certainly pursue it there as well. So I think this is something that remains an ongoing topic of discussion for Duke as we think about modernizing our system and delivering value to customers. We're engaged with stakeholders, we're talking about the beneﬁts that this brings and we'll just continue to progress it. We see it as a terriﬁc not only opportunity for customers, but obviously investors as well."
"Got it. Last item, O&M management. In terms of thinking about any synergies that might have existed as part of the Piedmont acquisition or just in general about being able to manage, to keep O&M either ﬂat or even make it decline, where do you see the greatest opportunities within the organization over the next two to three years to manage O&M?","You know, Michael, we certainly have recognized some synergies with the Piedmont merger in fact in excess of what we'd originally projected. Most of those are in corporate type functions. I think as we look forward over the next few years, there is a lot of opportunities for synergies, particularly in the distribution area as we roll out some of these grid investments that we've been talking about, smart meters will displace the need for meter readers, technology along the grid will allow us to know how equipment is performing and help us optimize around maintenance activities. Those are examples of things to come. We have already seen great success in the generation areas around fossil and nuclear eﬃciencies. But we've got a lot of good functions that will continue to drive eﬀorts in the eﬃciency areas."
"Clearly I'm not a congressman nor am i a legal expert on these issues. But in reading the House Ways and Means Committee summary of the initial plan, it indicated that the interest deduction will be little bit limited to the equivalent of 30% of any company's pretax income at the ﬁler level? And so, from my perspective, it would seem that, I mean, there aren't any utilities that I do research on that have, they even come close to that hurdle including you, so it would seem to me that this based on that interpretation, you would in fact have interest deductibility on your parent debt. Are you just allowed to make an opinion on that or you don't think that I'm reading it clearly?","You know Greg, I think the clarifying question there or clarifying point there is, who is the ﬁler, is it the individual taxpayers or is it an aﬃliated group and consolidated group. And I think depending on that interpretation in the corporate structure of any utility that will have a bearing. What we believe is that the combination of that allocation of interest to trades or businesses that are regulated coupled with the 30% in the structure that we have in front of us, we believe we've got a framework here that we can work with. But as you know, it's 24 hours, everyone's reading every word, everyone's looking at all the interpretations, we're meeting with the industry. And I think the early read is, we see a lot of positive recognition of our industry. But we want to continue to make sure that we've got the appropriate interpretation and see if any clariﬁcation is necessary as this bill progresses."
"Okay. That's fair, thank you. Have a great day.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)",Thank you.     Thanks.  Operator  And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank America-Merrill Lynch.
"So perhaps just to follow a little bit up on the South Carolina program, can you elaborate a little bit on the regulatory recovery thought process here just in terms of the cadence perhaps of future rate cases? Should you pursue the full 3 billion, how does that change versus what you previously articulated, if at all, just be very clear about this?","Yeah, so Julien, you may recall, we ﬁled South Carolina Duke Energy Progress case recently. So we'll be evaluating capital investment to prepare that utility to go back in and then we're evaluating timing on Duke Energy Carolinas, South Carolina and also looking at our investment plan to catch that case at the right time. That we are -- we always are ﬁne-tuning the regulatory calendar. It may move up, it may move back. But what we're trying to communicate today as we seek grid investment is an important part of growth in those utilities and we'll be pursuing timely recovery."
"Got it. So would you say that barring any novel trackers whether approved by the commission or more likely approved by the commission or legislative, would you expect to be ﬁling cases on a semi-regular basis in order to ensure kind of earned or near earned ROEs?",Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  I think that's fair.
"Okay, excellent. And then maybe to just follow a little bit up on the gas side, obviously, I think at times you kind of characterize the company as keen or more keen to look towards gas into the future than perhaps electric. I don't to put words in your mouth. How are you thinking about that today In terms of your future, and gas including midstream utility, et cetera?","You know, Julien, we couldn't be more pleased with the integration of the Piedmont system, not only in terms of the business that they bring, but the expertise and the focus on natural gas. And with the position that Duke holds as a company, second largest consumer of natural gas, we see that as a growing opportunity for us. We're also pleased with the Progress and Atlantic Coast Pipeline. I mean that's a $2 billion investment for us and we're anxious to get construction underway later this year. We will continue to look for ways we can leverage our market position and expertise to bring investment into the gas business."
"Got it. All right, excellent, I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much. See you soon.",Thank you.     Okay.  Operator  And we'll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust.
"Good morning. You know Steve, when you look at your full plan, you know, the $37 billion plan for CapEx and as you mentioned you know you've laid out the South Carolina proposal as part of that. As we sit here today, how much of that plan is now visible or out there versus stuﬀ that will eventually come but hasn't yet been put out there, just to get some rough idea of that?","I think the 37 billion has been well vetted here. We have very good ideas on the grid spend in terms of targeted undergrounding, smart meters, storm hardened equipment. When you look at the piece of the 37 billion that's related to generating cleaner energy, we have generation facilities such as Citrus or Lee CCs, we've got our gas growth portion of the planned $6 billion is very well deﬁned between ACP and the Piedmont distribution investments. So I think we have a very high percentage of the plans that we can lay our hands on.     The Florida settlement also Ali lays the path in Florida for both grid and renewables, and household is 5.89 in the Carolinas, also provides a pathway on additional investment around renewables in North Carolina. So all of the steps you see us taking in 2017 are underpinning conﬁdence in those capital investment plans. They are transparent, they are clear and understandable, and they are projects that we have expertise to deliver."
"Okay. And then thinking about the 4% to 6% growth rate, you obviously have two big rate cases right now, and we should get clarity on that fairly soon. So, just given the timing of the rate cases, does that cause the earnings road to be lumpy, perhaps more front end loaded or are you thinking of it more straight line, how are you thinking about this 2017 to 2021 period?","Ali, when we talked about guidance this year, we were clear that the plan we've put in front of you, gives us the ability to be within the range every year and that was really in response to that question about, will you fall outside of the range because of general rate cases et cetera. The plan we put in front of you puts us squarely within the range every year. And so, that's what we're executing to and as you know, we'll give you a forward update on the speciﬁcs around 2018 and reﬁnement of the capital in February."
"Right. And last question, Steve, you mentioned the eﬀective tax rate to think about is 31% to 32% for the year. Is that a good number to think about as we model future years or what should we think about future tax rate?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   For that, again we'll be rolling out our tax assumptions in February for upcoming ﬁve-year plan. But we've got to think about tax reform that's going on right now and assimilate where that's at. Certainly this year, we've done some good work around tax optimization to bring in some tax savings that have lowered the eﬀective tax rate a bit for us. But too hard to predict in the future given what's going on right now. We'll be working on that and rolling that out in February."
"Good morning, guys. I just wanted to ask two quick questions, the ﬁrst on coal ash. Hypothetically speaking, let's say that you are unable to get recovery that you guys feel you deserve there ultimately. What kind of leeway on spending do you have going forward, given the fact that you have kind of the lion share to go and you have the law that you have to comply with?","Well, Chris, we'll comply with the law. We have stayed in federal requirements, CAMA North Carolina, CCR in the Carolinas and then throughout our service territories. So, that's what we are, we'll comply with all of those requirements and we will aggressively pursue recovery and we'll have more to say about that of course, as we work through these rate cases. There are court appeals and other avenues we could pursue, if we think that's appropriate. We believe we have a very strong case."
"I know there is multiple categorizations of the ash ponds and timing associated with each one of those, but is there a leeway on timing in addition to what you just described?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   You were probably thinking about the risk rating in North Carolina, Chris. So we have certain sites that are due by the 2019, 2024, 2029. There are also timeframes within CCR. So, you may have ﬂexibility within a year or so depending on how you ramp up the activity. But when you look at the project overall, the team is doing an outstanding job of balancing the compliance requirements with the spending in a way that minimizes costs to the extent we can, but of course complying with the laws, we always will."
"Okay. And then my second question is on the renewable segment. I think the impairment this quarter was excluded from your adjusted EPS. So if we just look at the adjusted number year-to- date, it looks like maybe you are falling a little bit short of plan. I think that segment last year also was not quite where you had originally wanted it to be. Anything we should be aware of there versus your expectations?","No, you know Chris, the other thing I'd point to is, we've had weak wind resources in 2017, which has had an impact on results year-to-date. So we're continuing to operate the assets well, there will be weather variability and there will be some variability around timing of projects, particularly those that are impacted by ITC. But nothing additional that I'd share with you from a strategic point of view on that segment."
"Hi guys, thanks so much. So if possible, can we go back to tax reform for one minute. Just wanted to understand on the holding company debt and the interest deductibility on that debt, is it possible from the read that holding company would be treated as a separate tax ﬁler relative to the utilities, in which case, obviously the utility holding company has no income and purely just an interest expense if that was the scenario. Can that scenario play out or do you think that's not realistic?","No. You know Praful, we do have certain of our utilities ﬂowing up into the taxpayer called Duke Energy Corporation, just the way we are structured. And so, I think there are couple of avenues   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   we're looking at. This allocation to trader business, regulated utility and then of course the 30% tax. So we believe we see a path here, but it's 24 hours. We want to take the time to understand, get the clariﬁcation, but I think the progress that we've made on and the recognition of our industry is something that should not be overlooked."
"Fair enough. And then secondly on the Duke Energy Progress, the response from the staﬀ obviously was quite conservative in terms of the rate increase versus what you've asked. You seem pretty conﬁdent that you should be able to get to a good position there. Just any more color on that would be helpful and what if you don't hit let's say you get 50% of the ask, what does that mean for growth and 4% to 6% growth as well?","So Praful, would point again to this rebuttal testimony that we're ﬁling on November 6. We disagree with the positions that were put forward on ash in particular as well as a number of other items that were highlighted in the testimony. We believe they're not supported by precedent or the law and we'll make those positions very clear. We are open to settlement discussions. We cannot comment on whether we are engaged or will be engaged in those discussions, but the process needs to play out over the next couple of weeks. Hearing is of course on the 20th, and I think the potential implication to the ﬁnancial results, we'll share with you when we have more information to share and I think this is just a process that's going to need to unfold, not only in the next couple of weeks, but of course, the commission order is not expected until early 2018."
Got it. Thanks so much guys and look forward to catching up with you guys.,"Thank you.  Operator  And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Great, thank you and thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EI and continuing discussion. So, thanks again for your time this morning.
