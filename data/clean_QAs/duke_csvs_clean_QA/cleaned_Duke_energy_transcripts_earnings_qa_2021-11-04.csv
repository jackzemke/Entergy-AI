Question,Answer
"So Lynn, just couple of questions on 951. And it's -- Obviously, it's good. It ﬁnally got done and the pipe part is in way. Obviously,'22 is going to be busy and you do have some good amount of what to chop, though it's a really good framework. Remind us on next steps, especially as we're thinking about the rule making, securitization and the carbon reduction plan.","Sure, Shar, thank you. And we're pleased that the leaders of the State came together in this bipartisan way to provide the framework that we're going to be talking about. And in many ways, it's the culmination of the process we've discussed with you over the last several years as we've worked toward this clean energy transition.  The next step, which is already underway, is rule making around the performance-based rate- making and securitization. The Commission has outlined a process that should culminate in February for PBR and in April for securitization, and then we would also expect the Commission to establish procedures around the shaping of the carbon reduction plan. That is not yet out, but we would expect it to occur, as you know, the timeline for that is December of 2022.  So, a lot of work will go on as this legislation transitions into the regulatory arena. We will be involved. Of course, stakeholders will be involved. And on the carbon reduction plan, South Carolina will be a very important stakeholder, at the table every step of the way. And so, we'll be anxious to provide updates along the way as we reach those milestones, but feel like this is a very good process to put us on a path to achieve not only our carbon reduction goals, but meaningful investments that will drive returns over this decade and beyond."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. And then Lynn lastly, I want to tease it out a bit of your kind of prepared comments around the growth guide as we're thinking about sort of various drivers at the legislation and how it impacts your plan. You obviously have more regulated renewable opportunities. You should theoretically have less lag and more opportunities to increase and accelerate CapEx as the plan further cements, right? You, obviously, have opportunities around PBRs and sharing mechanisms.  So if you're solidly within your 5% to 7% growth rate without legislation, especially with an improving load backdrop, as Steve clearly highlighted, how can the legislation, I guess, not be accretive to your current guide from an EPS growth standpoint?","Shar, I appreciate the question and I think we should broaden that really beyond the Carolinas to also note the progress that we expect to make in other jurisdictions. We have an important IRP ﬁling coming up in November, end of this month, in Indiana, which will set a pace for the transition. So taking all of those things together, we do see increased capital. And as we open up 2026 and establish a ﬁve-year range, we believe that capital will go to $60 billion to $65 billion.  As we look at the back half of the decade, we had shared $65 billion to $75 billion. We think it's more likely to be in that top half, $70 billion to $75 billion. And so, we do believe we have the potential over time to earn at the top end of our 5% to 7% range -- the top half of that 5% to 7% range. And so, we have some work to do with rulemaking and beginning the execution, but we have a long runway of capital investment and this regulatory modernization will be helpful not only to align investments with beneﬁts to customers, but also to allow us to more eﬀectively put capital to work and deliver returns."
"Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Lynn. See you soon.","Thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley."
"I wanted to just maybe build a little bit on the prior questions. In terms of just federal legislation supporting renewable energy in a number of ways. And both, I guess, I'm thinking speciﬁcally in North Carolina, as well as Indiana. Indiana, to your point, you have a resource ﬁling by the end of this month. And then in North Carolina, though it does feel like the sort of deliberation around the cadence of decarbonization is going to ﬂow well into 2022 and to the extent that this legislation does pass -- does, as you know, it extends support for solar and wind, provides support for storage, how might that impact kind of the thinking not just for you but for other stakeholders in both of those states?","I believe there is a lot of conversation going on, Stephen, in both Indiana and Florida and the Carolinas around the clean energy transition. And that has been building over the last several years. And so, you see increasing opportunities for renewable investment, for storage investment, energy eﬃciency. Demand response investment will be a part of it. In some of our states, also a keen interest in getting a base amount of electric vehicle infrastructure in place. And so, I do believe the momentum is picking up. Of course, all states are watching what's going on at the federal level and the tax incentives, in particular, can be additive to our progress in the states. And so, I see a great deal of alignment between what we are trying to accomplish, where our states are going and the discussions that are underway in Washington."
"That's helpful. And to the extent that we do see this level of support from federal legislation, could that potentially lead to kind of a further acceleration? I wouldn't imagine anytime soon free capital plan, but kind of later in the decade. It's obviously an impressive amount of CapEx that you have, but could this essentially result in an acceleration, or I know that's very tough to predict, but how might that impact your longer-term capital spend levels?","Steve, I certainly think it can result in acceleration. And that gets down to the target and the timeline that's being established, and I know a lot of debate will occur around those two items. Aﬀordability is another factor that we need to keep into the equation and we have aﬀordability, reliability kind of top of mind as we pursue these goals. But I do believe transition of the bulk power system, both generation and grid, is underway with a lot of tailwinds behind it and we are trying to proceed in a way that works for our states, our customers, the economy. But along the way, importantly, it will deliver meaningful investments for our investors. And so, I do see just a long runway of investment opportunity operating and all of these states driven by both state and federal tailwinds.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Very clear. Understood. And then maybe just one other element of the legislation is the -- we're interested in is the minimum tax levels that are in the bill. How might that impact both through your cash ﬂow, customer bill impacts, credit statistics, things like that to the extent that the utility sector doesn't get exempted from that particular provision? What's your sort of latest thinking around the impacts there?","Stephen, because we are 95% regulated, we see the minimum tax is more of a timing issue for us. There could be some cash ﬂow impact, but we would need to look at that within the complexion of all of the elements, the tax incentives and other things. So, we do not see a signiﬁcant bill impact to customers as a result of the way the minimum taxes talked about right now. But as you know, this is a dynamic time and we'll have to see how it ultimately progresses.  Steve, would you add anything to that?     I would agree with that. We would view it as a timing issue. And then there's other provisions there; extension of other credits, direct pay of credits and inclusion of nuclear PTCs that, particularly for Duke, with our nuclear ﬂeet, that help mitigate any impacts of this to customers."
That's a good point. There are other provisions that sort of push in the other direction and provide a beneﬁt. Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.,"Great. Thanks, Stephen.     Great.  Operator  Next, we'll hear from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research."
"Hi. I just wanted to pick up on, you just mentioned the nuclear PTC, Steve. Curious whether you guys have any sense yet how you would derive -- deﬁne the revenues that would sort of interact with the PTC calculation for your regulated mix.","Jonathan, I'll take that. This is a pretty dynamic area and we're yet this morning coming through what came out of the house last night, a couple of thousand pages. We do believe it will apply to regulated nuclear. We do believe that it will apply for a six-year period, but we're anxious to learn more and study this a bit more.  So at this stage of the game, we're talking more about, we believe regulated nuclear is included, but more to come on how all of these elements ﬁt together."
"Okay. And just sort of staying with nuclear. One element of HB 951. I thought what was interesting was that maybe you could have a little extra time, if you're pursuing a small modular, I guess, nuclear project with oﬀshore wind. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about how these types of solutions will be part of what you put forth and what the timeframe might be best guess at the moment on both?","Sure. Jonathan, if you think back to the scenarios that we put forward in the 2020 IRP, there were a couple of scenarios that got to that 70% level. One included oﬀshore wind, the other included advanced nuclear small modular reactor. We do see a need over time to put in some of these next-generation of oﬀshore wind, very mature in Europe, not as much here in the U.S., but these clean-energy technologies. And so, I believe this will be an important discussion as the carbon reduction plan is developed and we will go into that engaging with our regulators, policymakers, the communities to come up with a thoughtful approach on how to incorporate these technologies. And so, I think more to come on that as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape in '22."
"Curious if you can be more speciﬁc about the -- Indeed. Absolutely. I know it's been a long ride. So, we're ﬁnally here. I mean -- To that point though, I mean, when you're thinking about the top half year, the $65 billion to $75 billion, what are the speciﬁc moving pieces that you're thinking about that gets you there. Right? What are the debate points around the 70%? I know you touched earlier about balancing bill headroom against perhaps various other considerations. But if we can talk more tangibly about like diﬀerent scenarios or diﬀerent combinations, if you will, just trying to understand how you get to that upper end, if you will, in terms of the incremental requirement.","Julien, I think the best thing I could point you to at this point is back to the IRPs. And if you look at the volume of solar and storage, the level of coal retirements, the additional resources that would be added to maintain reliability, as you move towards 70% carbon reduction, there are more megawatts. And so, that's what we are looking at. And this will be important as we go through the carbon reduction planning process; Commission, of course, setting that procedural schedule. There'll be a lot of opportunities for discussion, stakeholder in South Carolina at the table. But I would point you back to those IRPs, because I think that's probably the best place to really begin thinking about the magnitude of the transition."
"Got it. And if I understand those IRP scenarios, we -- again, I know that these things are in ﬂux. The two speciﬁc scenarios that got you there; one included a pathway for oﬀshore and the other included SMR. Is it fair right now to think that you're biased in favor of oﬀshore, given what we're seeing already across the space? Or is SMR really kind of one of the key pathways that you're thinking about?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","I would say it's too early to tell. We will not unilaterally make a decision, Julien, on what technology makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate. So, we believe continued discussion and engagement with the regulators, policymakers, communities will be important to this decision. We are evaluating oﬀshore wind. I think you may have noticed, there was a proposed sale notice issued for a lease oﬀ the coast of North Carolina. The Kitty Hawk lease area is also there. So, I would just say it's -- there is more to come here. And as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape, we'll have an opportunity to further the stakeholder discussions to develop the plan that makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate."
"Got it. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. And nothing more speciﬁc yet on the deﬁnitive timeline on IRP for Indiana, in terms of exit from coal et cetera? I know that some of your peers have already kind of made broad statements on that front, but that we've got to wait here. So...","Well, and Julien, I would say it's about three weeks away. So, the ﬁling is November 30th. And as you know, we have been working on reducing the useful life of coal. We did so in connection with the rate cases that were ﬁnalized last year. And we will continue to work on coal retirements diversiﬁcation, adding renewables. So, you can expect to see more at the end of this month on Indiana and we're actively engaged in the stakeholder process there, as this work continues."
"All right. Well, best of luck to the ﬁnal weeks and we'll see you soon.","Thanks so much.     Cheers.     Thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Just wondering, you hit on the SEEM proposal that was approved at FERC. I wonder if you could kind of give a little more color on opportunities that kind of come out of that in terms of your renewables, distribution and your transmission of opportunities?","Ryan, I would think about SEEM as a very customer-focused initiative and we've had a lot of work done with outside parties to look at the potential and we believe annually, customers would save in the range of $40 million to $50 million in the near term and up to $100 million to $150 million over the longer term.  So, we see it as a way that provides greater visibility around the operation of the southeastern grid and gives us the opportunity to integrate more renewables. So, that's how I would think about it here in the near term and we think it represents a great opportunity to continue to mature the renewable investment here in the Southeast."
"Understood. And then, if I could just ask one on thinking, understanding where you get the kind of the full kind of drivers in 2022 on the year-end call. But (inaudible) some of the strong load trends you guys see in this year, and then also your (inaudible) ability to have take O&M out of the business, how you kind of think at this stage on some of those diﬀerent drivers into 2022, as you kind of mentioned it being maybe a bridge year into kind of the capital ramp of 2023 and beyond?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Well, Ryan, I would say we will be within our 5% to 7% growth rate every year over the ﬁve-year period. Steve shared with you in his remarks what we see those drivers being. So, the Florida multiyear rate plan, we've got, of course, load growth and I'm just referencing that Slide, a number of other areas.  So, we'll give you more speciﬁcs on what it means in February, but feel like we've got a very solid plan for 2022.     Ryan, I would add, we certainly are seeing solid growth across our jurisdictions. That's always been part of our growth plan, and it is improved through COVID and we'll continue to, we believe, certainly.  We've got a lot of good rate activity coming along as well, when you look at our Midwest jurisdictions, Florida as well. We'll see strength there as we ﬁnish out the SoBRA program and kick in the new three-year plan, coupled with the organic growth in Florida.  So, there's a number of factors. We'll have more details but across our footprint, we've got a number of capabilities that we can pull. And cost control is one of them, as it has been in the past.     And the rate case activity, Ryan, I was just looking at the slide. Ohio electric distribution Piedmont, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky. So, furious rate case activity also I would point to."
Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate the color. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research."
"Great, thank you. Hope you're well. So, I have to ask, since no one else did, there was a press report a week or two ago about there being -- maybe being a settlement soon with Elliott investments. Could you comment on that, and if there is any status of that situation?","Yeah, Steve, I'm not going to comment on the press report. But what I will say is we remain in very constructive conversations with Elliott. We are open to a constructive settlement. And as I've said many times, our decision process around this will center on terms that we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders and our company, but constructive conversations continue."
"Okay, great. And just in North Carolina, the -- in terms of actually ﬁling another rate case to recover investment, I guess, the next one would be under this law with may be performance- based. Like when would that be, and is there any time lag issues before you are able to kind of get to that?","Yeah, Steve, we are evaluating when the appropriate time is for a rate case, as we always do. You point to something that is certainly a consideration. This rule-making process will continue into 2022 and evaluating the timing for a rate case that not only would contemplate that rule making but also reﬂect capital investment is work that's underway.  And as we have a better sense of that, we will update you, but some work to do, I guess, around this rule making that I referenced before, before we would ﬁle under that plan."
"Okay. So, is it not clear right now whether the next rate case would be with the new performance-based or maybe you do a case ﬁrst without that? Where is it?","That's an interesting question. And depending on the timing of the rule making, I think it would be good to try to reﬂect that in the rate ﬁling. Right now, the Commission is on target for rule making for PBR by February. That's an aggressive timeframe. I know there's a lot of work to do, but to pick up PBR within the rate case would certainly be an objective, if the timing works out.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hey, Lynn. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, just curious, when I think about HB 951, the language was pretty clear about on the coal retirement securitization being for just the sub- critical units. How should we think about what happens to the supercritical units, the larger kind of bigger component of the Duke Carolinas and Duke Progress ﬂeet over time? And whether -- how you would deal if there were early retirements of those units?","I would think about traditional rate making on those, Michael. And some of the units will have dual fuel capability. So, they will continue running on natural gas for a period of time. So, I would think about it that way."
"Got it. And then one follow on related to 951. I'm just curious, I don't think the oﬀshore wind components made it into the bill. You've talked a little bit about oﬀshore winds and SMRs. How   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   do you -- Is the concern the reason it got left out of the bill more of one on cost, or were there other concerns that were driving that?","I wouldn't regard it as being left out of the bill. What I would regard it is that those decisions around clean technologies will be part of the carbon reduction plan and overseen by the Commission, where they will also be evaluating aﬀordability and reliability. So, I think, more to come on it, Michael, and what technologies will be necessary to hit these goals and what works for the states, which technologies make the most sense for our policymakers and communities."
