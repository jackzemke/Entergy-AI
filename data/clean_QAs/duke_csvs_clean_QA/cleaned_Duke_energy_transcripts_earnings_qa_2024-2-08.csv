Question,Answer
"Good morning. Lynn, just on the CapEx expectations, the $8 billion increase reﬂects quote- unquote obviously, an early estimate of the Carolina IRP ﬁling at the end of March. Can you just maybe elaborate on what you mean by early? So what scenarios are embedded? Is there room for upside? And then to what extent does the plan include IRPs you'll be ﬁling this year in Indiana and Kentucky? Thanks.","Yeah. Sure. Thank you. You know, an early estimate would say we've begun to contemplate what the January IRP includes. And I think you've seen us demonstrate that we've not only seen an increase in megawatts, but frankly, we've seen an increase in price for certain of the resources that we're adding. But we believe that the capital plan is subject to continued reﬁnement. Not only as we move through the regulatory process in the Carolinas, but we will introduce more around Indiana. We have a 10-year site plan that we're ﬁling in Florida this year.  So reﬁnements will continue with the capital plan. But what I would leave you with, Shar, is we have a wealth of opportunities. I mean, there is growth that is strong throughout all of our service territories, and we'll be making along with our regulators, the decisions on reliability, aﬀordability, and increasingly clean as we move through these IRPs. So just a really strong growth story for Duke."
"Got it. Okay. So more to come. And then just, Lynn, on the nuclear PTC, it's a material driver of that FFO. I guess, what are you seeing in sort of that transferability market from a demand perspective? What discounts are you seeing? And then like we're getting questions on this all morning is like how do you price in the risk of an IRA repeal? And in a worst-case scenario, can you make up that lost FFO?","Yeah. So a couple of things. On the transferability market, sure, we have begun to test that market. We had a pilot transferability transaction in 2023. The discount on the transferability was right within our planning range. So very strong response to that initial test, and we -- the treasury group and team are already working on how we might execute in 2024 as well. So we do believe the market is developing, and I think around the industry, you've seen similar transactions executed in an eﬀective way.  On the potential repeal, what I would say to you is, we continue to be very engaged with policymakers at the federal and state level around the need for infrastructure as we continue to pursue growth, onshoring of US manufacturing, leadership and artiﬁcial intelligence, battery, manufacturing EVs, et cetera. And we believe there's a lot of support to continue to build that infrastructure and to build it at a price that is aﬀordable. And the point I would emphasize for us on tax credits around infrastructure, it goes directly to customers. It reduces price over time to customers dollar-for-dollar. And so I believe both of those messages continue to resonate with   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   policymakers and we'll continue to make them. I think it's essential that we keep moving on this infrastructure build in order to serve the growth that we're seeing in our service territories.  On the impact of credit metrics, our goal, Shar, is to be a minimum of 14%. So even in the event that the credits could be impacted in some way over time, we still believe we will have time to adjust, we'll look at our overall plans and continue to run our business with a commitment to our balance sheet and with a strong balance sheet to pursue the growth."
"Hey, thank you. Look, I just wanted to follow up on the last question, a little bit in the same focus on the nuclear PTCs here just as much as. Can you discuss the reductions in the forecasted rate base? Obviously, an increase in CapEx year-to-date and obviously, there's some timing-related matters as it pertains to the nuclear PTC impact rate base. But can you talk to what other factors might be impacting rate base, not just in the near here, but through the forecast as you think about the puts and take care?","Yeah. So maybe a couple of things. On the capital side, Julien, much as Shar described, we'll continue to reﬁne these with the wealth of opportunities. I do believe we'll have an opportunity to continue to introduce really strong capital in all of our jurisdictions. But on translating to rate base growth, what we show you with rate base is capital oﬀset by tax attributes. So the nuclear PTCs, because we're amortizing them over a four-year period in a very credit-supportive way, we have a reduction in rate base as a result of that.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So this is an opportunity for us to do both, grow and maintain the strength of the balance sheet. And we feel like we have developed a very constructive settlement in North Carolina to achieve exactly that."
"Yeah. No, that makes sense. There's just nothing else that's impacting that. And then can you discuss the revised load growth outlook, right? And again, [ph] 2% is a real acceleration from 0.5% to 1% last year. And ultimately, I get that last year had down load if you will so it's a new starting point. But just to reconcile a little bit of the logo commentary, especially considering the commentary from the last call here, what is sort of re-accelerated? How do you think about both the near year and the longer term here, if you will, just a little bit more?","Yeah. Thank you, Julien. I'm going to turn to Brian to discuss that.     Yeah. Good morning, Julien. So when we look at 2024, the setup on load growth is really underpinned by three main points. So you start with economic development visibility we have in 2024, projects that are in late-stage construction that are coming online, and we've got that on one of our slides. Net debt represents a little under a 1% growth as we look into 2024.  On the residential side of things, we've seen this normalization coming out of COVID of return to the oﬃce, right? During COVID, we had a lot of residential usage at home. As a return to the oﬃce, you saw this kind of lower usage at homes, more in commercial businesses. And in the back part of 2023, we saw that level out. So we will start growing residential more in line with customer migration trends, which has been really strong 1.7%, 1.8% in recent years. And so residential growth we expect to be an upward trajectory. And then lastly, the existing C&I customers where we saw a reduction in load in 2023, and when we talked about it throughout the year. And those customers are very optimistic in 2024. They've kind of seen a rebound happening maybe mid-ish year.  So those three factors give us conﬁdence that 2% load growth in '24 is deﬁnitely in our sites.     And then with the long-term, Julien, all of the things that Brian talked about, right, we're going to continue to experience customer migration or existing customer base continues to demonstrate some strength over the ﬁve year period. But probably the most new or signiﬁcant driver is this economic development load. And we've given you a range of what we're seeing, and what we've put on the slide are the things that we believe have a high degree of conﬁdence of being achieved. So dirt is moving, letters of agreement have been signed and we're moving forward. And so the combination of our existing base population migration and the strong economic development gave us conﬁdence to raise the long-term growth rate."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. Excellent. So it sounds like things have reaccelerated here, even just quarter-over-quarter just on the margin.","Well, and I think, Julien, we were continuing to grapple with this economic development all through '23, and came to our ﬁling here in the Carolinas in January, really reckoning with where we think this is going. So I -- we have continued to mature our own thinking, working with our customers, working with the prospects coming to the area, and believe this represents a really solid range. And when we're looking at that range, the growth is going to come along with it on -- in megawatt-hours, and that's what you're seeing in our update."
"Good morning, Lynn and Brian. The -- just one more on the nuclear PTC. Any sense on when we're actually, going to get details from the treasury and setting it? Any update there?","You know, Steve, our best intel is the ﬁrst half of the year. So we're thinking kind of sometime in Q2, we would get the ﬁnal guidance from treasury, and I think that's the general consensus.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Yeah. Okay. On the ﬁnancing, the equity plan, the DRIP and ATM, any kind of color on how much of that can be done through DRIP relative to ATM?","Yeah. So, Steve, you should think about DRIP as think about $200 million a year, so about 40% of it."
"All right. Yeah. And then just on the gas plant ﬁling in the Carolinas, what -- when would this -- would you be roughly targeting for these plants to come online?","So 2029, Steve. Combined cycle plant, two in '28 -- I'm sorry, CTs two in '28. CCs one in '28, one in '29. [ph]"
"As we think about the 1.5% to 2% load growth, I was just curious, is that concentrated in certain service territories more than others? Are you seeing certain states growing faster versus others in your footprint?","David, I would think about the Carolinas has seen the largest portion of the economic development prospects we see, but we do see healthy growth across our jurisdictions. I mean, Indiana with this reshoring of manufacturing has really seen economic development. Growing Florida continues to grow in a really strong way at 2% customer migration trends as well as the commercial businesses have supported. So I would say, Carolinas is slightly ahead of the others, but all that really -- really good growth."
"Okay, got it. Not several percentage points faster in any speciﬁc state, but fairly tightly grouped around there.","And you know, David, I wouldn't say, building on what Brian said, residential growth has been stronger in the Carolinas and Florida. Commercial and industrial in the Midwest has been good and it's also been good in the Carolinas.     That's right.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      So the growth kind of varies by customer class. But I would go back to where I commented, and I think [ph] we have a wealth of opportunities. And these are not only good for Duke Energy's growth, but they're are good for our state, its capital investment and job creation. Supply-chain is coming with a lot of these manufacturers. So it's good for the service territories that we are serving."
"Understood. Yeah, that's helpful. And I'm not sure if you gave this level of color, but just going forward, as you're thinking about all of these other CapEx opportunities to add to the plan, how are you thinking about ﬁnancing that? Is there a rule of thumb for how much incremental equity you would need kind of per dollar of CapEx as you're expanding the investment going forward?","You know, David, I think it's premature to talk about that because the ﬁrst thing that we'll do is run through capital optimization and allocation, putting the capital in the area that both delivers the most customer value and is delivering the best returns. And I think we'll have more on this reﬁnement of capital as we move through IRP approvals in the Carolinas this year, and then Indiana next year 10-year site plan as well. So we'll continue to keep you updated, and our commitment remains growth and a strong balance sheet."
"Hey, good morning. So I guess just the payout ratio, you're taking that down obviously, which seems very prudent. I know you've already been kind of growing into a lower payout ratio over time. The dividend growth has been lower than the EPS growth here. So just -- I'm kind of wondering just how to think about your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR now, like where you are in that range. Are you at the high, low, or midpoint of that? And then when do you get back into this kind of 60% to 70% payout ratio in the plan? Thank you.","Yeah. So, Nick, pulling that all together, we're very conﬁdent in our 5% to 7% growth rate. We have been building the capital plan to accomplish that, as well as the regulatory mechanisms for several years. And so what we're putting in front of you, we have a high degree of conﬁdence on. And as a result of that, we see the payout ratio declining. Over the next ﬁve years, it will be under 70% in 2024. And so as we look at our commitment to the dividend, we intend to continue growing it. We're committed to the dividend, as we have been for a long period of time. But believe in this moment with the level of capital that we have that introducing some ﬁnancial ﬂexibility in our range so that we can make good choices around dividend, capital and growth is just prudent. And so, as you know, we look at dividends every year. The Board is involved in that approval process. But given the the total composition of growth in dividends, we believe that 60% to 70% payout ratio is appropriate at this point."
"Okay. I appreciate that. And then I guess, just -- I know you just recently ﬁled in Florida. You have a history of -- there's a history of settlements in that state in constructive outcomes is just anything kind of changing in regulatory strategy that wouldn't allow you to pursue another settlement in the future.","No, Nick. What we have accomplished so far is procedurally what we need to do to provide notice and the ﬁling would follow late March, early April. As you know, we have a history of engaging with intervening parties in all of our jurisdictions as part of the regulatory process, and we will do -- endeavor to do that in Florida as well. And we'll keep you posted every step of the way.  It's a very constructive jurisdiction in Florida. Understanding the need for infrastructure to balance the growth that the state is maintaining or achieving, and also maintaining critical infrastructure investment for reliability, storm response, et cetera. So we'll look forward to keeping you updated on the rate case."
Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Thank you for -- good morning, Lynn. Maybe just -- I think the equity $500 million a year, two and a half [ph] total for the plan versus the CapEx raise towards the low-end. I think you might have said 30% to 50% funded with equity in the past. So maybe just a little bit more color at kind of what puts you at that low end of the range since we discussed this in November last year.","Yeah. And Durgesh, I think about all of these variables, the capital, the regulatory outcomes, the equity issuance, the fact that we see nuclear PTC is something that we've been able to negotiate in a credit-supportive way. You've got all of those variables that we evaluate in establishing the plan that we have in front of you. And believe that at this level, that 30% ratio gives us the best match between the growth we're trying to achieve, as well as the strength of the balance sheet. And so that'll be -- that's always our goal is to achieve both for investors, and we believe we've accomplished that."
"That's helpful, and thank you. And then the rate base is -- you know, when I look at the year- over-year growth rate in rate base, it's pretty healthy. It's within your 5% to 7% EPS -- long-term EPS growth guidance. Do we think about annual EPS growth rates within that range as well in that 5% to 7% range? Or is that more kind of a CAGR approach and back-end weighted?","No, Durgesh. We endeavor to hit it every year. Every year. And that's how we plan our investments. That's how we plan our strategies around regulatory and otherwise. And so that's how I would share with you year-over-year.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"So ﬁrst one may be to follow up on Nick's question just shifting that Indiana. How are you thinking about the timing, and what consideration should we be thinking about for the Indiana rate case?","So, Ross, we evaluate as you know periodically, where we are with the capital investment, rate case cycle. And in Indiana, we have a lot of investment in riders, but some of those riders are 80% of the investment. So we need a general base rate case to pick up the other 20%. We also have in front of us in Indiana CPCNs for generation that are in our regulatory mines, our regulatory calendar.  So we'll continue to evaluate that what is the right timing, when do we go in and how does that relate to other things that we're trying to accomplish in Indiana. And by ﬂagging it for you in this call, we're indicating that it's under review, and we'll keep you posted as we get closer to a ﬁnal decision."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thanks, Lynn. I appreciate that very much. And then maybe one for you, Brian. Excuse me, little under the weather today. But as I look at the bridge to 2024, over 40% of that's coming from this $0.12 of other, and I think I get the higher interest rates impact. And maybe can you scale the or scope the other things in there for me? There is a lower tax rate and then there's return from investments. I think that's probably coming from either pricing the insurance side or the NMC stuﬀ in Saudi Arabia around petrochem. Or how do I think about that as I look at my 2024?","Yeah. I would point to the tax optimization rise. In 2023, we had an opportunity for an item in tax optimization that was I would say outsized from our normal tax optimization work. That was part of our agility eﬀorts so which you would expect us to do because we had record mild weather, we were looking at every opportunity to oﬀset that.  As we look forward in 2024, we're seeing a more consistent level of tax optimization that we had in previous years. So that's the other major driver in the other section. But we still have a robust set of tax optimization, and our tax team is doing a fabulous work in that front. But that's what I point to. And we signaled our agility of $300 million that we were pursuing in 2023, about half of it would be sustainable. And I would point to that tax-up optimization as about that half that's not sustainable."
"Okay. Okay, I got it. Thank you, Brian, for that clarity. Aappreciate it very much.","Yeah.     Thank you.  Operator  This concludes our Q&A session for today. So I will turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any closing comments.     Well, let me close by just thanking everyone for participation today. I know when we do these annual updates, we give you 44 to 50 slides to digest so we're also available for questions and comments. The IR team, Brian, I am available and really appreciate your interest and investment in Duke. Thanks so much  Operator   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   This concludes today's call.
