Question,Answer
"So a big jump in CapEx and the rate base is obviously up $6 billion in '23. Can we talk a bit more on sort of the higher numbers and maybe even focusing on '23 especially in Florida, where I think you're expecting to ﬁle the formal GRCs later this year. I mean, i.e, base assumptions in the upcoming GRC versus the plan you kind of presented today and could we see some further upside if the outcome is a little bit more constructive, especially if you got support from sort of your healthy macro backdrop that you highlighted?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Sure. Thank you for the question. We did lay out in the slide deck the underlying investments around the $6 billion, $1.5 billion of it is in Florida, $4 billion in the Carolinas and then we see incremental investment in our gas LDCs of $1 billion. But I think to your point, the recent legislation in Florida represents a longer term opportunity and we see up to $5 billion over a decade or so of investment in that infrastructure. And as we move through the process of ﬁnalizing our existing multi-year plan and resetting that into the future, I do believe there will be ongoing potential for investment in Florida in a way that adds a lot of value to customers and investors."
"Got it. And then just lastly on North Carolina coal ash. It's obviously kind of a ﬂuid situation still. Is there any read-throughs to Dominion's recent notice of decision which essentially extended the recovery period for their ash spend, but with no return on that spend prospectively? I mean, assuming this is kind of applicable to you, can you kind of break this outcome down relative to your $8.5 billion in total CCR costs if we sort of apply that same methodology as we did with Dominion?","Sure. Shar, the ﬁrst point I would make on this, which I think is really important is the Dominion order did provide recovery of the costs and that is a signiﬁcant outcome, which we of course believe makes sense given its decommissioning of coal plants that have provided great value to our customers over generations. We have read the notice of decision, but I also think it's important to recognize that we have not yet seen the order.  So we don't understand all of the elements, we don't understand the rationale. I think it's fair to say that this order will be speciﬁc to the facts and circumstances in this case. And although we will learn from it, I am not prepared to say how it will impact us directly. But we will be presenting our case in the DEC case in March and DEP in May, and hopefully have the opportunity to learn more from the order as we prepare to enter into those proceedings."
"Got it. But just to follow up, but just given sort of your CapEx outlook and sort of how healthy it is, is it fair to assume that you can absorb whatever outcome that does come about in that case, assuming there for instance isn't a return on that spend?","Shar, when we put together a ﬁve-year plan, we do so assuming a range of outcomes. And so that would include amortization, that would include various assumptions around cost recovery. But I also want to emphasize that we believe a lack of a return over an extended amortization period is detrimental to our balance sheet and the customers over the long term. And therefore, we believe these costs ought to earn returns. There is a cost of ﬁnancing associated   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   with anything that of this nature. And the cost of ﬁnancing should be considered as part of cost of service. So we will be making those points as part of the case."
"Good, thank you for the time. Perhaps just to follow up on the Carolinas here if you don't mind. First, possibilities here on just rate case settlement and just prospects on the timeline, if you will. And then related to that, obviously you've laid out a pretty impressive updated outlook. How do you think about this tying into some of the updates moving in-ﬂight in parallel at the state level on sort of the grid mod side of the equation, I think in the DEQ side?","On the ﬁrst question, Julien, on settlement, we always explore opportunities for settlement in every case. I think when you think about the number of issues in the rate case, if we can get to resolution of any of them in advance, we'll certainly look to do that. We did that in the Carolinas cases. You may recall the last time around, at least as it pertain to ROE and cap structure. So I can't forecast with certainty how that will occur or if it will occur. But we'll certainly explore those opportunities.  On your second question around how it relates to each of the jurisdictions and capital, I'll take a shot at and maybe some clarity on the question would be helpful."
"Meaning, in Carolina speciﬁcally.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Sure. So we believe we've made the case soundly in all of our jurisdictions, about the importance of the energy delivery system to be the backbone of the transition of renewable generation, storm hardening and resiliency, we've had hurricane exposure in all of our Southeastern jurisdictions over the last four years. And then cyber and physical security threats are something that are not unique to Duke Energy, but certainly important for our industry. So we feel like we've laid the groundwork for that.  I think you know, Julien, we will be involved in stakeholder meetings throughout 2020 in the Carolinas to further discussions around the clean energy plan and as part of that, it will be not only advancement of how to achieve further carbon reduction, but also for the methods to modernize regulation, performance-based rate making and other things that would ﬁt quite nicely with our strategy around clean generation and good investment. So as the stakeholder processes progress in 2020 and into 2021, we will look for opportunities to continue to pursue regulatory modernization that sits with these investments."
"Got it. And then separately, if I could just follow up on the higher level of rate base, how do you think about the ﬁnancing? Just, I know you guys did the equity last year, you have a projected FFO to debt metric here, but I just wanted to try to have it all back together when you think about the updated stable projection?","Sure. As I alluded to, we priced out the $2.5 billion of equity to settle that in late 2020. That plus the DRIP ATM equity through 2022 are the equity needs that we see. We will ﬁnance the rest of our needs and refundings through a combination of holding company and operating company debt issuances and we feel comfortable about that ﬁnancing plan and maintaining the credit ratings."
"Got it. Maybe just if I can rephrase that slightly and you tell me if I'm not saying it right. The equity forward eﬀectively pays for the incremental CapEx such that the metrics are largely unchanged. And then I know that there was previously a conversation on ACP and providing some buﬀer. Do you want me to just reconcile the ACT conversation versus the CapEx plan perspective? It sounds like you've eﬀectively used the incremental equity now to pay for the new plan this year, but I just want to also make sure we've addressed the prior commentary about ACP outcomes.","Right. Let me give some clarity here. The incremental equity dealt with Atlantic Coast Pipeline and delays associated with that and the cash ﬂows that therefore delayed when we determine the project needed to go in one phase in 2022 as opposed to having cash ﬂows coming in in 2021. And that equity dealt with a number of ranges of outcomes with ACP and it still does.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   The incremental CapEx spend that we've gotten the plan, we can deal with under that same amount of equity. We've got other tools that we've utilized. We issued $1 billion of equity content securities in 2019 at very attractive rates. We have continued to ﬁnd operational eﬃciencies through O&M that we described earlier that helps the balance sheet as well. We executed on the John Hancock transaction and this could envision dropping other assets into mechanisms like that, that should provide some liquidity. So the equity, the $2.5 billion equity has not been used up for the incremental CapEx, we can deal with the equity I described."
"Hi, Lynn. So a couple of questions. First, just a technical one. The 2019, it looks like a lot of the beat versus your segment guidance came in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, can you just explain what drove that?","So we had a couple of things here, Steve. Of course, strong results from capital deployments, rate case outcomes, et cetera. Atlanta Coast Pipeline is in there and we also had tax adjustments on recognition of the way allowance for funds have been recorded on the pipeline that drove the LDC businesses as well.  Steve, would you add to that?     Yeah, I would say, looking at 2019, we had strong growth across all of our segments. You look at the electric utilities, we had a full year of the 2018 North Carolina rate case as we had a partial   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   year of the 2019 South Carolina rate cases. We saw our Midwest grid continue to roll through. We had the Ohio rate case that added a few cents. Our energy eﬃciency rider, particularly in the Carolinas, added several cents. So we saw good solid growth on the electric side."
"Yeah, so that was -- okay. We can follow up on that.",We saw growth in electric a bit and gas a bit more that pushed us above our target.
"Okay. And then just on ACP, at a high level, in the unfortunate event that it somehow doesn't get done, how would you characterize the -- how to think about your 4% to 6%?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Steve, I would characterize the ﬁve year period as having great ﬂexibility. And by that I mean the robust capital plan that we have outlined for the utilities, positions the utilities very solidly within the 4% to 6% guidance range. And that gives us conﬁdence. Those utilities are going to continue to grow and grow well and we have demonstrated the growth in those utilities over several years. And hopefully, that gives you conﬁdence as well in our ability to deliver.  I think on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, we will work our way through it. As we spoke about a moment ago, we've taken the step of strengthening the balance sheet to absorb the range of options. We have ﬂexibility with our capital plans to make adjustments to put in a plan B, if one is required to build gas infrastructure to meet the needs that ACP would have met. We also have the opportunity to expand or accelerate good investments in a number of our jurisdictions.  And then the ongoing productivity and ﬂexibility around O&M represents another level that we have in addressing returns over a ﬁve-year period. We have demonstrated the ability to achieve reductions and ﬂexibility in O&M across our diverse businesses and we see further opportunities over the ﬁve year period. So we're committed to driving low risk regulated growth in earnings and dividends, and we believe that we have the capability of doing that. But we will work our way through ACP and I think 2020 is an important year to hit some of these milestones and we will update all along the way."
"Yeah. No, that's great. And then one other just quick thing. The $4 billion of incremental spending in the Carolinas. Is it -- it sounds like it's mainly T&D spending. Just is there any coal ash related spend of new plan in there, or is that comp past that period?","Well, there is no incremental coal ash spend in that number at all. It's at a comparable level than what we've had in the past."
"Okay, great. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Thank you, Steve.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Congrats on a constructive update. I wanted to talk about Florida a little bit. Solar economics continue to trend favorably and you've highlighted Florida as one area of incremental growth. Over time, I guess, longer term, if we continue to see solar costs drop, is there a fairly signiﬁcant opportunity to make even bigger changes to your generation mix in the state or are there other reasons why that wouldn't be the case the solar cost drop further?","Yeah, Stephen, I believe there are increasing opportunities and we will watch those economics all along the way. And as I think back over -- even the last two to three years, every time we've set a forward forecast, it has increased and improved. And I think that will be the case into the 2020."
"Understood. The number that you've laid out is a sense of sort of -- I know you haven't speciﬁcally laid out the amount of solar, you've sort of put Florida together, but we'll be seeing a resource plan that you all lay out in, I believe in April in Florida, which could show further progress in terms of moving towards renewables, is that fair to say?","And you know, at this point, we're forecasting 1,750 megawatts of solar, Stephen, and we'll continue to update that as we go. But I think to your point, as you think out over a decade, the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   bias is that number is going to go up."
"That's helpful. And then just lastly, going to start to hit on the ﬁnancing needs. Just wanted to kind of think through scenarios. In the unfortunate outcome if it ends up that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project is not able to move forward, either because of the Supreme Court ruling or the biological opinion, how would that sort of that single impact sort of your overall equity needs? In another words, is the sort of ﬁnancing plan fairly ﬂexible and you wouldn't envision incremental equity in that scenario or how do you think about that sort of outcome?","Stephen, I believe we've taken care of the range of outcomes on ACT with the $2.5 billion. The one thing in the ﬁnancing plan that we would evaluate is, we have the DRIP and ATM on through I believe 2022 with an idea that we potentially could moderate in '23 and '24 as ACP is on. We will evaluate whether or not the DRIP and ATM should be a part of the ﬁnancing plan in all events for '23 and '24 depending on outcome. But I think that's the only thing I would point to as something that will -- we'll have ongoing evaluation, because we feel like what we've put in front of you with the equity that we've issued and maintaining the DRIP through 2022, with this additional capital, is a solid plan that will meet our credit metrics, our earnings guidance, and absorb outcomes around ACP."
Hey. Can we talk a little bit about commercial renewables and what the growth plan is for that going forward? You've had some projects that pushed out into 2020. So you have a $240 million assumption for that year. And I think it's up $0.06. So that would imply about $0.19 for 2020. Is that sort of the new level going forward or is that going to grow beyond that? And how many megawatts is required to keep that up anyway?,"Sure, Mike. We're looking at having commercial renewables contribute between $200 million and $250 million a year during the plan. It will depend on the timing of projects, but that's keeping pretty level -- pretty ﬂat with the level that they got to in 2019. So we're not showing a lot of growth there. We did shift the Palmer solar project to 2020. That was another optimization move as we got late in the year, that will help the 2020 earnings. But they will be between $200 million and $250 million a year through our plan.  We've got all of 2020 lined up and locked up, and we've got 60% of the net income over the ﬁve year period in hand as well. So a rough number that you think about is roughly landing 300 megawatts a year of projects to keep that going and between the markets that we're in, and the crispy [ph] programs in North Carolina and so forth, we think that's very attainable."
"Got it. And ACP, you said that you don't expect any dilution from the prior forward as a result of earnings (technical diﬃculty) after the pipeline goes into service and I'm just wondering is that as a result of higher rates on the pipeline going forward or is it higher -- are you banging on higher volumes through compression? Is there a lag period between the in-service period and the lack of dilution or is there like maybe a diﬀerent period in between there?","Mike, we have given you some ﬁnancial considerations on Slide 17 on allowance for funds in 20 and then full year in-service in '22 and beyond that you can expect in terms of the contribution of ACP. The dilution that we will experience in 2021 will be absorbed by incremental allowance for funds in that year, while the project is still under construction. And so I would think about putting that equity into the plan in 2021 and then the combination of the utility results we've shared with you today as well as what we're sharing on ACP is the earnings platform with ﬁnancing that you can expect over the ﬁve year period."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   One last question. Just to conﬁrm, how much ﬁnancing have you already committed to the project at this point? I think it's around $2 billion, including -- excluding AFUDC at this point?","Yeah. The gross project cost are about $2 billion on our books now, we've got about $800 million or $900 million of construction ﬁnancing against that."
"(inaudible) with additional spending start to roll in signiﬁcantly, is it going to be after the Supreme Court rules?","So the gating item on construction is the biological opinion and incidental intake statement, so the restoration of the environmental impact study. So if you look again at Slide 17, we are forecasting that re-issuance of the permit in the middle part of 2022, and you should think about construction as being in the latter of -- restart of construction being in the latter half of 2020."
"So ﬁrst question, very impressive CapEx update. For ' 19 through '23, it looks like your spending is up roughly 15% or so, but when I look at the earnings base outlook, the increase is more modest at around 5% depending on the year. Will you please help me reconcile those and what are some of the oﬀsets?","Yeah, I think our rate base growth is at the 6% level over the period of time there and CapEx may vary in terms of how it's loaded through the type of CapEx, but I'd have to look in more detail on that to understand -- and the IR team can help you with that.  (multiple speakers)     And Andrew, if you look at the capital in the appendix that will give you a sense of the growth in each of the utilities. So on average, every utility is growing within the 4% to 6% range, some are higher than that and gas, of course, is higher than that, but the combination, the average of all of the utilities together are at the 6% CAGR."
Right. I understand that. I'm not talking about year-over-year growth. I'm talking about your new guidance versus the prior guidance. I should have been more clearer.,"So we have laid out on Slide 11 kind of how this comes in and I think we could spend some time with the IR team to give you some speciﬁcs on what it looks like in 2021-22. I think the combination of that chart and the detail in the appendix, we'd be happy to walk you through."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. I'll follow up oﬄine. My next question is, can you talk a bit about the industrial demand? Obviously, you're not the only one seeing this but it was pretty soft last year, fourth quarter in particular. Then I think you mentioned the uplift in 2020 from the leap day, but maybe if you could just talk about adjusted expectations over the next few quarters?","Sure. 2019 was a rough year for the economy as a whole. That translated to our industry in lower kilowatt-hour of sales. We saw that in many of our peers as well. The good news for us is that we see tremendous customer growth. We saw the best customer growth in 2019 than we've seen in many years, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida.  As we look forward, we will see some of that customer growth translate into some favorable growth, we believe. We also think that there'll be some rebound as we look at some of our industrial customers. A few have had some singular issues with outages, supply chain issues and so forth. So we think they may get some traction as we move forward in 2020 to help rebound oﬀ a bad year.  Our overall growth expectation, load growth expectation is 0.005% and there'll be years by 2018 that are very strong years followed by some years that are little weaker, but we think that's a reasonable place to be over the ﬁve year period. We do expect to see some growth over '19 in 2020 as '19 was kind of a low year. And again, we're seeing some favorable indicators from some of our industrials in our service territories.     Andrew, the only thing I would add to that is, all of our jurisdictions continue to perform at GDPs above national average. The weakness we saw in industrial was largely driven by some of the uncertainties around tariﬀs surfaced in 2019. But as Steve said, we are beginning to see some signs of rebound in the speciﬁc customer circumstances and hope for a stronger 2020."
"Okay, great. That's helpful. Then on the dividend, Steve, did I hear you say that you're targeting the low end of the 65% to 75% range in the outer years? Why would that be and why not the midpoint?","Well, that's just where it tracks based on the assumptions we've put there. I will certainly monitor that as we go forward. It's nice to have the ﬂexibility to look at the dividend as it gets to the lower end of the range, but we have that ﬂexibility. So we're not committing to anything on that, but it's nice to be tracking in that direction.     And I think, Andrew, as we more solidly position the dividend within the payout range, our longer-term goal is to grow the dividend at the same pace of earnings and this moderation   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   we're experiencing here in the short term will give us the ﬂexibility to do that over the longer term."
"Got it. Very good. And then if I could squeeze one last one in here. The earned ROEs in the Carolinas you're guiding to a modestly lower return in 2020 versus the past few years. Is that primarily related to last year's reduction in the allowed ROE, or are there other factors there? I know it's tough to discuss in the middle of rate cases, but any kind of directional commentary?","A couple of factors that come in. As you build investment base for the upcoming rate case, you will incur some lag as I referred to. And then you will catch that up when you have a rate case. So some of those returns will move around depending upon rate case timing and I think that's one of the factors to think about as well."
