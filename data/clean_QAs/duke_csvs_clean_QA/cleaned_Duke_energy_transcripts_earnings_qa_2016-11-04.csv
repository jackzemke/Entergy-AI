Question,Answer
Good morning. Could you discuss in a little more detail the – I think you said that there was – the results from Commercial Renewables was not as what you expected. Just wondering if we could discuss some of the issues surrounding that?,"Michael, I would direct you to slide 16 of the deck, which gives you a comparison of where we are for year-to-date results against original expectations. So you see Commercial has delivered about $65 million of net income against our original expectations of $140 million. We are not expecting that we'll deliver $140 million for 2016. Some of that shortfall will be the result of lesser capital deployment, as Steve mentioned, returns have been very market-driven, so great for customers, but low for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind and solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So, those are the two things I'd point to."
"Is it that the market for investment has become more competitive than you expected, let's say, a year ago, that returns on acquisitions are just smaller than you thought or is this more of a weather issue?","I think returns are lower, Michael, and I think the other thing to consider for Duke as an investor, we are in an NOL position as a result of bonus depreciation. And so as we look at returns, we consider that the monetization of tax credits need to reﬂect when we will be a cash taxpayer. So, the DCF of that can challenge our returns. So, that's something that we'll continue to monitor as the time progresses. We understand the market well. We have great expertise in both wind and solar based on the business that we built. We still like the business. But, we are disciplined in the way we deploy the capital based on the returns we're seeing in the market."
How long does that NOL position go out to? What do you expect?,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Currently, we are expecting, assuming there are no further extensions of the bonus, that we would come out of the NOL position in 2019. We would then begin using tax credits, ITC production tax credits, so we would still not be a signiﬁcant cash taxpayer for a few years after that."
"So that would – that in theory could make the Renewables business a little more competitive for you, right?","I think as we get closer to that period of tax where we burn oﬀ the NOL, that will impact our view of returns, Michael, because the relative value of the tax credits will be greater."
"Good morning. First question, Steve, the proceeds from international sale, as you mentioned, you're going to use to pay oﬀ parent debt. Can you remind me, on average, what's the average interest rate on the debt that you're paying oﬀ?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Well, when we did the calculation there, we came out with roughly $0.05. We're looking at a long-term holding company rate. It might be in the 3.5% to 4%-type range of that nature. So that's the basis of what we're looking at, and we baked that into our ﬁnancing plans anticipating that to happen. We'll initially take down some bridge facilities of shorter term with the proceeds."
Okay. But there's enough – that high cost or relatively high-cost debt available to get that kind of savings?,"Well, what I'm speaking about is we've anticipated this and baked it into our ﬁnancing plans to avoid issuances of HoldCo debt at that higher level.     Yeah. So one way to think about it is $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion of proceeds coming into the holding company. So the average rate that Steve referenced is consistent with that."
"I see. Then second, the Commercial results that you're getting, $65 million year-to-date or $140 million for the year, I guess a little lower now, how much of that, roughly, is recognition of tax credits?","Tax credits are going to be a signiﬁcant part of those renewable returns. Ali, I don't have a exact number in front of me. We do have a modest amount of contribution in Commercial from the pipelines at this point through the third quarter. We'll move that to the Gas Infrastructure segment in the fourth quarter, how would you add? (29:39)     That's correct. The results for the Commercial Portfolio reﬂects small amounts of AFUDC on the pipelines. That will be growing. But, right now, it is primarily from the Renewables business, and that is heavily driven by the recognition of the tax beneﬁts."
"Got it. Last question. Lynn, as you look at this portfolio now post the international sale and you look at your utility footprint, is everything essentially core as far as Duke is concerned? And related to that, as you're looking at growth over at least the next three, four years, does M&A come back into the mix for you as you're looking to deliver growth for shareholders?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","So, Ali, the businesses that we own coming out of the transition are all core. And I think the strength of the franchises we own in the Southeast with Gas and Electric and then a strong position in the Midwest are all core businesses. And we'll be looking to drive growth through investments that build on cleaner forms of generation and strengthening our grid and driving growth, and providing value to customers. That'll be job one at Duke. I believe the M&A represents something that we will continue to look at as opportunities arise, and I think we've demonstrated a track record of successful integration of M&A candidates. But job one, as I said, is growing the core businesses that we own."
"So maybe just coming back to your Renewable portfolio, so when you're underwriting these investments, do you generally assume that the PPA cash ﬂows are going to cover the full investment costs, or do you assume some residual value post-PPA in order to recover that investment?",We will typically assign some terminal value beyond the contract period.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Okay. Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, can you provide any guidance on, like, how you think about valuation post-PPA? Can you make some assumption around re-contracting? Or do you apply $1 to every multiple or some other method?","We look at a variety of things as we think about terminal value, including forward curves, as well as market experience. And so our contracts are the majority of the value that we're looking at, and so terminal is something that we look at a range of possible outcomes."
