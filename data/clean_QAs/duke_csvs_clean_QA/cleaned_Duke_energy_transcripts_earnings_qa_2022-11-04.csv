Question,Answer
"Good morning. So when you guys put out a '23 guidance ﬁgure out there without a commercial deal actually being announced. I know obviously, you see robust interest but the ultimate transaction multiple here matters a lot. And can you maybe touch a little bit on your sort of level of conﬁdence here ahead of selecting a better -- do you have some ﬁrm oﬀers that's giving you this kind of visibility into '23 and to have this type of an EPS range or recent deals in New York a good proxy? Have you narrowed down the bidders? I guess just some more visibility on this pending deal that's kind of embedded in your '23 guide would be really helpful and if there's any conservative bend here. Thanks.","Thanks, Shar. Sure. I would start by saying, sure, we have a lot of experience in dealing with portfolio transactions if you think about the history of Duke. And as we began the strategic review process, a lot of work has been done, not only to challenge our strategic assumptions, but also to do work in the market, hiring advisers, understanding the range of potential valuations, including soliciting feedback from the market and feedback from credible counterparties.  So we do have indications of interest, robust indications of interest from credible counterparties and have a high degree of conﬁdence that we will transact on this business. All of that went into our decision to announce the sale. So that's kind of consistent with the way we would approach anything of this magnitude and this type of decision to do our homework before we announce.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So when we look at the guidance range for 2023, we not only have commercial renewables contemplated, but the high degree of conﬁdence will execute, but we have strong regulated growth. And we also have strong cost mitigation already in place and ready to go in light of some of the headwinds that we're all experiencing in the economy. So I feel like we've put together a very credible guidance range for our company that represents one of the strongest regulated utilities in the industry, we feel like 2023 is oﬀ to a strong start."
"Got it. And then just tax leakage, I guess you guys have enough in plan to oﬀset any kind of leakage there from the sale?","We believe we can manage within this range, Shar. We wouldn't have put it out there if we didn't think we could do that. So high degree of conﬁdence in executing and a high degree of conﬁdence in the range."
"Okay. Perfect. And then lastly, when turning to the carbon plan. Obviously, the commission has been very clear at hearings and then ﬁlings that intends to meet that December 31 deadline to have a ﬁne to order and an initial plan in place. I mean, obviously, you guys highlighted last week, you ﬁled the proposed order in the docket supporting a real wide range of diﬀerent technologies. But everyone seems to be kind of in diﬀerent directions. It doesn't appear we have a lot of consensus among over a dozen parties that are involved. So it's a little bit more contentious than we would have thought. I guess how does the commission bridge these gaps, it seems to be a little bit of a tight time frame by year-end? Thanks.","Sure. Shar, what I would say to you is the feedback in this process is something that looks reasonable and somewhat predictable to us. So the solar industry is interested in more solar. The industrials are interested in low prices. Low income, we're interested in the impact to low income. Attorney general and the environmental community want us to go as fast as we can to reduce carbon.  So as we look at how the hearing rolled out, the testimony that we presented, the case that we put forward, we felt like all of those positions were well understood, were well discussed in the hearing and didn't ﬁnd them surprising in any way, frankly. But that's what creates kind of the fertile ground for the commission to make decisions.  And the good news is, in the near term, it's all about solar and battery. And we have time on the long term to make decisions about some of the more diﬃcult pump storage, SMR oﬀshore wind. And so we think there's a strength to our recommendation to use the next couple of years to look at development on those key technologies so that we're prepared by the middle of the decade to make the decisions about where to go.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So I would say a very good process, a very transparent process, not surprising in any way on where the parties put forward their positions. And I think the commission has a lot of good information on which to make their decision, and we expect them to do so by the end of the year."
"Got it. Terriﬁc, guys. Thanks so much and we'll see you in about a week. Appreciate it.","Yes. Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you're ready, Julien."
"Hey. Good morning. Lynn, just following up on Shar's question, maybe a couple of details tied to it. Again, I see the discount oﬀ. So can you talk a little bit about the partial year assumption of lower interest expense? Just what's the timing assumed there? I know people are looking very carefully at these '23 numbers. So just if you can elaborate there.  And then related, actually, I'll just ask you the follow-up would be, can you elaborate a little bit on eﬀectively the $0.30 of cost reductions of the $300 million? How does that square with the earlier sensitivity you provided against interest rates at this point? Eﬀectively, where are you on '23 and beyond assumptions on sort of eﬀectively fully oﬀsetting that impact?","Sure. And Julien, I think for planning purposes, we are thinking about the commercial renewables transaction is being mid-year. And we'll know more as we get into the ﬁnal round, bidding, et cetera, and hope to be able to give you more feedback in the February call. But I think midyear is the partial year would be the right planning assumption.  And on the cost reduction, I think you'll recall that back in the second quarter, we had undertaken something that we call the work reduction initiative, really focused on ways we can   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   simplify work, use digital technologies in order to streamline our governance processes, our reporting processes, et cetera, and we were targeting $200 million.  We were also, at the same time, looking at supply chain and looking at other things that we could do to potentially more tactically move O&M out of '23. And we were able to increase that $200 million target to $300 million. We have sized that, Julien, to give us conﬁdence around the macroeconomic trends. So when I look at interest rates, for example, we are in a position with the work that we've done to be able to hit this guidance range despite the headwind of interest rates.  And as we look ahead beyond 2023, we have modest amounts of maturities in '24. And we also see the beneﬁt of the IRA showing up more materially in 2024. I think we've talked about the nuclear PTCs being consequential for us. We see IRA is not only beneﬁting customers but being credit positive, cash ﬂow positive to the utility.  So we feel like we've got good plans in place here and are really pleased that we got after cost reduction. As you know, we always do early enough in 2022 that we have a high degree of conﬁdence for 2023 and beyond. We think that the $300 million, 75% of it is sustainable."
"Got it. And if I may, just to continue with that thought, the unsustainable piece, that remaining 25%. Is that order of magnitude pretty comparable to the interest savings that you get from the tailwind in the '24 from the ﬁrst half of the year would be commercial renewables having a run rate impact on the sale?","Julien, I haven't thought about it that speciﬁcally because the way I approach every year is looking for a way to save money. So we may come up with some new ideas in 2023 for 2024. The continuous improvement mindset at Duke runs pretty deep, and we're always trying to some ways to reduce costs."
"Got it. And so the cash ﬂow uplift on the nuclear side to your credit metrics, just to elaborate on that, if you can. I know things are still in ﬂux a bit, but if you can quantify that.","Julien, it's several hundred million dollars, we believe. We believe our regulated ﬂeet qualiﬁes and we operate very low cost, very low cost nuclear units. And so we will be working with our regulators on the appropriate way to recognize those beneﬁts. And those scenarios could have a range of passing it back over two years, three years, ﬁve years. And in the meantime, we have the opportunity to strengthen the balance sheet or the cash ﬂows, if you will, from those credits."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you, again. Good luck. See you soon.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We now have the next question from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead when you're ready.
"Hi, Lynn. So just I think you just answered this on Julien's question, but just to maybe ask again a little diﬀerently. So obviously, the cost cutting oﬀsets a lot of pressures in '23 in '24 and beyond, as you mentioned, the cost cutting moderates, and it goes through regulated rates also and -- but the holdco debt reﬁnancing and stuﬀ continues, assuming rates stay high. But it sounds like what you're thinking is that the improved cash ﬂow and performance at the utilities kind of could sustain the oﬀset? Is that how to think about beyond '23?","Steve, I would maybe expand the thinking to be a little broader on that. So we also use tools like interest rate hedging, which you would expect us to. We have $1 billion of proceeds from GIC coming in. we have the commercial renewable transaction. We have cost mitigation. We've sized it at $200 to $300 million in this year. That will carry forward, and we'll continue to look for ways to drive costs out of the business. We also have the IRA coming.  So I feel like we've got a variety of tools. And as we look at sort of the proﬁle into '24, even in this present environment, we don't have a lot of additional headwinds because of a relatively light maturity period. So I would think about all of those factors together and recognize that we are working very strategically to minimize these costs and to manage the business eﬀectively."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. Great. And then just in terms of thinking about kind of dividend growth, should we -- given that there is some kind of reset a little bit on the earnings, just should we assume you continue at kind of a rate below the earnings growth for another couple of years before you move it up into the earnings growth range?","Steve, it's a really good question. And one we're looking at closely, we had set a target of being in the 65% to 70% payout range. And in this 5-year period, we will be well positioned in that range. So our expectation would be to recommend a dividend increase at the right time in the 5-year period to match something closer to the growth in the business. But I think 2% is a good planning assumption for '23. We'll look at it again in '24 and beyond. But this is something that's getting a lot of attention in light of the derisking of the business in the light of the strength of the capital, the cash ﬂow we're anticipating and the work that we've done to moderate the payout ratio."
"I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit more around the load growth backdrop that you're seeing. And for the -- it sounded like ﬂat to 0.5% growth assumed into 2023. What are the puts and takes there? Is that conservative based on what you've seen so far this year? And then would be just curious on that industrial slowdown that you've seen, do you expect that to continue into 2023 as well? Is that factored in?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And David, I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to Brian. We use a conservative load growth assumption in our planning. We size our cost structure to be consistent with that. We -- but when I look at the strength of the economy that we are enjoying right now and the volumes that are coming through, we have -- we're very well positioned. And Brian made a comment in his remarks that we're already 2% above pre-pandemic levels, which I think is quite an extraordinary rebound. But Brian, how would you add to that and maybe talk a little bit about the industrial.     Sure. Yes. So ﬁrst, on the general economy, David, we continue to see migration into our territories. And it's driving both the residential and the commercial class. So those growth proﬁles are strong. And as Lynn said, we use conservative assumptions as we look out in future years to really size our business.  On the industrial side, we've seen some companies with planned shutdowns this quarter. So we don't feel like it's a trend that's going to linger. It was planned as well as some of the supply chain bottlenecks that continue to show up in diﬀerent pockets of industry. The automotive sector was one this quarter that surfaced. But again, those things are worked out over time and nothing systemic. So we're still bullish on all three sectors.     David, some of the statistics we shared with you on economic development are also noteworthy. And that's not even a complete list of what's happened in 2022. North Carolina was rated number one for business for a reason, which low tax environment and a good workforce, great university system, and we have had an extraordinary year from an economic development standpoint, and we expect that to show up over the ﬁve-year period."
"Got it. Thanks so much. That's helpful. And then was interested in just expanding a bit more on the cost reduction outlook into 2023. What are you seeing for inﬂationary pressures right now in the O&M budgets? Obviously, the backdrop has been tough in terms of inﬂation pressures, but you're expanding the cost reduction aspirations into next year. Wondering just how achievable that looks and what pressures you're seeing in the current environment?","We do see some inﬂationary pressures. I would point to materials. I would point to labor, but all of that, David was a part of the analysis that went into our cost reduction eﬀorts. So I don't see anything happening in the inﬂation environment that's impacting our commitment to drive these costs out of the business. And the other thing I would point to, a lot of the material inﬂation is showing up in our capital plan. And so, we're monitoring that as well to make sure that we're spending capital in a prudent way to beneﬁt customers."
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.,"Thank you.  Operator  We now have Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.     Hi, Nick."
"Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks. Hi. So I guess just -- thanks for the update on the CAGR. It sounds like you're now kind of including the inﬂation outlook going forward. So that's great. And I recall on just previous calls and talking about the CAGR, you kind of talked about getting to the higher end of the range as the multiyear rate plans kind of come into eﬀect and you kind of execute on this carbon plan. So I'm just curious if you could just update the investment community on if that dynamic still exists as we get to the out years here in the new CAGR? Thank you.","Yes. Nick, thanks for that question. Let me start by saying we believe our regulated business with this clean energy transition, $145 billion of capital over the 10 years has the potential to achieve at the high end of the range. But given the dynamic economic environment that we're in right now, we believe 5% to 7% is the right range to use for the planning assumption and know that we will work every year to be as well positioned within that range as we possibly can.  And we've talked about many of those puts and takes, IRA beneﬁts, reducing O&M, all of these things represent opportunities as the plan unfolds and then further this very meaningful regulatory activity that's underway is another key ingredient. The ﬁrst multi-year rate plan ﬁling for DEP occurred this year.  We're expecting another one -- another ﬁling for DEC in the coming year. So we're putting pieces in place and trying to address the macroeconomic environment at the same time. And we believe all of this given the premier regulating utilities that we oﬀer is a very strong value proposition for investors."
"Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to pivot to renewables real quick, acknowledging that you are moving away from the Commercial segment. But as you mentioned, you're doing a ton in the regulated arena. So just -- maybe just a general state of the state on what you're seeing in   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   the renewable supply chain at this point. I see that you're still kind of executing in Florida with the 300 megawatts that went into service in 2022 as planned. But just general kind of comments on supply chain and ability to kind of get things done in the ﬁve-year window. Thanks.","Nick, thank you for that. And I think as we've talked over the last year with some of the challenges in the supply chain. We have always leaned to our regulatory -- regulated business and make sure we have adequate supply. And we have extended our purchasing relationship with our suppliers to extend on a multiyear period so that we have conﬁdence around supply into '26 and beyond with options to continue.  We're putting similar arrangements in place for battery storage. So we are conﬁdent in our ability to execute the regulated plan and have just so many opportunities as we pursue this clean energy transition. We are working to make sure we've got the supply chain, the labor, et cetera, and have been successful so far and see that continuing."
"Hey. Good morning, Lynn. I just had a quick follow-up, hopefully, quick, on the interest expense into 2023. Any color, Brian, that you can share as to what level of rates -- interest rates are you using as we look out to 2023, particularly related to your variable there, so we can kind of do the sensitivity as we look out to the interest rate outlook here?","Durgesh, the sensitivity of 100 basis points, representing about $0.12 is probably the best and cleanest without getting into speciﬁc detail on commercial paper and long-term debt,   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   recognizing the tenor can ﬂuctuate. I think that's a really good proxy for you, and I would point you there."
"Thank you taking my question. A couple of questions here, if I may. First, with the sale of renewable business, does that present an opportunity for you to have conversations with rating agencies about reviewing and maybe improving your corporate trade trading? And what impact could it have on your borrowing costs?","Yes. So we keep a close relationship with the agencies. And by that, I mean sharing with them all of our plans, what we expect in terms of this transaction, the de-risking of the business, I wouldn't expect though, given the magnitude of this, Sophie, it's only 5% of the business that it would have an impact on downgrade threshold or anything of that sort. But it gives us an opportunity to de-risk. It gives us an opportunity to bring in some cash and all of that, it's important to the agencies, and we'll keep them apprised every step of the way."
"Got it. Thank you. And then on the cost-cutting initiatives you're talking about the total project that you're talking about the ring process, especially given the inﬂationary environment that we are in and how some of your peers are struggling to control costs right now. So could you just maybe share some, for example, I don't know about what you're planning to do there. So we can get a better sense of what the initiatives are with cost control? Maybe (inaudible) from the ground.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Yes. And Sophie, I appreciate that. And the 1 comment I would make is, this is where size and scale matters because we've had an opportunity to drive cost through the supply chain as a result of that size and scale that has been helpful but also a variety of other projects. We've been working on this over the course of the summer looking at work reduction eﬀorts.  And Brian, you might have some perspective that you would share on speciﬁc examples, maybe some of the reporting, the governance, the digital.     Yes, certainly, Sophie. And good morning. So we really took a fresh look at the entire corporation and said, how are we going to get the work done, we need to get done. We prioritized certain roles over others. So we said some roles had more purpose ﬁve years ago, and now they need to be repositioned. We looked at our real estate footprint and said, how can we optimize the real estate in this post-COVID world. So there was an opportunity there to really reduce the amount of corporate real estate we operate.  And we just looked at governance across the company and making sure that we maintain our controls, but while run a leaner organization. And it was really a grassroots eﬀort where we got input from all of our teammates to try to ﬁgure out what are the best areas to execute on. We have over 200 initiatives. So it isn't a one-shot thing. It's many, many small singles and bunts singles that are going to add up to this $200 million and that we've upsized to $300 million as we've looked at the opportunity set.     Sophie, one example in Brian(cid:0)s area that I would share, if you look at the amount of reporting that comes out of ﬁnance at Duke Energy, there's a lot of it. Not all of it results in decision- making. So we view this as an opportunity to sweep through what kind of information do we give our operating leaders in order to manage their business.  Similarly in IT, lots and lots of applications, right? Do we need all of them? Do we have applications that are only used for a handful of people? And can we transfer them? With that, you've got license fees, you've got cybersecurity expense. You have people who maintain those systems.  So it's things like that where you're just standing back and looking at all those corporate functions, the service levels we're oﬀering and determine is there a way to do it leaner and more eﬃciently using technology. And as you would expect, when you look every few years, if those things opportunities arise."
Thank you so much for the color. Very helpful.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Mike Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead when you're ready.     Hi, Michael."
"Hey, Lynn. Thank you for taking my question, and Brian, I think this is your ﬁrst earnings call, leading a CFO. Congrats. I may be wrong. I may be getting (Multiple Speakers)","It is, Michael. Thank you.     Everybody remembers their ﬁrst call, Michael. It's true."
"I could imagine. They should give out trophies or something like that. I'm a ﬁgure that out. Hey, a couple of questions. One, can you remind me -- one short term a little bit, Lynn, one is long term. Can you remind me the cadence and schedule for ﬁling both the North and South Carolina at Duke Energy Carolinas? That's question one.  Question two is kind of think of much longer term, which is many of the stakeholders in North Carolina in the carbon plan have expressed support for oﬀshore wind? And yet if you look at the company's developing oﬀshore wind in the U.S. You've got 1 company on the East Coast that's trying to back out of its PPAs, the signed contracts that they signed less than 1.5 years ago. You've got a large European operator and developer of U.S.-based oﬀshore winds in its earnings call this week that returns and the progress of developing and installing oﬀshore wind is facing headwinds.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Can you just kind of talk about your views of some of the -- I don't know, I'll call it oﬀshore wind still a bit of an emerging technology, but just kind of how you're thinking about the risk reward for Duke relative to doing something as signiﬁcant as that?","Yes, Michael, thank you. And let me -- I'll do ﬁrst rate cases. So Duke Energy Carolinas, North Carolina will be ﬁled in early 2023. You may recall that the sequence of these things, you host a technical conference to talk about the capital in the multiyear rate plan that occurred this week or last week recently. And then the rate case will follow. We have not yet announced timing or plans for a DEC case in South Carolina. So more to come on that, and we'll keep you updated along the way.  Oﬀshore wind is something that we believe is an option over this 2030, 2040, 2050 period here in the Carolinas. It represents diversity of supply. It is a renewable resource system. But as I say all of that, we also recognize it's expensive. It has transmission requirements, particularly here in the Carolinas, where you've got to get the power to the load centers that are further west than the coast.  And so the approach that we're taking is one of studying and learning more and also allowing the commission and stakeholders and the communities that could be impacted by both the oﬀshore and the onshore transmission to be involved as well. We will not move ﬁrst and we will not move outside of the regulated business.  So the risk reward for investors and customers has to be appropriate in order for us to move forward. And so I would say we're in evaluation mode. We think it's an important resource. We think it is important over this clean energy transition, but we're being deliberate and thoughtful and cautious as we move into it."
"Got it. And then last question, just on energy reliability. Just curious how you're thinking about the near term, meaning next 3 to 5 years for your coal generation ﬂeet, given the uptick in demand that you and some of your peers in the Southeastern states as well as in the Midwest. And just some of the details like in the Midwest and elsewhere, that the grid operators and others have put out concerned about near-term reliability constraints.","Michael, it's a really good question. And what I would say to you is as we contemplated the various scenarios we presented in the carbon plan, as we contemplated the integrated resource plan in Indiana. And in fact, we're updating that integrated resource plan in India to include the new planning assumptions that MISO requires consistent with those reliability concerns.  We will not present a plan that does not maintain reliability. And we will not retire assets that are needed to maintain reliability. And so that's something that is being closely monitored. Our regulators completely understand and support that. And so I think we just have to work our way through it. Making sure that we have replacement generation, transmission ready to go. The   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   combination of resources ready to go so that when we retire, our customers can expect reliability. That is our commitment, and that's the way we're planning and executing these transition plans."
