Question,Answer
"I wanted to follow up. When you gave a great update of the sort of the clean energy transition on that Slide 6 and calculated it pretty well, and I just wanted to explore the Carolinas a bit. You laid out on this page the North Carolina, the report to the Governor by the end of the year, and then in both case, you have IRP hearings. You've laid out pretty clearly sort of the trade-oﬀs of diﬀerent approaches to your future energy mix. How do you anticipate sort of the decision making process evolving? Do you see, for example, sort of heavy direction from the Governor in these cases or is it more sort of a collaborative hearing process where many constituents are going to weigh in and then ultimately, it's sort of a more of a commission driven decision? How do you kind of think about where you're headed there?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Sure. And Stephen, thanks for that question. I think the Governor has been very clear about his expectations in the form of his executive order that set a target of 70% carbon reduction by 2030. He has been directing the stakeholder process throughout 2020 through his Cabinet Secretary Regan to oversee it. And I would say that that stakeholder process has been a robust one, broad range of people involved, and has made signiﬁcant progress over the course of the year, identifying and aligning around common goals. So transitioning to generation ﬂeet over time, developing regulatory mechanisms that would incent that transition. And so I also believe that kind of points to broad support for critical infrastructure investments that will drive jobs and economic development, of course, chief carbon reduction, and achieve resiliency for the state.  So I believe the next steps on this will be shaping and updating of energy policy in North Carolina. If you look historically, about the way that has happened, Steven, it's always been led by stakeholders coming together to achieve common goals in a bipartisan way, Governor of course wing in with his expectation, stakeholder shaping the way to get there. And we see that process maturing in 2021 and expect that we, of course, will play a pivotal role in implementing that energy policy in a way that meets all of these objectives. I think the IRP is very complementary to that stakeholder process because it puts in front of the commission a variety of options on how those policy objectives could be achieved. And we would expect a review by the Commission and, of course, any input or feedback that they would have. And I think the combination of both of these processes will give us more clarity in 2021 on how we will move forward.  But I would emphasize again the alignment of stakeholders to achieve common objectives has always been the foundation of movement on energy policy in North Carolina and we would expect the same to be the case here."
"That's very clear. And I guess at a high level, looking at this stage, you kind of have a lot of at- bats in terms of the possibility of additional capital spending. And I just want to make sure I was clear -- let's say that the Duke is fortunate enough to have the opportunity for even more renewables spending, EV spending, whatever it might be, just to refresh in terms of your thinking of incremental CapEx and how you would ﬁnance that incremental CapEx.","So, Stephen, as you know, we put some incremental CapEx in the 5-year plan really underpinned by what we're seeing here in this generation transition. We have not changed the ﬁnancing plans that we shared with you in February. We continue to plan to issue DRIP and ATM equity in 2021 and 2022. As we get to the back end of that ﬁve-year plan and really build the momentum to accelerate rate base growth, I would expect for us to have a modest level of DRIP/ATM equity in the plan. We think that coupled with cost mitigation, regulatory support, and other elements that drive cash ﬂow would balance the needs of shareholders and creditors.  So we will provide that complete update on ﬁnancing in February. But your mind should go to the modest DRIP/ATM level as we think about the way we underpinned this growth investment going forward.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Understood. So if I'm sort of thinking about this correctly, didn't you already-- sort of thinking about some incremental CapEx, which you've described before, I mean these hearings and these processes are going to take a while anyway, so it's not as if it's an immediate impact to your ﬁnancing needs, and some of that was already sort of factored in. So it feels like even if you get good responses in these states, at ﬁrst it's going to take a while for that CapEx to actually transpire. Secondly, some of that was sort of already contemplated. And so it's not as if we're likely to see a fairly signiﬁcant change your plans, i.e., not massive new additional equity needs over and above what you've already laid out.","That's very fair. Stephen, if you-- on the slide that Steve walked you through, we updated capital from $50 billion to $56 billion in February, and that ﬁnancing plan underpins that $56 billion which is really the foundational element of the spending. This additional too and then ramping to $65 billion to $75 billion towards the back end is where would really be focused on your question initially. And we will be updating that. You should be thinking about the modest DRIP and ATM is ﬁrst place we would go to support that accelerated growth toward the back half of the planning period."
"Just a couple of quick questions here. First, around the $5.15 number through '21, obviously, this is sort of a worst case outcome as we think about coal ash, et cetera. And I know you'll talk a little bit more about it in February and you have some drivers in the slides. But maybe you can provide a little bit of a sense on some of the incremental items that could put you higher than that Slide 15, it's a lot of moving pieces here.","Sure, I'll point to three things that we're watching and then Steve can add to it. You know COVID load, we're continuing to look at what is load growth look like into 2021, is there a second wave, are there more economic shutdowns and so on or does the economy bounce back more strongly. As we said in the second quarter, and it continues to be our proﬁle, we intend to oﬀset COVID impact with O&M so that we lessen the impact of that. But understanding where that economic forecasters and how that matches up with cost would be something that we're watching. Maturing our cost management productivity to see how much of these savings that we've been able to drive out in '20 can continue into 2021, that work continues. We will start the year with a lower headcount. We have used technology in diﬀerent ways, we dispatched crews in diﬀerent ways, there have been so many opportunities, and we're looking for ways we can create even more sustainability. That represents a potential item. And then, of course, rate cases, we have set the $5.15 to absorb the dominion outcome on coal ash and we will learn more towards the end of this year, early next on the DEC order in particular. We will also hear from the Supreme Court, we believe, in 2020 on the prior rate case. So those are a couple of other things that we are monitoring. But we have-- as I look at 2021, there is so much clarity. We will have all of this behind us, the uncertainties that have been a challenge for us, and we're excited about the ability for the utilities to demonstrate the growth we know they're capable of without ACP, without rate case overhang, without coal ash, et cetera. And so we believe there is incredible opportunity in 2021 and then growth beyond. So, Steve, would you add anything to that?     Yes, the only thing I might add is that we will look to see the impact of the customer growth. We're seeing the highest customer growth numbers we've seen in several years in the Carolinas and Florida. So perhaps that can give us a pick-up as well.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Some of these New Yorkers, Shar, coming down to New Jersey."
"I am on my way. I'm on my way. And then obviously, you highlighted the Supreme Court pushed out the ruling until December of 11. Can you just maybe, Lynn, with that delay, talk a little bit about sort of the settlement strategy? How do you think discussions are going? Are they more or less constructive? And you've been obviously very vocal of the impact of not earning a return on the expenditures. Maybe it'd just helpful to the refresh your thoughts as we think about credit metrics and how we should think about potential equity or not and do of the Dominion order.","And so, Shar, let me go to the last part of the question ﬁrst. And that is, if we do receive the Dominion order from the NTUC, we do not intend to issue equity to cure the impact of a diﬃcult rate order. So that is the headline answer to that question, I think we will wait to hear from both of these parties to Supreme Court in the E&C you see on coal ash in December, early January. I do not expect that we will be reaching settlement on coal ash. I think all parties are interested in hearing with the court and Commission has to say but as I've said many times, we believe that coal ash as recoverable cost B&C do you see those as well.  We also believe that we are entitled to earn a return on cost that are collected over a long period of time. Consistent with the presence of rate-making in the state and also consistent with the requirements of strong credit for the utility. So we will await ruling later this year."
"Got it. And then just lastly on just to follow up on Stephen's question around the alternative regulation Group. It sounds like it's going to mature in '21, do you sort of anticipate a bill forming in '21. And then just remind us like a bill that sort of the max potential ROE bands or PVRs, does that sort of really act to minimize some regulatory lag or could that be sort of incremental or accretive to your current growth trajectory of the proﬁle of how you're guiding our growth.","Those are good questions. Shar, and I do believe that legislation could spring from this clean energy process in the recommendations coming out of the report to not only such some parameters around transition of the ﬂeet, but also those regulatory reform changes that you're talking about the objective of the regulatory reform would really be to incent and enable the energy policy in the state and to the extent it reduces regulatory lag.  It is good. It is good for customers, It is good for investors and that will be an objective as we talk about the way regulatory reform would play out I think about grid investment in particular it's so important to this transition and grid investment needs a diﬀerent regulatory model than what we have here in North Carolina and there's a lot of good discussion going on about that as part of these processes.    Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hi guys, good morning. On the, is the upside for 515 in 2021 is that only apply 2021. In other words, would you intend to keep the base at 515 even if you were able to ﬁnd some savings for next year.","I think we'll cross that bridge to [ph]come to us invite[ph]. I appreciate that question. I do feel like we've got a lot of uncertainties behind us, we've got a clean picture for 2021. But just like any business year you have things to tackle we're tackling Covid and O&M and we're also working to progress the Clean Energy plan. So Steve, would you add to that in anyway.     You're right, we don't have that speciﬁcity now, but whatever we anchor to we're going to have a growth trajectory from that point forward, that I think is going to be very clear in throughout the period that we're projecting forward on. certainly have a rate base growth there.     Yes. Industrial as is clear.     That's correct."
"Yes and Steve, when you were negotiating after the tax rate reductions, a few years ago, when you're negotiating with the regulators to keep cash ﬂows intact, what would be the outcome of a higher tax rate going forward, but you do you think there'll be room for additional FFO to debt improvements there if such a thing were to happen going forward.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Yes. So I think that would ultimately happen what you'd see here if you saw an increase in the federal tax rate, people have talked about moving from 21% to 28%. It would just move in the opposite direction of what we did in 2018. You would see the holding company tax shield be more beneﬁcial to the tune of $0.05 or $0.06 per share at the operating company levels once enacted the higher tax rate, we would start deferring the additional income tax expense, and then we'd work with regulators on increasing the rates to reﬂect the increase in the tax expense, which is the opposite of what we did back in 2018 through 2020 and that would result in an increase in cash ﬂow and would help FFO there.  We estimate that type of impact would be in the neighborhood of 2% customer rates, but they've seen larger decreases as we've implemented the the 2018 Reform Act. So I do think it provides cash ﬂow beneﬁts in that fashion."
"Great, thank you very much. That's all I have for now. Thank you.","Thank you, Mike.  Operator  Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"At the time of --Hey. All right. First, perfunctory question, just wanted to see, I haven't heard meeting strategic here, but the following media reports in recent weeks and months anything can oﬀer runs strategic remarks up, I'll just leave that open-ended. And then I've got some more substantive questions if I can.","And so, Julien. Are you talking about market rumors on M&A?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Yes, I just wanted to see if there's anything that you would oﬀer on that.","Okay, all right. I'm sorry.  So I, building on your comment about strategic things for the Company, our focus is on the strategy of clean energy transition. It's on the strategy of building the stakeholder support in the Carolinas to move forward on regulatory reform and infrastructure investment. And so our focus is on driving that organic growth, which were we believe is extraordinary, not only in terms of rate base investment customer growth and driving jurisdictions. So that's what I would say our focus is on Julien, and we feel like the future is bright as we've laid out here and we'll continue to build on, as we give you more insight in February."
"No, I appreciate that. Just wanted to make sure. All right. So back to perhaps more substantive measures. As you think about the transitioning here from the Clean Energy plan and the reports to the Governor, what pieces are resonating best I can tell thus far with that stakeholder group. And I know we're still few weeks away, but as you would in an attempt to try to capture the preponderance of diﬀerent views here, what are those regulatory buckets for reforms that are still on the table versus perhaps those that means less relevant today, if you can try to capture that in your mind.","Yes, you know, it's a good question. Julien, because a lot of things have been discussed and I think it's been a good exchange of information feedback education point of view being shared. I think at the top level, the regulatory reform is really focused on how can we incent the development of this critical infrastructure and the associated reduction in carbon. So things like multi-year rate plans are being discussed decoupling is being discussed and we believe there is a lot of interest in those types of tools in order to move this forward performance based rate making, it would be another thing that I would point to. Because you can tie achievement of certain outcomes to performance-based rate making. So those are the things I would point to at this point.  And as the processes continues, we may recall there in two pieces carbon policy in one, regulatory reform in the other, carbon policy will ﬁnd its way to the Governor's desk by the end of the year. Regulatory reform will also be kind of wrapping up in that time frame. And as, as we reach critical milestones will update of course so along the way."
"Got it. Sorry, it's one quick clariﬁcation, if I can. With respect. Keep your conﬁdence on cost we consider. Do you think you'll be able to earn at your authorized there are least in the Carolinas.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Going forward, even with electricity in order.","So if you look at our track record on earning our allowed rate of return. Julien, it's been very good and we expect to be able to earn at our allowed rate of return going forward. Steve, would you add to that.     Yes, I think absolutely we've got a long history of utilizing various levers, whether it's O&M cost control expanding wholesale sales just working optimizing our regulatory schedule to earn our allowed return on our growing rate base and so we'll continue to employ those tools as we go forward, regardless of any particular rate outcome."
"All right, exactly. All right, perfect. Thank you, guys, and best of luck here--",Thank you. Julien.  Operator  Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
"Hi, Lynn. So just a little bit more follow-up on North Carolina. The -- I think you did mentioned that you kind of work with both sides of Ohio. I think the Governor, one Democrat but the legislature state Republican just thinking about trying to turn these working groups and do a law. How much is that going to be a challenge in 2021?","Steve, I would say that historically energy policy North Carolina has moved in a bipartisan way and the beneﬁt of having diverse stakeholders together as you have voices from business community from the manufacturing community from low-income from the environmental   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   constituents, you've got the administration of the table as well. And I believe critical infrastructure focus not only an environment, but on job creation has a durability or in appeal to both sides of the aisle.  And I believe we'll play a role and working with both sides to bring that bring that intersection together so we approach this with great optimism and enthusiasm from the alignment we've been able to be a part of in 2020 and we'll keep the conversations going."
Great. And I guess outside of getting legislation can some of these potential changes be implemented without that just by the Commission directly--,"It's interesting if you look at the-- Yes. If you look at the IRP we've got everything from a base plan to the more aggressive early retirements of coal and so on that base plan can be executed immediately because it's within the regulations in North Carolina. It has renewable investment that has storage investment in a variety of things. So there is a lot that can be done without any changes. I think as we look at some of the more new technologies like oﬀshore wind and other things like that having some legislative support around achieving those targets and embracing new technologies.  So I think would be helpful to any investor in the state as well as to the Commission. So you can think about that IRP is providing a menu of options that we can get going even absent changes on the transition up to, I think that the base plan is a 50% to 55% carbon reduction under existing statutes."
"Thanks so much for all the information on this slide, I just have two quick ones more related to Slide 12 and the growing CapEx proﬁle. I guess ﬁrst how much of that CapEx is maybe rider eligible and in the company is kind of winding down hopefully resolution of kind of one thing on a rate case cycle, how much could that get including rates without a rate ﬁling you entering another rate case cycle and then the follow up would be, it appears that the service territory has a signiﬁcant amount of investment opportunities, especially the banking. The other companies, what's the limitation there, is it balance sheet? Is it rate impact? And I'll leave it at that.","So in the Carolinas, Anthony, the regulatory structure is still a rate base rate case type structure. I think as we think about this regulatory reform, multi-year rate planning decoupling performance-based rate making are in the conversation and our hope and expectation is there will be some adjustment to that regulatory process we have not laid out any speciﬁc timing for rate cases, we've just ﬁnished a rate case here in 2020. So we would not expect us to come in the short term on --     Right. I would agree with that. The Carolinas we're working to put into place some mechanisms that help as Lynn said this growing investment proﬁle that we have going forward. Our gas businesses and in the Midwest and Florida, we have mechanisms in place and they worked very well for us, whether it's rider mechanisms or multi-year rate planning or decoupling on the gas side. So we're very familiar with those. We're advancing the ball in the Carolinas with this dialog and I think we'll, we'll make some progress as we move forward.     And on the second part of the question around constraints, Anthony we always planned capital within, what I would call a reasonable expectation of impact the customer price. So as we talked about in the integrated resource plan discussion on, the base plan is about a 1% increase in customer rates per year as you get more aggressive, It could go up to 2.5% that includes oﬀsets for fuel and O&M and so on, that would be a part of the transition.  So we always keep an eye on price. And in addition to those tools of fuel and O&M that will come naturally from transitioning the generation. We also continue to very aggressively drive cost out of the business through digitization through changes in process, all forms of automation and that will continue to be an objective to keep prices low for customers."
"Great, thanks for taking my questions. And looking forward to connecting the EEI with the team.",Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Thank you. I appreciate that.  Operator  Your next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Go ahead.
"I think you've touched on 2021 O&M a bit here, but just thinking about that a bit more is the timing of 2020 outages kind of main driver of higher 2021 O&M, are there other factors to think about here? And how should we think about 2021 O&M versus '19 as a base year in kind of what is the trajectory look like longer term as the pandemic subsides.","Sure. Lynn had mentioned and I had mentioned outages as as being one thing that potentially could put some ups upward pressure on O&M, going forward, we'll also look at variable compensation that's another area of that, we have ﬂex on that could see an increase in 2021. So we'll continue to look at that. I'd say those are a couple of areas there. When you think about our O&M trajectory as a whole, we started back in 2015 at $5 billion of non-recoverable O&M if you will. And in 2019, we, that was at $4.9 billion and that included absorbing $280 million to $300 million at Piedmont because they were acquired during that period of time.  That gives you an idea of the savings that we've been able to generate through this very concerted eﬀort of business transformation. We're going to come in lower in 2020 because of all of the tactical eﬀorts that we've put in place to replace the topline revenue loss, that will move up in 2021 but I suspect the downward trajectory is going to continue in 2021 over 2019 will be ﬁrming that up as we go forward, but our sustainable reductions will continue. I do believe that.     And what we're trying to do, Jeremy. As we've said, a couple of times is load continues to represent a headwind in 2021. We do not see it quite back to 2019. Based on our projections, although we would be delighted to be surprise to the upside will keep under control. Consistent with that weakness in the top-line as we think about 2021."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Great, that's very helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks.","Thank you, Jeremy.  Operator  Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Go ahead."
"(inaudible) covered, but could I just could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the renewables development space for the commercial business and just remind us where, where that sort of ﬁts into how you are talking about the growth outlook.","Jonathan We continue to see a lot of project opportunity and pipeline of contracts and projects under development. We have targeted $200 million to $250 million of net income over the ﬁve- year period and we have a clear line of sight to achieving that during the during the ﬁve years. So we feel very good about the business, when you couple that expertise with the renewables that we're building in the regulated business. I feel like the team is doing a good job of understanding the integration of the resources, how to develop and build them cost eﬀectively and so that's what you can expect kind of a $200 million to $250 million contribution from commercial renewables going forward."
"Great, thank you. And then just if I may. Then on your comment about seeing upside potential to the FY 15. I'm just curious, be, could I know this has been covered, but is that incremental comfort that you've developed since you've left put that number out there or really just articulating kind of a path that you already on more clearly.","Probably a little bit more comfort Jonathan in that we've got three more months behind us on COVID our forecast for that have been pretty accurate in terms of net income, but we'll be watching it over, November and December, with a second wave and the rate cases, we've   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   always been out there is something that represents a, an opportunity, and then we talked about cost management.  We're going through everything we've done in 2020 to challenge whether it's achievable in 2021 and that work as part of our normal process. Steve leads in connection with the ﬁve-year plan. So, probably a little more conﬁdence because we've got three more months of experience. Steve, how would you add.     Yes, I would agree with that. We are starting to ﬁrm up what we can, what we've learned from COVID on cost reductions and we'll continue to drive that out and that's always helpful to our plan. So, well, we'll be continuing to push on this and drive more detail as we go forward."
