Question,Answer
"A couple questions. When I'm looking at the earnings guidance, one, I noticed that there was a signiﬁcant increase in expected earnings contribution from the Commercial Renewables segment 2019 over 2018. So can you talk about how you're driving that? Is that from taking in ITCs or is that just a big step-up in expected investment and getting plants on line?  And then, the second question as it relates to that is if I look at the overall expectation for what AFUDC earnings were going to be from ACP in 2019 before the delay versus now, how much of a change was that that you had to overcome?","Sure, Greg. Thanks. On Commercial Renewables, we have just seen a lot of market opportunity. And as we look back at our history in this business, there are times as customers not only have an interest in renewables but there is interest in pursuing the tax credits to a great extent. We've seen a bit of a cyclical nature to this and have had a good track record in pursuing and achieving wins with a number of these projects. So you're seeing the beneﬁt of that in 2019. It includes both wind and solar projects. And we have the majority of what is reﬂected in 2019 guidance already committed based upon work that the team has had underway in 2018. So I think about the portfolio of businesses that we operate, commercial is a part of them. And when we have an opportunity to pursue growth, we do that. And you're seeing that in 2019.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I think when you look at allowance for funds, one of the other things to keep in mind on allowance for funds trend is we did put a large capital project in service at the end of 2018, that's Citrus. And so some of the trend line that you see between 2018 and 2019 is a result of that in-service date of that generating station.  I think in terms of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, there is no question that even as early as four months ago, we were expecting more capital to be deployed in 2019. You may remember when we talked in November, we were projecting an in-service in 2019 for part of the project and the rest in 2020. So we have a slowdown in that spending that resulted from some of the court decisions in December, and we have reﬂected that in our guidance. We continue to remain committed to the plan and will work through this, committed to the project, but I think we have some work to do around the court challenges in order to get construction going again."
"Great. Just to follow up on the ﬁrst answer. So the pace of activity is higher and that's fantastic. Congrats on that, on the renewables segment. But is the earnings contribution partially driven by monetization of tax credits, either ITCs or through tax equity? And then is that what's driving the big increase?","Sure. There's certainly tax equity included in those results, Greg. You may recall that we've been talking about tax equity. As we had more clarity from tax reform on what our own tax position was, we have been pursuing tax equity. We closed our ﬁrst project in July and have continued and plan to continue using that technique as we go forward. And so what you see in 2019 is not only investment tax credit related to solar but there's also wind in those numbers."
"Okay. I've got more questions, but I'll go to the back of the queue. Thanks. Bye.","Thank you, Greg.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Michael.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Hi, Mike."
"Hi, Lynn. Good morning. Hey, just a follow-up on Greg's question. So when you take in tax equity, you're booking that as earnings? Is that true?","Steve, you want to talk about tax equity?     Yes. The utilization of tax equity in the ﬁnancing does guide you to certain accounting rules. And on most of these renewable projects, whether it's tax equity or not, a lot of the recognition of the earnings is driven by the tax beneﬁts, which is in the early stage of the project. Tax equity doesn't change any of that. The tax equity structures, however, do vary in how quickly income is recognized in solar and wind projects. So it's not all up-front necessarily. But most of these renewables projects, certainly with tax equity and also without are going to have earnings recognition in the early years depending on PTCs or ITCs."
"Got you. Can you quantify how much of the $230 million is from tax equity and tax credits? And then related question to that is, the guidance going forward 4% to 6% through 2023, what happens to the Commercial Renewables segment during that period? Is this a contributor to that 4% to 6% or as tax credits perhaps fall oﬀ, is that a subtractor from it? Maybe you can ﬁll us in on that.","Yeah, Mike, I would respond to the ﬁrst part of the questions by saying tax attributes are an important part of the net income for anyone who invests in renewables. So, you should think about it that way. And I think over the ﬁve-year period we see Commercial Renewables based on the pipeline that's in front of us having a more meaningful impact in the early part of the plan. And then I would think about over the longer term our approach being opportunistic, again if we see demand we'll pursue it but we really look at this business as being complementary to the 4% to 6% growth that we're driving in the utilities."
Another just one more question on earnings growth. Did you actually quantify how much of the AFUDC drop-oﬀ in 2019 is impacting earnings?,"All of the AFUDC. I'm not sure I understand the question, Michael. Could you do that again?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Also you said that the rate base growth is 6% going forward and you used to talk about 7% as a result of tax reform from the return of excess deferred taxes. Is that still a possibility? Is there still – is it just that the return of excess deferred taxes is slower in the early years and that's why you're still at 6%? Or is 7% still possible?,"You know, Mike, I think there's always upside potential on regulated investment. We just progressed our guidance a year forward and 6%, we believe, is a good planning assumption. We focus on the 2019, 2020, 2021 most heavily and will continue to develop and originate investments into 2022, 2023. But I think 6% is a really solid plan, and we do have upside potential.     And, Mike, I think some of the math here comes into play. When you've got a starting year that does not have the eﬀect of tax reform in it and then you've got a change such as we saw in the out years, that can lead to a higher percent. It depends on what year you're starting. If you're starting with a year that has the impact of tax reform layering in throughout the period, that can aﬀect the percent. But as Lynn said, our early years have very strong growth. Typically the out years we develop as we move along. 6% is a good number for our rate base growth."
Thanks a lot for the update.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir."
"A question just on – I understand you've rebased the starting point for the 4% to 6% growth to $5. But you were saying before that you expected to sort of dip below oﬀ of the original base and then kind of get to the high end at the end of the plan. It doesn't seem to be what you're saying now oﬀ the new base. So, I just want to clarify whether we should still be thinking that or whether it's more sort of middle of the range would be a core assumption from this new base.","Jonathan, we committed to delivering at the low end of the range for 2019 and we've done that by hitting the $5. And then we set 4% to 6% oﬀ of $5 which is within that guidance range we had talked about previously. But certainly, the midpoint has been aﬀected by the near-term uncertainty around Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both the schedule delay and the cost increase.  And so, as we look at 2019, if Atlantic Coast Pipeline goes quickly, we do still have the potential to get to the high end of the range in 2020 but we believe a planning assumption within that range is more realistic until we can work through these legal challenges. So, we just thought it was appropriate given where we are with that project to reset the base. But I think there's a great deal of overlap between what we've given you here and where we were previously and we continue to believe strongly that we have a strong growth plan that we've put in front of you."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. And then just a quick housekeeping one, I noticed you had a fairly sizable write-oﬀ at the Citrus County in the fourth quarter. Why would that be?","We're in the middle of ﬁnalizing a contractual dispute with Fluor, Jonathan. You may have seen some press coverage of this as they've been ﬁnalizing that project. We are in the middle of this and, from an accounting standpoint, recognized exposure. But that isn't the end of the story. We still have legal remedies that we're pursuing that we would expect to resolve in 2019."
"Okay. Thank you, Lynn. And then just one other thing, it's been reported, I think, in the press and also exciting Duke spokesperson that you're one of the bidders pursuing Santee Cooper. I just wonder if you could speak to that at all and speciﬁcally what your criteria would be? Just remembering back to Piedmont, you talked about it being very unique and adjacent, and therefore something that was very high priority for the company. So, I'm just curious if you have any comments.","Jonathan, throughout the process that South Carolina has undertaken, our objective has been to support the state and the state has called for and been actively seeking investment interest in Santee Cooper. We are one of the four parties that has met the qualiﬁcations. We have submitted a couple of proposals for the state to consider. But I would also say this is very early stage. There's a law that needs to be passed, the General Assembly needs to make some decisions. And that could take some time here in 2019. So, we remain committed to our organic growth plan and supporting the state of South Carolina as they look at alternatives."
"Okay. I think I'll leave it there. Thanks very much, guys.","Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
"Most of my questions were answered. But Steve, let me ask you because you talked about the drag from the AFUDC and the pushing out of ACP. Does your current outlook include refunds from the unprotected ADIT that could potentially have an eﬀect of actually raising the rate base? So, I'm kind of curious. I mean, obviously if you look at the guidance now and the rebasing, it looks somewhat a little bit lower than the prior guide. How is the refunds of unprotected ADITs, how does that play into the growth picture?","Well, yeah, Shar, we have worked with our regulatory commissions in the various states on the handling of income tax refunds related to the Tax Act [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act] and the excess deferred tax ﬂowbacks, and that's incorporated into our plan. It will vary per jurisdiction. Some states are giving it back over a 10-year period, some states are oﬀsetting it with other types of costs such as storm costs in Florida. But that's being weaved through the plan, and that does have the impact of raising rate base as well, and we do have that as a growth item in our rate base that we've talked about in the past. So, that's in there."
"Okay. So, it's in there. Okay. And then, Lynn, I know you're working through legislation around grid mod and how to think about potentially getting a rider mechanism. But assuming legislation doesn't time the well the way you're anticipating, you guys are going to be in for serial ﬁlings on an annual basis. So, how should we think about the spending of that proﬁle, assuming that you don't get legislation, maybe the commission approves trackers, but if you don't and you're going to be in rate cases, do you see any sort of downside to that grid mod spend?","You know, Shar, I think the capital we've put in front of you is capital that we would spend under the rate case scenario as well. So, we have contemplated both scenarios in our long-term guidance, so I don't see a lot of downside to grid spend as a result of what you're describing."
"Okay. Got it. And then just lastly on Santee Cooper. Obviously, the bids are conﬁdential but can you just maybe elaborate whether there would be an interest to do a management service agreement around that system versus an outright acquisition?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So, Shar, we have looked at both of those and have put proposals on the table that would accomplish both objectives."
"Hey. So, just a few clariﬁcations of some prior questions here. Just starting out on the Commercial Renewables spending plan. Is that mostly contemplated to be solar just as we start to calibrate our models on future tax credits, obviously, ITC versus PTC?  And then also, just given the diﬀering accounting treatment, that's a one-year accounting on the ITC, not ﬁve-year, right?","So, let me catch up on that for a moment, Julien. There's a mix of solar and wind in both 2019 and 2020. I would say a little heavier solar in 2019 but a mix of both in both years. And under the accounting model that Steve was talking about before, you do have an opportunity for a range of recognition. Two years to seven, I think, on solar; and then PTC. So, Steve, you want to add to that?      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Well, that's right. What Lynn referred to is correct. You can structure the solar deals with tax equity so that the income recognition can be spread over one to seven years, as an example. And we'll do what suits us and makes the most sense to us in that situation. The wind projects, the PTC recognition is typically over the seven-year period."
"Right. Absolutely. And just to go back to the question about what's reﬂected in the outlook, maybe squaring the last question, the procurement that you talked about, I believe North Carolina earlier up to 800 megawatts, is that contemplated in the outlook that you're disclosing now, ﬁrst? And then separately with respect to that, also just curious, is that all outside or within the utility just with respect to where you're allowed or intend to participate from?","So on HB 589, I think, Julien, is your question for North Carolina, so we have over the ﬁve-year period put some additional capital in Commercial Renewables reﬂecting the potential impact of HB 589. And all of that capital is sitting in Commercial Renewables. So you may if you compare back to last year you'll see about $1 billion more, which is reﬂecting of not only market conditions but also what we hope to pursue in North Carolina."
"Got it. Thank you. And then one quick clariﬁcation here. The ACP range that you've delineated $7 billion to $7.8 billion, is that slightly diﬀerent than what Dominion talked about at $7 billion to $7.5 billion? I know this is a little picky, but just curious, any slight changes, or is this more about the conﬁguration that you guys are thinking about?","Julien, I appreciate that question because it's right on top of what Dominion disclosed. They just talked about it in two phases, so $7 billion to $7.5 billion, assuming more timely resolution of the Appalachian Trail. If the Appalachian Trail goes to the Supreme Court, they said another couple of hundred million. All we did was put the whole range together."
Thanks.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta of Citibank. Please go ahead.
"Morning. Hi. So maybe with all the earnings questions addressed mostly, maybe we touch on credit. As we look at slide 15, ﬁrstly, you talked about equity issuance is going up a little bit through the plan. Is that driven by pressure from the agencies to kind of shore up the credit a little bit, or can you just give us a little bit more color of what speciﬁcally was driving the increase in equity need?","Yeah, so, Praful, we are committed to our ratings. As you know, we've demonstrated that with our response to tax reform. And as we look at the increase in cost in Atlantic Coast Pipeline that we're projecting, as well as the fact that we spent $1 billion this year on storm response, we thought it was appropriate to bring some additional equity into the plan in the form of the DRIP and ATM. This gives us some ﬂexibility for uncertainty. And we've also talked about the fact that we will consider pursuing securitization of the storm cost, as well, which we think is positive for credit. So all of this is within the context of maintaining the commitment to our balance sheet while also responding to impacts to the business."
"Got you. That's super helpful then. So in terms of the FFO-to-debt metric then as I look at again slide 15, the AMT credit I'm assuming is helping support the credit and the FFO-to-debt through the 2020 timeframe. But it seems to be going up even though the AMT is rolling oﬀ by 2022. So just wanted to understand like what's driving the uptick in FFO-to-debt in that 2021 to 2023 timeframe even though AMT is in fact rolling oﬀ during that same period.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Sure. Steve, you want to take that?     Sure. Praful, a couple of things are happening here. Number one, we've got the expiration or the conclusion of the heavy spend on coal ash in the Carolinas that will end essentially in 2019. And then, that spend level will drop. So as you get coal ash expenditures built into rates and the actual cash expenditures go down, that can certainly help cash ﬂows.  In Florida, we've had in 2018 three generation projects – Citrus County, Osprey, Hines Chillers – go into rates. So those will turn into cash annuities as well. In 2019, we will complete the Western Carolinas Modernization Project and get that into rates, and that's over $1 billion of investment. So we've got a number of activities that are aligned there. Additionally, when Atlantic Coast Pipeline goes into service in 2020, 2021, in that type timeframe, when that's completed, that will turn into a strong cash annuity. So we've got some big projects rolling through rates that will help push up FFO."
"Got you. Perfect. And then just ﬁnally, just clarifying, in 2020 the increase in holdco debt, is that driven by the increase in Commercial Renewables investment that's funded by parent debt or is there something else driving the 33% to 34% holdco debt in 2020 timeframe?","Well, I think you've got a couple of things going on here. You've got certainly the delay in ACP, so that puts some pressure there. We've got expansion of the Commercial Renewables as well, those types of issues as we have lag on recovering hurricane cost of over $1 billion, that can put some stress on holding company debt as well. So those are some things I'd point to.     Yeah. Praful, I wouldn't point to any single item. I think this is kind of just the ﬁnancing of the whole picture including the results of 2018 and what we're looking at for 2019."
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One or two just minor items when I think about the Commercial Renewables business. How do you think about what's the right scale and size of this business? Meaning relative to everything else, when you're thinking longer term and kind of what you want that business to look like relative to the core regulated subsidiaries?","Michael, I would say it's complementary. But given the size of the regulated businesses we operate on electric and gas, it will always be a modest contributor. We're talking about $200 million of net income. So we'll continue to grow it opportunistically. We think there's an incredible wave of support for renewables. We think it's the growing part of the generation portfolio in the U.S. We want to be a part of it. But it will take a long time for it to have a meaningful percentage impact on the portfolio of the company given the size and the growth proﬁle of what else we operate."
"Got it. But when you think about the Commercial Renewables business and its growth rate that's embedded in your multiyear four or ﬁve-year EPS growth rate guidance, do you assume that that business like the gas utility and pipeline business grows at a faster rate than the core electric utilities, does it grow more in line with the electrics or beneath that? I'm just trying to parse a little bit about what's in the guidance levels.","Yeah. So, it grows faster in the short-term part of the plan, Michael, and levels oﬀ in the back part. By the time 2023 rolls around, we begin to enter a period where we have some wind projects reaching their PTC expiration. So, I would think about it as being a stronger contributor in the front end than the back end."
"Got it. And then last one, just curious, tax rate and guidance seems to be a little bit on the low side. Is that anything at the utilities or is that all – and I think someone touched that. Is that all just related to tax credits as you bring assets in the service on the Commercial Renewables side? And then should we assume that that consolidated tax rate stays at that level through the whole guidance period or does it creep up over time?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Michael, the tax rate could change over time. We've lowered it because primarily the giveback of EDIT. We're starting to push those taxes back through to rates in our various jurisdictions, and that'll push the eﬀective tax rate down. Now, there's an oﬀset in revenues, as you give these taxes back in lower rates, but it will change the eﬀective tax rate.  Now, the addition of renewables and the credits associated with that will also push it down, but a player in here is the excess deferred taxes that are being given back. So, as we move through time, we'll look at how that excess deferreds are giving back, whether that's ratable or whether there's ﬂuctuations in that and those types of things plus the renewables cycling up or down. Those things could push the eﬀective tax rate around a bit."
"Good morning. My ﬁrst question is on the outlook for CapEx at Midstream. How much of that is more than just – of the $2.9 billion included, how much of that is more than just the main ACP. In other words, do you have expansions at ACP? Do you have other greenﬁeld projects? What else is in that bucket, please?","It's primarily ACP, Andrew. We've actually dialed back in this ﬁve-year plan expansion capital until we have a better sense of in-service and completion of this project. We have a little bit of placeholder capital, maybe $250 million sitting out there in 2022, 2023 but I would think of it is primarily ACP."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. How would you describe your appetite for more greenﬁeld Midstream construction going forward? If you saw another opportunity come along, how willing would you be to jump on it?","That's a really good question, Andrew. You're catching us mid cycle here in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We're a believer in the infrastructure. I think one of the things that gets overlooked in this discussion of these pipelines is how critical they are to our customers. And we think about our Piedmont system and the need to continue to provide pressure for growth in that area. We think about the infrastructure in North Carolina supporting economic development and our power system which has a lot of renewables in the eastern part of the state. So, we're a believer in the infrastructure investment. We've learned a lot about how to move through these, the stakeholder engagement that's important, the permitting, etcetera. So we like the business, I think, but we'd be thoughtful about what opportunities exist that we might want to pursue."
"Got it. Makes sense. And just a quick one on the dividend. Before I ask the question, could you repeat what was the targeted payout ratio you had for ﬁve years out?","So we have indicated a range of 65% to 75%, Andrew, but would like to moderate our payout ratio. We're above 75% today. By the end of the ﬁve-year period, we'd like to be closer to 70%. Still committed to strong growth of the dividend. We think our yield is very attractive. We have a longstanding history of growing the dividend but believe that some moderation of the payout ratio positions the company for more sustainable growth given our robust capital plan."
"Okay. So, but just to clarify here, back of the envelope math to me suggests around a 3.5% CAGR. You've previously guided to 4% to 6% just as recently as EEI. What would you say were the biggest delta event as far as being a bit more conservative on the dividend growth?","I think this near-term uncertainty that we've experienced around Atlantic Coast pipeline, Andrew, where we're looking at 2020 and 2021 as being inﬂuenced in that way. And then as we think about $1 billion of hurricanes that we've experienced, we also think about our desire to continue growing with a very robust capital plan. We believe all those things taken together represent a very attractive dividend plus growth proﬁle for our investors and think that moderating the dividend payout ratio as part of that whole picture makes a lot of sense."
