Question,Answer
So I'm starting on sort of the commercial news. There is a lot of renewable assets out there for sale right now. I guess what prompted the process? Why now? Did you get unsolicited oﬀers? And maybe just ﬁne [ph] tuning on timing as we're thinking about presentation packages being sent out and data rooms being set up. Thanks.,"Sure. And you know, Shar, what I would say on timing is we have been looking at this for some time. I think you have known us to review our portfolio and make strategic decisions about the future a number of times in our history. And this is no exception to that. As we look at the pipeline of regulated investment that is in front of us over the next many years, we believe this is the right time to step back and really look at the strategic ﬁt of the commercial business, because there is going to be competition for capital at Duke.  And we think we operate a very strong commercial business that can grow and grow well in the future. And we want to take the opportunity to evaluate as we're a better strategic owner at this moment. And as I think about other portfolios in the market, I believe there will be a robust market for these assets, given that it's not only operating assets, but also the development pipeline, a platform, a team of very capable developers and operators. So I think they have the potential to add a great deal of value.  And if I focus just a moment on the pipeline, we have a gig to a gig and half of near-term projects that could be quite valuable in 2024, 2025, in addition to what we had planned for   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   2023. So when we think about our timing for execution, we commented that we will be completing the strategic review by the end of '22 into early '23. We will move quickly to get information into the market. There is an interest in these types of assets from a broad range of buyers and would hope Shar to have more to share as we think about third quarter EEI, and then moving into February of next year."
"Got it. And then just from a numbers perspective, I know you've highlighted that there could be a time in the future where you could need some equity to fund the incremental regulated capital growth opportunities that are out there for you. Could this potential sale, I guess, provide enough balance sheet capacity in and threshold improvements where future equity needs are oﬀ the table, even as capital growth opportunities accelerate. And just remind us what the basis in tax leakage is on the asset? Thanks.","Yes. So, Shar, it's a really good question. And as we look at our potential to accelerate and what we believe the potential from this transaction represents, we do think it would postpone equity into the future. But I think we're getting a little bit ahead because I don't want to comment on value. We have given you an indication that we think the right bias right now is to use the proceeds to avoid debt. It's a high interest rate environment, inﬂation, a variety of other uncertainties around the economy. But I do think it strengthens the balance sheet at a moment when we see accelerated capital and that would lead to a period in which we can delay any further equity issuances.  On tax leakage, let me turn to Steve just to make a comment on that.     Yes, Shar, a couple of comments here. The book value of this body of assets is approximately $4 billion and that would include about $1 billion of tax attributes. And we don't see any signiﬁcant tax leakage, if a transaction were to occur."
"Got it. And then just one last one from me and I'll jump back in the queue, Steve is, there is a viewpoint that you may need to re-base. I mean is that a scenario or do you feel that just given the robust nature of the process and the demand for renewables that you could more than sort of oﬀset, sort of that lost earnings and maintain the current trajectory? Thanks.","So Shar, I don't want to comment on 2023 guidance at this point. I feel like the process is thoroughly -- we're going to be testing the market on value. We have given you a sense of how we're thinking about use of proceeds at this point. But what I would point you to is if we are successful in executing a robust transaction, which we have every conﬁdence, we will, then Duke Energy lessons volatility, we increased transparency, we draw focus and attention to this   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   regulated business, which I would say is one of the strongest franchises in the US with 5% to 7% growth and the ability to earn at the top half of that range as we deploy capital and move through the regulatory modernization that sits in front of us.  And so I think that's the real takeaway. We'll keep you informed on this process every step of the way and bring guidance at the right time. But I think there is just a strong pipeline of investment and a strong conﬁdence in our ability to grow 5% to 7% on the regulated business."
Great. Fantastic. Thank you guys. I'll pass it to someone else. Appreciate it.,Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Absolutely. Just to keep going on the stop process, I mean obviously this has seemingly been in some thought for a little time. How do you think about the accretion dilution and the commitment of pursuing this through. And then related to that, just again given some of the use of proceeds considerations, is there a potential that this ends up taking some time? (indiscernible) to align with some of your CapEx needs through the course of the decade. I guess just thinking about some of the parameters here.","Yes. And Julien, I'm not going to comment on value. I think we're too early in the process, we're testing the market. But we do believe we have a very strong set of operating assets, development pipeline, etcetera. We've given you an indication of use of proceeds. So I'd like to leave the comments there. And that's as the process progresses, we'll move forward to give you more information. The second part of your question -- lost the train."
"Well, I was just thinking about use of proceeds and perhaps elongating it to align with your CapEx. Again, more of a pushing you on the parameters that you alluded to a moment ago.","Yes. So, the use of proceeds, as I said in my comments to Shar, our bias right now would be to use the proceeds to avoid debt. But Julien, as the review progresses, we get a better sense of the market, where sometime in '23 likely we will ﬁnalize that decision and keep you informed every step of the way.  And as I think about the way this will work when we reach a decision, we will likely move the business to discontinued operations. So the Commercial business would come out. We would give you very clear guidance on the regulated business and we'll give you a sense of use of proceeds so we can put all of those various pieces together. And we will do that when we have progressed far enough in the strategic process to have a sense of how to guide you into 2023. But I would point again to -- this gives us an opportunity to really draw a great focus and attention on the regulated business which is poised to continue to grow at a very healthy pace.     Got it. Actually, I'm sorry. Sorry to keep going on some of the core operations here, just with respect to some of the other moving parameters at present, any initial thoughts on the AMC impact from IRA? Again, I guess that's a moving target itself. And then related obviously continued successful on cost mitigation, and kudos Steve, just with respect to that, again, feel fairly good about the outlook.of '23 onwards, in some of the earlier comments that you've made, again, I get that the gross level of inﬂation is potentially accelerating against what you guys had previously thought, establishing your EPS CAGR?      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yes. Julien, we feel very conﬁdent in our ability to execute on cost mitigation. And I think if you track back COVID and even prior to that, dating back to '15 and '16. We have consistently managed our O&M trajectory in a way that's not only been helpful to investors but helpful to our customers. It's been a part of keeping our prices low in all of our jurisdictions.  We are looking at the Inﬂation Reduction Act and we see meaningful beneﬁts to customers from the renewable tax credits, the recognition of nuclear, the incentives around critical infrastructure. We will be impacted by the corporate minimum tax, but we will also beneﬁt from the credit, which will pass through our customers.  So we are in the early analysis of this, as I know so many others and we'll be tracking it closely, as you would expect us to."
"I just wanted to ask, just go back to CEB quick and I'm just thinking to -- about contribution in total, like, what is the EBITDA for that business? And then, also, last quarter, I think you commented that CEB in 2023 would be somewhat ﬂattish to 2022. So we've had some relief via AD CVD there. So I'm just trying to think what is like ultimate loss earnings for those assets in 2023? How we should be thinking about that?","Yes. Nick, thank you for that. Our target for 2022 is around $150 million of net income, which we kind of stepped down the contribution at the end of last year as we saw some of the challenges in the supply chain and panel availability, etc.  We also in the last calls, we see a trending more in line with that for 2023 because despite the favorable executive action, the delay and uncertainty that was created during that period of time really pushed execution of projects from '23 into '24. And so, I'll leave it there, I don't know, Steve, if you would add anything to that?     No, I think that's correct. We had stepped down the contribution for those years in light of the supply chain issues and we had kind of capped the earnings throughout our plan, prior to that, in the $200 million type range per year and stepped it down for the recent supply chain issues. So that's I think about is in that fashion."
"Okay. So just run with the $150 million. And then, do you have EBITDA for that business that you're willing to disclose or --?","I'll leave it at that, the $150 million. And you know Nick, Jack and the IR team are available for any further follow-up on speciﬁcs."
"Great. No, thank you. I appreciate that. And then I guess I just.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you.     All right, thank you.     Thank you."
Just wanted to look forward to the ESG Day on October 4. Are there any kind of updated metrics or any other kinds of messages we should be looking for at that point in time?,"Jeremy, we're really looking forward to ESG day because we've had -- over the course of this year, a chance to give you some visibility into new targets, right? So we added scope two and scope three emission so you can expect to hear more from that. We've also ﬁled our carbon plan. We've also continued to progress our integrated resource plan in Indiana and have continued to build solar in Florida.  So, we will give you an update on what all of that could mean. You can expect ranges of capital to be discussed as we kind of take all of these plans and do a more ﬁnancial perspective at ESG day. And then, of course, we'll comment on some of the social issues around environmental justice, just transition, aﬀordability, which is increasingly important, and then, of course, governance. You can expect to have a member of our Board join the conversation. So I think it, it'll be a great day to really hone in on the clean energy transition story that we have here at   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Duke. We're not only making good progress, but we have good plans and targets in place in all of our jurisdictions to continue that work."
"Got it, thanks. That's very helpful there. And just want to pick up with the carbon plan a little bit more if I could, if you could just give us a little bit more ﬂavor on stakeholder conversations? We hear some stakeholders might have a diﬀerent kinds of concerns about the proposal. Just wondering if there are any sticking points or alternative pathways around that to get a sense on how that's all going?","Yes. And you know Jeremy, it's been a robust stakeholder process. And I would say to you, as we have been engaged in so many meetings and discussions there. There are a wide range of topics being discussed. But it's nothing that we would say as surprising. And one of the reasons that we've put together multiple pathways is really to get all of the topics on the table so that we can have the kind of discussion, the commission can have the kind of information they need to make decisions.  So if I were to just comment brieﬂy on the types of things that are under discussion, there is a lot of agreements on retirement of coal, there's a lot of agreement on near-term actions, particularly solar, storage, wind, a lot of agreement on energy eﬃciency, demand response being a part of the conversation. A lot of agreement on the need to accelerate the integration of renewables, because it's not just a matter of naming megawatts, it's a matter of getting them interconnected.  And then I think if I were to talk a little bit about areas of diﬀerent points of view, some are more aggressive on how quickly solar comes in, some are more optimistic on the pricing of storage and pricing of oﬀshore wind, some believe we could do more onshore wind then what we considered. And then of course, a lot of discussion on the attributes of natural gas, the assumptions on price and the role that natural gas should play.  So in price. I put price as a top-of-mind consideration on the minds of our industrials, as well as customers in general. So I think this just provides a fruitful menu of items and discussions that will result in a thoughtful plan. I think as you know, we have asked for authority to move on the no regrets elements of the plan. Not to lock into any speciﬁc one. Allow things to continue to mature, prices on certain technologies to continue to decline. And I think there will be just a really good discussion.  Hearings are scheduled for mid-September. We will be ﬁling testimony in late August. So, there'll be more data points along the way that we can share with you as this process continues."
Got it. That's very helpful. Just last one if I could. I just wanted to touch on nuclear a bit here and touch -- your understanding of the nuclear PTCs and as supply to regulate nuclear and the level   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   of beneﬁt do you see there? And just also if you could update us on Duke's involvement in SMRs and any thoughts on that technology going forward?,"Sure, and Jeremy, we're digesting what we know about the inﬂation reduction Act at this point. We believe regulated plan are included in that consideration and frankly we're really pleased to see nuclear being recognized as a critical part of the clean energy transition. We're a believer of that at Duke. And as we look at the products, we believe there is value for those who are low cost producers and Duke certainly is. So, we'll learn more as this model progresses and have an opportunity to share more with you as we know more. And of course, the bill has to pass before we can give you any [ph] new speciﬁcs. On the SMRs, in advanced nuclear, we are working on both technologies. I would say stated advisory capacity and the capacity to understand more to lend our operating expertise, we do not have an intention of being version one of anything, ﬁrst of a kind, we would like to see a broader adoption of the technologies, a broader understanding of not only operating characteristics, but the commercial attributes of price, ability to construct them within a timeframe that we're comfortable with.  And so we see this decade of the 2020 as an important one to continue that work. And if it progresses as we all hope it does, we would be in a position to potentially invest in one to come into service in the early 2030s. So more to come on that. This will be a fruitful area of discussion in front of the commission. I think you know that we operate in the Carolinas for 50% of the power today comes from nuclear. So it's an important part of the equation in the Carolinas. And if there is a way to add to it in an economic way that's supportable to our customers and ﬁts with the expectations of our regulators, we would welcome the opportunity to do that."
Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. I'll leave it there.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open.     Good morning.
"Just, maybe just really quickly, is there any debt on the renewable assets that we are pursuing a strategic review on?","Yes, there is. There is about $1.6 billion of project debt on the Commercial Renewables assets."
"Okay, thank you. And then just, Lynn, just wanted to get your thoughts on the -- conceptually on this transfer ability topic. Obviously, this was another plan that doesn't have direct pay but has transfer ability, how would you compare in contrast this versus tax equity? And just as a concept, what's the market for these credits? Just any color you could share there would be appreciated.","Yes. Durgesh, we have been spending some time thinking about this. What we like about transfer ability is we do believe there could be some eﬃciency in the market to move cash which would be valuable to our customers. It has been a concept that has been used for certain state tax attributes. But the market I think will be quite diﬀerent If we introduce credits of this level. And so I think trying to forecast how the tax equity market would react to the introduction of this market and who shows up to be a counterparty for transfer ability is something we're spending some time on. I don't have all the answers. But we do like the introduction of another technique that more eﬃciently moves cash, with the hope and expectation that a liquid market develops at a level that would monetize these credits for our customers."
"The regulated capital spend that you laid out in your fourth quarter (Technical Diﬃculty) relative to what we know today, just on the regulated side, can you talk to us about the puts and takes? About what may be has moved around? Maybe has some upside to it? Maybe has some downside to it when we think about that capital spend in directional guidance?","Yes, and Michael, what I would say to you on regulated spend, I'm going to focus on the Carolinas just for a moment, we used one of the 2020 IRP scenarios to develop that capital plan recognizing that we were going to put a carbon plan in front of the commission and it needed to be reviewed. And so there will be a ﬁne tuning of Carolina capital coming out of the carbon plan. We also were on this technical conference on the multiyear rate plan and put forward a recommended range of transmission and distribution that will be ﬁled in connection with the cases that are upcoming. So there could be some ﬁne-tuning there. And then I think about just around the corner, we'll be opening up 27 when we come to the street in February.  And I think we've talked to you about the fact that we see an acceleration of capital in the back half of the year as we get deeper into the multiyear rate plan, deeper into coal retirements,   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   deeper into replacement generation. So we do see that capital trending up and we'll have an opportunity to give you some perspective on that at ESG day."
"Got it. And is that capital trending up? Is that more of a post 2025 and maybe '23 to '25, doesn't move a lot?","Yes. Yes, I would think about it as post 2025 because honestly, Michael, 2025 is tomorrow for us. When you think about large infrastructure build. The other thing I would point to is there will be some ﬁne-tuning of capital in Indiana. As a result of the integrated resource plans, the CPCN process that we plan to ﬁle later this year. So that's another update that you can expect from us. Again, it will be more in the back half of the decade. As we move more deeply into our clean energy transition in Indiana."
"Got it. And then one ﬁnal one, Lynn, just curious on coal generation retirements, both in the Carolinas and in the Indiana. Given supply chain issues for a battery and a little bit for solar panels, as well as just given high commodity prices. Does that have you rethinking the timeline for coal power plant retirements?","Yes, Michael. That's, it's a good question because there are puts and takes on that question from every direction. And what I mean by that, you've highlighted supply chain issues on the replacement side. You also highlighted fuel prices for natural gas generation. But frankly, coal, the supply of coal, the logistics of getting coal from point A to point B are also a challenge. And so we cannot assume that there is some steady state perfect situation here. We have to manage all of this. And so trying to ﬁnd the right balance between timing of coal retirement and replacement generation is something that we're spending a lot of time and attention to. And also trying to ensure, for the period of time the coal assets are with us, that we have a reliable supply. There have been labor shortages in the railroad, labor shortages in the mining community, the global market has impacted coal and pricing. So I would just raise that as another dimension to your question that we're also working on."
"Hopefully, just two quick questions. Lynn, one, I understand the size of the renewable business relative to Duke, but do you think the sale of the renewable business will have any impact to like the ESG rating that Duke Energy has? Such as, hey, maybe they're not as focused on ESG as previously?","Anthony, I appreciate you asking that question, because I would unequivocally say no. Because when we talk about our carbon reduction target and what we're trying to accomplish by 2030 and 2050, it's all within our regulated business. So we have not taken credit for any commercial renewables and our clean energy targets that we have shared with you. It will mean that we'll have a fewer number of megawatts of renewables until that regulated renewable growth accelerates in the back part of the decade because we'll sell some of them. But our commitment around carbon reduction and the clean energy transition is unchanged. All of our targets are on track. And this will give us an opportunity at ESG day to really zero in on that even more and make it very clear. But I appreciate the question, because it's an important one."
"And just lastly, on load trends, it looks like you're coming in maybe above your original 2022 guidance of 1.5%. I'm curious, what do you see long-term? It seems that may be the electriﬁcation of the economy is accelerating, then maybe we previously thought. Maybe a couple of years ago, we were talking about ﬂat is the new up. Do you think going forward, 1% or 2% may be the new norm as hybrid work and all these other things come to beneﬁt the electric utility?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yes, Anthony. We look at that very closely. And back in February, we had projected at that after 22, it was pretty ﬂat, our growth through the rest of our ﬁve-year plan, electricity sales, weather normal, was pretty ﬂat. And we're keeping an eye on energy eﬃciency products that are getting rolled out in addition to electriﬁcation. And these are variables but we do look at as we project our load. We'll be updating that as we move forward. But right now we're going to stick with pretty ﬂat load growth throughout our planning horizon and hope for that upside on that.     And Anthony, what I would add to that is, we believe the discipline around cost management is really grounded in the fact we're not putting in overly optimistic assumptions on load. So we manage our cost structure consistent with sort of a ﬂat expectation on load growth. But when I look at some of the trends around in migration in the Southeast, I look at these economic development numbers and the business ratings of our states. We do have some tailwinds on growth, right? That I think we'll enjoy for a period of time. But we continue to believe this ﬂat to 0.5% is the best way to manage the business and always have to be surprise to the upside."
"My last question will be -- Steve, you brought up about energy eﬃciency as may be a headwind to demand growth. Do you think as we -- we had big energy eﬃciency gains in appliances, home construction over the years, and we just reached maybe the peak of these energy eﬃciency gains and right now it's just all really small gains that you're going to get with, upgrading a refrigerator, a new appliance, and that will be the pivot in demand?","Well, we'll continue to monitor that. We do see a desire to increase energy eﬃciency as part of carbon reduction plans. You'll see that as an increasing area if for example on our North Carolina plant. One of the things that's helpful to us as we move forward, is we're also going to have residential unbundling as part of our multi-year rate plan. And that takes away that volatility for that large customer class on usage, whether it's weather or just growth as well. So, I think we've got protection there if we saw economic issues or energy eﬃciency coming along to aﬀect the top-line demand.     And Anthony, the only other thing I would point to is energy eﬃciency hasn't been uniformly adopted across all of our customer classes. So we do have an opportunity, particularly with low income and vulnerable customers to continue to drive energy eﬃciency. And I also believe that home energy management technology, time of use rates, other things to give us an ability to help a customer move their usage around and minimize is an opportunity that will lower price to customers over time and giving us headroom for these clean energy investments."
