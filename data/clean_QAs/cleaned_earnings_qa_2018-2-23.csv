Question,Answer
"So ﬁrst, quick question, just on tax reform, you kind of nailed it down early on. In terms of FFO to debt, where does the $1 billion equity rise get you on kind of a pro forma run rate basis, and how is that relative to where you want to be? Obviously, looking at 2017 trailing, kind of what do the rating agencies wanting from you today and how much buﬀer more importantly are you looking to have against that?","Julian, this is Drew. Right now the $1 billion will get us around 14% range. And so that's where we're starting from and we think that will maintain the investment grade as we've talked about and discussed. And of course we'd like to be better there, we're looking for other ways to do that by driving internal cash ﬂows and working with our retail regulators, but that's kind of the place where we see it bottoming out. The amounts we will see will be bearing by the exact timing of the return to customers of any excess ADIT. But that's kind of where we see it bottoming out."
"Got it. Excellent. You -- generally speaking, beyond the $1 billion equity, you would think that you would organically see the growth in the business to support an improvement in the FFO?","Yes, over time it will improve, but early on that's what we're seeing."
"No, I was thinking more around the strategic angle, around sort of divesting that business more structurally?","Okay. So, Leo in his remarks, and yesterday or a couple days ago, you saw the update on the Vermont Yankee process, so you're clear on that. Beyond that, we continue to work through our process to try and duplicate that eﬀorts at our other plants, and those processes continue to be ongoing. We are making progress, but the ﬁrst thing up is going to be Vermont Yankee, and we're really focused on making sure that we bring that one home, and then the others would fall along behind it."
"Thank you for the guidance around tax and appreciate you deviating from your normal way you talk about your ranges to give us a sense of that. So just to rephrase back to you, what you said in your comments, so that I'm sure I got it correctly. Given the regulatory outcomes you've seen like your ability now to earn at your authorized ROE in Arkansas, because of the formula rate plan, and the types of demand growth you're seeing, had tax reform not happened you were looking given what you should know now being at the high end of the range. And then the impact of a, the loss of -- partial loss of tax yield at the Parent debt; b, the billion dollars of equity that you need to fund to oﬀset the cash ﬂow impact of tax; and c, the positive impact of rate base going up because of deferred tax, you're still no lower than the midpoint of the range as you see it today.","Right. Yeah. We said we're not at the bottom of the range. So, I think you would be -- I will not kind of characterize around the midpoint speciﬁcally, but we're not at the bottom of the range."
"Okay, thanks. And what can you tell us on the margin has changed between your last disclosure and your current comments on the cash ﬂow impact of exiting EWC? What on the margin has changed put you in a position to say you think it will be neutral to positive?","I think the main pieces are the strong performance in the trusts, and as you'll see in our K when it comes out early next week, the decommissioning, actually, I think it's in       the back of the disclosures in the appendix today. The trusts are up over $4 billion at this point. So we've seen strong performance in the return of trust.  And then secondly, we continue to work through our expectations on what it would cost to decommission facilities in the Northeast. And as we work through that, we are ﬁnding that we may be able to reduce our cost expectations there. So the common nation of those two things -- given us the conﬁdence to continue to move our expectations on the overall cash need at EWC."
"Great. Last question. Had you not -- let me rephrase this, all things equal, before the things you've done to oﬀset the impact of tax reform on your credit metrics. How much of a negative impact on your FFO to debt metric before you -- before the -- this is obviously before the things that you've done to oﬀset it. The tax reform have as an impact in a vacuum. I mean, you say you're going to be at 14%. Where would you be as you've done nothing to oﬀset it?","We would have probably been around 16%, 17% range FFO to debt."
"Good morning. So on the equity, just wanted to understand which piece is more correlated with the timing? Is it from a regulatory perspective, if you get decision on the unprotected piece for the DTL and the timing of the refund? Is that going to     drive the timing to be more in 2018 versus the 2019 event? Just wanted to understand how should we think about that timing?","I think that it's more of a back-end question, Praful. So, we will probably start executing in the second half of this year, even though our processes aren't complete based upon expectations for having to go and do some, no matter what. And then the question will be how quickly we get the certainty and we go ahead and how fast we begin to return those cash ﬂows to customers. If it's very quick, then we will accelerate the back-end forward, but if it's slow obviously we would need the cash until later. Does that makes sense, Praful?"
"Yeah, it does. Thanks. Super helpful. Thanks. So and the second question, on EWC, clearly was good to see the decommissioning trust performing well and the fact that you've locked down those gains, but just obviously it opens up the question to if it performed well now, there is also now the risk that if it doesn't perform well, what happens then given now you're in a positive position from a cash ﬂow perspective. Just wanted to understand how you protect against that risk of downside on the decommissioning trust now that it's performed. And secondly, now that you have these assets at a good position, is this a better time to execute sales with people who are experts in decommissioning these assets?","Okay. So, on the ﬁrst question, we have been actively trying to derisk our portfolio, particularly for Vermont Yankee, for example, as that trust has grown, we do know we have expenses that are coming. And so we've taken them ahead of schedule out of sort of an investment proﬁle, and putting them more into a cash proﬁle to derisk because our trust has grown to higher levels. Similar for Pilgrim as we prepare for the retirement of an asset next year plus Pilgrim's trust by itself is up over $1 billion. So it's very well funded. We've been actively derisking in that way.  And then the second question was -- what was your second question again, Praful?"
In terms of executing on the sales for these assets --,"Yeah, and so of course, it makes it much easier to manage that sale process as those trust become higher. That is true."
"Let me just follow up on Greg and Julien's question for a second on the EWC. So, it's nice to see that it's -- you know, you've got a higher cash ﬂow trajectory upon an exit, but sort of how does the cash ﬂow trajectory look under an assumption that you sell the decommissioning trust. So in light of the performance of the funds, would it be cash ﬂow dilutive for you to exit the decommissioning trust funds?","Not necessarily, because we wouldn't necessarily have access to those decommissioning trust funds, and accept to do the decommissioning until well down the road. So, the fact that it is performing better, and I guess maybe the Praful's question helps us to move towards a transaction, but it does not necessarily move more cash into the business."
"Okay, excellent. Just let me then rephrase it, did the Arkansas order improved sort of what you're looking to do in Louisiana?","Well, remember we talked about that in prior discussions, the nuclear issue is less of a -- has been less of a conversation in Louisiana. Our focus because of the size of our capital plan has been around transmission conversation. So nuclear is a much smaller component of Louisiana's capital plan. And as a result, hasn't been a line item, if you will in the negotiation. So, it's been less of -- I'll just say less of an issue."
"Hey, guys. Couple of questions. I just want to make sure I understand a few things. First of all, Drew, what is the O&M growth rate year-over-year, you're assuming in 2018 versus 2017 at the Utility?","I'm trying to think about the percentage, it is probably 1% to 2%, Michael."
Okay. So inﬂationary. And then do you see signiﬁcant opportunity for O&M cost saves post 2018 at the utilities or do you think that's kind of a normal run rate you go from there? I'm just asking because of heightened nuclear spend that you had in 2017.,"Right. And we are still actually ramping up some of those nuclear costs. And I think a big piece of the driver for us is the pension expense, and where that will go. But beyond that operationally, we have several programs internally to try and drive operational eﬃciency within our organization.  And as we begin to roll out our automated metering eﬀorts, the next year, and we start to install meters, and then we start to put all the other parts together with that new operational and management distribution systems, and asset management systems and making all those things together, we would expect to begin to realize some operational savings going forward for our customers.  And as we realize that I think that will create headroom for incremental investment, but would not -- maybe on a temporary basis, it might drop to the bottom line, but we would expect that it would be recaptured in rates fairly quickly."
"Got it. And then Arkansas, and Rod, I want to make sure I understand the puts and the takes that are happening here. Can you walk us through how tax reform helps get you closer to earning authorized. Is it simply because the 4% cap is no longer as big of a deal because you're reducing rates this year or is there some other driver there?","Michael, I think the straightforward answer is the revenue requirements because of the lower tax expense is less, and as a result you're closer to your allowed rate of return. Thus you're not having to worry about the carry-over year-over-year for the true-up. So you're actually earning allowed ROE in the year because the tax expense is presumed to be lower."
"So, I want to just kind of think about the Arkansas income statement, because this is actually a pretty big deal for you guys. So tax rate goes down, but revenue goes down to adjust for the tax rate, but that's earning -- that would be earnings neutral by itself, but because you didn't get the full increase that you cold have been authorized due to the 4% cap. Now you can actually get that full increase in 2018.","No, the tax rate goes down. The revenue requirements that is the amount of revenues that are embedded in our rates don't go down. Remember, we are over, and so all I'm saying is the overreach that that we wouldn't be earning on that would     be subject to a true-up is actually less in 2018. And so we're actually earning closer to our allowed rate of return, because of the taxes that we're not paying that the overreach is not as great as it would otherwise have been.  So Michael, maybe, think about it this way. Our original revenue requirement request was about $130 million. The cap limited us to, I think, $70 million-ish. And so we were short by $60 million. We were underearning by that amount.  Well, I think Rod is saying is under the lower tax regime, the revenue requirement get something closer to that $70 million. So, you could think of it as our revenue requirements kind of our revenue line if you're thinking about our 2018 income statement, our revenue line is about the same. Our tax expense will be lower and all of it will kind of balance out to where we get close to our allowed return in Arkansas. Of course next year we will be moving through the FRP, and we'll have an expectation for our lower tax expense next year as well, and we'll just continue to roll forward in the FRP process in that way."
"I just -- Leo, I noticed the comments about 800 megawatts of renewables potentially over three years. And if I heard you rightly, about 180 is PPAs. But then you said, the remainder I guess 600 or so would be -- about half of that would be ownership opportunities. Did I hear that right?","Yeah, yeah. And over the next three years, we would anticipate entering into contracts for those. The projects themselves would be kind of more towards the back-end of the period or beyond."
"So my -- I guess, how do you have conﬁdence that in that split at this point and which jurisdictions are we talking about?","Well, we are in the process right now in some of those jurisdictions with some discussions around those. I really don't want to get into any detail about it at the moment because those discussions are going on. But we've been looking at them for a while, it's obviously is the price point of renewables and everything come down that it begins to make sense in certain instances around the system, so we're pursuing that."
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on the comments about FFO metrics, and I think you said a couple of times, you obviously intending to remain investment grade, but with the Baa2, Moody's rating, are you -- we too understand that you might be willing to were [ph] a notch of downgrade or are you also pushing to try and defend the current rating as opposed to just staying investment grade?","Right. So we're committed to investment grade, but we still would prefer to keep our current credit rating. And so, certainly we're not giving up on that. And so we're going to be continuing to look for ways to manage to our current credit rating, while we maintain our earnings outlooks that we've committed to you all to achieve. So I wouldn't say that our current credit rating is going to necessarily fall down a notch, but our commitment is to maintain investment grade."
"If I'm not wrong, they've got downgrade thresholds around 15%. So would you consider more equity to stay where you are, or in that instance, do we -- I guess, I'm just pushing, but how do you defend the current number -- current level?","Right. I mean, we will also endeavor to maintain our earnings outlooks. And so that's going to be the balancing mechanism."
Thank you. Can you quantify the tax reform impact on your rate base?,"Sure. This is Drew. It's going to depend mostly upon the amount of cash that's ultimately returned to customers, because that will represent sort of incremental rate base. If there is some of the excess ADIT that turns into accelerated depreciation of existing assets or is put into sort of pay for asset that we were already planning to put in the rate base and that would be kind of neutral. Right now, we would expect that we would grow the rate base by a little over $1 billion over the three years."
"Okay. And then, can you also on the unfunded pension for 2017, can you give us an idea of where you ended 2017?","Yes. So we ended 2017 with about pension trust that's at around 6.1 billion, and pension liability around 8 billion. So we're at about 1.9 billion diﬀerence there."
"Okay. So you're actually improve there relative to where you were last year, so that should also help in terms of the FFO to debt metrics, right?","It will, but it's not improved all that much. I want to say, it's improved by $50 million to $60 million. The rates have been going up, but the pension discount rate at the end of the year versus the end of the prior year was still lower, because as you know, corporate spreads are tightened, curve had ﬂattened and most of our liabilities are longer dated. So, the liability went up more than we were anticipating, despite the fact that we had strong returns and $400 million of contributions into our pension last year. And by the way, we would expect to put about $400 million in this year as well."
"And then beyond that, I mean, should we assume that 400 million number continues as a run rate or should we look at those more as just one-oﬀ?","Well, that was -- this year will be the end of a ﬁve-year eﬀort to put $2 billion of incremental assets into the pension trust. I don't know that necessarily we could continue but that's something that we're investigating."
"I believe you said the billion dollars of external equity will depend on the timing of out of the rate case, or rate ﬁlings. Do you have an at-the-money or dribble program?","David, we don't have one currently established, we would need to go get authorization starting with our Board, but also with the SEC to make that happen. We would anticipate that probably occur in the second quarter or so."
"Okay. Got it. And I believe you may have just addressed this, I apologize. Can you explain why your pension discount rate assumption is following again, given the rate environment that we're seeing?","Yeah. Well, it's there at the end of the year. And so it's a once-a-year snapshot, and so you compare it to 12/31/16 versus 12/31/17. And if you look at that time frame, sort of the 10-year treasury had actually come down a little bit, even though the front and     shorter-term treasuries had come up meanwhile. So you had the ﬂattening of the curve and then you also had corporate spreads which had tightened to that. So using a longer-dated curve, corporate rates were a little bit lower than what they had been previously. So those are the two comparison points."
Got it. Great. And actually just want to sneak in on more on your sales forecast. I know you said that there are some volatility within the year. You see forecast sales growth beyond this year rising. I mean just can you characterize whether these are using conservative assumptions about industrial growth or are you kind of fairly comfortable with your assumption now? Just any room for further improvement or further upside?,"Yeah. So, this is Drew again. On the industrial side, I would say that we're kind of middle of the road on our expectations for industrial growth. For our large customers, it's based upon our expectation for projects that we can see under construction right now through 2020. And what our expectation for them is in the marketplace. So, I would say that's fairly middle of the road expectation on industrial.  For residential and commercial, there may be a little bit of near-term opportunity in 2018, but beyond that we expected the eﬀects of automated meters and getting our customers better information, by how to manage their energy usage, would allow them to be more eﬃcient and conservative on the way that they actually use our electricity. So, we have actually built in an expectation that over the longer term we would expect to see a decline in residential and commercial sales."
