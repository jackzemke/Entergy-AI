Question,Answer
"Maybe starting out with the Commercial results that were very strong. You had some good success in new business creation. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what you're seeing or where you're seeing the strength. And maybe more broadly, the competitive environment in retail, what are you seeing for churn and any changes in market share there.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes. I think the ﬁnancial retail and wholesale markets and, in turn, margin is really a reﬂection of the underlying physical power generation stack and the demand fundamentals. And when we see that physical stack get tight, when it's under weather-related stress, or demand is increasing, then we see higher volatility and markedly higher retail and wholesale prices. Of course, we all know this relationship between the physical stack and the ﬁnancial markets, and the weather events in Elliott, Uri and many other unnamed storms, demonstrate that eﬀect all through year.  But the physical stack is undergoing a rapid change from cold-touted resources that are less reliable because they don't have on-site fuel or introduce intermittency risk in the case of renewables. And so that physical stack is changing today. And today, I think when you participate in either the retail markets or the wholesale markets, you have to ask yourself really 3 basic questions. Do I have physical generation? Is it the kind of physical generation that's going to show up in extreme events? And do I have the ﬁnancial balance sheet to deal with negative outcomes?  Many folks who haven't asked those questions historically have been hurt. Some driven out of business entirely. But this is where I think our ﬂeet really shines. This is where our business model really shines. Because we have the physical assets that operate in extreme weather events, they're clean energy assets that are going to live for a long time and our Commercial business is both smart and beneﬁted by the fact that we have a strong balance sheet.  So in eﬀect, we have physical generation that runs. We have a Commercial business that has a competitive advantage of others. And so when others see risk of volatility, they add those costs into the price that they're willing to oﬀer in wholesale and retail markets. Because we don't have those risks, that translates into incremental margins in our businesses. And so that's what we're seeing. I think that's really been the story of the ﬁrst quarter. And really, it's been an evolving story. I think it's going to continue for some time.  At some point, people don't price in risk and they'll get hurt again. But right now, they're pricing in the risk. And for us, that's margin expansion because we have the right ﬂeet and the right business model."
"Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that perspective. And wondering if you could also give an update on the inﬂationary pressures that you're seeing just in terms of labor contracts and material costs. Was 1Q consistent with your expectations heading into the year? How do you see it trending for the year? I heard your conﬁdence in being able to achieve it, wondering if you're seeing any diﬀerence in the pressures on the business this year so far.","No. I think we predicted it well in our plan, and we're right on plan.  Operator, we're ready for the next set of questions.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe."
"Yes, just on the commercial upside you're seeing. I know I'm just -- the 24 gross margin is a lot better than we would have expected just on power prices. Does some of this beneﬁt the way you contract go into '25 even, just given the way you contract? Or is it more kind of '23, '24?","Yes. Steve, we're obviously not putting numbers out there for '25. But yes, this trend doesn't end in '24."
"Okay. Great. And then big picture question. Just any concerns you have about IRA related to just this debt ceiling issue, with the Republicans having IRA removing a bill? And just any thoughts on likelihood that, that is a real risk?","Steve, at this point, we just see that as kind of -- it's hard to use the word normal. But the political back and forth, that's occurring. But I don't think there's any prospect that President Biden is going to cut or gut the IRA to deal with this issue. And at the end of the day, we're conﬁdent it will get solved."
"Okay. And then lastly, just on upgrades. The -- I know you kind of came out with some growth investment for uprates that were, I think, more ones that were a little more normal course, but I think they're still working on kind of the potential for others over time. Just any update on how you're thinking about uprate opportunities?","Nothing that we're ready to announce today, Steve. But to your point, we are working through some other opportunities, and we think there will be.  Operator  And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners."
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Quick ones here. I know, Joe, you guys mentioned on the fourth quarter call that you were working with kind of state policymakers to potentially reduce their support in light of sort of the federal PTC. Any updates on those eﬀorts, especially as you look at states like New York?","No, Shar, the only thing I'd say on that, we've -- those conversations have continued to evolve, nothing unexpected. There's nothing that is diﬀerent about the way they're looking at it than the way we're looking at it based on the conversations we've had. We just haven't -- those agreements haven't been memorialized, and in some cases, might not get memorialized until after the guidance is actually issued because it's -- obviously, we still have a whole year really to go before we get to it. But I think those conversations are progressing very well."
"Okay. Perfect. And then on the gross margin side, obviously, you talked about it a little bit. You're now looking at about $100 million in PTC credits for the nonstate-supported plants. Could we get a little bit more detail on where that is coming from? And it looks like from the sensitivities, it might be weighted towards LaSalle. But any additional color you can provide here as we see this creep up in gross margin for the ﬁrst time?","Yes, Shar, this is Dan. I think if you look into the sensitivity table on Page 23, you can see the moves up or down with (inaudible), NiHub and the PJM West ﬂeets, which would suggest that we're having plans in both markets, where at the bus, they're going to be all below the PTC threshold [ph] there. Remember that our PTC sensitivity is only for the plant who do not have state support. So to narrow that down, right, it's going to be LaSalle in the Midwest and then Limericach, Peach and Calvert in the East. So it is aﬀecting on both sides. And you can see the sensitivity to price there, which also is a useful tool for you guys to desensitize your models."
"Okay. Perfect. And then just last thing, sort of to ask -- and I'm getting questions on it this morning. But I guess would you have guided to the top half without the additional PJM invoice uplift?",Yes.  Operator  Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America.
"Following up on the capital allocation discussion, you referenced growth and potential consolidation as inﬂuencing the timing. Just are there things discrete that you're watching for? And just in general, when should we expect you to start to move some of that unallocated to the allocated bucket?","Let me ﬂip that to Dan.     Paul, I think that Joe talked about the upgrade. I was asked earlier, we're looking at a number of growth opportunities that take a little time to manifest, so we're going to continue to work through those. We continue to look at the market for potential M&A opportunities. I think nuclear (inaudible) comes to the top of that list, and we're going to be pretty focused there. We have the $750 million of buyback to work our way through. I think we have a little time to get through there. And we'll continue to analyze both the scope of opportunity and then -- when we can put that out. So I'm not going to give you an exact time line, but we're certainly keeping a close eye on how quickly we can deploy opportunities that come to there."
Okay. Great. And then I heard the opening commentary on your view on '23 and '24. Is it still a fair expectation 2024 formal EBITDA guidance would come on the fourth quarter call? Or could that come sooner?,"Yes. No, it will -- the formal guidance come on the fourth quarter call. But Paul, what we've been trying to do with these new disclosures is to kind of give you all of the moving pieces, which will update quarter-to-quarter. So you'll see the formal guidance, but you can start to piece together the story, obviously.  Operator  Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI."
"Just, Joe, a ﬁner point on capital allocation. You talked about the attractiveness of the share price. I just want to be clear in terms of the unallocated $2 billion [ph] for '23 and '24, could that   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   potentially go towards an upside share buyback?","Good. Sure. But it would mean that the other opportunity sets that we've talked about, whether that be organic or inorganic growth opportunities, did materialize in the time frame. We have -- and we understand it's kind of a short time period to execute in '23 and '24 on those opportunities. And if they don't occur, as I said in the prepared remarks, all day long, we buy the stock price at this level."
"And then just maybe, Dan, going back to the PTC, the $100 million accretion gross margin. Can you -- is there a way for us to get to what a dollar PTC value you're using to get to that, like an average across the diﬀerent assets that you have?","No, I'm not going to -- I can't give you at least to give you a speciﬁc unit or price comparison because of the bus parts diﬀerences of the plants. What I would say if you can look back at the sensitivities on '23 at a plus or minus $5 movement, you can see how much the PTC would change from where we are. So you could price out on those protectively 4 plants, somewhat you could price out how much move you would have to get the PTC back to 0. That's probably the best way of thinking about it right now.  Operator  And our next question comes from Ross Fowler of UBS."
Okay. Just wanted to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity),"Yes, you got it. And like I said, I think all the pieces are right there in front of you.  Operator  I would now like to turn it back to Joe Dominguez for ﬁquestnal remarks.     Well, thanks again for joining. It really has been kind of a remarkable quarter and the progress we've seen in the business, that points to really a nice outcome for us this year, and next is very exciting to all of us. So we look forward to our next quarterly call, and we'll conclude the call. Thank you.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.
