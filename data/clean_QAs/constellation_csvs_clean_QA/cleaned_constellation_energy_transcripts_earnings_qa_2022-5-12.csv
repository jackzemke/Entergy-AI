Question,Answer
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Congrats on the great results. So I wanted to maybe focus ﬁrst on just the outlook for federal legislation, and you provided some great commentary. How are you thinking just given the evolution of everything we've seen politically, could you just maybe speak a little bit more to your sense for the chances of success?  I do agree with your point that, if anything passes, it does appear highly likely that nuclear support will be in that. So I think that's well-appreciated. But I'm just curious more about your sense of the prospects for something getting across the ﬁnish line?","Yes, sure, Stephen. Look, as you all would well imagine, as a new CEO of a new company, spent a good bit of time over the last few months in Washington literally having dozens of meetings with White House policymakers and others. I still believe that there's a strong appetite to get something done on clean energy.  I think they don't like to call them the Build Back Better tax pieces, but there's a lot in there that all sectors of the energy business like in terms of the tax policies. I think there's strong support certainly continuing within the Democratic Party, Senator Manchin and others to get something done.  What we're seeing is whether or not there's an appetite to do it from a bipartisan standpoint. Stephen, as much as I think -- as I said, that there's something in it for Republicans and Democrats, we're all observing the challenges of getting anything done from a bipartisan standpoint, and certainly, this close to an election, that might be a lift.  What I do believe is that the Democrats will try to get this done, in particular Senator Manchin will try to see if there's an appetite, but they're not going to be strung out forever trying to get bipartisan support if it becomes evident that the votes just aren't there to get to 60.  So I think people are assessing that in D.C. One of the things that, honestly, I thought was a bit of a disaster with Build Back Better was the amount of which the kind of political interplay was being spelled out every day in the newspapers. It was counterproductive. Often is counterproductive in negotiations to have that kind of play-by-play going on and certainly was there. I think they've learned their lesson, and they're very clearly trying not to do that. But there's a diﬀerence between not being vocal about it and not doing something about it.  We see activity on the ground. I think very clearly here, the next couple of months are going to be telling, right, whether or not there is something from a bipartisan standpoint or the Democrats can decide at the end of the day that they have to move their own bill. We're going to know that here in the next 4 to 8 weeks.  But my point is, as I said, more fundamental, we're building this company for the long haul. I think all of you need to kind of spend some time and take a timeout and remember how far we've come. I think all of the momentum is at our backs. As at least I appreciate these bipartisan discussions, there's nothing but support for the nuclear components of the bill. I'm happy to see that. We've worked on it for a long time.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   And honestly, as I said in my scripted comments here, the work or the problems that we've seen in Germany and Europe I think have simply reinforced the U.S. policymakers the importance of keeping this ﬂeet alive from a national security standpoint, an energy security standpoint. And although we are hyper focused on those things right now, the climate change problems are not going away. That's what we built this company to address. That's what we will address, and I'm conﬁdent that policy will back it up."
"That's super helpful color. Maybe just my last question, just building on your point on national security is uranium. I think you all have taken a very thoughtful approach to ensuring you have uranium supply. But we do get in the United States a decent amount of uranium from Russia.  And I was just curious, what do you see as possible moves in terms of supply chain adjustments at the industry level? Then feel free to comment on your position, but I think you guys are in good shape. But more broadly, I'm interested in your take on what adjustments might occur at the national level in terms of how we procure uranium?","I think -- it's not just uranium. I think it's all fuels and a lot of technologies, we're going to see an onshoring movement. We certainly support that. I'm going to ask Bryan Hanson to provide some color. You pointed out that we're in a pretty good spot. We are about what we're seeing in the marketplace. But as a general rule, Stephen, I think uranium and uranium-related services like other things in energy, we're going to learn from this situation, and we're going to decide to move those onshore.  Again what I'm liking in terms of what I'm seeing out of Congress is a focus on these areas. We're talking about it. And again to the extent that there are limits on imports from Russia over some period of time, we support weaning ourselves oﬀ of Russian fuels, but it needs to be done in a pragmatic way. I think policymakers understand that. Bryan?     Yes. I'd say we're working well with policymakers, both the industry and policymakers working together to expand the capacity and capability in the United States to provide enrichment conversion services. So I see that accelerating more so as we talk about it amongst the utilities. I think for our company, as we look forward, we've said we're good out through several years around our enrichment conversion capabilities.  And if you think about the cost impact to us overall, three things I'd remind you: one is nuclear fuels, 20% of our production costs are nuclear plants; two, our fuel team does an outstanding job in their hedging policies and strategies to make sure we use multiple contracts, long-term contracts, diﬀerent hedges collars around the high side, low side of the prices we would pay to ensure that we have a robust supply; and then ﬁnally, once that fuel is actually loaded in the reactor, it's amortized over 5 to six years, depending on the length of fuel cycle for that particular plant. The costs are really muted for us, maybe $1 a megawatt hour out through past 2025 for us right now. So we're sitting in a good spot.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research."
"Yes. First, just on hedging strategy. Just given the change global environment and the fact that you have a lot more core hedged through the Illinois agreement, plus also, I guess the potential PTC, are you thinking about maybe hedging less going forward than you have?","Steven, I'm going to ask Jim to jump in here. We're not vigorously tied to the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 that you saw from this company in prior years. We have, as you pointed out, through the state support mechanisms, a lot of our volume already hedged -- but look, we saw a good run of prices during the course of the quarter.  And Jim's message to the team was opportunistically seasonally where it makes sense let's grab some of that value. In point of fact, as we're sitting here today some of the high points that we saw during the quarter have now worked their way back a little bit. We're pretty glad that we had those hedges. So look, I don't think we're going to be slaves to 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, but we're going to see value.  And you ought to know that, as we're going to run this company, we're going to be disciplined around the balance sheet, but we're going to be disciplined about making sure that every time we give a projection to you, we hit it or do better. So we're going to continue to use the hedging strategy to give us that sort of assurance. Jim, jump in here with more color.     Yes. Thanks, Joe. I guess what I would add to your question about, well, given that we have the policy deals, the way we think about this hedging window is typically in this kind of 3-year window, there's some customer contracts that go a little longer. So the way we think about that is we want to be able to Joe's point, capture the moments when we have the opportunity when you see prices run like this, and I think overall, we're still going to be able to have some ﬂexibility, and Dan mentioned the ﬂexibility.  So we tie that in constantly to what are we trying to achieve in hitting the targets that we've provided, as Joe mentioned, and achieve with the balance sheet goal of keeping a strong balance sheet. So I think we'll continue the same general strategy with ﬂexing up or down here and there as we see the market move in periods like this. I don't think there's a vast change to the overall philosophy of what we're trying to achieve."
"Okay. One other question. You guys probably saw the Energy Harbor announcement this past week with a contract on site -- 10-year contract on site, I think with a data center host customer.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   I'm just curious how much are you looking at opportunities like that? And is that another way to potentially get kind of above-market hedges or essentially contracts? Can you talk about that?","Sure, Steve. We have looked at it. And as you know, we announced at our Analyst Day we did a deal at our combined cycle machines down in Texas, where we get incredibly strong interest from data center companies that come behind the fence line, and not only at the fossil plants in Texas, but, of course taking advantage of the clean energy production at our nuclear plants and the high reliability that they get sitting behind the fence line there.  We've held back a little bit on that. First, not interested in getting into more commodity risk around bitcoin and cryptocurrency. And honestly, I think all of the events that have transpired since Analyst Day kind of reinforce that sense of running the business and not having commodity exposure in terms of the production.  So far, that's the way we've run things. We will look at contracts. But right now, I'm holding tight to see what happens in Washington because I want to see how that policy would work and interplay with any contract we might have with a data center behind the fence line. But is it an opportunity? Sure, it is.  The Tier 0 data center market is going to do nothing but grow even if the cryptocurrency piece of it starts to stagnate a little bit, and those will be opportunities for us. But they're not things that we need to jump at with our nuclear plants. I think hydrogen and certainly how the production tax credit work are things that we need to see pretty clearly before we enter into long-term deals.  Operator  Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America."
"I wanted to continue on Steve's line of questioning. Just more speciﬁcally around retail. How have those conversations gone? Not talking about the crypto data mine but just large commercial, industrial, the Microsofts of the world chief in recognizing that 0 carbon value. Is it about higher margins, more duration? Just if you could give a little more ﬂavor on those conversations?","Yes, sure. It's Jim. I can start. I think the conversations with our large commercial and industrial customers is going very well. They're very interested in sustainability products in general. We're talking to them about a number of things, the least of which I think is 24/7 and 365 that we've talked about. Our partnership with Microsoft on that product is going really well.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   We plan to pilot that product in this quarter coming out with some customers with the plan to be -- have commercial oﬀering towards the second half of this year for those products. And a lot of our customers are asking for diﬀerent ﬂavors from a type of carbon-free matching and generation supply as well as what percentage of an hourly match you're looking for.  And this platform that we're building with them is going to help us be able to supply that. We do tend to see in these types of customized solutions higher margins than the pure commodity sales when we're just selling energy supply contracts. So I think that's a great opportunity for us in general as these kind of customized sustainability products that they're looking for.  There's been, with the high-energy markets, customers have certainly wanted to understand what the sustainability of these prices are, and they've cut down their terms on some deals, but the margin expansion has occurred for us, as Joe mentioned. So we've seen good results in terms of margin expansion, even just on the supply deal, and then the sustainability products have margin on top of that.  Lots of interest. We hear feedback all the time and get feedback from our customers about how we can help them go ahead and meet their sustainability aspirations and what are part of their ESG goals.     Yes, Paul, I think if I could complement Jim's points here, just, there's one piece of it that the customers are asking us for the sustainability products. The other piece is we see, obviously starting with the U.S. government, a focus on load matching from a geography and a time standpoint.  This is following a trend we've seen in Europe where regulators, customers, governmental entities and producers are all trying to, as I said, bring together the production of clean energy with the consumption of clean energy. If we're really going to move to a clean energy economy, we've got to make sure that those things match up, we send the right price signals for things like storage and other technologies that'll help us match these things up.  So beginning with the executive order that President Biden signed earlier in this year, there's been a growing focus on load match. The other piece of that is what's going to happen out of the SEC process? What are people going to have to demonstrate to support their assertions around sustainability? Those are all big focus areas. But we've got to be ready with the technology to ﬁll the niche to be able to deliver that value to our customers.  And I mentioned this earlier in my comments, the RTOs, too, have to provide the industry with the data that tells us when renewable energy is being produced, when storage is being operated, and where it's happening relative to consumptive load. And many folks are surprised to learn that, right now, the RTOs don't oﬀer that capability. So we've worked with PJM and others, and I complemented PJM's leadership for getting after this.  But there are a lot of pieces that still need to come together for the 24/7 business to really develop it's kind of full muscularity. There are a lot of these regulatory questions that need to be answered, technical capabilities. But what we're trying to do is move this business, and we   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   obviously have the support of supply but move this business into a position where it anticipates the continuing trend in the direction of matching load and generation, which we have to do if we're going to make a dent in the climate crisis."
"Okay very comprehensive. Then one other, if I can, just in light of the $300 million higher total gross margin for 2023, is there a refresh view or a way to think about the Analyst Day disclosure about the $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion free cash ﬂow for 2022 and 2023?","Yes, Paul, it's a good question. We're not going to remark that annual guidance or the multiyear guidance on a quarterly basis. But certainly, I think we talked about the idea, we're conﬁdent in our capital budgets and our cost budgets. So there's more at the top line. You can probably translate it down to what it means for us.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs."
"I actually have two questions, one for Dan, one for Joe. Dan, kind of a little bit of a modeling or just kind of trying to think about the gross margin line. When we see forward curves move up a lot in a year like 2023, safe to assume that you don't get to capture -- for the unhedged portion or uncontracted portion of the portfolio, you don't get to capture all of that beneﬁt simply because some of your retail contracts they have prices set, or if they're ﬂoating, they have caps.  And therefore, when we think about kind of moves in the curves for the unhedged portion of the portfolio that there's some portion of that move that just won't kind of trickle down to your bottom line?","Michael, the forward sales for our customer business are going to be reﬂected in our hedge values, right? So those prices are locked in, and you'll see that in the hedge percentage and in the (inaudible) value. So when prices move, that does translate through. We provide sensitivities in the appendix pages that can be sent (inaudible) the prices.  Those work awfully well, to be totally honest. So when you think about the movements in the market, I think that's a good way to help calibrate where we're heading. But otherwise, we should capture. I mean sometimes when you get into the ﬁnal year and the small percentages, there might be some seasonality where our hedges are. But generally speaking, when you think about a 23 with our position, you should expect that to carry through."
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Got it. Then, Joe, you made a comment in your opening remarks, you talked a lot about how some parts of the world, and especially Europe, may not have focused on the criticality of nuclear generation. I want to talk about that a little bit, and I'm curious for your feedback.  One of Europe's largest nuclear generators has made no moves to retire plants. In fact, they're building plants. But they have faced given legacy issues with the plants or simply just aged, massive operational issues that have brought plants oﬀ-line and have reduced the amount of nuclear power in France, and that impacts the broader European market.  I'm just curious how you think and your team thinks about your nuclear ﬂeet and the U.S. nuclear ﬂeet and the potential whereas these plants age, that operational performance, which has improved dramatically in the U.S. Over the last 10, 15 years for the nuclear ﬂeet, actually turns the other direction or faces headwinds or risks?","Yes, that's a good one, Michael. I think what's aged at our clean energy centers is the name of late. I think when you look at just about every other piece of equipment inside we've updated them aggressively.  You know from watching this company for a long time, and I know you have, that we've invested capital in these machines even during times where commodities were, frankly, at a real trough level. So it's -- I think some folks who are neophytes in our business look at the age when the plant was commissioned and think the plant is that old.  When in reality, the pumps, the main pieces of equipment, oftentimes steam generators and other things that need to be replaced have been replaced -- turbines, we've eﬀectively rebuilt computer systems and electronic controls and cabling systems. So we've done a lot of that work. The situation in France is one that we've talked about we don't have.  The weld issues were a characteristic of the design they use that we don't. The other thing that tends to happen in France is, when they have an issue, they shut down the entirety of the ﬂeet. The U.S. regulators have taken a more structured approach to dealing with issues as they come up and allowing operators to address them during outages.  And it's presumptuous for me to question the way the regulatory environment works in France. But honestly, it's a big part of the story there. But I feel very comfortable about the investments we've made in the plants. I don't think it's like a coal plant, as an example, where everything is of the vintage that it was when the plant was originally built, and you see kind of this sliding performance and increasing cost proﬁle. We haven't seen that.  I think one good illustration of that, frankly, is when we did Peach Bottom, and we went from 60 to 80 years and through the NRC licensing process. What we found was that the investments we have been making to get the plants from 40 to 60 years had a lot more life than that incremental 20-year increase in their license life and carried us through all the way to 80.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   And I think that's illustrative that a lot of the changes that Bryan and his team are making, the technology improvements we've made now for decades are things that will carry us for many decades without expecting any diminishment in the performance of the unit, in fact just the opposite, or any increase in the cost of operating and maintaining the units, in fact just the opposite. So that's the way I would summarize it. Bryan, anything more to add?     I'd just add just much to Dan's chagrin, we invest in the plants like they're going to run forever Joe. So we just stay attuned to that, right? There's nothing signiﬁcant in the future that isn't already on our forecast around making these plants (inaudible) years.     There you go, Michael. You got a little bit of ﬂavor of the discussion in our management team.  Operator  Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners."
"Joe, can you just maybe elaborate on your capital allocation opportunities? It's kind of in light of the potential improvement in cash ﬂows, especially as we're kind of thinking about growth. Are you seeing more organic or inorganic opportunities as we think about kind of asset-level opportunities?  Then conversely, does this kind of environment kind of make your fossil fuel assets more attractive as we think about sale opportunities. So maybe some thoughts on accelerating decarbonization here, for instance, with ERCOT or the Eastern gas assets?","Yes. I would say our Texas assets are worth more now in terms of our own valuation than three months ago when we kicked the company oﬀ. But they're also producing more value. They remain some of the lowest-emitting resources in the entirety of the Texas market.  Look, I think we own the 2 best combined cycle machines in Texas, not only in terms of their operational performance and their emissions levels but something we haven't talked about in Texas, but probably should is the ability to withstand drought conditions because we don't need cooling water. They're air-cold machines. So not only are they very good, but they're air- cold machines. So if you have drought, they're going to be able to run through that. We like where we're positioned there.  And while the work certainly isn't done, and the Texas Commission has acknowledged as much in terms of market design there, they've taken a lot of risk oﬀ the table, and the weatherization   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   eﬀorts there have worked. Point is, yes, I see the rising value of those things, but they're also delivering a lot of value to our customers in Texas right now.  No hurry to give them up. I think the trend in terms of upward value is going to grow even stronger there. Not -- but that's probably where things are going to stop. We're not going to be a company that is going to be buying a lot of additional fossil fuel units. We've made that clear from an ESG commitment standpoint, and that's where things stand right now on that. Does that address your question on fossil?"
"No, it does. That's super helpful. Then just really last thing, sort of maybe be beating a dead horse here on the hedge proﬁle, but maybe just give a little bit more color as we're thinking about the eﬀorts in '24 and '25? I mean some of your peers were able to at least speak maybe directionally with a stated EBITDA range, and the scale of the opportunity seems really large?","Look, I think we have a much bigger open position out there. And as Dan said, we try to give some good sensitivities. I think those are projectable, and the prices are pretty healthy out there. But I'm going to kind of stick to where Dan and I have been throughout the call.  We'll have a period of time later on in the year when we can provide the update we'll provide updates in terms of our performance this year. I want to get through the summer. I want to be able to see how the ﬂeet performs this summer. I want to then be able to factor in things like capital return.  We owe you a big update at the end of the year on those sorts of things, and then we'll start wrapping in '24 to '25. I'm cognizant of what some of the other players in this space have said. Obviously the improved pricing has lifted our boats there. But I want to shy away from being speciﬁc until we get some more ground under our feet. Dan, anything more to add there?     Yes -- no, I agree. I mean charter, just you're looking at hedge percentages and that sort of thing in 24. It is a starting point, A, we gave you '24 at the Analyst Day. We talked about the increase since then. I've highlighted the fact that the Illinois CMC is about 27% of our output. So that's going to be hedged as it is.  The New York assets given where prices are with the ZEC mechanism is going to look like that going forward. You can get a handle on kind of the building blocks of some of those pieces. But as Joe said, you do the math, there's still a lot of open exposure there on our generation link. We think that's going to be an opportunity, particularly with the prices you're seeing in the Mid- Atlantic.      Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   And hopefully, Congress will act, and we'll have some sense of what that looks like for us at the same (technical diﬃculty) So still a lot of moving pieces but a great start.  Operator  This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez, President and CEO, for closing remarks.     Well just -- I just want to end up where I started oﬀ. Thank you, all for your interest in the company. I'm thankful for the men and women who run this company. They've been doing a great job. Look forward to continuing this discussion in our next quarter, and frankly, continuing the good performance. Have a wonderful day.
