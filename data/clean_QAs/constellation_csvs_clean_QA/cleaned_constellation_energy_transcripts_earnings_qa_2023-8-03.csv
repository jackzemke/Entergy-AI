Question,Answer
"I guess a couple of questions. Just on the credit metric slide, the numbers are kind of the same as the last quarter. Are you not yet including the higher assumed guidance for '23 in there?","Correct. Yes, Steve. The way we've approached that slide is we refresh it once a year when we give our full plan for numbers.  So the metrics there, I'll tell you that given the strength in earnings this year, that would certainly favorable before we put STP and time match.  So we do not include updates to our numbers in credit metrics or the cash available as we go to the year's favorability we've seen in '23 and '24 would be additive to the numbers you talked about."
"Okay.  Then, I guess secondly, maybe just a little more kind of color or thought process on the sustainability of this improved environment for wholesale retail margins. You kind of talked about what's driving it. A little more color of what's driving it and just how you're thinking about the sustainability of it beyond?  I know some of it's into '24, but even beyond that.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes, sure, Steve. I mean ﬁrst of all, think about the duration of our products that we typically sell on the market or when your products were selling for 30 months or more in the case of load following options.  So this is -- the deals we're entering into are going to persist for a while.  I think that the margin expansion is really -- and I'm going to invite Jim McHugh, the head of our commercial group, to chime in here, is a reﬂection of the volatility we've seen in the market.  In turn, I think that volatility is a reﬂection of the changing composition of the generation ﬂeet and kind of saw that this -- this summer in Texas, where you have whole home prices and all of a sudden, you have less wind or renewable output and prices spiked asymmetrically really high levels and makes it really diﬃcult for companies that don't have our balance sheet and our generation capabilities to handle, frankly, the impact -- the ﬁnancial impact of that volatility and cover themselves. That's a new phenomenon.  I think that's going to do nothing but increase.  Honestly, Steve, I think reserve margins are about as thick as they're going to be in these markets and as you see fossil generation being replaced with renewable generation. The underlying markets are going to be very volatile and it's going to take a special kind of company with a special balance sheet to cover that. I think the sustainability solutions also allow us to enter into longer deals with customers that really want that sort of product support.  So look, I think this is durable. I think margins will always increase and contract over time.  But what we're seeing here is what I think is going to be a durable long-term trend. And Jim, why don't you get into some of the speciﬁcs of what you're seeing.     Sure. Yes. Thanks, Joe.  Steve, I think adding some color on the duration of the contracts, if you think about in addition to the contract as we sign is the duration of the customer.  We tend to hold customers for at least ﬁve years when once we get them signed up when you think about retention.  So that's another sign towards durability.  I think the macro trends on volatility with add load and electriﬁcation hit and low growth continues or starts to really pick up. Combining with the supply side changes that Joe talked about on the (technical diﬃculty) and other things on the generation side, volatility in multiple of these markets, we think is going to continue in the next several year window, PJM, Texas, New England, New York.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   So I think that optimization activity is durable also.  Then to me, the last thing I would add is the year, as you talked about '23 and we've talked about '24, we deﬁnitely see some of this margin also now going into 2025 as we sign up these customers and the activity we're seeing in the market.  So we expect that to be there over the next few years on the gross margin optimization also.  Then the macro trend of sustainability products is something that you add to that as it scales in the future. We've talked about our core product quite a bit with you all. The amount of volumes we're seeing there and the margins have been continuing to grow. And now we have the possibility with hourly CFE, carbon-free energy matching to look at the next wave of sustainability products to get our customers signed up for longer terms and for decent margins.  So we're feeling good about the sustainability environment, and it really does start with the balance sheet.  Our competitiveness is there. I think others in this interest rate environment with the collateral costs and the borrowing costs hit quite do what we can do.  So I think it's -- we're feeling good about it."
"Great. I have one more question. That was very helpful. Just -- can you maybe update us on your thoughts on the green hydrogen IRA credit treatment?  And I guess aligned with that, how are you thinking about choosing between producing green hydrogen from nuclear or these 24/7 contracts like this?  Just can you maybe go through your thought process on how you're prioritizing among those?","Yes. Let me kind of go at it a little backwards and cover your second question ﬁrst.  So when you think about the time match product we just sold to Microsoft. It's the same sort of product that is going to enable hydrogen production at a customer location, right?  So if you have a reﬁnery, a processing center, if you're distributing hydrogen, and you don't want to make it, for example, behind the fence line of a nuclear plant transported, you can cite the electrolyzer directly at the customer's location.  Then we would sell that customer, time-matched clean energy that would allow that customer to get the tax credit, and we would earn some of the value of that tax credit and the transaction in these longer-term deals that Jim is talking about.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   So it can be a separate product. It can be sold. The 24/7 product can be sold to a Microsoft like company for sustainability reasons, but it could also be sold to enable hydrogen production at the customer location, so-called grid connected hydrogen.  In terms of how we see the current discussions going on in treasury, let me just start with this, Steve. The language of the statute is clear that existing nuclear plants are allowed to earn a tax credit for producing hydrogen. There's no other way to read it.  And frankly, when Congress intends something like, for example, only new resources would be allowed to earn the tax credit, Congress is well aware of how to write that and explain that in the statute. I think Senators (technical diﬃculty), Senator Carbo just came out very publicly this week are exactly right that there was never an agreement on additionality, let alone even a discussion of additionality when this bill was passed.  So to the extent from a regulatory standpoint, people intend to impose that requirement, we believe it will be defeated in court.  But I don't think we're going to get there. We're having very productive conversations with the administration about means of addressing this from a regulatory standpoint so that existing nuclear can begin to be used to make hydrogen and relicensed nuclear plants would eﬀectively count as new. I think those conversations are productive, not only because Democratic allies in Congress are saying what they're saying about this never came up in the process, but also the fact that think about it, with nuclear, the other tiers of the strategy they're trying to achieve, time match, geographic matching already are there.  We could do that immediately tomorrow.  We could start having these contracts and electrolyte is running on time match regionally matched electricity.  And we're going to have to do this because for things like the EPA regulations that I mentioned earlier, that, say for example, that existing natural gas should blend with hydrogen, you'll never ever create that much hydrogen by the deadlines that EPA is seeking unless you allow these existing resources to begin making hydrogen with megawatts that, frankly, are in surplus at diﬀerent times of the year.  So look, I think we've made all of those arguments.  We continue those discussions. I don't want to get into the nitty gritty on these calls of the exact content of those discussions because I think it will be counterproductive.  But I feel conﬁdent.  If at the end of the day those discussions don't go the way we expect, then we'll use the courts to achieve alignment.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   I'm quite conﬁdent that we will be successful.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners."
"Joe, I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question and just drill down a little bit on the ongoing gross margin outperformance we've seen so far this year, and in particular, on the quarter. The retail margin expansion is pretty straightforward. You guys have talked about it a lot this morning.  But where have you seen the wholesale outperformance?  It seems like you were very hedged as of last quarter. Is it primarily the ERCOT CCGTs?  Just some more color there, if you can.","Sure. Shar, let me give it over to Jim.     Sure. Yes. I would start with wholesale load customers, too. I know you've had a focus on our retail customer base.  But on the wholesale side, we've also had decent really good strong performance in wholesale loads. Whether that be load auctions to utility companies, but also structured origination contracts with other large entities and municipals and co-ops.  So we've seen the ability to go sign up customers for load contracts on the wholesale side, too.  So that's part of the wholesale story.  The second one is on the optimization activity, to your point, has really been around kind of this volatility assessment.  And just the decisions we need to make every hour, every day every month, every week, as you see the price movements and load and weather movements where we can kind of optimize the portfolio by setting up the imbalances in the right way of where our generation is and where our load delivered contracts are.  So that's been also a signiﬁcant driver of it.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   So that is the one we're saying we expect to continue because we've had this track record when you see these markets moving around and being volatile.  This is where we've seen this before. This isn't kind of the ﬁrst time we've seen wholesale success in volatile markets.  We just expect that these markets are going to continue to exhibit this behavior based on just the changing stack dynamics.  So I think it's customer business and optimization activity, both that are driving that."
"Fantastic. Helpful.  Then, Joe, just on STP, I realize you guys are somewhat removed from the legal situation between their current owners, and I appreciate the comments in the prepareds.  But any additional color you could provide on your timing expectation right now and how we should be thinking about the potential redeployment of that $1.75 billion if, for like whatever reason, this becomes a more serious roadblock?","Yes, Shar. I'm not even to the second one because, frankly, I think the claims are meritless and will be discussed by a court.  To the extent we ﬁnd any extra capital in our plan, we'll use it for the things we've talked about, double-digit growth opportunities.  If they don't happen, and we don't have any inorganic growth opportunities at that time, we're going to look to deploy value back to our owners.  And Dan and I have not been shy about saying we very much like the value of the company and buying back shares at these price levels. I said it on the ﬁrst quarter call, when the price was in the 70s that we would buy all day long at those prices, and I feel the same way today."
"Okay. Perfect.  Then just lastly for me, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Joe, your dialogue with the New York on net ZECs. Can we just expand on the mechanics of what that will look like going forward?  Is there actually uplift from the transition to the PTC?   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)","Yes. Sure. Shar, let me give -- let me introduce you to Dave Dardis, our General Counsel, who negotiated the provisions of that agreement and is best to answer the details question.     Yes. Thank you. Well ﬁrst, obviously New York was the ﬁrst state to recognize the value of nuclear and what it did for its customers, both from a sustainability perspective as well as managing prices.  So that program was historic.  We've been a strong partner of the state all along under that program.  New York also was able to negotiate a provision in the PTC, which basically ignores the ZEC payments for purposes of calculating the PTC.  In working with New York, what we've agreed to under the amendment we made under a change in law provision of our existing contract is that the ZEC program will be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar of PTC we would otherwise be eligible for them."
"Joe, what have your conversations been like at the policy level around on-shoring nuclear fuel production?  Just curious where you see that going and what's the latest there?","Yes. I think there's some bits of good developments.  So I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen Barron here who heads strategy and legal aﬀairs for us to give an update on that.      Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes.  We have had some good developments on that front.  As you know, we have been encouraging Congress to allocate funding to improve domestic enrichment and conversion services in the U.S.  In July, there was a vote taken in the Senate to include the Nuclear Fuel Security Act into the NDAA as sort of a must-pass bill for this year to fund the military.  So a little bit outside the scope of that topic.  But given the importance of this issue, that provision was added in a vote of 96 to three, which does include $3.5 billion in funding to go to the DOE, again to spur new conversion and enrichment capacity in the U.S.  That was one of several provisions that were positive towards nuclear that were added into the bill. There was an extension of Price Anderson by 20 years, streamlining of NRC review of new reactors and the additional funding for domestic sources of fuel.  So it may be one of the last remaining issues that's bipartisan in the Senate, but continued support for the nuclear industry is certainly something that was behind those three provisions, and we think is a good signal for how Congress and federal policymakers are thinking about our business."
"Got it. That's helpful.  Then just looking back to what your expectations were around nuclear fuel cost heading into this year, how has that been tracking in terms of market pricing of nuclear fuel and your ability to lock that in going forward?  Then a kind of similar topic just on O&M trends this year, how is your overall O&M expense been following against your earlier guidance?","Dave, this is Dan.  On the nuclear fuel side, we laid out on the fourth quarter earnings call that we were procuring fuel to make sure that even if we were to not have our rush deliveries executed on, we'd have enough fuel to meet all of our needs through 2028. I can tell you the actions have continued to deliver on schedules. We're in a better position than we were coming into the year. We're very happy about that. I feel very conﬁdent in all of our deliveries.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   As we look out, we'll continue to execute on that plan.  We also shared with you that having up to 2028, our nuclear cost will still be below $6 a megawatt an hour through our income statement, and that remains on track.  So that's all in good shape.  But as far as O&M is concerned, we are on plan, I'd say with our core O&M that Joe hit on in his prepared remarks, you'll see a bit of an increase in our disclosures. That has to do with proﬁt sharing and other incentives associated with the signiﬁcant outperformance we're having in 2023. When you look at 2024 in that same table, you see that will be consistent with year-end.  So we're on course and comfortable with our projections.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America."
"Just to follow up on Shar's question brieﬂy. In terms of the New York agreement with the ZEC and the PT center play how would that change the cash tax rate, whether for 2024 or beyond?  Just I think that there's some savings as you switch from pretax to post tax there.","Paul, I think we're probably not going to be in a place to give you speciﬁcs on cash tax rate. There's a lot of things that are going to move period-to-period with CapEx, bonus depreciation, timing of the cash taxes that Exelon is still owed back, they still owe to us at this point in time. There's a lot of pieces that will go into it as well as the DTC timing.  So I probably wouldn't isolate it's one particular issue. I think the forecasts we have are pretty solid at this point in time."
"Okay.  But at least just generically, if you kind of -- the New York agreement and if you do things in other states, is it right to think that should be cash tax savings prospectively?","I think there could be an opportunity when we look at our cash tax bill over time to get more eﬀective, and this could be a piece of it.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)"
"Okay. Great.  Then quickly going back to the Microsoft deal, very interesting to see that one. The nuclear energy, whether it's the energy certiﬁcates, the CFCs, are those coming from Constellation nuclear plants or diﬀerent nuclear plants to serve Microsoft?  Just curious there.","Yes. Paul, it's Jim, they are coming from Constellation nuclear plants.  The hourly matching and the geography are both pieces of the nuclear plants that will source the hours by which Microsoft will buy nuclear power from us.  Operator  That concludes today's question-and-answer session.  I'd like to turn the call back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks.     Well thanks again everybody, for joining the call. We'll end the call now and get back to work.  Have a great day.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.
