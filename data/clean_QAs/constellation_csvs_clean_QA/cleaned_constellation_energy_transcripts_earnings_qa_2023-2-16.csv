Question,Answer
"Alright. Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Maybe this question is for Dan. I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on the higher growth-related CapEx that you've outlined in the updated slides. And speciﬁcally, you discussed generically that these organic growth projects will exceed your double-digit thresholds.  So I want to conﬁrm that this is a double-digit unlevered IRR threshold ﬁrst and foremost. But then I was also hoping that maybe you could discuss a little bit if we look at these three diﬀerent channels whether it be hydrogen, nuclear uprates or repowering, could -- are there diﬀerent return proﬁles for each one of these or just disproportionate return? And is this driven by a function of the leverage that you think you can put on these discrete projects? Or is it driven more by the overall economic margins you see prior to the leverage?","Hey, James, I'll start oﬀ. It's an unlevered return threshold. We've been hopefully clear on that in these calls. It's hard to kind of say the diﬀerent ways will always have diﬀerent value. But we see a lot of value in the upgrades. Dan could kind of walk through why that is. But it's combination of the capacity factor and the fact that we could do these upgrades and not have the O&M that any other kind of asset would have.  And I think on hydrogen, we're still learning. I think -- what I can tell you is we're comfortably within the parameters that we've set for investments. And I think as we start rolling through some of these investments, you'll have a better sense of how repeatable they are and what the numbers actually are. And I know we will announce those projects as we get to execution, and you'll get a chance to see that. Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about the upgraded work?   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      Yes. I mean it's kind of interesting when you think about the uprates at 135 megawatts. It's a lot of megawatts when you put it in clean energy equivalent value, right? It's almost the same as 400 megawatts of wind. We're going to get that equivalent energy output $200 million with the same $27.50 per megawatt hour PTC tax credit, right? So think about the gearing on how many megawatts you get to that amount of capital is quite attractive.  As Joe said, all of that back-end work, right? There's no additional O&M. There's no additional fuel to make those work. So there's -- the economics on those look awfully good, and we're continuing to run down a list of projects to see what else we can advance forward. It will take some time to get those on, as I said, just based on the timing of getting equipment manufactured and then managing the reﬁlling our business. But that's -- and it's great for the environment. It's great for the company. So we're real excited about those.  I think the other question you asked was about kind of leverage and how that's aﬀecting the return? As Joe said, these are all unlevered investments at this point in time. Our assumption is we're managing our balance sheet to that 35% CFO to debt. That's been kind of the buoy [ph] for us for the last year and will continue to be. So the future opportunities to think about ﬁnding some diﬀerently. We'll look at that. But I think we have the time to further in service to make those decisions."
"Okay. Great. Thank you so much for that. And I guess just one other real quick question. I guess in sort of pre-spinout, one of the things you talked about in terms of capital return is obviously the dividends and the organic growth. But there was also a discussion in terms of common stock buybacks versus special dividend. Can you give us a little bit of a view, I guess, on how you're thinking about that trade-oﬀ between doing common stock buybacks versus actually when you would actually look at a special dividend as a preferred route to get money back to shareholders?","Yes, it's a good question. And thinking about where we are, it's been quite a year, and we've learned an awful lot about the business as far as where our investment opportunities are. The IRA dramatically began to change the landscape for opportunities to deploy capital. I think about hydrogen, think about the operators, there's a lot of things that have really opened up, and we made a lot of progress this year, $1.5 billion of growth capital from an organization that wasn't putting that kind of capital to work.  Our expectation is 2022, we're going to learn a lot more about the opportunities for investment. We're going to see how inorganic opportunities play their way through. But I think we're going to continue to learn more about the size, scope and duration of our investments. And that will then inform some of our capital allocation decisions for the long term, right? We think that the dividend increase today made a lot of sense. It's still 20% or less of our free cash ﬂow before growth. We think that's a very reasonable payout at this time. And it will continue to   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   evolve. But I think the balance right now is the growth investment, the dividend and the buyback is the right setup.     Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, James is that, obviously, we're looking at the relative value of our stock right now compared to other assets in the market. At the end of the day, the Board is making a determination of how we feel about our own company, our value and the value of the investment in stock. That will move around certainly over the course of the years, and it may cause us to make diﬀerent decisions halfway. But that relative value and the tax correction are things that drove us to a buyback."
"Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. So just a couple of things. The increase in CapEx related to fuel, could you just talk to how much of that is kind of this inventory build versus actual higher fuel cost? And then also just how long does this inventory build last? Does that higher level of CapEx start rolling down after the period you're showing? Or could you get some sense on that?","Yes, Steve, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. But what I said in the prepared remarks is the majority of that increase is associated with inventory over this period in time. Remember that what we're doing right now is we're continuing to expect that the Russian deliveries are contracted to provide, will continue to occur. We will be buying fuel from other providers who will make sure that we would cover any potential Russian shortfalls. We'll be net building inventory out towards 2028, assuming Russian delivery -- if the Russians were to -- if fuel is no longer available to us the capital numbers would change.  We are admittedly seeing higher prices both on the pieces of fuel we had not previously purchased. And then we've talked to you in the past about there some hedge advance in our numbers. When you saw uranium move, really conversion and enrichment services go up 50% to 100% over the course of the year due to the conﬂict, that is putting upward pressure on that fuel bill. So it is more than inventory reserve.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)"
"Okay. Secondly, on the hydrogen project. When we think about how you're going to capture returns there, obviously you'll have an investment and some kind of, as you said, contracts for the hydrogen. But how should we think about the interaction between the nuclear plant and what it sells its power at to the hydrogen projects? Like is -- will some of the return come from that side, too? Or how should we think about that?","Yes. I think that when you look at the returns, right, the power sales have got to stand on their own, right? We look at the returns or economics of the hydrogen facility, the input production of hydrogen in sale, that's what we're talking about, the double-digit leverage returns. So the investment there, the production and sale of the hydrogen is going to make economic sense on its own. The generation will be sold at a price that makes sense for us also. So we're not co- mingling our returns adjusted by a hydrogen bill.     Yes. Steve, it's a really cool kind of investment because in a certain sense, if energy prices were to decline, there's incremental value on the hydrogen side because what's happening. Let's just kind of pretend some numbers here. Let's suppose prices go from $40 to $35. From a company standpoint, we're going to get the tax credit that will true us back up at $43.75 for the energy sale. Plus production of hydrogen just became cheaper. So it's -- we've talked about it quite a   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   bit here. It's one of these interesting things that's been the holy grail in this business. How do you ﬁnd value in businesses that are negatively co-variant to natural gas?  So that actually, when natural gas prices go down, it's a better story for Constellation and the top line story is immediately what's happened to power crisis. Before supporting the PTC, does that to a signiﬁcant degree, as Dan mentioned. But the other piece of it that's interesting is this interaction between power prices, making hydrogen even more economically viable at lower prices. So it's the ability to get both of these production tax credits that makes it a very good strategic way for us."
"Great. And last question just on -- obviously, last fall, you were very focused on M&A at the time and now not as much. And maybe you could give us some perspective on just what are you seeing in the nuclear M&A market that from the processes you've kind of been looking at it such? And how does that kind of impact your thoughts on that for the future?","Look, I -- we're always bound by conﬁdentiality when we look at any group of assets or any companies. So I'm not going to get into the speciﬁcs. What I would say is the same impact that has happened to our ﬂeet and the value of our company is expressed in those acquisition values for M&A. But that's where we get to kind of have to take a little bit more of a disciplined view of looking at the quality of the assets that are available, how well they have been maintained and this big criteria for us around dual unit sites as opposed to single unit sites. For our ﬂeet, we're invested in 23 units. 21 of them operate as a dual unit site or eﬀectively as a dual unit site. The only two plants that are outliers are Clinton, right, and Guinea [ph]. And in both those circumstances, the reason they're part of our ﬂeet is because the states have had clean energy policies that require the existence and continued operation of these plants.  So that's the way we've looked at it. We've run every single one of these assets out there. We know exactly what to look for in diligence and we've been disciplined. I'm not trying to signal to you that we think any less of the consolidation opportunity. That's not my intent here. But I think when people heard us talk about discipline, they had a view that, that was something that we sold on and we're not. We already have a tremendous business here, unparalleled by any other group of assets, and I'm not going to dilute it by overpaying for anything. If there are assets that come to us that are available at what we believe is a reasonable price and they meet the criteria we talked about, we're going to go after it. But it takes two hands to clap in this space.  And I think the other reality is we probably aren't seeing the same passion for separating these assets from traditionally regulated utilities that exist in pre-IRA and frankly throughout the separation of Exelon into its two component parts. So that's what we're seeing. I think there will still be opportunities, and we'll kick the tire on everything. So I don't want to indicate a lack of opportunity, but it's the reality of our discipline and the reality, as I said, of the fact that these units are more valuable in the IRA setting, and strategically, companies are holding on to them."
I'm just wondering just you've got $2 billion of additional capital that hasn't yet been allocated. Wondering just what the milestones or timing you would envision in terms of identifying other investment opportunities to start to allocate that capital. Could more opportunities kind of pop up through 2023? Or is that potentially a chunk that could roll over into 2024 and serve as an ongoing base for a potential allocation?,"David, it's a good question. I'd say that -- as I said, we've learned a lot in 2022 about opportunities going forward. We have a lot of things in queue that we're looking at right now. Joe reiterated the fact that we're still very interested in inorganic opportunities when they make the right sense for us and maintaining that ﬂexibility. And I think there's $2 billion certainly aﬀorded that to us to look at opportunities they progress this year and into next year makes a lot of sense.  I don't think we have a shot clock saying we're going to have a decision by X date to release some amount of this money if we don't have an investment or whatever, but we'll be prudent as we saw this year as far as making high-return investments and then returning the excess. And that's how you should look at us moving forward."
"Okay. Got it. And then I was just wondering, just digging a little bit more into the hydrogen opportunities, I was curious which end markets you're envisioning in terms of who might be the oﬀ-takers for the hydrogen? Wanted to clarify, they're taking the volume directly from the site so you don't have to deal with transportation. And I was also just curious if there's an electrolyzer producer or technology identiﬁed at this point?","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes, David. On the latter, we have that -- the developer and who's going to make the electrolyzers. We have a pretty good sense of that. But we haven't announced it ﬁrst day and we went into a competitive process. So I'm going to hold on that. In terms of the oﬀtake, you're exactly right. We're looking for opportunities where the customer counterparty is at the site, taking the hydrogen at the site without the need to compress or otherwise transform through pipelines or whatnot the hydrogen to other facilities.  I guess the cautionary point on all of that is that, we're part of this hub and that hub is still evolving. And so I do anticipate there are possibilities that hubs will include pipelines, hydrogen to customers that are oﬀ our premises, and we'll see how that kind of plays out. But -- and I hate to not share it all, but I don't want to front-run the announcements we'll be making on this, and we've still got some commercial terms that we've got to work through and get these deals executed."
Okay. Got it. And no indication at this point as to just the end market in terms of if it's industrial uses or fertilizer or jet fuel or other areas like that?,"Not proportionally, but the answer is, yes. I think at the end of the day, it's going to be all of the above will be markets for hydrogen that are at best produced at our site. But let me kind of leave it there."
"Hey, good morning to you also. I was hoping, could you elaborate a little bit on that comment on the slide about working with the state policymakers to reduce the nuclear support, I assume,   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   the ZECs? What states are you working with? And what would the timing, whether that's legislative or regulatory, to get conclusion?","Paul, I've long ago learned that the worst way to kind of have these discussions with policymakers is to talk a heck of a lot about them on earnings calls because we're having these conversations where you would expect us to have them. Let me ﬂip it over to Kathleen with the caution that these are conﬁdential discussions and we'll see how they unfold.     Yes. Sure, Joe. I mean I think you know the locations where we're talking about. We have state programs in three places and we have four programs across those states. So that's where we are. And of course, the goal is to make sure that these states that acted ﬁrst to keep the plants online get some beneﬁt coming out of the national support for the nuclear ﬂeet. So what we need to work through is just precisely how those provisions are going to work, both federal and state, and importantly, the timing to make sure that everything lines up properly. So as we said, we've started to have the conversations and we will let them play out according to how the states would like them to and not sort of discuss that anymore at this point."
"Okay. Duly noted. And then I know you commented a little bit on the special dividend commentary and relative value. But just at a high level, what's the philosophy around the authorized share repurchases? Is it something more programmatic or opportunistic?","Yes. And I think as Joe said, we see real value in our software. It is here today. We have the $1 billion authorization. I think we will ﬁnd ways to be in the market and I probably want to get into the strategy more than that isn't like particularly prudent to get too much of a layout. But we like where the stock is here for sure."
"Okay. Great. Thank you, all.  Operator  And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks.","Well, thanks, everybody, again, for joining the call for your interest in our company. It's been a great ride this ﬁrst year. But as I noted earlier, our attention now is focused on '23 and beyond. We're oﬀ to a strong start. And I just want to thank again the folks at Constellation who made   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   this happen every single day at the plants, in the commercial business and the back oﬃce functions. The stats ought to demonstrate this, but we feel we have the best team in the business, and we're just really excited by what the future may hold for us. So thanks again to everybody, and we'll talk again at the next quarter.  Operator  This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
