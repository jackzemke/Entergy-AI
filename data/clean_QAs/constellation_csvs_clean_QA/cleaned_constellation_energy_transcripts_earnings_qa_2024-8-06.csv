Question,Answer
"Joe, just starting with the colocation backdrop, does the FERC technical conference -- I think you kind of alluded to this, does it kind of prolong the timeline for a deal announcement at this point? And can you give us just any color on timing of a potential deal or how your potential counterparties are viewing the ISA process right now?","Yeah, sure. I think it could slow things down in terms of folks looking for certainty. But as we kind of think about it, right, you think about the ancillary services that people are debating here, you think of the totality of those ancillary services is relatively small. We actually think it's zero just as PPL and Talen do in terms of the physical application we have. But even an allocation of these ancillary services is relatively a small amount. And if they're metered as PJM proposes, we're talking about really low dollars per megawatt hour, $1 to $2 to $3 a megawatt hour at most. Those kinds of charges aren't going to change the economic viability of these projects, even if they're imposed. And, again, we think the better argument is no charge will be imposed in terms of the conﬁguration we're talking about.  So, from our customers' perspective, it's about crafting provisions in the contract that allocate those contingencies to the extent they occur and then -- and we've had to kind of deal with that in the negotiations of the deal. But these things continue to march forward. I think in the long run, having clarity is going to be the most important thing and getting through this -- and Talen getting through its ISA and having clarity is only going to kind of speed up the process and speed up deal execution because people will then know exactly what they're contracting for. So, that's kind of the way we see it. We'll continue to work for it. I don't think we need to wait until the end of a FERC process to announce a deal. Like I said, contracting provisions will handle all contingencies that might occur with regard to that FERC proceeding. And we really don't see an outcome here where the FERC is going to say, you can't do this. I mean, we've outlined the four reasons in the script. I won't go through them again, but this is kind of a -- this is important on so many levels to get done, the policymakers in the states want it to get done. And I think that message will come through loud and clear in the process. I actually think it's a good opportunity to educate and inform people and kind of get this all out there. This is again not a really new idea, but it's new to many. And so, we've got to walk-through the process.  Kathleen, I don't know if you have anything to add in terms of the timing of the conference, what you expect to say?      Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   No. I mean, I think you covered it, Joe. This kind of meeting is the kind of meeting that FERC holds from time-to-time when they want to learn something about a topic. Last year, they had a technical conference on the EPA proposed 111(d) rule. And I've participated in these on both sides, both as the commission and as a stakeholder. And it really is a great opportunity for there to be interaction between stakeholders and the commissioners in an informal setting like a conference as opposed to doing so in litigation. So, that we can answer questions, we can talk about the beneﬁts as we see them and get the issues out there in the open in a setting where it's less adversarial than a litigated docket. And in terms of the Talen case, when we look at the narrowness of the deﬁciency letter, as Joe pointed out, it's very similar in language to other deﬁciency letters that have been issued on ISAs that have non-conforming language, asking very narrow -- one really narrow question about why those provisions are necessary. You contrast that to what typically happens where there are long list of questions in deﬁciency letters reﬂecting concerns from the commission or questions from the commission. That does not occur here. So, they're really -- if you zoom out signaling that they intend to keep the Talen proceeding focused on the Talen facts, and they're going to use the standard tool that they have this tech conference to learn some more about the topic. So, we see this as a very constructive way to move forward and, frankly, a responsible one on the FERC's behalf."
"Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, BRA, I mean, I guess, it's open to interpretation on whether we actually do instant new entry into the market. I guess, obviously, Joe, you're in discussions. What's your view on some of the commentary out of some of the T&D utilities? And it's been topical on these calls as regarding just PPA-ing or rate-basing peakers in PJM if the market doesn't move fast enough. Thanks, guys.","Yeah, sure. I don't think that's really any diﬀerent. I've now been in this business seemingly for so long that I remember these cycles over and over again. We've had these discussions before. But in states like Pennsylvania, states like Ohio, they've been pretty clear, let alone places like Illinois, where I just think that conversation would be impossible. They've been very clear that they want the markets to work and there's great evidence here that the PJM market has worked. We've seen high prices before in the PJM market. And in fact, even with these higher prices, the point I made in my opening remarks here is that we're still at a lower point than we were 15 years ago. And it's just -- it's a testament to the value of competition. I think stakeholders in those states get it. I think there is a genuine concern about the growth rates in terms of spending on the T&D system. And I don't see policymakers naturally going to the view that monopolization of the generation sector -- further monopolization of the generation sector is going to be the answer now, frankly, any more than I ever did. So, we'll respond to those points. But right now, we just have a new FERC process in the capacity auction. We need to give it the time to work. There's no evidence whatsoever through history or anything that's going on now that competition isn't going to address this problem, right? So, that's our view."
"I was wondering, does the outcome of the PJM auction just in terms of how high prices got, does that increase the urgency that you're hearing from potential data center counterparties to get some of these colocation deals done?","Yeah. I think it increases urgency both in terms of that and also urgency in terms of locking down in front of the meter deals because it is a tightening market and people are seeing that. And in particular for clean and reliable megawatts, it creates a huge opportunity, I think, for PJM's [ph] business to go and meet the demand of these customers. And we're certainly seeing that. We've reshaped the team. We've refocused the team through a lot of eﬀort on PJM's part to go out and meet and address the needs of these customers and we're seeing a pretty signiﬁcant appetite there. I think it also signals that even with the forecasted growth, right, because the data center growth was in the forecast that PJM used when it ran the auction, it's evidence that we have the supply needed in PJM to address this data center growth. So, I think it was a positive on two fronts. I think it -- now we have the forecast in and the market still responded with enough generation to meet the reliability needs of the system and -- but at the same time, we do see a tightening in the market and people need to get moving to lock up their supply. So, I think it's additive."
"Yeah, got it. That makes sense. And then another question that we've had is, as you're working on data center deals, should we be assuming that dual unit plants make the most sense with one unit acting as backup or is there demand or certain structures where you could fully contract a dual unit plant? What would that structure potentially look like?","Yeah. Great question, Dave. For us that we started with the dual units because that made the most sense, right? One -- as you noted, one unit becomes the natural backup for the other unit during outages. But as we've gotten smarter in this, it really depends on the type of data center, whether it's an inference data center or a learning data center. And it really depends on what -- how the hyperscaler intends to evolve the facility. I don't think we've seen all the conﬁgurations. And I could easily see circumstances where behind the meter data centers are located in the same region as on-grid data centers and eﬀectively provide reliability through ﬁber as opposed   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   through to -- through wires and backup generation where on-grid picks up the behind the meter data needs when the data center is in outage mode. So, we could see those conﬁgurations. I could frankly see those conﬁgurations evolving even at the dual unit stations. We're learning a lot. It's -- despite the enthusiasm, we certainly feel it and we know our owners feel it, we're still fairly early innings in terms of understanding all of the diﬀerent use cases and how our resources will interact with the grid and will interact with these customers. Honestly, I think in talking to them, the customers are still ﬁguring it out. So, I at this point wouldn't rule out anything. We do think the most natural place is the dual unit site, both in terms of the volume of electricity and the natural backup. We think those are going to be the ﬁrst sites to be selected, and so far appears to be the case."
"Yeah, hi, good morning. Sorry, I wanted to just try to kind of better clarify a little bit more on the colocation kind of timeline. So, I think we'll have a technical conference in the fall, but I don't think we're going to get kind of any next step from that probably till sometime in 2025, most likely, policy statement or 206 or whatever? And, I guess, we will have a Talen outcome by the fall. So, just in terms of thinking about just the realistic timeframe to kind of get the -- be helpful to get clarity as you said. I mean, is this something that we should kind of not expect to hear more until sometime next year or is this something that we could still see something happen even this year even as these things are still kind of in-process?","I think that something you're referring to is a deal done, right?"
"That's helpful. Thanks. And then just on -- one, this has been a very public, kind of gotten very noisy process. And I would assume some of these customers don't really love kind of seeing that and such. So, just, is that in a way impacting at all the ability to kind of get things done with the customer. Is that a concern?","Not yet, Steve, but the customers are paying attention to this. And by the way, so are the policymakers. Look, if this stuﬀ is happening, and I'll just -- Talen is not our deal, but I'll use it as an illustration. Talen in that arrangement is bringing $10-plus billion, maybe more than $20 billion of economic development to a region that, if we're going to be honest, hasn't seen a lot of sunshine from an economic development standpoint of this dimension in a long, long time. And I think it's fair to say that policymakers around Pennsylvania like to see that for communities like this that aid jobs and economic opportunities. And I think it's fair to extrapolate from that that they won't like it very much if people interfere with those things and cause it to come oﬀ the rails. And so, I think the policymaker reaction, the labor reaction, which, of course, drives policymakers in many of our jurisdictions, they're all pretty important factors. So, I think we'll see that play out. And I think that pushes parties to try to work these things out.  The other thing is from a customer standpoint, right, you want to be in a jurisdiction that is pro and friendly to data centers and gives these companies every option. And I think in the early innings that probably isn't the case. And I noticed that you pointed that out in some of your research. So, look, we're not at a place right now where people are saying, have a circle around a particular jurisdiction with a red stripe thrill like the Ghostbusters thing. But I think people are paying attention to it. Policymakers want this to happen. They want the parties to work it out. So, at the end of it, we will go anywhere we need to go to have a discussion. If we could only have the discussion in proceedings, state or federal, we'll have the discussions in state or federal proceedings. But we think the clear signal from what happened at FERC from the rejection of ban legislation in Maryland is to tell parties, work these issues out, this economic development is important. I don't think we're the only ones hearing that message. And we'll strive and we do this every day to have conversations. You don't have to have every policy conversation in a proceeding. And frankly, if we did, regulators and lawmakers would never sleep. So, we need to continue to have those discussions.  I just -- in my view, Steve, it's this. If you have clean energy centers in your jurisdiction and you could oﬀer that opportunity, that's a huge advantage for the incumbent utility to make the state a place that's friendly to the data economy. And what we've seen before is one data center attracts more because they kind of work together. So, I just think the approach here of thinking about this as a zero-sum game is really just kind of the wrong mindset. And I think we just got to kind of get through that phase here. And where you are working very hard to do it, our owners expect us every day to work on the things that bring the spectacular results that our team is   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   announcing today. That's what we want to be working on. We don't want to be tied up in proceedings all over the place. We will if we have to, but we prefer to resolve these issues in a way that's friendly to what policymakers want and what customers want. That's what we aim to achieve."
"Thanks for squeezing me in. Yeah, no, thank you. Lots of good content today. I want to shift and kind of run with that last one you mentioned a little bit. I know we're all focused on FERC, but you mentioned Maryland. Just holistically, what are some of your state legislative priorities to support the colocation strategy? I know Maryland has Senate Bill 1, but if you could just comment more broadly what kind of the focuses are at the state level? That'd be helpful.","Paul, I think we're going to be largely reactive to what we're seeing, but we will work with customers with labor unions and others to make sure that all opportunities remain on the table for economic growth. But we're not sitting here thinking about launching legislation. We think this is like the co-gen stuﬀ that I alluded to or the microgrid stuﬀ that we've talked about largely handled in the regulatory arena."
"Okay. Understood there. And I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the customer bill impacts from the PJM auction, some of the beneﬁts for all parties from the colocation strategy. But just curious, if you have any initial estimates of like what the beneﬁts would be in terms of rate reductions for rate payers, if there was like a hypothetical 1 gigawatt data center or colocation, some of your peers have kind of put out some numbers, but curious if you've done the analysis that you're willing to share?   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)","Well, I will point to either Kathleen or, David Dardis, our General Counsel, we could talk certainly about some of what we've presented in our case, but we have generally seen a $1 billion of costs associated with a 1 gigawatt of load, right? And in jurisdictions where a lot of that is socialized, 90% or more, and frankly, I think that's an underestimate because that just includes the kind of direct substation work, it doesn't include the work behind the substation that may be necessary. But we see some jurisdictions where a lot of that is spread out to many other customers. In our applications, those hyperscalers are paying for the connection. Now, it's not a $1 billion because the connection is occurring right at the plant, which is the point, right? So, what we're doing is creating switchyards and other things that are one-tenth of those costs to connect the same amount of load, but you could see easily a factor of 10x, I actually think it's more, when you talk about putting a data center out on the grid somewhere and a lot of those costs get socialized to customers that aren't the hyperscalers. And so, that's the real beneﬁt.  But the other thing that -- that, look, Paul, when we're talking about this, we are pretending as if the grid could easily host a 1 gigawatt of load. When I was at ComEd, the largest load we ever had in the system was steel mills at 150 megawatts, right? If -- when I was General Counsel at PECO, the largest load or one of the largest loads we had were the reﬁneries in Philadelphia, 60 megawatts, 70 megawatts. The notion that you could accumulate enough power somewhere on the grid to power a 1 gigawatt data center is frankly laughable to me that you could do that in anywhere that doesn't start with decades of time, right? This is an enormous amount of power to go out and try to concentrate it. Think about it, you're building three 345 KV lines with all the attendant substations to create all of the redundancy, each one of those substations having to draw power from an independent source. It just -- it has always made sense. This is not new. It's always made sense that when you're talking about large load, you're going to bring it closer to large generation resources. And when you're talking about large load that also wants to use zero-emission energy, you're going to bring it very close to nuclear power plants.  We need to make sure that policies don't inadvertently drive us to spending billions of dollars, where cheaper solutions are available, quicker solutions are available. And from an electrical engineering standpoint, more prudent and frankly feasible solutions are available. So, we're going to have those policy discussions, but I think that's what's going to be revealing in the FERC discussion. And I think it's powerful if you want to take a look at one document that I think lays this out pretty clearly, Mike Kormos, who for many, many years was the leader of transmission, all things transmission at PJM, published a report. He was also Senior Vice President of Transmission for Exelon for a period of time in his career about exactly the issues I just described. The feasibility of connecting and the cost of connecting super large loads somewhere on the grid as opposed to colocation. I think it lays it out pretty succinctly in his expert report. Those are the things we'll be talking about to regulators and policymakers. There's going to be opportunities for data centers in both places, but dimensionally, the bigger we get, the closer we're going to be to the generation source if we are going to have any chance of doing this in a manner that addresses the nation's need for timely action."
"Great. No, thank you, again. Really appreciate all of the context.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Operator  Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Joe Dominguez for any further remarks.","Well, thank you. We've had a great beginning to the year. And, again, just want to give a shout out to our all -- all of our folks that made it happen. We really feel strongly about our performance to-date. We really feel strongly about what we think we're going to be able to accomplish in the balance of the year and the work we're doing. Appreciate the robust discussions we've had today around colocation. One always gets concerned that one particular issue distracts from the overall beneﬁts of the company that have -- that are really laid out in the last slide we have in the deck about the unique opportunities we have here. We're super- excited about them. We appreciate your attention, your focus on Constellation, your ownership and I guarantee you we'll continue to focus on the things that create value for you.  With that, Michelle, I'll end the call.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect.
