Question,Answer
"Well, Joe, you even got the operator excited. So I think that's the ﬁrst.","Well, we thank Liz for that. Enjoy the show. She's a shareholder."
"Yes. So this bill's not passed yet, and so I just want to just get a little more color on your conﬁdence, such conﬁdence that it's going to get done, and also make sure that the corporate min tax provisions would not impact Constellation.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)","Yes. Let's do it backwards. Dan, why don't you talk about the AMT ﬁrst?     Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. So when we talk about our cash tax exposure, I guess, number one, certainly, we're going to be over the $1 billion pretax earnings threshold as we look forward. So we'll qualify it in that sense. We've told you that we expect that our cash tax rate to be moving up from a modest payer this year to be a more meaningful payer next year and the years beyond.  When we look at '23, our cash tax rate would be above the AMT under all circumstances. We would expect to be a cash taxpayer, absent the PCC, once that goes in eﬀect in '24, we'll manage the credits to cover our tax liabilities and use the transfer market to monetize those that wouldn't ﬁt and rate the AMT construct.     Thanks, Dan. And Steve, as to your question on the IRA, it's -- look, there's just a lot of work that's been done, and we're pretty close. At this point, what we're seeing is probably what everybody is seeing who's following the bill.  Strong progress, getting managed on board was key. Senator Sinema is out there, reports yesterday on some, what I would describe, maybe not others, but what I would describe as fairly modest changes to the bill. And so if that all holds true and the parliamentarian gets the work done, we see a pathway to passage here in August. And then, of course, they'll go to the house when they come back from recess. But there's no reason, at this point, that we could see not to be conﬁdent. Kathleen, do you have anything to add?     No, I think that's right. I mean, I think, Steve, you've followed us for long enough. You've seen hurdles get cleared over the last couple of months. There are a couple of remaining, as Joe said, the problem with is getting to work on the tax title and the energy title. And we just -- we have a couple of more days here to let the Senate continue doing their work, but we're getting close.  Operator  Great. So the next question is that's wrapped up is going to be from Paul Zimbardo at Bank of America. Paul, give me one second to move you to the queue and then you're ready to rock and roll."
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   I'll will be the next context today. Appreciate it. Wanted to touch a little bit on the cost side of the business. Just given the inﬂationary pressures, are the guidance -- the multiyear guidance that you put out for O&M, maintenance capital, still good ones to focus on, or are you starting to see some pressure on those numbers?","Hey, Paul. I think we're -- like everybody else, we're starting to see some labor pressure. But we beneﬁt from a few things here. We have -- for the O&M at our plants, we have long-term agreements to support the operation of the plants. And they have built in escalators at 2% to 3%. And that's something, obviously, we had already factored into our plan. So we -- that being probably one of the largest drivers of our cost is locked in.  Most of our big labor agreements are also locked in, in some cases, through 2027 at 2.5%. So we're not immune in this environment to inﬂationary pressures, but we ﬁnd ourselves in a pretty strong position. I'll also add, we carry -- and this is one of our strengths, we carry a lot of the nuclear parts inventory in-house so that we could quickly recover from maintenance events. And that's a beneﬁt because it's already bought. It's already on the sidelines here. Dan, anything more to add on that?     I think that's right. We'll keep an eye on all the pieces, but certainly, between the labor deals that we have and the supply contracts, the delays that signiﬁcantly played out at this point.     Yes. I think we feel comfortable, Paul, is the bottom line."
"Okay. Great. And if I could quickly ask just about the nice uptick in new customer win rates, renewal rates, just how those conversations have evolved now that commodity prices have proven pretty sticky, to be higher than before?","Yes. Well, I'm going to ask Jim McHugh to weigh in, but I think you just -- you've actually nailed it.  I think in the early days, and we certainly saw this in the ﬁrst quarter, renewal rates were down because our customers quite naturally were wondering if this is a short-term blip and things were going to kind of cascade backwards to where prices were before. And now we see a lot more renewables. Now some of that's just time-driven. Some of these contracts are coming up. Customers have to make the decision. But I think the conversations we're having, Jim, right, are that customers now understand we've had a transformation in energy pricing, and they're locking in deals.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      Yes, I think that's right, Paul. From a pure locking-in commodity perspective, they have to get their budget certainty, too, right. So they're coming up on their renewals, and they're coming up on when they need to kind of get their deals, unable to drag their feet for a little bit.  But it's pretty apparent, I think, to them and to us that we're kind of in a diﬀerent energy complex right now, and they're more willing to lock in. We saw that during the second quarter with the increased renew rates. We also saw increased -- during the second quarter, the terms stretched out a little bit longer from where they were in the ﬁrst quarter.  So both of those, I think, are indicators of what Joe just mentioned. And of course, these same customers are also talking to us about the future products, too, because they have an eye on their sustainability needs and their energy footprint. So those conversations are generally going pretty well right now.  Great. Thank you, both.     Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Great. Thanks, Paul. Good questions. And next up to ask a question is Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim, and Shar, give me one second, while I activate you for questions."
"Good morning. So I guess, I wanted to start with your comments on growth in capital allocation and how that kind of ties into the IRA potentially passing this summer. Would that change your views at all around inorganic nuclear growth. And are you seeing any opportunities out there right now?   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)","You know, I think I've talked a little bit about this before on last quarter's call. I always thought that with the IRA out there, and we were certainly seeing this, it was just going to be hard to pin down valuation. Sellers were always going to want to value the IRA. And we wanted to see the certainty, even though we were cautiously optimistic, and we saw the progress.  So I think what the IRA does is narrows the bid-ask spread by eﬀectively providing a strong price ﬂoor under the nuclear units at over $40 a megawatt hour. So that allows us to have conversations that we haven't had before.  In terms of getting into speciﬁcs here, you all know that we're focused on acquiring assets, and that's part of the inorganic growth strategy, if the price makes sense to us. And if you see any nuclear plant transacting, I think it's fair to guess that Constellation is going to be involved in that discussion. But I wouldn't describe the pace as increasing or not. I think right now, people are just waiting for this to get done.  And then I think maybe revisiting that question in the third quarter, it'd be interesting to see if there's an uptick in activity. But I think folks have to digest this. They have to understand what it means for their business. And then I think there'll be an opportunity to have a landscape where assets will become available."
"Excellent. And I guess, just sort of on the hydrogen side of the legislation, the opportunity here as we look at the capital allocation, could you actually start spending growth capital in '23, or is it really just something that has some technical looking at to the pilots?",My thought on that would be that anything we spend in '23 would be relatively modest compared to the amount of cash that we'll be generating as a business. And I think capital in that area would probably scale up more meaningfully in '24. Thank you.
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Hi. Thanks, guys. Hopefully I can live up to that intro on the exciting side. Just a real quick question, just sticking on the supply side. A lot of people are focused on the pricing side. But just wondering, I noticed that just yourself and Duke had signed LOIs with Global Laser Enrichment over the last couple of months.  And just wondering if the -- there's been increased focus on energy security and domestic supply production, how do you guys see bringing uranium back in terms of both production as well as enrichment here in the U.S., and how this technology might sort of play into that. I know it's going to be longer dated.","Yes. I think in terms of a U.S. strategy, I think policymakers are right to be focused on incentivizing more production capability in the U.S. I think that's a pretty exciting technology. Bryan Hanson, who runs our ﬂeet, is here. And maybe, Bryan, you could add a little bit of color.     Yes. I just said it's important for the U.S. to reestablish itself as an international leader in enrichment services. As you know, we currently have very modest amounts in the U.S. today.  So I think based on this desire, we're seeing a lot of new innovations come about, both in GLE, as you referenced, and a couple of other companies that are also looking at the United States to expand enrichment services. And we want to be an active part of that."
"And just as a follow-up, I know that these things are going to probably take longer than probably most investors' attention span. But as you think about bringing back sort of domestic, not only supply, but also enrichment to the U.S., how long of a time frame do you think before we're kind of we've wrestled back a large chunk of what sort of currently oﬀshore?","Yes, I think most of the manufacturers think somewhere after 2026, out in the 2028 to 2030 period. And again, through our contracting and contracts that we have, we're -- again, we're hedged for multiple years out in the future and feel comfortable where we are in our fuel position today."
"Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. I was wondering, just if the -- if you get the nuclear PTC, is there a like baseline EBITDA and cash ﬂow level that you would have in mind as to -- if all of your plants would have received the PTC into that low 40s per megawatt hour level, what that would mean for the kind of stable, low-risk and derisked piece of the EBITDA proﬁle?","Hey, David, ﬁrst of all, good morning. Appreciate your question. We're working through that. The legislation still hasn't gone. We want to see the ﬁnal language. Even after the legislation is done, there's going to be some elements of it that will be subject to treasury interpretations, where we're going to need some guidance to settle it out.  It has -- the ﬁrst year it's really eﬀective for us is '24, which is outside of our guidance at this point. But we'll be working through that, quite obviously, and have devoted a good deal and thought to it. But at this point, I don't think we have all the data points yet to say. And secondarily, I just -- I don't want to be in the middle of this legislative discussion talking about proﬁts until we see bills and see how this really translates to our business."
Understood. That's fair. I thought I'd give it a shot. And then you've mentioned some retail margin pressure that you're seeing this year. I was just wondering if you might be able to quantify that further as to how much that's impacting the EBITDA and how it might kind of come back in a positive way on the back end out in 2024?,"Yes, David, I think our target point was just kind of highlight that this is a trend that we haven't seen historically, right. We reiterated our guidance comfortably for the year. So we still feel good that this is going to be a little bit in the friction of the year. So I wouldn't over rotate in it by any means, the origination, as Joe pointed out.  We're having good margins on the business as customers are coming back, and they're looking at getting risk priced into those contracts. So we feel good about it. I guess a little bit of something we're keeping eye on for this year, maybe dragging in next year a little bit, but nothing has changed in our disclosures at this point."
"Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you could talk to how the 2024 hedge level might be shaping up just in terms of how much you might have layered on over the course of the quarter. Would it be similar to what we've added for the 2023 year, or any color there would be helpful.","Yes, David, I'm going to ask Jim to jump in and answer that. But just not to be nitpicky, but in your prior question, you talked a little bit about how we levelize prices and that we might get the value back in outer-years. There's no might about it.  What we're doing is just smoothing the price trajectory for customers and levelizing that really over a period of years. We will get it back in the outer-years but by no means are we signaling that this has lost money and that there's any chance to it. Jim, why don't you cover the last question?     Thanks, Joe. As it pertains to the 2024 hedging question, I'll kind of highlight where we are and what's been going on in the portfolio. I want to basically -- I want to start with just a reminder that, like Dan said in his opening remarks about having the CMC structure, that starts us out at about a 27% hedge level.  And the way the -- in addition to that, the way the New York ZEC rate setting mechanism is happening right now with where prices are. That's also hedging a piece of our portfolio because as prices go up, we're able to -- we're oﬀsetting the increase in generation value with the ZEC mechanism moved into.  So those are two things that start our portfolio already hedging a bit ahead of reasonable amount. But to give you some context of where we are, we had talked at the Analyst Day, we gave a number that we were 52% hedged in calendar year '24. In the last quarter, during Q1, we talked about we added a similar amount of hedges to calendar year '24 that we added to calendar year '23. So that would get you to the mid-60, like the 65% hedge level.  Well, this quarter, we added right -- again, right about a ratable amount or slightly less overall. And we're sitting around the 70% hedge number right now. So there's 30% of our portfolio that's still open, participating in the market conditions.  What we've been doing recently is just adding some of those incremental hedges as we've seen this gross margin moving higher with the forward markets and taking some opportunities to lock some of that in to achieve what Dan talked about during the opening remarks of the call, where we're looking at creating reliability and durability and stability in the gross margin EBITDA projections out there.  So we have a 70% hedge number right now. The activity in hedging is coming from our customer business, primarily it's coming from -- or with the forward markets and taking some opportunities to lock some of that in to achieve what Dan talked about during the opening   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   remarks of the call, where we're looking at creating reliability and durability and stability in the gross margin EBITDA projections out there.  So we have a 70% hedge number right now. The activity in hedging is coming from our customer business, primarily it's coming from customer sales where we make those margins on the energy that we're selling. So it's been a good story for calendar year '24."
"Good morning. Just a quick question to sort of ease oﬀ of the starting to talk about 2024 and hedging. As you read the IRA legislation as it's currently drafted, what is going to drive the PTC most likely. Is it going to be a market clearing the busbar type price of the unit, or is it going to be some number that reﬂects hedges you have on, and then how do you think that would be determined, or just any insight you can give on how you think that's going to work?","Yes, Jonathan, we think it could be either. And that's the way that treasury will ultimately interpret it, either as a hedge or you could do it -- you can take it the spot.  But that's -- when I talked earlier about one of the treasury interpretations that we're going to need in the long-term to really add certainty, that's one of the things that we're going to look at. The reason -- look, the reason we think that the hedge should be one of the means of setting the value of the PTC is this, the way we've always done business.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   And in point of fact, if the IRS was telling us that the only way to guarantee the PTC at its full value is not the hedge and take everything to spot, then we would have to eﬀectively stop participating to a great degree in some of these utility procurements that go out multiple years.  And with 33-plus percent of the energy that's being sold in PJM as an example, coming from nuclear, without the participation of nuclear baseload in these auctions, our customers, at the end of the day, families and businesses won't be able to get the certainty through their hedges.  So there's a number of examples where Treasury has used hedge values for for tax purposes. We think those will apply here. There's a lot of good reasons why it should apply to, again, facilitate these load options that all of the utilities seem to have and warrant. And those points will be made to treasury. And I think treasury will certainly accept it at the end of the day, but it's not a done deal just yet. It's one of these open issues."
Okay. So to the bills sort of not deﬁnitive and something to work out oﬀ to the -- oﬀ to passage eﬀectively.,"I think that's fair. I think the way we read the languages, it's open to either."
"And then maybe if I could just sort of follow up on that, the question David asked about the baseline under the nuclear PTC. Do you think you'll kind of give the market an indication of that as part of this price discovery process? Or sort of let us ﬁgure that out and then decide what to do on capital allocation, depending on book value, which is what I'm hearing?","Yes. I think in terms of the long-term value of our assets and our business, the market is going to be able to ﬁgure that out fairly readily.  I know that the treasury interpretation on the reference point for setting the PTC is an issue, and certainly, in the earlier year of the program, perhaps it's an issue. But in the long-term, you're going to be able to look at the number of megawatts we produce and evaluate it against low 40s megawatt hour price, and you're going to have a pretty good sense of what the value of these companies can be."
"Perfect. Thank you very much.  Operator  Great questions, everybody. That does conclude our Q&A session of the event the program. You may all move over to Joe or Dan. I think Dan maybe.","Well, Liz, I just want to thank you again for starting to call and your colorful remarks throughout, and for all the folks who have listened in and the great questions we've received. So thank you very much, everybody. Have a great day.  Operator  All right, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.
