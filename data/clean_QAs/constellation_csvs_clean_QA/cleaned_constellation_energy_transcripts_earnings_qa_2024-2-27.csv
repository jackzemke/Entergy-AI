Question,Answer
"So I guess ﬁrst for Joe, just as you're thinking about the attribute values the ﬂeet and the diﬀerent options, whether it's the 24/7 or the on-site hydrogen, on-site data center, et cetera, just how are those kind of weighing against each other right now in terms of most likely? And then just also kind of the timing of when you're likely to kind of be in a position to start making more of those decisions. And just to clarify, those are all kind of upside to base and enhance the way to think about it?","I think so, Steve. I think it will represent itself both as an improvement in base and enhance because when you think about how the PTC pricing elbow works, right, wherever -- assuming your overall price is below that elbow, there's extrinsic value above the elbow. It's eﬀectively the possibility that prices will be higher than the elbow come the time of the delivery year.  So whenever you're getting -- whenever you have a contract value that's in that range, if you're adding to it, for example, PJM capacity payments, if those end up being higher, even if the plant right now is residing in the PTC level, the closer it gets to that elbow, the higher the value of the extrinsic ﬂoor, and that gives you enhanced earnings. It also gives you what Dan has talked about the potential for higher margins and better portfolio opportunities as you handle the contracts.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   But eﬀectively, what we're thinking is the contracts will be well above the PTC levels, right, to reﬂect the value of the attributes.  In terms of how we're seeing the opportunities, let me just go from kind of maybe worse the best. I think hydrogen right now, we've stayed in the game on the hydrogen hub in Illinois because DOE has asked us to, and they're covering the cost, pending the outcome of the ﬁnal rules. If we don't get the right ﬁnal rule, we'll head into litigation, but we'll suspend further capital deployment or opportunities in hydrogen until we get an outcome from the courts.  In terms of 24/7, we're continuing to see uptake from our customers on those opportunities. They are some of the same customers that appear to us in the data economy world, right? So Microsoft shows up as the ﬁrst pioneer in 24/7 customer, it's also a potential customer in powering the data economy and growth in that economy. And so I think those two things is kind of similar. There will be customers that obviously are pursuing sustainability solutions that aren't in the data center economy like ComEd and others.  But I think probably materially the biggest piece of this, at least as we see it right now, is going to be in the data economy and selling 24/7 solutions to those companies that are in the data center business or intending to grow in the data center business and trying to do that across multiple jurisdictions so that we could get a template agreement in one place where we agree on pricing and then quickly move to other opportunities with that same customer in other parts. I think when you think about who we are, the spread of our assets, we're probably the only company that could do this at scale that has the megawatts available and do it with geographic diversity that these clients seem to like.  In terms of timing, Steve, we're working all of these issues. There's a huge team at Constellation that is involved in these discussions and sorting them out. They are big deals and they take a long time to materialize. And what I don't want to get into in these calls is predicting when the outcome of those deal discussions will occur. But they want speed to the market and we want speed in terms of getting this started.  So I think the incentives are aligned.     Steve, just to tie that into the earnings expectations, right, as we sign long-term contracts for the attribute sales data center, what have you. Those long-term contributions would ﬂow into the base earnings given the long-term visibility to go with."
"One other question, just on the when you kind of came out with this base growth rate, how are you -- how are you -- what are you assuming for kind of use of free cash in that plant?","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Steve, we used a range of expectations, right? We have the $1 billion buyback on right now. We've got the $3.1 to $3.5 of unallocated. We assume that we'll use some of that for growth opportunities and some of that for buyback. But I would say that, that outcome covers a range of outcomes.  So it's not as if it was an all buyback assumption, which would probably be the highest additive contribution to EPS, right? because you get an immediate contribution, whereas the growth investments probably have a higher return, but take a little more time to get into play. So we -- our growth rate is -- encompasses a wide range of capital deployments to make sure we'll meet our commitments.  Operator  Our next question will be coming from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley."
"Thanks for the comprehensive update here. I was wondering on the free cash ﬂow outlook, really solid outlook here for 2024, 2025. As earnings grows, will free cash ﬂow before growth be growing at a similar level over time? Or just wondering if there are other important puts and takes over the guidance period for cash ﬂow?","I think that's a fair expectation. If you think about setting aside the nuclear PTC and the tax attributes of it, we will work through our tax credits we've accumulated previously. So depending on capital investment and bonus depreciation, things like that, our functional cash tax rate is probably going to be a bit higher in the future than it has been in the past. That could be a little bit of an impediment year-to-year, you can see a diﬀerent timing on nuclear fuel spend or base CapEx spend, particularly if we think about the work we're doing to extend the useful lives of the assets. But I think it's fair to assume that we should have some good follow- through on free cash ﬂow.     David, I just would to supplement Dan's point, I think that the opportunities we're talking about don't come necessarily with more O&M, some of the behind-the-meter opportunities might, but that will be factored in to the contract pricing. But simply selling attributes doesn't add a bit of O&M to our company. So its cash conversion is quite large."
"And then let's see, you give a range, that range of $10 to $20 per megawatt hour for the attribute payments. Is that the right range that you think about for each of those diﬀerent clean attribute potential, whether it's hydrogen, whether it's data centers. And I guess what's your conﬁdence in achieving that uplift in terms of the pricing level for those end customer sources.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)","Yes. David, I think we put those in as kind of just benchmarks for you to kind of quickly do the math. We're not selling an attribute for $10 here. That's just not what we would be interested in over the long term. What we are -- what doesn't make sense to do on this call is kind of reveal our pricing curve for attributes because that's obviously competitively sensitive information.  But we put the $10 in just an illustration. Could have just as easily been $20 rate. So.  Operator  Our next question will be coming from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI."
"Just wanted to follow up, a quick clariﬁcation. Dan, the unallocated capital, the $3 billion, is that factored into the base, the EPS growth rate? Or is that in the other bucket on top?","I think you should think about it as some deployment of capital for buybacks and then whether it was used for paying down debt, although we'll manage our balance sheet diﬀerently or reinvestment in projects, which would have contractual visibility, which is really how we think about our growth investments by and large. I think you should assume a decent amount of that would show up in base, right? Because your denominator is changing on a share buyback calculation.  It would also help enhance a little bit to be totally honest if your share count is falling, but we use a range of diﬀerent allocations to get comfortable with both the growth rate in the range we provide and we didn't want to lock ourselves into one version of future capital deployment."
"That's helpful. And then maybe any color that you can share on your M&A strategy going forward? Obviously there's a healthy bit of free cash ﬂow here for you to execute on, but just then you laid out the return parameters. But what kind of assets, is it predominantly nuclear? Or could you be looking at other renewable assets, if you could just provide more color there.","Yes. Look, I think we talked about the two parts of our business, the commercial business and the nuclear asset basis. I think it's fair to say that M&A activity would be focused on both of those things. And in the case of nuclear, we've kind of long said that young dual unit sites are tight around here. So those that sort of -- anything that's in that ﬁts that description would be something we'd be interested in.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      I'd just add, if you think about -- sorry, if you think about last year, we were successful on SDP would certainly ﬁt that template and other assets where we were not successful because it didn't ﬁt our return proﬁle or our asset mix.     But look, it's all at the right price, right? What you're seeing here in terms of the management presentation is that we like the future of this company. We like the future contracting opportunity. We like the future realization of the reliability beneﬁt that we think we can. So stated quite simply, we think there's a lot of value that is still unrealized here.  So as we look at diﬀerent M&A opportunities, it's going to be judged against buyback in the sense of where is going to be the greatest impact or a return for our investors. And I'm not sure where that's going to be. We have a type of plant that we would be interested in buying. We have commercial businesses that we'd be interested in buying, but those things have to come at the right price. And if we've, I think demonstrated anything very well over the ﬁrst couple of years is we're going to be really disciplined in how we look at that.  Operator  Our next question will be coming from Agnieszka Storozynski of Seaport."
"So just maybe two things. One is, can you tell us how you did against the free cash ﬂow projections from the Analyst Day from '22. Again whenever you think about power, it should be a cash business, right? So I'm just wondering how you track against that guidance range and also what was the main reason why you decided to change from (inaudible) to EBITDA, well from EBITDA to EPS. I understand the nuclear PTCs.  But just like conceptually, what was the reason?","Angie, this is Dan. On the free cash ﬂow performance, we exceeded our commitments in both years. I think I described we can get you the actual numbers, we follow up, but we did exceed the numbers on the plan for both years. As far as going from EBITDA to EPS, I think a major factor was the nuclear PTC because you're calculating against gross receipts, the PTC value can move within the calendar year. It is an after-tax number.  So how you aﬀect your net income would be consistent as those two balance themselves out from an EBITDA perspective, it added a lot of volatility and there's not an ability to gross up the PTC to a pretax EBITDA equivalent value on the consult of (inaudible) counsel and auditors and all those folks.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   I think the other part more signiﬁcantly, right, is that when we look at our story, right, we're a strong investment-grade company with a modestly levered business. We've got a really compelling growth story as we see it with the PTC growth and the opportunity to redeploy capital. The free cash ﬂow is returned it [ph] to our owners will reinvest in the business, drives a unitized growth story, which we all felt it a lot closer to an EPS driven business in a more mature business than probably what we would have experienced with the volatility and variability of results that a lot of the IPPs have had over time where they didn't have the certainty provided by the PTC in our core commercial business.  So we thought it was a really natural time to make the transition and probably suits us to compare to companies who we think we look a lot more like as we go forward as a company."
"And just one other thing. So when I look at your the progression, for example, of O&M expenses and CapEx, right? those numbers seem to be going actually even faster up versus EBITDA projections. So I mean that would imply like -- well, at least the CapEx one would imply lower free cash ﬂow generation of the EBITDA that you're adding? And admittedly, and again there's no question about it.  You guys have been on the forefront of addressing the nuclear fuel cost risk. I obviously appreciate all of the additional purchases, nuclear fuel expense, nuclear fuel CapEx, et cetera. But just again is there a shift in how cash heavy the cash -- the earnings are? or is it just -- again I don't know if you can comment at all.","Yes. I mean Angie, I think on the O&M front, right? I mean you got to remember that we did buy STP last year, right? So there's a fairly meaningful step-up in our projected O&M for '24 from last year's update because STP is the biggest piece of the increase. In '24, we also just like we saw in '23 we do have IR O&M for performance-based compensation for employees given the extraordinary results we've had in commercial.  As you're aware, we (inaudible) a lot of backlog in '22 and '23, that's going to show up in '24, hence the strong enhanced earnings numbers. We pay at delivery, not at inception. So our O&M is going to be up with extraordinarily higher proﬁts for that pace. I think we're really comfortable with the O&M proﬁle relative to earnings expectations. And if you look at how much the numbers have moved for '24 from where we were a year ago, I think that's pretty clearly validated.  On the CapEx front, I think timing will vary from year-to-year depending on what our workload is for maintenance capital at the plants. When we've done things like the up rates, we've moved some capital forward in order to get that on and get those high-return projects in place. So I think if you look at a long-term CapEx program that's incredibly consistent with where we expected things to be maybe a few more dollars here and there for long-term support of the assets going into the SLRs, but we feel good on that front.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   On nuclear fuel, we were, you're correct, well ahead of where the world was heading on the need to procure fuel. We had bought out through '28. That has continued beyond '28 million. We have contracts extending well out into the 30s at this point in time across the fuel chain. So I think that we've managed our fuel exposure very well.  We talked about last year nuclear fuel expense, you're around $6 a megawatt hour. It might be a smidge over that, but not a whole lot more. So I think we've done a good job controlling where our fuel costs are certainly in an inﬂationary environment. And I guess the last point on fuels because people ask about it a lot because you can see the spot price move around. I'll just remind you that we don't buy in the spot market, right?  We buy in the term market for all of our products. We are a long-term buyer with a very sophisticated fuels group. So where we're procuring is certainly diﬀerent than what you're seeing on a very illiquid tape."
And none of your fuel contracts have any indexation to the current price?,"We -- some of them will have colors around them, and I will tell you that all the numbers we're showing you basically have those contracts at (inaudible) value.  Operator  Our next question will be coming from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo."
"Just a question on the retail power margins. You're showing in 2024 about $1.75 above the 13- year average is trending down to $0.50 in 2025. Just curious, is that -- does that reﬂect the market coming in '25? Is that just where the hedges sit? Just any kind of comment on how we should be thinking about '25 and beyond there?","I think when you look at our commercial business, right, we tend to sell forward in contract terms, let's call it, 24 months plus or minus, right? We would have sold a lot more of our '24 volumes in '22 and '23 than we would have sold '25 volumes in '22 and '23. So what we have in our numbers reﬂects really the positive backlog gains, right? We had very good margins on what we've been signing to the point that Martin [ph] sustain at the higher than these long-term average margins you would expect that enhanced value to improve as we sell more contracts, right? So anything that isn't sold at this point in time, we assume reverts back to this long-term average we've seen volatility continue.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   We've seen good margins hold up into this year. So I'd say there's probably, in my mind, a bit of opportunity if we can sustain at these market conditions. And the commercial business has just done a tremendous job taking advantage of the market, but also helping our customers, the volatility is disruptive to them. So our ability to sign and provide them long-term certainty to their energy costs is really valuable for them, and it's been a good relationship for sure.     Neil, I think it could be pointed out that we're probably a little conservative here in returning back to historical margins as opposed to resetting margins. But there's probably a ﬂavor of conservatism throughout the materials as Dan has covered, and that's just we anticipated you would or you or someone else would raise this question, we just used the historicals for a plug for right now until we see how the market continues to evolve."
"That's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure that was the case. And then in terms of the growth there, how should we think about it? I think it's like 200 terawatt hours is sort of your base. I mean how do you think internally about the growth longer term there meaningful? Or should we think about it as kind of being in that range for the foreseeable future?","Well, I think that gets into the question of operates. We've already announced some. We have others that we're looking at. We're looking at some other fairly material opportunities to increase the number of megawatts that we produce and then anything that would happen from an M&A perspective. We're not going to build more nuclear, so that's -- it's really how we optimize the existing ﬂeet, which is already running at a pretty high capacity factor.  We'll look at upgrades M&A opportunities and possibly some unique opportunities that we have to bring megawatts on. So that's -- I think this is a neighborhood we're going to be in for a while.     Neil, on the retail side of the house, I think that we have been opportunistic in our ability to grow. We've been a consolidator in retail for a long period of time. So I think when things that ﬁt our portfolio, could be added to our volumes. I think the team always challenge themselves on the proﬁtability of the customers and the margin gains that we're looking at, right? So we're going to balance all those pieces as we go forward making sure that it's not just volume driven, but it's proﬁt to be organization-driven.  Operator  That ends our Q&A session today.  I would now like to turn the call to Joe.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      Well, again it's been a longer-than-usual call.  We had a lot to go through in terms of the evolving marketplace, Constellation strategy and the change in guidance that we're providing.  Appreciate, again all the positive feedback.  We look forward to continuing to deliver on the promises that we made to you. So looking forward to the ﬁrst quarter call.  And with that I'll end it. And thank you again for your time and attention.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.  You may all disconnect.
