Question,Answer
"Couple of quick questions. So, I think I understood that the delta in the tax rate on the quarter was primarily due to a higher than normal rate in Q1 last year, but I'm just curious if the 26% that we see on the GAAP income statement is what you consider to be normal here or whether there was also a beneﬁt in Q1 kind of versus the run rate.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   No, it is normal. And our eﬀective tax rate is close to that 26%. So, it will time out throughout the year. Last year, just because of reported earnings being higher, we had higher tax expense that quarter which normalized throughout that year."
"Great, okay. And then, I was just curious, Gerry, in your opening remarks, you talked about having prepped for the El Niño winter and come out of it okay. You obviously had a big quarter in the trading business, I wondering if – was that part of the positioning for the winter? Did you set yourselves up there or was it expense management? Just give us a little more ﬂavor of what you were alluding to in terms of the oﬀset.","When I said we came out of the quarter the way we wanted, I was really talking about our growth segments. The trading, I would – it's really a separate discussion. So, no, we weren't talking about positioning our trading company. What we really did is just look at the odds the way the El Niño was setting up last summer that we would have a warm winter, and the odds are very high when you look across past statistical data. So, we all looked at ourselves and said, look, if the odds are this high, we're just going to take it as a given and plan for it. So, we did go into our expenses, we went after additional productivity in the business.  So, we always look for productivity improvements, but we went for more than normal. And that was hard work to put the plan together but it paid oﬀ. And we don't publish our plan or make public our plan, but I do feel really good about the way we exited the quarter in our growth businesses relative to the plan we had for the year, and that's why you're hearing a conﬁdent tone on our ability to play out and meet or exceed our guidance for the year. Trading, just a comment on that, I mean they had a really good ﬁrst quarter. As Peter said, we usually wait until mid-year to kind of give you a better sense. So, we'll probably on our mid-year call update you on those earnings and then give you probably a conservative forecast for where we think trading will land for the year."
Can you give any insight into what was the main driver of that performance in the risk contexts perhaps?,"No. We've been migrating that business more and more physical. So, for example, the gas business is a very active business in moving gas both in the Marcellus and beginning to play in the Utica area to take gas to markets. So, that's been a growing and proﬁtable segment. We also are a supplier to other utilities and some other full requirements services businesses. And that segment did very well for us this quarter. So, it's kind of lining up supply for the utilities who are in end markets that have restructured but still have a responsibility to supply their retail customers. We provide them wholesale to do that."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Great. Thank you very much, guys.","You bet.     Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill from Barclays.     Hey, Gregg."
"Yeah, thank you. Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the legislation and your thoughts around the prospects there and the timeline?","So, I've been saying for a while that Mike Nofs is a good guy to be steering this. Mike was one of two principal architects of the 2008 legislation, so he's the most knowledgeable guy in the Michigan legislature on this whole topic. Mike has been working this in a very systematic way since early this year and he's now moved it to a point where he feels like he's ready to take the bills, there are two bills out into the open and take commentary this week and next. And he'll then evaluate, look to do I feel like things are right for a vote. I think his intention is to come through that discussion period and bring it to a vote here sometime in May, probably the ﬁrst half of May ideally. And then, that legislation will be pushed back over to the House. And then, the question in the House is how quickly can it move there. Will they be in a position to move it before the summer recess? Or like in 2008, will it come back after the summer recess and be acted on then? In 2008, just having been part of that, I spent kind of a year of my life involved in that one. The way it played out is – actually in that case, the House ﬁnished the action just prior to the summer recess and then the Senate came back and acted right after the recess. So, we'll wait and see, but I think the hope would be that we'll get out of the Senate and act on it in the House as well prior to the recess. But if that didn't happen, it could play out like 2008 did."
"So, just coming back to the NEXUS project – don't want to belabor this one too much to go around, but just curious a little bit on the nature of the contracts signed and speciﬁcally if you can elaborate on the future opportunities for further contracts, whether they're generators or utilities. And then ultimately, as you think about moving forward on the project, where do you stand under contracts today from an ROE perspective on the project? Taking it as a given that you're going to move forward, how does it compare versus what you're targeting ultimately in terms of the ROE range you kind of alluded to?","I think I'm going to turn this one over to Jerry Norcia. So, Jerry, why don't you respond to those?     Sure. Great. So, the nature of the contracts we have on NEXUS today, about half the capacity is committed to by LDCs in Michigan as well as Ontario, and then we have three producers that are also anchor tenants. So, I would say, about half is LDCs and half is producers. In terms of incremental markets, I think it will come from both classes of customers. We're pursuing both LDCs in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and the mid-west for incremental volumes as well as other producers that are interested in moving gas for these markets. I think we are well positioned for that, so those discussions are underway. In terms of returns, we're happy to proceed with the returns that we have based on the contractual commitments that we have today. And as we've said before, I think we've got about two-thirds of our total commitments signed with long-term contracts today.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So, just to add on to that, I think we've said in discussions with investors previously, we typically move ahead with these projects at about 80% subscription level. We're a bit below that, obviously because the market took a pause while we were in process, but the combination of the geology here and those interconnect agreements, I mean those 1.75 Bcf of interconnect agreements which really are not a substantial part of our subscriptions right now. I mean that represents more capacity than the pipe itself has, so we think that'll be a signiﬁcant source of future demand, not to mention markets in Illinois, Wisconsin, et cetera. So, the combination of the quality of the geology and so forth is what's giving us the conﬁdence to move forward.  I would say that you really create the hot value out of pipeline projects as you get full subscription and then expand, so I'd say we're kind of down in the willing to proceed, but not in the hot zone, with the level that we're at and so we are looking to add capacity over time. (26:56)..."
Got it. All right. But no speciﬁc ROE expectations given the two-thirds though?,"I would just characterize it as kind of meeting our threshold requirements, but we're looking to move it from meeting our kind of threshold requirements to taking it up to what really makes a pipeline project sing, which is getting into the full and then expansion. So, we're happy to proceed, given where we stand now."
"Got it. And then, if I can ask you to elaborate a little bit on the P&I side of the equation. You commented on softness in the ﬁrst quarter and speciﬁcally comments that REF would help oﬀset it through the balance of the year. Can you elaborate a little bit more and speciﬁcally how the numbers are turning out? And then, with regards to the P&I more broadly, how are you thinking about this business and the optimization of the overall portfolio of businesses you have in the context of the plan?","Yeah. We anticipated the softness in the steel sector. So, we put that into our guidance; as you look at the ﬁrst quarter results that was anticipated when we published the guidance for the year. For the REF segment, that's tied to coal production, there's seasonality in most of the coal   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   production that occurs in the third quarter, so we'll see those REF earnings helping to oﬀset the steel sector. We also had some projects come in late last year on the REF segment, so you'll start seeing those materialize as well coming in at the second half of this year as well. So, there's seasonality with the REF (28:51) and we overall are conﬁdent with the segment guidance that we put out there for P&I."
"Got it, but net-net for this year, it's kind of ﬂattish as one oﬀsets the other?","Yes. I think that's right, we're still feeling ﬂattish. As Peter said, steel was known and we knew that last September when we had analysts into Detroit, but REF is both cyclical and was a bit soft in the ﬁrst quarter just because of a warm winter and substitution of gas for coal and those sorts of things. So, it was down somewhat but as we assess the prospects for the balance of the year, we still feel good about the guidance we have out there for the segment."
"Can we just get a quick update on Bluestone, and then sort of if you could just elaborate on any contingencies you have in place if sort of that production schedule with the producers remains kind of weak?","Go ahead, Jerry.     Yes, I think right now we're feeling very good about the guidance we issued for the Midstream segment. Production that's ﬂowing is in line with what we had estimated, and actually we also feel good about the future there. I think the prospect for Southwestern drilling in that area, as commodity prices continue to strengthen, become more positive as time goes on. So, we feel real good about where we are in 2016.     Southwestern was publicly talking recently, and I would say that what we're seeing in our exposure to Southwestern is very consistent with their comments publicly, and consistent with the plan that we have out. So, when Jerry says we feel good, I think we'd say that it's consistent with what we expected and is playing out in a way that supports the plan. And then, you look down the road, you're beginning to see gas prices for early next year strengthen. I think they were $3-ish when we were talking about them yesterday. And you know that people keep concluding that the drilling's pulled back, but gas declines at 15% in the United States, and you can only allow a 15% decline before – only allow that for so long before you need to begin to backﬁll it. And the most obvious places for Southwestern and other people to begin drilling again is in the northeast Marcellus and in the Utica, and the well quality there is still high. So, our expectation is if we pushed up gas supplies in the country awfully hard in 2015, people are going to pause, but they're going to need to step back into it. And when they do, we expect it to be in the areas we have exposure to."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Got it. That's helpful. And then, can you just maybe elaborate on where you're at as far as any potential midstream acquisitions to ﬁll any gaps, or are we still kind of far oﬀ?","We're – been in the process of looking at many assets, or at least a handful of that we're very interested in. One of the things that we're ﬁnding is that these assets are still trading at premium values. Some recent transactions have illustrated that. We're – we still have a handful that we're looking at and actively pursuing. I think in addition to that, we are also looking at greenﬁeld opportunities where we've had most of our success in the last 12 years or 14 years in this space. So, we've got both in motion to secure incremental growth for the business."
"Okay. Got it. And just last on your capital outlook, I mean obviously you guys have more capital than you can aﬀord, and I think historically sort of the rate impact to the customer has been that c link (34:29). What – is there any sort of guidance you could provide as far as what rate inﬂation you target when it comes to your spending outlook?","If you look at our recent performance there, rates have been negative. So, if you go back to 2012 and compare them today, today we're down. And even after the current rate case plays out, we'll be ﬂat to down to 2012. So, we've been able to work our way through a very heavy capital investment period with rates down. And I'm talking about base rates. The future – we've consistently said that we're trying to keep rate increases in the range of inﬂation, so around 3% as you work your way through one of these intense capital investment cycles. And that's going to require us to both measure the pace of capital investment but also keep the focus on productivity and continuous improvement that we've had in order to do that. So, you know what the blend of capital and O&M is. We've got to keep the O&M. Our O&M in recent years, the increase has been zero. And when you can blend a zero with the increases that come from capital, you can hold it at something reasonable.  Now, we can't commit to zero in the future. But we've worked in the past very, very hard to keep it there. The future is – that's unlikely, you can't continue that forever. But we'll work hard on C&I and we will continue to measure the pace of investment. I think we've said that, for example, in our distribution business, there's a lot of demand for investment. But we're going to have to high-grade those projects to do the most work at once. We're really doing that from a customer aﬀordability perspective."
"So, I think you gave us a good framework for how you're thinking about power and industrials in terms of what you have to achieve to hit your guidance, but frankly I think the stock has underperformed year-to-date, not because people are worried about your utilities businesses, but because they're worried about that business and they're worried about the gas pipeline and storage business and the hurdles to hit the guidance you've laid out. So, focusing back on the pipeline business, NEXUS is two-thirds contracted but these interconnect agreements are pretty substantial. So, should we assume that shorter hauls for those interconnects at a certain percentage of those interconnect commitments could get you well into the range of an acceptable ROE on the pipe? Or do you need to get fully contracted for delivery to dawn at a higher percentage in order to hit your return hurdles or some combination of both?","So, I think both will happen. So, I think what interconnect – these interconnect agreements that we have really provide the pipeline with a lot of diversity and supply opportunities. So, our shippers, long-term shippers on the pipe as well as new shippers that we expect to come out of the pipe will use these interconnects as ways to deliver the various markets up and down the pipe, especially in Ohio. Do I expect that those will turn into real opportunities and real commitments? Absolutely. I think that's a given that that will happen.  I think in terms of more long haul, we are in discussions with several parties to sign them for more long hauls. So, I think what you'll see here, as the pipeline built, you'll start to see those interconnects become very active market points for us and provide the what I would call a lot of optionality to future shippers on a pipe. And I think that'll make it a very attractive pipeline that allows to get both short-haul and long-haul commitments. So, I expect both to happen."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay, in terms of permitting, we just saw obviously a big negative surprise out of New York last week on a diﬀerent pipeline project. What are the remaining permits you need beyond just the FERC approval to get this pipe into the ground?","I think the big one we're waiting for right now is a FERC Notice of Schedule which we expect to happen here in the second quarter. And I think we're in really good shape with that. We're getting very good feedback from the FERC in terms of the quality of our ﬁlings. I think a lot of our issues we're managing quite well, routing issues. We're well underway with our right-of-way acquisition process. And I think in terms of other permits, there are some large customary permits that come with a FERC-regulated pipeline, like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other various permits, but those are the big ones. I think the FERC order which we expect by the end of this year, and also the other large customary permits, I think they're proceeding very well at this point in time."
"Okay. And then, when I look at – go back and look at your year-end then with (39:56), you say your aspiration is to grow operating earnings from $110 million at the midpoint, $16 million from this segment, to $170 million in 2020. If Bluestone were to sort of ﬂatline from here in terms of its earnings contribution, and you didn't achieve any bolt-on acquisitions, what would that number be? Would it be signiﬁcantly lower? Would it be only modestly lower? Because really, the crux of the issue on people's problem with valuing the stock is concerns over the growth in this business.","Yeah, so I'd say the prospects of Bluestone ﬂat lining are – I wouldn't frame it that way. We're expanding Bluestone, and we're expanding Millennium. And I think the prospects we see are for more of that. So, there's – you were mentioning cancellation of a pipeline. What we're seeing in the northeast is a continued pull for gas. They have to have gas for power generation, and the oil to gas conversions continue. So, the demand for gas continues to be very, very strong, but there's real resistance in New York and other areas of the northeast to new pipeline.  I think that's what that's likely to do. In fact, New York called us out explicitly is bias toward expansions of existing pipes. So, I think the likelihood of some of this resistance you're seeing is that owners of existing position, including Millennium and Bluestone, will see people coming to them as the most credible and doable paths and expansion path to market. So, I just start by saying – I think what we're seeing evolving in the market is a positive for the asset position we have there. Bluestone and Millennium are attached to really good geology, and there's resistance in the market with creating new outlet, altogether new outlets for that geology, which means the existing ones are going to have to expand.  And then, the long-term growth, NEXUS is an important part of that growth, but when we look out ﬁve years and ask, what is the current dynamic in 2016 really mean for 2020, not much. The gas demand in 2020 is going to be what it's going to be, and power generation conversions are going to be underway. And so, the geology is going to have to deliver, the pipes are going to have to deliver.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Now, I think that you could say in the short term that production get out in front of itself a bit with a lot of excitement in the market, the answer to that is obviously yes. So, there's been adjustment in the near term, and it's changed the path to get to 2020, but the ultimate point that the market needs to achieve in 2020 hasn't changed for either production or delivery through pipes to meet demand. So, we really don't see a lot of impact long term, although the path to get there has changed from what it might have been."
"So, with Senator Nofs prepared to move the bill this week, what can we read into that as far as any progress that may have been made with just schools and with the Chamber of Commerce?","So, Senator Nofs has been in active discussion with the Chamber, and I think I will – I'm not going to put words in the Senator's mouth. The coalition he's put together, I think, would be better for him to play that out, but he has been in active discussion with the Chamber. I think he's also put some provisions in the bill that broaden its interest to his Democratic colleagues. So, if you look at the energy eﬃciency provisions, that's positive in terms of broadening the   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   appeal. He also does have the 30% goal; it's not a mandate, but it's a goal, by 2025 for renewables and energy eﬃciency. That's something the administration has advocated for as have Democrats in the House. So, I do think what you see is Senator Nofs listening very, very carefully to a whole range of participants trying to broaden the coalition to a point that he can be successful."
"It's just my understanding that the bill, when we see it, will have a provision where shoppers who leave actually have the opportunity to come back. How are you thinking about that?","Right. They do today and they will in the future. We never thought there would be or should be a prohibition of retail open access customers coming back but the – I think what you'll see when you look at the legislation is that there's a lot more integrity now in terms of the reliability provisions related to this. So, suppliers to the retail open access market need to carry their fair share of local resources, and that needs to be real, need to have ties to real local resources for reliability. Customers who leave the queue, if somebody should come out from under the cap and somebody goes in, we'll be paying a demand charge. So, there's a series of provisions without me going into all the details, that really do shore up the reliability provisions related to that 10% of the market."
"Quick question, ﬁrst, on the distribution reliability. You're showing the $6.5 billion, 10-year plan here. You've previously talked about potential for that to be over $10 billion, even. Remind us, is   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   that – is there potential to add some of the extra stuﬀ there? Does that depend on your ability to cut costs or the state energy law or what might be some of the swing factors of getting that into the plan and when in might those decisions be made?","So, I think what we've said on that one is that there's a lot of demand on our distribution system; it's an aging infrastructure system. As we evaluate the need, the need currently outstrips what we think customer aﬀordability will enable. So, in order for us to do more of that and kind of work our way into that backlog, it would depend on us ﬁnding productivity opportunities. Or if there were things, for example, that evolved on the generation side that required less capital, we could conceivably push some of this needed investment in.  But we are kind of calibrating how much of that we do based upon aﬀordability because we've consistently said that companies that don't pay careful attention to that when they're going through a big investment cycle end up losing. You just need to go through these cycles in a way where your customers feel their aﬀordability is workable. So, that's really what determines how much of the $10.5 billion we would spend versus the $6.5 billion. And you're right: if we can ﬁnd either capital oﬀsets or productivity oﬀsets, those are the things that would enable us to do more of that needed investment."
"Okay. Great. Next question is related to Millennium in New York. Someone already made reference to the – a diﬀerent pipeline basically getting shut down because of it, because of regulators not supporting pipeline expansion there. Do you see any risk to the plans for Millennium speciﬁcally?","The way I'll answer that is that with our pipeline investments that we've been able to secure through the FERC, as well as with New York regulators, for example, we've been able to secure an expansion of Bluestone most recently through the New York regulators, and that's actually a pipeline regulated by New York, in New York. And then secondly, we secured the last two compressor expansions for Millennium through FERC, as well as working with New York regulators.  So, I think what we're – as Gerry described earlier, I think the regulators are pointing towards existing assets as ways to expand into a growing market. So, as you know, we've got a Millennium pipeline expansion where we've made a FERC pre-ﬁling, and that's going well. We are in active conversations with regulators in Albany on that expansion, and we feel that those conversations are going well. So, we – at this point, we feel pretty conﬁdent that we'll secure our expansion approvals for Millennium.     So, Bluestone runs both in Pennsylvania and New York, so you need approvals out of both states. But our recent expansion of Bluestone – our conversations were very productive. And as   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Jerry mentioned, same is true for Millennium. So, our experience has been that when the need is clear and you're dealing with an existing asset with I guess you'd say more modest implications, you can have a productive conversation and work your way through it. And that's what our last two rounds of discussion in Albany have produced."
"Very good. Last question. You added a comment there about continuing to evaluate current- year equity needs. You previously talked about targeting $100 million of equity in 2016. Which direction are you thinking? Are you trying to ﬁnd ways to maybe reduce that number, or is that more an implication that if you were to make an acquisition, for example, in the midstream business maybe you would issue some equity?","Yeah. We always go into the year – we have a big focus on cash in the company. And so, we did indicate that over the three-year period, it's $200 million to $300 million. And then, we potentially can do up to $100 million this year. So, we're assessing that. Our goal would be, if we can, to make that zero. Might be too early to say that. We're going to see how the year plays out, and the cash ﬂows and the company plays out. I'll still say that $200 million to $300 million over the three-year period is still a good number, and we're assessing how much do we actually need to do of that $200 million to $300 million this year."
And will the equity needs have an impact on the dividend decision which you typically announce in June and have a relatively low payout ratio?,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   No. We typically will grow the dividend in line with the earnings versus the amount – so the amount of equity we're issuing is not going to have an impact on our dividend decision.
