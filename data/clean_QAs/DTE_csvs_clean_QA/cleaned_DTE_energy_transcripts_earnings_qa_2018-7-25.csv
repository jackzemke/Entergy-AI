Question,Answer
"All right. Good to hear. I just wanted to touch a little bit on your midstream growth strategy. Can you just provide a little bit more color on your valuation process for acquisitions like how much is it from gathering and processing versus transportation assets? And can you just maybe touch on the long-term strategy, how much is fueled by acquisitions versus organic growth opportunities?","The assets that we're looking right now are gathering and transportation. So there is some high pressure transmission as well as gathering assets that we're looking at. In terms of mix into the ﬁve-year future, there is a balance that we try to maintain between, what I would call purely demand-charged style projects and what I would call demand-and-variable charged project. So that mix there, we try to maintain. We try to maintain a good balance. So there is a balance of both gathering investments through acquisition as well as organic development.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   The other thing I would say is that we have had a pattern of building a platform and then expanding organically from the platform. In many cases, our best growth comes from those organic expansions. So you look at Millennium, Millennium led to Bluestone, which was an organic expansion, Bluestone led to some gathering which has turned out to be a nice business line for us and that whole area continues to produce growth opportunities.  So for example, we recently reached an agreement with Cabot there, which we think will be a good relationship, a positive relationship for us in that area. And we see a Link playing out analogously where we made an acquisition, but we expect that acquisition to lead to a host of agreements like the one we just mentioned, where we -- we've got board approval and are ready to anchor 250 million-ish investment with one of our counter parties there. So that's the thought process that has worked out well for us, and these acquisitions we're looking out are meant to repeat the same pattern."
"Got you, guys. That's very helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.","Thank you. Appreciate it.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.     Good morning, Julien."
"Hi. So I wanted to follow-up a little bit here on the comments on the long-term guidance. And perhaps just to kick it oﬀ, can you comment a little bit on how you think about the Link sized acquisition in the context of the 5 to 7 and how that might position you within that guidance range?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   And then separately, let me also just throw these other questions in there while you talk about the 5 to 7. How do you think about the P&I segment, speciﬁcally you talked about being materially above that, certainly in an '18 context, you're certainly tracking very well. How much of that is REF related versus some of these other elements like RNG? And when you materially, can you maybe expand a little bit more on that?","Sure. So maybe I'll start with P&I. Here we're having a very strong year in 2018. As Peter told you, we had a -- we had focused on optimizing these projects and positioning them to get as much as we could out of them, which is going better than we thought, but we're also moving toward the phase where we're going to be doing tax equity transactions and the goal there is to accelerate cash ﬂows, and then redeploy those cash ﬂows into other growth projects, debt reduction and equity reductions. So we are -- I think what we're going to see out of P&I projects is higher earnings in the short term, and then the long-term beneﬁt will come from the higher cash ﬂows the projects will generate versus what was in our plan even a handful of months ago.  Concerning the Link style acquisitions. We are looking at those. We're disciplined about how we go about those. So -- and we will do it if it's right for us to do, but if it is, I think it would be one of the things that really helps us shore up our 5% to 7% growth targets. So we aren't saying if we do one of those, we are going to raise the 5% to 7%. It's really meant to achieve that. I'd say in general, those platform investments as I've described them, have surprised us to the upside. So the whole Bluestone platform certainly did. So far the Link platform is.  So we're seeing at things come at us faster on Link than we had anticipated and we're ahead of the pro forma that we shared with you when we invest in the project back in 2016. And so our take for Link is, everything we've seen there is positive. And so if we think we can do another of those and we like the investment and our history would suggest that there are fruitful places to ﬁrm up and ﬁll out the growth plan that we shared with you.     Other area that we're seeing strength than P&I is our Steel business. With surge in steel production, we're seeing the value for coke that we produce go up this year and we expect that will provide some value next year as well.     And then long-term with P&I, I think Jerry mentioned this. When we continue to add cogeneration projects and I think in part that's a reﬂection of the positive natural gas environment in the United States and the conﬁdence with industrial producers have in their fuel. On top of that, there is a real push nationally to bring some renewable into natural gas. That's true both at the federal level through the EPA and in various states.  For example, California has a renewable natural gas push in the transportation sector. And currently, there is the sector short supply. So it's providing favorable dynamics and so on this renewable natural gas base which is an area we haven't been doing it as renewable, but we've been doing waste methane capture for decades. It's an area we have the skills for, but it's one   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   of these niches that I think we've stepped into that has some very favorable growth wind behind it. So we think that's going to be a attractive area for us to grow and is one of the things that's convinced us with the 70 million number that we've been communicating for the last couple of years, feels conservative now and now we think we're going to materially beat that."
"Got it. Excellent. Can you comment a little bit on the utilities then, I mean, you obviously alluded to some incremental capital spend speciﬁcally with the renewables program, et cetera. You delineated a capital plan through '22 for electric and gas of 10.4 [ph] to 2.1 [ph] respectively previously. Can you elaborate just where you stand relative to those perhaps as well just to kind of give me some --","We will give you a full capital kind of re-stack later this year, but I can't say that the voluntary renewables is added about 450 million of renewable investment to the plan that we communicated previously, and we also have the item Gerry mentioned which is the acceleration of the gas main replacement as additional to the gas plant and that is a program that as we further look at both operating impacts, environmental impacts of an old system, we just think we've got to move and get that system ﬁxed and modernized. So that's an acceleration as well ."
"Got it. Excellent. And then lastly on the GSP segment. Just to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying. Obviously the Link would be incremental. How far above plan are you when you talk about your original Link investment that you talked about and/or anything else. I mean, is there anything new that we should be considering in the context of the 2022 CapEx plan and earnings growth target range?","Well, I guess I would say that we're multiple years ahead of plan. So in 2018, we kind of sit where we thought we might be in terms of volumes and so forth out a couple of years from now on. And I'd say we've more than locked in there -- kind of locked in our base case and are now working on upside to that. So we got to continue to produce good results there, but it's a lot better than being behind, I'll say that, to be well ahead of plan and the dynamics there continue to be positive. I mean, we bet on the asset, because the reserves are such high-quality and that's what's playing out. The nation continues to deplete and needs to drill to replace production and this is a very good place to do that. So one of the producers there substantially increased plans versus what we thought they would do in the -- in our pro forma and it's accruing to our beneﬁt."
"Not to beat a dead horse, but you know, I know that you're -- you guys are very comfortable with the long-term plan, but when we think about the base of earnings that you're using for your 2008 -- for your 5% to 7% earnings growth target for 2022, I mean, I just want to -- given that the steel business can be cyclical and that the REF business obviously has a tail.  How should we think about the -- despite the fact you're crushing into those businesses today, like what base you're using to -- to set that 5% to 7% earnings growth target, because I just fear that investors will get ahead of you or get behind you in terms of the long-term view on where you are going to be given the cyclicality in the steel business, the falling away of the REF stuﬀ and you know there is some natural cyclicality to potentially in midstream. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you think about the end point versus the beginning point and so we can rightsize our expectations?","So we're still guiding up of where we always have after the initial guidance we gave you for 2018 and we're clearly seeing a very strong earnings performance this year. So if you look at GSP, for example, I mean, our guidance year-over-year is up over 40%, that business is not going to be up 40% every year. So we're not guiding to that. But it's great to see your plans, your long-term plans evolve at the front end of your investment period because it brings certainty and allows you to move on and focus on adding to that rather than trying to peruse what you hoped you could. So yeah, we are still guiding to 5% to 7% of our initial guidance from this year in 2022 and we know that, for example, in GSP, there may be times when we bring a lot to the table in a particular year, you know some year down the road may be slower, but that's ﬁne as long as the overall growth rate is good.  In P&I, yeah, we've talked about REF and sunset there and harvesting cash ﬂows from that business we've been talking about that for ﬁve years or more. So that's not news, but the -- you mentioned steel. That is a business I think the breezes are generally good. So people talk a lot about tariﬀs where the prices for domestic steel are up some 20% and we are seeing increased   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   production. It probably gives us an opportunity here as we see that strength to bring some contract term to some of our position. So we'll be looking to do that.  And then some of the other businesses, cogen and REF, those are all businesses where we see longer-term trends.     Yeah, I was going to add that the steel business is going to give us some favorability, of course, and already is, but the fundamental growth in P&I is driven by asset investment for long-term contracts and that's going to revolve around cogen deals that we're pursuing and we are very close to closing on one this year -- another one this year. And the RNG deals, I mean, these are all asset investments with long live deals. So that's really the -- if we were to model where is the growth kind of come from, the P&I will come primarily from those two types of investments."
"Yeah, that's what I thought. I just wanted to get a sense. You're actually replacing overtime ssome of these more cyclical revenue streams with longer life to assets with more predictable revenue streams. Is that your summary?","We said last year maybe, even earlier that, what we needed to get our longer-term growth plan at a P&I was 70 million of recurring earnings, and then we needed 45 million of incremental earnings to achieve that. Last year we got 15 of those incremental earnings. This year, we're projecting to get the next 15. So we're two years into the ﬁve-year plan and we're two-thirds done and the fundamentals are more favorable than we saw a year or two ago. So when we put all that together, we think P&I is going to be a incremental payroll up to bringing our 5% to 7% growth -- bringing certainty to all of that. It feels better than it did a year ago."
"Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it. Have a good day.",You as well.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
"Good morning. Just go back on the pipeline segment. So good performance this quarter and this ﬁrst half, but what should we think about -- it seems to be implying the lower -- the lower second half versus ﬁrst half?","We've raised guidance in this sector as Peter and Jerry have mentioned for the balance of the year. So we're not predicting a lower second half.     The second half is going to be strong just like the ﬁrst half is, which is why the guidance is up so strongly, and I mentioned the 40% growth rate year-over-year. Some of that's taxes, but some of it's just fundamental volumes on various platforms. So we expect a strong second half for the year as well."
So far has any one-time non-repeating items in this ﬁrst half?,"No.     No, not in the gas storage and pipeline segment. There is no one-time."
"I was just -- at the unregulated businesses, I mean, is there kind of how much more strength are you baking into the second half of the year and is there upside to that?","Paul, this is Peter. In terms of the guidance for non-utility, we're feeling really good where we're at right now with our non-utility segment. As Gerry mentioned, we do have contingency ﬁlled in our utility segments, depending how weather plays out, we may have upside overall the guidance, whether it'll be coming from out utilities segments.     You know we mentioned the mix of weather in the second quarter, cold April -- hot May and so forth. But June was warm and so was July. July is playing out warm too. So from a weather standpoint, it's been favorable and that gives us some strength through weather in the utilities which covers some of the -- provide some of the contingency we're talking about. And then, could we conceivably see a little more out of the non-utilities, we will just have to see how the year plays out possibly, but we're giving you the best guidance we can."
"Gerry, you mentioned as you look out at some forecast for the out years that some people are light. And one of those issues is the utility forecast. Is there any aspect of that that you think might be missing? What are they missing?","Yeah, in regards to the utility forecast, we -- despite a point of clariﬁcation post tax reform between people, maybe a little bit light; earnings will be growing 1% faster than the rate base for both utilities. So that electric [ph] utility rate-based growth is 6% to 7% and earnings growth would be 7% to 8%. And for gas utility, the rate base growth is 7% to 8%, so our earnings growth of about 8% to 9%, and that is because as we're giving back cash -- deferred cash to our customers, we're replacing that with equity over this timeframe.  So we believe that some people are missing, the nuanced post tax reform as an increase of equity that's coming in to both utilities which just provides earnings growth over and above rate base."
Where do you see the 2022 equity layers at the electric and gas utilities?,"They are currently around 38% when we look at overall capital structure. So it will start bleeding in. We don't have -- I don't really disclose the precise number (inaudible) but I think it's really about $70 million a year that providing the fact the customers across both utilities, about 35 of that will be going into both utilities. But there is a technique that probably gets into the more low 40s by the end of the year of the ﬁve-year period."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   A quick question on -- so you talked about the IRM that you will ﬁle it -- you ﬁled in the electric rate case and that it will help you defer having to ﬁle annual cases. Can you go, I mean, how long do you think you would potentially be able to stay out with that mechanism?","Well we're targeting -- I think you will see in our ﬁlings, we're targeting multiple years as an approach, but that's something to be worked out with the commission staﬀ and the commissioners over time here as to how long we could stay out, but we're looking for at least three years and if things play out well beyond that, but that's what's in our current ﬁlings.     So we've got in the IRM -- look if I step back in there and what we've been talking to the commission and commission staﬀ about is, elements of our capital -- are driving rate increases, but are totally predictable and agreed upon. So this gas plant, for example, we know the schedule, we know the cash -- what the cash ﬂow is going to look like. So covering that in an IRM is something that could make sense. We've also been talking a lot about our long-term distribution investment plan and trying to reach agreement with the commission and staﬀ and what that should look like for customers. Once agreed upon, that's not something that needs to be a ongoing basis of re-discussion in rate cases, it just needs to be executed and reconciled.  And so we're trying to bring those sorts of items into the plan to focus rate cases and things that really are extraordinary. You know how our sales changing, our cost changing and so forth. That needs to be done less frequently than every year. And so I think the commission recognizes that and we do too. We've been clear with the commission that we think this IRM can reduce rate case frequency and that is our goal. We've also been clear that we can't promise, you know some stay out period because you never know what happens in the world. So I think the understanding on our side and there is that the goal is to reduce frequency without a speciﬁc locked in target as to what that means."
"Okay, great. And if I heard you correctly, you feel you've been able to have suﬃcient dialog with the commission and the staﬀ that what you've ﬁled is -- it is likely to be aligned with something they would ﬁnd acceptable?","We had many rounds of dialog with them. So I can never kind of pre-judge where the commissioners will land, that's their call, but we did try to take a process where we had many rounds of detailed discussion about what would make sense to them and what made sense to us and where our needs lie and so forth."
"Right. Okay. And then just quickly on NEXUS. You're now saying you expect it to ﬁll in terms of contracts after it into services. Are you still seeing the same as you were saying last quarter   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   there eﬀectively or is -- yeah, I think you were saying around the time it enters service. I'm just curious if that is a shift or not a shift?","Jonathan, I would say that last quarter we were saying that we are moving onto capacity that we feel is really valuable in this basin as capacity becomes short in this basin and are growing -- very quickly growing basin. So we've got -- we continue to have discussions with producers detailed discussions of our capacity commitments and we're trying to maximize volume in term and we think this will play out once the pipe goes under construction and/or is in construction and goes into service. So we've seen intensity of the discussions heat up as we predicted as we went into the construction and we look forward to concluding deals here as we go into service that gives us the price and that we're looking for?"
Would you expect that to happen here in this calendar year?,"So, Jonathan let me -- let me just add, and then I'll answer that one is that I think we've been saying it for probably a couple of years. The way these things play out is the serious discussions happen once your pipe is in construction. And people believe it, they know it's going to be there. And it absolutely has played out. Our team is in deep discussions with multiple producers at a scale that is very signiﬁcant. So that's promising.  For a variety of reasons, these deals are going to close after the pipe is in operation and that's probably all I can say on that. But I think we will -- we will see deals close not over multiple years, but I think it's going to take months for what Gerry talk play out. So will conceivably see late 2018 into 2019 after these discussions to play out and the reason is that people see the basin going short takeaway capacity in a couple of years, the writings on the wall for that.  And so as producers try to set up capital plans in '19, '20 and beyond, they can't -- it's not capital plans until they've got take away. And so that's what people are talking to us about and as Gerry said, we're going to make sure that we use what we think is a really valuable resource and our basin that's going to go short in the best way for DTE and its partner."
"Great. Okay. Thank you. And then just -- your comments on equity, have those sort of -- does those encompass doing a Link sized acquisition or would that presumably change your comments on equity?","That would change the comments that we did an acquisition some of the Link, we'd be issuing shares just for that project in itself, that project to support the additional equity that we would be issuing.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. And then just one other thing on the RNG projects, you talked quite a lot about that business here. If I'm not wrong, those -- that business kind of keys oﬀ of the RIN values in the RFS program. And I'm just curious how you have long-term visibility on the value on those contracts. Given that the program, some sets in 2022, and yeah just adding further insight, you can just sort of give us on how -- how much term visibility you have on what the earnings are likely to be on these deals in the longer term? And maybe I'm incorrect about some of that?","Some of the ﬁrst deals that we did have long-term OpEx. So that was very valuable to us and there is an ability in the market to hedge some of these products that we're producing. So that is one of the ways that we're going to manage cash ﬂows going forward. But based on what we see and sort of the requirement that has been established by Congress or the provision to provide these deals, we see the market remaining short on supply and long on demand, which we think will continue to put a lot of pressure on -- upward pressure on pricing. So again, multiple strategies. One is long term upticks with counterparties, bilateral arrangements, as well as hedging programs that help secure cash ﬂows in the future.     Another thing I would think is that the RIN program is one source. And by the way, that's not short. It's way short supply demand and it has been consistently supported through congresses of every stripe and EPA's by the way of every stripe as well. So it seems to be a durable program that as a provision that -- it just got a supply-demand gap, that's not going to be closed any time soon. But actually some of the deals are not driven by that market, that could be a support market that are actually driven by state markets.  So, example, California has a market that's wants to pull renewable gas in the transportation sector and some of our deals are directed at that market and its dynamics. And again, there are producers, they are who need to fulﬁl those obligations and where we are supplying gas to those counterparties.     One of the added features that makes this market attractive for us as that as we look at IRRs and cash ﬂows, the simple payback is very fast. So the exposure to market ﬂuctuations is less of a concern from an IRR perspective."
"Sort of ﬁlling in the REF falloﬀ perspective, then what is your visibility on the sort of post 22 pricing on those deals?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I think ﬁrst of all -- I think are actually really good dynamics in terms of ﬁlling in those earnings, because they are strong earnings and good return. And I think that as Gerry has been implying, we've got visibility through that period. Could Congress change out in late 2020, I suppose it's possible, but there's -- we've seen no sign of that. It is just been very durable support in Congress for these sorts of provisions. But beyond that, I guess I would point you away from Congress to more some of the local markets that we're supplying which have been -- if anything had at the stronger and deeper into these sorts of provisions."
Okay. So how long are the deals you've signed so far and how can you disclosed that?,"Actually, we don't disclose deal speciﬁc terms, because we are negotiating other deals. So --"
"Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in, Just a couple of quick ones on the utilities. First question is, as far as generation with the increased renewable spend the new gas plant, is there any change you're thinking from a supply demand perspective as far as generation needs over the next say 5 to 10 years or would the incremental renewables come as a replacement for something else you had been thinking about whether existing or new?","I do know if you noticed the discussion in the state on long-term renewables that happen. So we had a ballot initiative emerge in the state. There was going to push Michigan do a 30% renewable standard. I actually wasn't crazy about it, because it was from someone outside the   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   state. The state was very well aligned behind what was happening here. We actually had republicans and democrats and environmentalists and utilities on a common dim [ph] sheet, but what happened interestingly out of that whole discussion about a ballot initiative was an agreement that came out that targeted a 50% clean energy standard which is -- when you dig behind what that means, it implied for us 25% renewables by 2030.  And when you look beyond this current renewable plan that we said has some upside for customers that are requesting voluntary increases, we think it implies in the 2022 to 2030 period incremental investment in renewable to what we would add to some measure. So -- and I think that one thing I would say is that as we continue to see renewable cost go down, I think those go hand in hand. So I would expect that renewable investments in the 2022 to 2030 period will probably surprise to the upside given trends and technologies and on the agreement that was just reached."
"Okay, thanks. Then on the IRP scheduling, you guys are going to be going next year whereas your neighbors are going this year. What in particular will you be watching for to see how that process unfolds? And what you might be able to learn from them being the guinea pig so to speak?","Well, I think we will certainly watch it very closely I mean their proceeding. And we are looking to ﬁle in March and we ﬁled a version of IRP under the old legislation as part of our CON ﬁling. You know, it's a need ﬁling for the new power plant that we are going to build. So we'll be updating it. I don't think they are -- we don't expect fundamental shifts in our plan. So I think you can rely on the current IRP that we ﬁled as a projection into the future. We may update the renewable investments as we -- as Jerry mentioned as we start to think about the -- how the next decade may evolve, but that will only likely mean a higher renewable content or business.     Yeah, one of the things that I think people need to realize about us versus our neighbors is their starting points are diﬀerent. So they have a much higher gas mix currently than we do. I think their mix is in the order of 30%, ours is much lower. So, our gas plant needs sense from that perspective.  And then I think one of the things we will be watching is technologies above is the need for another gas plant in the late 2020s versus the ability to handle that via renewables, and time will tell on that, we will just have to see how both our load and technologies evolve, but that will be one of the things I'm sure that we evaluate in the IRP next year scenarios that evaluate both potential outcomes."
