Question,Answer
Good Morning. So maybe just ﬁrst starting with the equity that you pointed out on slide 11. The $1.5 billion to $2 billion '20 to '22. I'm assuming in '22 you're including the approximately what $8.25 of mandatory converts?,They do include the mandatory converts. It will be approximately $1 billion related to the acquisition. But the $1.5 billion to $2 billion does include those converts.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And the 2020 guidance that you provide, all that includes an additional $300 million of equity in 2020. So just wanted to understand the share count that you're using for that 2020 guide?",Yes. We have $300 million that we will be issuing next year in 2020 and here in 2019 we'll be issuing the $500 million that we previously disclosed.
"Got you. And just, ﬁnally, I just wanted to stay on the credit theme, I guess. You mentioned that couple of the agencies clearly expressed some concern. Do you see any scenario where there is additional need to issue equity in a particular business? I guess, how the business, kind of, moves forward from here? Do you expect any need to issue additional equity to, kind of, satisfy the rating agency concerns?","No. I do not. The S&P rating, in particular, our strong BBB and excellent business risk proﬁle. We were really targeting that. So we are very happy with that outcome. It gives us -- actually we have a lot of cushion even within that current rating and proﬁle. Moody's did fall in line with S&P, a part of the issue with Moody's, they do not recognize the converts as equity. So that was one of the reasons behind the action they took, but with their new rating we have a lot of cushion as well. So we're feeling really good where we're at with the rating agencies at this point."
"Hey. Good morning. Perhaps, if I can come back to just the transaction last week. Help clarify just a quick follow-up here. I mean, as you think about that $0.45 in the organic growth of that business, just again to come back to oﬀ of the run rate '21, '22, 10 times multiple. How do you think about that? That's a -- how do you think about the growth to the ﬁve-year outlook ﬁrst oﬀ just to reconcile that and I've got a follow?","Well, I think, Julien, the ﬁrst thing is that, the transaction supports the 7.5% growth '19 over '20. And then as we have mentioned, we re-established 2020 is the base for the 5% to 7% growth going forward long-term. So we view the transaction not only as providing a lift '19 over '20, but certainly provided an outlook -- an uplift long-term as well in the plan. And ﬁlled all the growth needs that we have at GSP.     I think just to add on, as well as this segment particularly, we are feeling really good with the growth rate going forward. We will be talking in more detail at EEI about this. I can tell you though that we have a previous disclosure out there of 2023, now we're going to be more than achieving that."
"Got it. Okay. But just from a planning perspective, as you think about the other investments that have been talked about before the NEXUS laterals, Link expansion capital, perhaps, generator and connections. What are you thinking about it? And I know we're getting ahead of the GSP disclosures, perhaps, coming up here in a couple weeks. But I just want to clarify what else are you thinking about out there on GSP?","Well, Julian, again, I'll repeat that it's certainly supports the 7.5% growth '19 over '20, and if you lock in that growth and then grow 5% to 7% from there, this transaction, as well as the other investments in GSP, and let's not forget that the bulk of our investment is going into our two utilities. Those high growth rates from our utilities, high growth rate from GSP, as well as the strong growth of the P&I base will support 5% to 7% growth over the new 2020 base.     Yes. And --   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      We'll provide a lot more detail by business segment at EEI.     Yeah. We will and in this segment in particular, we have some great growth platforms now. So we're not looking for any big new acquisitions. So we have a lot of opportunities, as you mentioned a few just in your question there. So between Link and NEXUS, and now this new Blue Union and Leap Asset, we're going to have a lot of organic growth opportunities, but we'll give more updates here at EEI."
"Got it. If I can clarify quickly the early '20 outlook, I mean, it looks like it implies even ex-related transaction a pretty healthy degree of growth oﬀ the 2019 base for GSP. Can you talk about what's driving that? I mean, as you say, it seems like a 12% type growth number?","Well, two things, the transaction, as we mentioned is providing signiﬁcant accretion next year. So it is ﬁlling a portion of the growth objective of GSP. But I can tell you we're also planning very carefully for the balance of the platform at GSP in light of market conditions."
"Yeah. So, ﬁrst, I just wanted to follow-up on that last question. So is there any more detail that you can give us as to how the base midstream business is growing, sort of, ex the transaction you just did. And then, I think, also the upping the stake in Link and the Generation Pipe just, kind of, what the base business is doing? And how that stacks up to what you were previously anticipating?","Well, what we can say is that if you look at all those investments and that drives a 30%, 34% growth year-over-year in the GSP segment. And overall allowed us to lift our corporate growth to 7.5% year-over-year, and sets us up really nicely long-term that meet our 5% to 7% growth corporately, along with our growth at our utility. So we typically don't describe each platform, but what I can tell you, I'll repeat is that the balance of our platforms we are planning for it very carefully next year in light of the market conditions. So the 34% reﬂects that and supports our 7.5% growth year-over-year."
"Okay. Thanks. And then switching over to P&I, can you just give any color around the recently acquired REF units that you mentioned. How much of a contribution that was towards 2020 and when those will roll-oﬀ?","Yeah. We did acquire some new units here in the late summer and we did redeploy those at existing sites where some units were sunsetting. So REF is ﬂat. The way to think about is, REF is ﬂat year-over-year. So the growth we're seeing is really around the origination that we've been doing over the last few years. These additional units and REF will contribute about $30 million   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   over the next couple of years, which is a really nice chunk of cash and really helps reduce equity needs over the next three years."
"Okay. And when do those roll-oﬀ, the new ones that you just acquired?","Yeah. The new ones, as well as all the existing at the end of 2021. It all sunset at that point in time."
"Just one quick one, obviously, a nice dividend increase today. My question is going forward, is there any change to the dividend policy, given the mix shift with about 35% of next year's earnings come from -- coming from the non-utilities, and all the credit updates that you talked about earlier? How do we think about the dividend policy going forward?","Well, typically, we have said and continue to maintain that we will grow dividends in line with our earnings growth, but we'll be able to provide a lot more color and detail on that at EEI as to how it will look going forward. But, certainly, it will be in line with --       DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  With earnings growth.     -- earnings growth.     Yeah. We haven't really changed that philosophy, Andrew."
"Apologize I jumped on a second late. The comment that you made just around planning in light of market conditions. So like the 33.8% includes that? Is that -- can you just elaborate what you   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   mean by that and is that tied to a speciﬁc asset and the producer, so I'm kind of curious if you can just touch a little bit on what you mean by that?","Well, we're looking at all our platform, Shahriar, and certainly, we're operating in a low price environment. So as we continue our conversations and discussions with our partners, we are forecasting earnings growth of 34% in this business line in light of these market conditions. If the market conditions improve things could change. But certainly, we're planning carefully for this business segment at this point in time. In addition to the balance of our portfolio, which we feel very comfortable will help us deliver a 7.5% growth year-over-year."
"So this isn't really tied to credit quality or ﬁnancial conditions of the actual producers, but more of a pricing environment, which --","Both pricing and production. Yes, that's correct."
"Okay. Got it. And then just as you guys look at the contracts, what remains of NEXUS. There is a portion of it, obviously, that's still under short-term contracts. Is that -- are these market conditions, do they continue to dictate that you remain within that kind of a tenor of these contracts or is there an opportunity to actually contract longer term?","Shahriar, we have started to see interest in terming out longer than we've seen in the past. So we ﬁnd that as an encouraging signal from the market that there is a desire to contract somewhat slight -- slightly longer term. And so we continue to move our contract portfolio on NEXUS in that direction. So we are seeing positive signal there."
Okay.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"And of course, production continues to grow in the Appalachia at this point in time. So we believe that it's a combination of those factors that's creating more interest."
"Good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But I have a question about your renewable natural gas type of plans and investments. I mean, we've seen this sharp decline in RIN prices. And I'm just wondering, if you guys have a view, whether those prices will go and how it's being depicted in your 2020 guidance?","So thank you for that question. The bulk of our returns from RNG asset investments are in the dairy sector and most of the value from that comes from the low carbon fuel standard that exist in California to displace essentially diesel and gasoline and the C&G markets. We have seen a decline in the RIN pricings, but we have seen it also start to recover recently. But it forms a small portion of our forecast for these assets and these investments, which with the LCFS, they still remain very attractive assets and very attractive returns.  Our outlook, you asked, how do we feel about how it's looking? Feel that the EPA will issue a volume obligation, there'll be more in line with the supply that's available. And I believe that's why we're starting to see some out of whatever recovery and the pricing for the RINs."
"(Technical Diﬃculty) questions. So just wanted to come back real quick to the midstream segment and the $0.15 accretion that you talked about on the call earlier, when you announced the deal. Is this fair to think about the 2020 is $0.15 of the growth comes from that and the rest from other organic opportunities at this time?","Yeah. That -- actually that's a good way of thinking about it. Yes, the 15% -- part of that 7.5% includes that 15%, for sure."
"Okay. Thank you. And then, I wanted to dig a little more into utility earnings. So being roughly ﬂat year-over-year in the DTE Electric rate and I understand there has been a weather volatility last year and this year, but sort of the way you describe it, if we strip the way the weather impacts completely, would that have grown in line with your, kind of, long-term rate that you're projecting? And is there something within the rate implementation growth, of course, that is unusual this year?","Yeah. That's correct. We had -- last year was one of the hottest we've had here -- on record here in Michigan in the region. So you take that away and normalize weather this year, we had positive weather this year of $27 million, but last year was much higher. That was over $60. That - - when you take that away, kind of, look at the rate base growth, it is -- it will be in line with the 7% to 8% that we expect from this segment."
"Just going back to the Haynesville acquisition and thinking about the $600 million of growth CapEx. I was just wondering and I apologize if you said this on the call a couple weeks ago. But when you think about the $600 million, I know part of it's related to the Leap growth. But is there something that eﬀectively guarantees that growth happening or is that just based on your expectation for expansions based on Blue Union and where you think demand will be?","Actually, all of the growth is fully contracted with -- within the go. And so, the $600 million plus the other $400 million that we talked about approximately about $1 billion is fully contracted growth over the next 18 months to 24 months."
"Okay. And then, going back to the equity guidance. So I think you discussed this a little bit, but it's $1.5 billion to $2 billion and then $1 billion of that is the convert. And then, it says you can do about $300 million internally. Is that -- are you able to do that kind of level every year of $200 million to $300 million of equity internally to getting you to around the midpoint or higher end if needed?","Yes. David, for the next few years, we should be able to do about $200 million to $300 million, a lot of that is going and did the funding our pension, which we're a few years away from doing that."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And then, my last question, I think, you're alluding a little bit to, I mean, NEXUS, maybe there are some other parties, who are looking to potentially, kind of, term out those contracts, which is good. But also just thinking about the Generation Pipeline and connecting there. Could you remind us what those contracts, kind of, look like, if they are -- are they ﬁve years or they in the double digits? And then, also if you were to contract with them, would it likely be the oﬀ- taker side or would it be a producer looking at the contract on NEXUS?","Well, the Generation Pipeline, just to remind everyone is very proximal to the NEXUS pipeline and it stands on its own with its own long-term contracts, and it gives us a nice return and nice accretion. The plan is to connect that asset with several miles of pipe to NEXUS, and that will provide approximately for a $400 million to $500 million a day outlet for that pipeline. But again, just to repeat, we do have long-term contracts, they are about 13 years in length, so very nicely contracted is a pipe with demand charges."
"Hi. You may have addressed this on the actual call maybe two weeks ago. But one is just if you -- what makes you conﬁdent on the competitiveness of the Haynesville? And then, second, just you could help me understand the diﬀerence between minimum volume and commitment charges, and also a demand charge?","So let's start with the competitiveness of the Haynesville. We had the opportunity through this transaction to review all 1,700 of their proposed drilling locations and we did that ourselves as   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   long -- along with two reserve consultants. And we can tell you after that analysis, we felt that the resource is extremely strong, whereby there are at least 10 years of drilling available at sub $2 prices. So that's one.  Number two, the pipeline is being constructed, creates great interconnectivity with the Gulf Coast markets, including the industrial power and the emerging LNG markets. And the proximity to those markets provides a very large basis advantage that other resource basins don't enjoy. So we felt that the quality of the resource, the interconnectivity of the resource with growing markets. And three, the positioning of the resource, which provides it with basis advantage, create a really nice package of high returns and strong cash ﬂows.  In terms of MVC's and demand charges they are essentially the same thing. MVCs are monthly demand charges, just that in the gathering business they call it a minimum volume commitment and in our pipeline businesses including the pipeline that we're building for this asset, they call it a demand charge, but they are essentially equivalent in nature."
"Yes. Thank you. Apologize if you've said this already, but how much are you issuing a new converts related to the acquisition and when?","Yeah. We'll be issuing approximately $1 billion and we're going to ﬁnalize the exact dollar amount here shortly, but it will be about $1 billion."
"Good morning. I only have one left. On the P&I segment, the -- I didn't hear you talk or give any update on any industrial projects. I think the -- with the last one you had was the Ford complex or is that something you want to wait the EEI for or anything you can talk about now?","We essentially have secured three co-gens this year. One we were -- two were public about Stelco, in Ontario with their Lake Erie Works facility. We signed a long-term arrangement with them to develop a co-gen facility. And then we also have a commercial customer that we haven't yet disclosed and that we signed a purchase agreement with, the purchase of co-gen facility. And lastly, we signed an operating agreement with Wayne County for their correctional facility to operate their Industrial Services assets. In addition to that, we also close two RNG projects in Wisconsin this year. So three co-gens and two RNG projects, which gives us to be approximately the $15 million origination target that we are pursuing this year."
"So the -- I guess, gas price somewhat bearish outlook the people have, that is a little bit of a tailwind for these co-gen projects, correct?","Yeah. There's really two factors. One is the fact that gas prices continue to be at low levels. And secondly, electric rates continue to rise, so the spread between gas and electric to produce power continues to widen and that creates an attractive opportunity for customers that have, one, a large electric need, and two, are usually typically have steam host as well."
So it's -- when a customer has that thermal need is where you see the opportunities?,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Yes.
Okay. Got it. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for any additional or closing remarks.,"Well, I'll wrap up by thanking everyone for joining the call. 2019 again is shaping up to be another very successful year. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in a few weeks, where we will describe in more detail, our growth strategies and our ﬁve-year outlook for each business line. We'll also describe our ﬁnancing and dividend strategies in more detail. DTE story will continue to be a strong one into the future that will deliver premium shareholder returns. So thanks again for joining us and have a great day.  Operator  Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.
