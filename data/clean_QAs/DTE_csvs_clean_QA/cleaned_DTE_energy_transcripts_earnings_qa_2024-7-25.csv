Question,Answer
"Just want to pick up, I guess on prior conversations with regards to any updates you might be able to share with conversations with hyperscaler, negotiations, and how you see, I guess, the timeline of these negotiations developing, given the background of the Michigan sales and use tax legislation and, I guess, lack of clarity on coming to fruition at this point.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Jeremy, I would say that the conversations and engagement with the hyperscalers continue and I would say that there's still very strong interest by multiple parties and they are awaiting the results of the legislative eﬀort. We were targeting -- there was a target for the legislature to get that done in the spring, but I think the budget deliberations kind of overtook that process.  But there's still very strong bipartisan support both in the House and the Senate, and the Governor is still is indicating strong willingness to sign it if it comes to her desk, which we expect to happen sometime this fall and or the balance of this year. So, I think as soon as that happens, I think we'll start to get a little more serious traction on landing some data centers"
"Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just turning to the quarter and some of the results there, I was curious in the corporate and other, the timing of taxes that you might be able to, I guess, quantify a bit more the impact kind of there, and should we expect that to reverse in future quarters?","Yes. Hi, Jeremy. This is Dave. Yes, the timing of taxes will reverse as we go. This is really an eﬀective tax rate adjustment, so it adjusts the consolidated year-to-date income tax expense for what we think will be the annual tax rate at the end of the year, and it does come to zero at the end. So We did see some favorability from that of about $0.10 in the quarter, and that will adjust again as we go through the year."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Just one last quick one for me. If you might be able to share any color for the second quarter earnings, how much came from tax equity at Vantage, and how we should think about that, I guess, trajectory here?","Yes. There was -- there really wasn't anything that was tax related, ITC or PTC at Vantage in the second quarter. I will say we're -- you can see that we have a lot back loaded at Vantage through the year. We're really conﬁdent full year guidance there. A lot of it is project related that comes through the second half and a little bit will be a tax as well in the second half as we go through the year. But we're really conﬁdent in our guidance of $1.25 million to $1.35 there."
"Got it. That's really helpful. And just actually one last one if I could. Energy trading, is there any other incremental color you can provide with regards to the type of activities happening there in -- on the outside and how to kind of model or think about how that will ebb and ﬂow over time.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yes. You saw in the quarter and for the year so far, we're oﬀ to a really strong start there and that's driven by really two areas. One is our power FRS portfolio. So, these are contracted and hedged positions that we do and yeah, there is a shape to those through the year and we expect that that shape will -- it should increase through the through the end of the year.  And then, our gas portfolio, we have some structured contracts there as well and we're able to take advantage of some of those are contracted and hedged also. So, we had a good ﬁrst half. We're really about on our guidance for the year right now. But we want to go through the summer, see how that plays out with the weather and see how it works for the rest of the year. But, as you saw, we did have a very good ﬁrst half of the year in energy trading.     And these are multiyear contracts, so we expect some of those high margins that are contracted continue to provide beneﬁts sometime into the future beyond this year as well."
"Good morning. Just real quick on the rate case ﬁling. Obviously, it's in early innings, testimonies tomorrow. The provisions and kind of the mechanisms remain unchanged. Do you feel, I guess, there would be an opportunity for a settlement after testimony? Or do the parties, once again, kind of want to litigate a path? I guess, how are you overall thinking about a settlement at this juncture, whether it's partial or non-unanimous to help take issues oﬀ the table? Thanks.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Good morning, Shar. Yes. So, we are anticipating testimony tomorrow. If we can get to a contested settlement, our chances of settlements increase. But if not, there are a lot of interveners in this case. Obviously, we'd like to settle, but if we don't settle, we feel pretty conﬁdent in our ability to receive a constructive outcome regardless. So, it's a pretty straightforward case. It's all about the capital we need to invest to improve the reliability for our customers. And we hope that the commission is seeing that in our testimony and it's pretty strong testimony in that regard."
Got it. Any of the rate design proposals in the case cause any kind of contention as we're thinking about that settlement path?,"Not really. Most of the interveners are picking up on what least we've seen in the past. There's some interest in just our path forward on our retirement of our plant and then also some environmental pieces. But generally speaking, there isn't much rate design that is contested in the case."
"Got it. Okay. Great. And then maybe just a question on Vantage. I mean, obviously, the business mix has changed over the years. Do you kind of anticipate growing the existing platform for services in RNG? Would you lean on one or the other? And is the opportunity sort of for carbon capture potentially load services for industrial data centers increases? I guess, how do you ﬁnd Vantage repositioning? Is there even a need to look for some optimization there?","Shar, the two most signiﬁcant opportunities that we continue to pursue our greenﬁeld RNG, and we've got a good backlog of those projects. And then secondly, our custom energy solutions, which is sort of behind the fence industrial installation, where we're providing co-gen services, water services, compressed air services. Those are nice long-term contracts, ﬁxed-fee, without commodity risk. Those are two primary areas of focus.  CCS still is an emerging opportunity for us. We've got a number of parties that have committed to working with us contractually to test the feasibility of carbon capture and storage, and we're in the middle of a handful of those opportunities right now. So more to come on that before it becomes a business line that starts to create value. But we feel good about it, but we're also very focused on the ﬁrst two business lines that I mentioned."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. Got it. And sorry, Jerry, just the optimization. Is there any need to do some portfolio optimization there?","If we see two things, one is the business growing beyond our 10%. We're very committed to the 90-10 mix between utility and non-utility. That would be one potential trigger. And secondly, if there were signiﬁcant equity needs at DTE that would be a second trigger to perhaps look at asset optimization and rotation. Right now, in our current forecast, we don't see that need, but -- so it doesn't really create incremental value for us to rotate assets."
"Good morning, Jerry. I just want to start oﬀ on '24 expectations for '24. Maybe just can you remind us where do you sit year-to-date in terms of weather impacts? I think it was $0.28 to the negative in 1Q, and here it's slightly positive. So, maybe just is it the $0.20, $0.27 net number that we see in the ﬁrst half and you have mitigation underway? Maybe just reconcile that for us.","Yes. We show the weather impact slide. It's in the deck on Page 14. You can see at year-to-date electric, we're still negative $0.04, and at gas, negative $0.23. But as you know, we build in some contingency for weather throughout the year, and so we're really conﬁdent that we're going to be able to meet what we need to do for the second half of the year and hopefully see some good weather, which will allow us to invest some more for our customers in '24, pull forward some of the investment we need to do for our customers from later years into '24 and help out even and help out even more.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it. That's helpful. So basically, slight oﬀset to 1Q weather and still on track for 2024 with your sort of contingency measures in place. Okay, Joi, thanks for sharing all the details on the operational things you're doing, vegetation management, et cetera. Just wondering, how's the Liberty Consulting Review going? And as you made these operational changes, how is that getting factored into the review study and what to expect there as we await a report in fall here?","Yes, thanks, Durgesh. I say that the audit is wrapping up. The auditors have completed their interviews and they've done ﬁeld visits. We've gotten positive feedback on our interaction with them. It's been a very collaborative process up till now, and we anticipate that will continue as we get the report in September.  The initial feedback is very much in line with the agenda that we set forward in our plans. We may see some shifts in programming slightly, but generally speaking, we've seen nothing to indicate that there will be any surprises in September."
"Hey, let's see, I guess wondering if you could give an update on how you're seeing the performance-based rates potentially shape up from here, any progress and the direction of that new structure?","Sure. So there's been a lot of interaction and collaboration with the staﬀ on this PBR process, and I would say we're landing on metrics that we feel are really valuable to our customers. So I think we've got strong alignment on the metrics, and I think the process we're in now David is   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   to make sure that we've got strong consensus on the initial targets, and also on making sure that there's symmetry in the targets.  So those are the two remaining things that we're working with the staﬀ and the commission staﬀ on. So we feel like it's progressing well, the fact that it's lining up quite nicely with things that we think are very important to move for our customers."
"Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe on the data center side, wondering if you could just provide any color or context in terms of how much demand that you're seeing in terms of the data center pipeline, any quantiﬁcation that you might be able to oﬀer? And do you think there are characteristics of your service territory of Michigan that could attract those customers even without the legislation?","Yes. I would say that two things, several things that make Michigan attractive. One is, natural disasters are not a part of the Michigan's repertoire, so I think that makes it attractive. The access to water, fresh water, cool water, and also our climate being cooler are all attractive. Of course, our energy rates and the fact that we've got capacity available that we could oﬀer, I think makes us attractive. So those are the attractive features.  I think what will make us even more attractive is the sales and use tax exemption, but there are some aggregators that already have a sales and use tax exemption that got passed in 2015, so I think we're seeing some action, we will see some action from them regardless of the sales and use tax that's really targeting the hyperscalers, if you will. So more to come on this.  You asked about how much demand are we seeing. Obviously, there are a lot of big numbers ﬂoating around in the industry. We're seeing demand numbers in the thousands of megawatts, so that seems encouraging, and we want to work to landing the very ﬁrst one. Hopefully, that will -- I believe that the sales and use tax exemption is kind of holding some of that momentum back, but once that gets passed, I think that will break loose a bit."
"Hi, guys. Just picking up on some of these earlier questions, so it sounds like the trading business is tracking better than expected, but maybe just being conservative for now, but is there any oﬀset year-to-date at the other segments? Like, is that weather at the utilities or is that being oﬀset, and it's really kind of net-net the entire range is biased higher because of trading? Or is there an oﬀset somewhere?","I'd say we're in a good place across our businesses right now. We did see some challenging weather and gas. We had really cool winter so far, and -- or very warm winter so far at gas. So, we saw some challenge there, but we're working through that, but overall, we feel good about all of our businesses right now, and we feel good about the opportunity that's going to give us to invest for our customers here in 2024 as we can pull forward some expenses and do some additional maintenance on our projects or in our lines for our customers.     Yes, Michael. Just to add to that, I would say that we're feeling like we're going to have a really strong year, and we deferred a lot of non-critical maintenance last year that we'd like to pull back into the plan for the beneﬁt of our customers and also for the beneﬁt of creating success in 2025.  So I would say in this moment, we're back to our traditional planning process where we feel really good about 2024 and we're looking at what opportunities do we have to eliminate some of the sort of non-critical maintenance backlog that eventually becomes critical if you don't get it done. So we're looking to pull that forward, which will not only beneﬁt this year, but beneﬁt our customers. It will also beneﬁt our planning for 2025, which we are deep into at this point in time."
"Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the color. I think also in the quarter, this was adjusted out of earnings, but the gain on sale, on equity investment at Vantage, can you give any more color on what that was?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yes. There was a sale of one of our landﬁll gas projects, and we got a gain on that sale as we were exiting one of those projects.     Yes. We saw value in exiting. It was a partnership that we were exiting, and we saw good value there, so we took advantage of it."
"Okay. Great. And then just last one for me is just how you're thinking about the election and what that means for your future planning, mainly with respect to resource planning and maybe some of the tax credits that you're realizing if anything could change on the margin there in a Trump presidency, Republican sweep scenario.","Sure. So, great question. You all are aware that last year, we had some mandates as it relates to a clean energy standards and also in RPS standard that was passed by the state. Any type of federal change in politics, I don't think will aﬀect that. We will be mandated and required to achieve the RPS standard, as well as the clean energy standard, which drives a signiﬁcant amount of investment for us.  The other fact also is that, will require an act of Congress to change the IRA, and it would have to be a very signiﬁcant majority in order to overcome the fact that a lot of these investments are going into, in our service territory, Republican dominated territories and there'll be signiﬁcant interest. We see signiﬁcant interest from those legislators to get the economic development, get the property taxes and the jobs that come with billions of dollars of investment.  So, we're seeing at a local level really strong support for our solar developments. We are getting permitting, is moving quite nicely for us, a lot of community support. So, even though the politics could change, you would have to -- the political landscape would have to change drastically in order to make a diﬀerence. So, just to summarize, the RPS standards and the state mandates will drive the investment. And if the IRA was to change, it would make it perhaps less aﬀordable, but we would be looking for oﬀsets. But we view that as a low probability event."
"Two operational questions for you. First, on the tree trimming side, you're targeting a ﬁve-year cycle by the end of 2025. Where do you currently stand? Where have you been historically? And is there any challenge to getting to that target, or should it be pretty straightforward to get there?","It should be pretty straightforward to get there. We may have some trailing areas that we may have to revisit. We are -- right now, we've got about 80% on that ﬁve-year cycle. So, we're cleaning up some of the areas. We've revised our tree trim standard. We found that we had to go back to certain areas because the tree growth happened a lot quicker than we anticipated.  So, I think, Andrew, we can anticipate that the ﬁve-year cycle will get us back on track and then we'll go back and revisit again and make sure that those areas that we did trim, that the tree growth stays as we anticipate, we may even expand it even further because we're seeing certain areas, the growth is much higher and more quickly returning than what we had initially anticipated.     Andrew, you'll recall that we got a tree trim surge approved by the commission, where we took our investment in tree trim from $65 million a year to $200 million a year, about a handful of years ago. Actually, six years ago.     Six years.     And that excess tree trim surge is being securitized, which is helping to smooth the impact for our customers, while it provides that beneﬁt to our customers over a longer period of time. So, we do have the ﬁnancial resources to complete the surge. And as Joi said, we're actually ﬁne- tuning it and probably will keep it going for a while as we go back and take down even more vegetation.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Yes.     But it's having a really positive impact on reliability where we've done it."
"Great to hear. Then, more broadly, Joi, on Slide 8, you outlined a lot of those reliability eﬀorts in the four categories. Are all of those eﬀorts and the related spending fully embedded in the ﬁve- year CapEx plan, or would achieving some of those require incremental spending above and beyond the $25 billion ﬁve-year plan and how much of that relies on the rate case outcome both the current one and obviously future cases between now and then?","Andrew, it's all embedded in the plan and it is contingent on the rate case outcome and we'll hear tomorrow staﬀ position. We also have the audit and we hope that, just based on the feedback that we've gotten from the audit that the auditors were supportive of, at least the way we laid out the plan. Now, there may be some movement between the programs based on their feedback, but generally speaking, the feedback we've gotten from the auditors supports our agenda."
"Yes. Thank you. Appreciate it. Just to come back to this nexus of aﬀordability and growing tension between accelerating load growth and obviously the need to prioritize reliability and aﬀordability. How do you think about, as you look at the expanding pie of opportunities, this balance between PPA and self-build, especially in light of the latitude aﬀorded under the energy law? And even in light of what you know today, how do you think about that balance, just as you as you try to ensure ongoing aﬀordability and a palatable CapEx budget?","So, I'll start now and Dave can add. So, when we self-build, we ﬁnd that we're more competitive, which means we end up being more aﬀordable for our customers. PPAs with the ﬁnancial compensation mechanism makes our product more expensive to our customers. So, I choose up aﬀordability room. So that's thought number one. Thought Number two, from an investor sets, from a customer perspective, self-build is much more compelling than PPAs with an adder.  Now, secondly, for investors, owning assets provides more value. And I think the EPS value is 2X to 3X for owning versus PPA. And that's fundamentally driven by the fact that these intermittent resources, the FCM only applies for the output of the product. So, that's what fundamentally reduces the value of an FCM for investors. So, that's -- I'm not sure if that answers your question, Julien, but those are the two thoughts I can oﬀer. Dave, did you want ask the -- anything add to that?     We do have PPAs built into our plan we do have some PPAs built into our plan but when it comes to our balance sheet can our balance sheet can handle the amount of capital that we're investing in, as Jerry says, better for our customers and better for our shareholders to do that."
"Excellent. Yep, sounds like self-build remains the priority here for sure. And then related here, just a small nuance, can you talk a little bit more about the custom energy solutions and steel- related businesses, just any dynamics there on an ongoing basis as it pertains to Vantage? I know you've talked a little bit about it, but just to go back on that comment.","Well, we see good opportunities across the custom energy solutions business in particular as we're doing the central plant services for some more projects within the country. So we have a good pipeline of projects there that we feel we can continue to grow and continue to drive.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We have the project we talked about last quarter with Ford that is coming online in two stages this year. Some has come online and more will come online. The second half will come online at the end of the year. So we feel really good about that business. And then our steel-related business is just a solid performer for us."
"Wonderful, guys. We'll speak to you soon. All right. All the best.","Thanks, Julien.     Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead."
"Hey, I have two questions, one of them for Dave. He had previously told me he gets upset without a lot of questions. Just -- Dave, I'm just curious, when you think about levels of spending have been maybe at all-time highs, not just DTE, of course, industry, more severe spending, more severe storms, do you ever think about the company has a very healthy credit cushion right now, probably 200 basis points, 300 basis points on your FFO to debt metrics. Do you ever wonder if that's enough given where we are right now in this cycle of spend?","It's a good question, Andrew. Yes, we do target the 15% to 16% FFO to debt. We think it does give us some -- it does gives us some good headroom to downgrade thresholds. And we met with all the rating agencies over the last quarter, and I think they're pretty conﬁdent in the level   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   that we're at, too. So we feel good about where we are with our balance sheet, our balance sheet metrics on that."
"Great. And then just one follow-up, I think it's kind of to an earlier question. You mentioned a lot of the economic growth on Slide 6, a lot of opportunity. And then when I look at Slide 14, as you highlighted earlier, where you look at the demand growth or the customer growth or load growth for the year, it's trending about 1%. When you get all those economic activities in service, what are you seeing as long-term sales growth?","We do see it about in that range for our base our base economic sales growth, what data centers and how that comes in could play in a little diﬀerently. And then when we look out a little bit further, EV load is another thing that could drive some of our residential load up a little more kind of in the long-term as well. But it's pretty consistent with what we're seeing right now is what our longer-term forecast is."
"You answered most of my questions, but just go a couple little things here. With respect to the rate case, are there any new interveners that either you're seeing ﬁle or you expect to ﬁle here   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   versus the last rate case or rate cases?","Yes. There are new interveners in the gas case for sure and new interveners in the electric case. But as I said before, even with the level of intervention we're seeing now, the MPSC would have to move to likely a contested settlement, and that would increase our chances of settlement. Aside from that, we still feel conﬁdent that we can get a constructive outcome regardless. But yes, a lot of activity in the rate case space, more than we've seen in recent history."
Sure. Any way to bucket what those new interveners want or their agenda or what they're contesting or not contesting?,"We'll know with certainty tomorrow for sure. But what we've seen in the gas case is some environmental groups, more environmental interests in natural gas. That's generally what we're seeing.     What happened in the legislation last year, there was an increase in intervenor funding and that has spurred more interveners, because there's more money. So I think that's part of the challenge that we have and why there's been so much more activity is that the funding allowed by legislation has created much more activity."
"All right. Interesting how that works. One other question here, all the discussion about reliability, which obviously make it in the rate cases also, is that more of a positive in terms of giving you support to get more investment, get more spending approved, or are you seeing more of the negative right now in terms of push back on potential rate increases, if you could characterize those?","I would say I think we're all aligned in that we want to approve the reliability of the grid. The question becomes what's the best way to do that? And we believe and we believe that, that was the purpose of the audit is to examine and get everyone aligned on how we go forward in improving the reliability near term and then into the future. So, I think the audit results will go a long way in building, I say, alignment and consensus on what the path forward should be.     Yes. And I would say that the audit really came as a result of the commission wanting to make sure that we were doing all we could to drive reliability improvements. And so I would expect, I   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   don't believe that this audit will say, we should spend less on reliability improvements.  I think it will, like, Joi has said a few times today. I think it may shift things between diﬀerent buckets, but overall, I think there'll be a strong endorsement to continue to invest heavily in reliability, especially driven by the age of our system. I think that has become pretty evident in the audit that it requires signiﬁcant investment as we are proposing to improve the quality of that system over time."
"Okay. Great. And will those audit results be able to make it into this rate case, or will it be future rate cases?","Not well, the audit comes out in September. It can't be a part of the record necessarily. So, it probably won't make it into formally into this rate case.     But it may inﬂuence.     It may inﬂuence, right.     Yes. It's the buckets of investment, perhaps."
