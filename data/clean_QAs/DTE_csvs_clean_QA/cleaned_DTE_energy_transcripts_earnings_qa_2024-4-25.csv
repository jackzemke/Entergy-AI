Question,Answer
"Good morning, Jerry. Good morning, guys. I guess ﬁrst oﬀ is, I guess, how are you sort of thinking about the cadence of maybe CapEx updates in light of the kind of the new legislation? Could we see some adjustments to generation plan CapEx kind of in the near term to align closer to the new construct, or is this kind of further out? And is 3Q or maybe EEI kind of the right cadence for any updates as we're thinking about this new construct? Thanks.","So I'll start and maybe Dave can add to it, Shar. But we did update our capital plan that reﬂected our IRP settlement from last summer and also the legislation that passed in the fall. So when we updated our ﬁve-year plan, much of that capital was included and that created a $2 billion increase that we rolled out. Now I will say that as we get to the last part of that plan and we roll things up for the next ﬁve-year period, we do anticipate that the IRP and legislation will create an incremental investment opportunity.  Dave, do you want to add to that?     Actually, I think that's exactly right. We'll -- our ﬁve-year plan was consistent with the IRP. The legislation and the IRP were really close to each other in this ﬁve-year period, but they will give us some additional opportunity as we look beyond that.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Yeah. And that was actually more referencing the -- as you kind of roll forward, right? Okay. And then just on -- I guess, on just funding that incremental CapEx as we're thinking about rolling forward, you have that up to $100 million ﬁgure through '26. I guess, how do we -- Dave, how do we think about the incremental equity on every dollar that you could increase? Should we be assuming kind of that 50-50 cap structure? Or is there still some avenues to monetize assets like maybe DTE Vantage projects, RNG, or is that kind of oﬀ the table at this point? Thanks.","Well, I'll say that our strong cash ﬂow generation and our strong balance sheet allow us to do this capital investment with that minimal equity. And we've said that zero to 100 kind of ﬁts throughout our ﬁve-year plan, the zero to 100 on equity. And a lot of that was because of the IRA and we have a lot of cash coming in from the IRA and the tax credits from the IRA. So we're conﬁdent in the capital we have in the plan that we're going to be able to stay within the -- in the equity that we've talked about as well as keep our FFO to debt at that 15% to 16%."
"Okay. Perfect, Jerry. That's what I was trying to ask. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate it.","Thank you, Shar.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead."
"So I guess you're kind of back to your normal course business plan now that we move past '23. I know you have some execution items out there on the rate case side, but just how do you kind of feel about being able to kind of derisk '25 and beyond here with O&M and otherwise?","Maybe I'll start again, and my team can add to it. But we've started in a much stronger position this year with the absence of $200 million of headwinds -- the incremental headwinds that we experienced last year. And we are deep in the planning for 2025. And what we're looking to do is really try to create opportunities to improve the levels of headroom for 2025. I mean, this is our typical planning process when we start to feel really good about the current year, we go deep into the prompt year. And I can tell you we're deep into it.  We're starting to feel real good about '25 and putting that together as far as key milestones, both the gas rate case and electric rate case that come late this year and early next year. These rate cases are pretty straightforward in the sense that they're all about capital -- capital deployment and really continuing to rebuild and enhance both the gas infrastructure and our electric infrastructure to be more reliable and cleaner. So much of what we're requesting from our customers is to support those investments. And we've seen support for that in the past. So we feel pretty conﬁdent about our 2025 year plan coming together nicely."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I appreciate that. And then I guess, I know Vantage, you kind of have this 15 million a year growth cadence in the plan, but it does seem that there are some tailwinds to that business from tax credits and then just stronger cash returns in general. Is there just any way to isolate how large that strength is relative to that assumption that you've had in there? And I guess, how would you kind of describe where it puts you overall in the business at the midpoint of that 6% to 8% range? Can you be above that range in certain years? And how should we kind of think about that?","Yeah, Nick, we -- as you said, there are some good tailwinds in our Vantage business that we're seeing from tax credits related both RNG and to our Custom Energy Solutions business. And also, we have some good growth in that area as well. When we get to the end of the year, we'll talk more about '25 and beyond and how some of those tax credits will come into our plan. But what we do see is that it does give us some more ﬂexibility and some additional conﬁdence in the 6% to 8% as we go through these years. And then as we get beyond some -- still some really good conﬁdence in the long term 6% to 8%."
"Just want to come back to the comments as you laid out with regards to Vantage and the RNG assets and the potential for portfolio rotation there should the opportunity present itself. And just curious, I guess the driver to these comments, have others approached you on these assets   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   or just trying to get a sense for what you see or how that the market is for those type of assets right now?","Sure. So Jeremy, I'll just start by saying, look, we like those assets that created extraordinary returns for us and great cash ﬂows and we still see a strong pipeline of growth. And as we -- we're in the market all the time talking about value. And I can tell you that at this point in time, based on our long-term plan for value creation, we don't see the opportunity to create incremental value above what we could expect. Now the assets are extremely accretive, but we always look to create incremental value over our long-term plan. And we don't see that opportunity just yet. But if it presents itself, we will -- we will exercise that opportunity, I assure you. And again, we're in conversations all the time with the market. There's obviously lots of dialogue that happens in this type of marketplace."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. Thank you. And then I just want to come back and kind of -- on the back of some of your earlier comments here, talking about the renewable energy plan, just wondering if you might be able to peel back a little bit more of the details here, what we should be expecting, what you're focused on for the upcoming renewable energy plan?","Well, what I would say that is our voluntary plan continues. I'll just replay this that we have one of the largest voluntary renewable development plans in the country based on the size of our company. And that continues to exceed our expectations. We currently have about 2,400 megawatts signed and 2,500 megawatt goal for the next ﬁve years. So you can see that we're getting very close to having to update that plan. So I would say that's one update that we will provide as we roll forward the next ﬁve-year plan. In addition to that, the IRP becomes more aggressive as we move forward beyond the current ﬁve-year plan. So I think we'll see some tailwinds from that in the plan as well as we roll it together. So those are the opportunities that we see longer term and near term in the renewable energy development plan."
"One more Vantage question here. I was curious, are data centers a customer class that you go after? I'm thinking with custom energy solutions. Just wondering if there's any emerging growth opportunities there.","So the short answer is yes, but maybe I'll describe this in sort of more global perspective for DTE. I would say both our utility -- electric utility and vantage are well-positioned to pursue these opportunities with data centers here just right here in our backyard and also with Vantage beyond our backyard. But in Michigan, let me focus on Michigan for a minute. We have great access to water, favorable climate conditions and power plant sites with large land positions and grid access that I think will be very attractive and is very attractive to the suitors that we are having conversations with.  We're seeing signiﬁcant interest and we're engaged in discussions. But I will say there's much changes on the legislation that exempts the sales and use tax. And as you know, you may recall that the House here in Michigan approved the bills in a bipartisan way. They're awaiting approval by the Senate and the Governor has indicated a great willingness to sign those bills if they come to her desk. So I believe then that we're well-positioned in Michigan with both the electric utility and Vantage that could provide on-site energy services. So we're having those conversations. They're early, but the opportunity is sizable."
"Great, thanks. That's helpful color. And then I was wondering if, let's see, pivoting to the rate case -- the electric rate case, I was wondering if you could maybe help contextualize some of the Attorney General's comments that were out there on the -- on the size of the request and maybe any early indications or early thoughts on whether you think a settlement could be something that you go after and could be acceptable in this rate case.","Yeah. I think the Attorney General -- and good morning -- Attorney General pretty much is on par with things that we expected. We are really -- this rate case, as you know, is really all about our capital. And the capital we're deploying is targeting the distribution infrastructure and we're looking to improve reliability and certainly continue our journey to transition to cleaner energy   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   sources faster for the state. And with respect to the distribution infrastructure, we're looking to reduce power outages by 30% and cut our outage time in half over the next ﬁve years.  So the case is going as we had planned, we just ﬁled it. We do know the pre-hearing is scheduled for tomorrow, and we'll start to know this and understand the schedule and then start to get feedback from the interveners and from the staﬀ. So I guess what's in the case in general, aside from the investments that we have in our infrastructure, there's also a storm tracker. The storm tracker is about $65 million. It's based on the ﬁve-year average and it's a two- way tracker with a 50-50 sharing of anything above and below rates. So that's really what's in the case, investments that we have in our infrastructure to drive reliability improvements and certainly cleaner generation. You know that the revenue requirement is about $466 million. And we're targeting an ROE of 10.5% with a 50-50 cap structure.     In terms of prospects for settlement, David, we've got a lot of interveners in this case and we will do all we can to settle. But again, as Joi said, since this case is really primarily about capital deployment and well-understood and well-known agendas for capital deployment, we're conﬁdent that even if it goes to its full course in terms of litigation that we will get a supportive outcome. I think the commission has a strong track record in that way and also the administration supports these investments and knows that they're extremely important for the state to pursue economic development and also provide more value to our customers and our citizens here in the state of Michigan. So, we're feeling pretty good about how it's progressing."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good morning, Jerry. Jerry and Joi, just on the discussion around on the electric rate case settlement, you guys have discussed or in the past have talked about potentially a partial settlement with some parties and not unanimously. Is that something that you could pursue with this electric rate case?","We could, Durgesh, and certainly we will. Again, I don't want to hinge too many hopes on a settlement. We will do all we can to settle. I think -- but as we saw in our last rate case, we weren't able to bring all the parties together for various reasons and sometimes that happens. But our opening position and our desire is to settle. But we're also conﬁdent that we will get supportive outcomes in the event that there is not a settlement."
"Understood. Thanks for that. And then maybe just one question on 2024. Obviously, you expressed a lot of conﬁdence here in hitting numbers. Maybe can you just frame for us what level of contingency, if any, you might have used? I know you go into the year with a healthy level of contingency, but you had milder weather in 1Q. So maybe just frame for us how much of that contingency bucket is still left?","Hey, Durgesh, this is Dave. How are you? As we came into the year, we did have some contingency for weather. And then we did see weather in the ﬁrst quarter, as you can see. But as we see that weather, we work right away to rebuild what we can to make sure we're in a good position for the summer. And then -- so we've done that. And then we also have our lean and invest where we saw last year we can go -- we can go deeper if we need to and doing things that we will need to do to make it. So we're in a -- we're in a ﬁne position going into this -- into the summer, and that's when the real weather will happen for us."
Excellent. I appreciate it. High conﬁdence in 2024 is what I hear. Thank you.,Yes.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
"If I could ﬁrst -- if I could ﬁrst ask that O&M question a little bit diﬀerently. You were pretty aggressive last year as soon as the year started, given the rate case and the mild winter weather. And obviously, some of that is partly reversed in the ﬁrst quarter. I guess, the way I would word it is, would you say you're back to normal O&M levels, or are you still sort of catching up from last year? Or again, the[ph] last question asked, are you in lean mode already, given the mild winter 2024?","Andrew, I'll start by saying this year feels a lot diﬀerent than last year. We had -- we had weather last year too, but we also had the storm in the ﬁrst quarter and the rate case. So, we were in a very diﬀerent position this year. And we did a lot across the company to achieve what we needed to do last year. Some of those reductions continue naturally into this year. But for the most part, those were all one-time savings from last year. So we're back into what I would say is our normal eﬀorts on productivity and eﬃciency improvement putting into place our lean and invest as needed as we continue to manage aﬀordability and ensure we're going to deliver for our customers. So I'd say it's more into the normal DTE mode of productivity and eﬃciency improvements."
"Okay, great. Good to hear. And then one very small one. The negative earnings at Corporate and Other, and you have a note that there's a -- it's related to the timing of taxes. Was that in line with your expectations when you gave the full year guidance? And should that fully oﬀset as the year goes on, or is that trending a little diﬀerently than you had budgeted?","That is all consistent with what we budgeted, and it will all reverse by the end of the year, too."
"Hey. I wanted to maybe dive a little deeper on the rate case and some of the kind of non- traditional aspects of it. I guess on the storm cost tracker, what do you think chances are that, that goes through or does this need to iterate through a couple more cases? If you had that in place last year, would that have been enough to put you in a position to have hit the original guide? And then on the IRM, how much is that ramping up from the last case? And do you think that can help space out cases in the future? Sorry, that was a bunch there, but any color would help.","Yeah. So your ﬁrst question around the storm tracker, the $65 million. If that were in place last year, yeah, that would have been helpful, certainly given the cost that we experienced in the ﬁrst quarter and then throughout the balance of the year. And do I think that we'll get some support for it? I think there's a lot of conversation that happened early on. There is a good chance that we'll get the support. I think we're aligned with consumers and pursuing this type of tracker. And more will come in by way of testimony. We'll know here shortly, once the schedule is set and we start to see the intervener and staﬀ testimony how much support we actually get.  In terms of the IRM, what's in the IRM? For 2026, the IRM includes $530 million worth of capital. And then for 2027, it's $720 million worth of capital. Previously, we had ﬁled for $62 million in 2024 and $290 million in 2025. And we're well-positioned to execute on our '24 plan and we certainly have plans for '26 and '27. Do I think that it will keep us out of future rate cases? I think it will have to continue to grow in order for us to achieve, I think, a delay in the rate case cadence that we have right now. And that will take us several years to arrive at I think that ramp."
"Okay, great. Yeah, you hit all of them. Thank you for that. And then just one quick one. The renewable plant outage advantage in Q1, was that planned or unplanned? And is it -- if it was unplanned, is it resolved?","It was unplanned. It actually started last year, and it is resolved. So it's coming -- it's back online for the rest of the year."
"I was just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit big picture, right, with a pretty -- pretty impressive investment plan that you have over the next few years, right? And I'm sure there's going to be more rate cases coming to kind of account for that. Longer term, what do you see as an oﬀsetting factor, I guess to customer bill increases here? Is that maybe industrial load that's growing and including data centers or some of the other material[ph] automation you're putting in would cut on OpEx? Like if you could give us some sense on kind of like big picture, how would you, I guess, oﬀset customer bill pressures with that?","Well, I would say -- Sophie, thanks for the question. I mean, we are undertaking a historic transformation here at DTE. As we think about the way we deliver energy, our wires business, the way we're transforming, the way we produce power over the next ﬁve years. And as you can see in our capital plan, we have $25 billion in our ﬁve-year capital plan with 90 -- more than 90% of it directed at our two utilities. And we also continue to transform the way we deliver natural gas, and that's well underway.  Now in terms of the aﬀordability perspective, you can see we're extremely well-positioned with our bills to our residential customers being well below the national average. Our goal is to maintain that position. And the way we maintain that position is, as you described, a lot of these investments are pointed at assets that will reduce cost. For example, as we continue to improve reliability in the electric wires business, we'll start to see our trouble costs and storm costs that fundamentally will start to decline. And that will help ﬁnance this as well. And that's just one example. Even the transition from coal to natural gas and renewables, that's creating signiﬁcant cost reductions, operating cost reductions. So a lot of our CapEx will yield lower operating costs, which will obviously be transferred to the beneﬁt of our customers.  In terms of revenue growth, we see several of opportunities as we look forward, a lot of discussion in the industry about data centers. Certainly that will help as we start to land those, and we need enabling legislation to get that done. We also see EVs even though they've slowed down a bit, we're still connecting 1,000 EVs a month or more, which is encouraging. And we see that growing and we see the big three here working heavily to bring new models to bear. And as a matter of fact, just quickly here, I was on a video call with the President of   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   General Motors and he was testing a new EV on their track here at Milford. So lots of development activity still on new EVs and bringing those to market. So I think we'll see that help ﬁnance some of these investments.  So I would say two things just to summarize, very signiﬁcant capital agenda, $25 billion over the next ﬁve years, $50 billion over the next 10 years. So if you're an investor of DTE, you should be really excited about long-term investment opportunities and the fact that a lot of this investment will help moderate bills over time."
"Thank you. That's very helpful. I also wanted to ask you a quick question on Vantage, right? So I guess to the extent you keep in this business, how should we think about the size of it relative to the utility businesses that you have? Is there a certain kind of like contribution to earnings that you want to keep it under and not let them grow beyond? Like what is your thinking there?","Yeah. Our investment thesis there is that we want to pursue high-quality investments with low- risk and high returns. And we've been doing that, and that's working out quite well. But we want to keep it at less than 10% -- at 10% or less of earnings contribution as we look forward. And our utilities are growing so quickly that it does give us the opportunity to continue to grow Vantage as well."
"Good morning. So just wondering, in the past, I remember there was always this discussion about your approach to co-planned retirements and reliance on the grid versus self-generation. I was always of an impression that you guys were long power. I hope that's still the case. So just two things. As the load growth accelerates and as we are more cognizant of the importance of dispatchable resources and -- is there a chance that you're going to make any changes to generate (Technical Diﬃculty).  And number two, and as I said, I'm assuming you're a long power and that could sort of attract data centers. Would that simply improve aﬀordability of electric bills for existing customers, or would it be actually incremental to earnings? Again, I feel like we're seeing this pickup in the load growth at our utilities without any necessarily commensurate increase in earnings. And so, I'm just wondering how you envision it, given your generation footprint.","Great questions, Angie, and I'll take them one at a time. So in terms of reserve margins at DTE, when we ﬁled our last IRP, we ﬁled that with adequate reserve margins as we move through our coal plant retirements. And as you know, we've built a state-of-the-art combined cycle facility that's up in operation as part of our coal plant retirement plan. We are converting the Belle River power plant from coal to natural gas, which will be a dispatchable -- continue to be a dispatchable plant. That will happen in the '25 and '26 time frame.  In addition to that, we've embarked on battery storage, which will provide us short-term dispatchability. So all of that ﬁts into a portfolio between now and 2028 that works extremely well. As we near the end of that -- near the next phase of the IRP plan when we want to exit coal completely by 2032, we will need to build more dispatchable generation. And what we're pursuing there is current technology where we can use natural gas with carbon capture and storage. And we highlighted that in our IRP. So we do see more dispatchable generation in our future, as we continue our exit from coal. That plant will also be available to burn hydrogen, should hydrogen present itself as a viable resource and fuel resource.  In terms of growth, very good question. What we see there is if some of this growth accelerates, we will need to build and the growth that we're looking at like data centers, for example, our 24/7 operations, that will need generation that cannot be -- and power that cannot be interrupted. And so, we will need 24/7 dispatchable -- more 24/7 dispatchable generation and renewable resources. So again, it will be a mix. It does have the potential for accelerating our next IRP should such demand present itself.  In terms of impact to customers, we expect that those investments will pay for themselves and actually provide a beneﬁt to customer bills to some degree. So that's our going-in position and we see that as very possible. And it will also add value to our investors because those investments will be in rate base and they'll attract the typical returns. I think it's a win-win all- around."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   And based on your discussions, when -- when would this incremental load potentially materialize? Are we talking like 2028 and beyond? I'm just wondering how soon we could see the earnings impact?","Angie, it's too early to tell. These conversations, as I mentioned earlier, are very early. They are sizable conversations in terms of the load that we're talking about. And again, we're really well- positioned. But in terms of timing, we haven't gotten that far just yet, but I think that will come. I think the key catalyst here in Michigan will be this legislation that needs to pass on the sales and use tax. That's a big deal for the data centers that are considering Michigan and considering investing at some of the sites that we put in front of them."
"You answered most of my questions and discussed most of the topics I was hoping to hit. So just real quick, I saw residential commercial demand. Looks like it was up. I know this is a small -- relatively small quarter for that, but anything there either relative to plan or notable where you're seeing residential commercial demand pick up a little bit?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. We did see a residential up quarter-over-quarter. I would say though for the year, it's -- we're expecting it to come in on plan and probably pretty well consistent with last year. We have a lot of energy eﬃciency we do and that -- and the growth kind of work together and will be fairly ﬂat to last year."
Okay. That's all I have. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.,"Thanks, Travis.  Operator  I will now turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks. Please go ahead.     Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. And I'll close by saying that we're feeling really conﬁdent about 2024 and of course, our long-term plan beyond that in terms of providing value for our customers and for our investors. Have a great morning. Stay healthy and stay safe.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines.
