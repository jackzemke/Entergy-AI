Question,Answer
"Just on the CapEx plan. How are you currently looking at the generation spending and plan, I mean you announced Belle River, would cease coal operations ahead of schedule. So they're sort of incremental spending opportunities for generation, especially in light of the IRP ﬁling. Any kind of speciﬁc constructs that you may be looking for Jerry? We've seen some more aggressive proposals from your Michigan peer and I guess I'm asking can you get out of all coal by the 2030-'35 time frame? and do you sort of, is there an opportunity to provide an early look into the IRP at EI at the next year's ﬁling? So a couple of embedded questions.","Shar, as you've seen, we've accelerated the Belle River Power Plant conversion from coal to other fuel sources like natural gas or RNG and to potentially hydrogen. So that's certainly in the works by 2028. As you mentioned, we're going to ﬁle an IRP in the fall of next year and we're going to really use the next year to get a lot of feedback (Technical Diﬃculty) know that Monroe Coal Plant is slated to retire in 2040, but we are looking at many scenarios to pull that forward, Shar. So that will be become much more transparent when we ﬁle the IRP, the details of exactly how we're going to do that and also replace that baseload generation that's over 3,000MW of baseload generation. So we're going to have to think through very carefully how do we maintain reliability and aﬀordability and get good feedback from our stakeholders. So what you see in the current (Technical Diﬃculty) 5-year outlook is an increase of about $1 billion in cleaner generation and that's really driven primarily by our investments in voluntary renewables as well as some investments that we have at our pumped hydro facility, and a small hydrogen pilot perhaps at our Blue Water Energy Center."
"Got it. And then Jerry, just a question on '21 guidance and sort of how you're planning to oﬀset some of the storm and other headwinds from 3Q that were not in plan, right. What sorts of kind of maybe discretionary spending ﬂex do you have, and does that kind of defer anything into '22? And so I guess I'm asking about contingency and ﬂex and if you're using any of that ahead of '22.","We're going to deliver 2021, all of those storm costs are already reﬂected in our results and in our current guidance for 2021. So I can tell you I'm extremely conﬁdent of delivering 2021 and as we, Dave and I mentioned in our speaker description that we'll likely deliver at the high end of that. So we're feeling really strong about 21. I have no concerns about delivering 2021, and 2022 just to speak about that for a moment. As usual, we spent all of the year building levels contingency to ensure the delivery of 2022. (Technical Diﬃculty) And as you've seen in the past, if we don't consume that contingency, then we will trend towards the higher end of guidance. So again, '21 is locked in and we are trending towards the higher end of that guidance and '22 is feeling really good and really strong at this point in time. Whereas as a matter of fact, we're busy working on '23 to build a strong plan for 2023.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Perfect. That's what I was trying to get at. And just lastly from me on the energy trading side; obviously, we're seeing a step run on commodities right and gas is now little over $6 for the winter. How is, I guess, so how is the portfolio positioned in terms of volatility with the Gas and are there any kind of risks to counterparties we saw with Texas this year or conversely, is there a kind of an opportunity to exceed there??","We, our portfolio is slightly long as it relates to natural gas, Shar. So if anything, there is bias for upside as commodity prices in the gas business have gone up. So I would say, certainly biased for some level of upside."
"Good morning. Wanted to start on the DTE Vantage and that $160 million, $170 million you laid out in 2026. Just wondered if you could kind of talk through the line of sight, you have to that number. And I know you have been very successful with the RNG projects and that has been trending well, but thinking through the carbon capture side, how much of growth capital you think you could deploy there in the near term and how much kind of current legislative environment would the 45Q support that or how much you might need support on that side to make those projects kind of more economic?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So I'll start by saying that the way we get through our guidance 5-year guidance for DTE Vantage's, we continue to deliver $15 million of net income growth per year, and that's really underpinned by us being very selective about what RNG projects we do and what cogeneration projects we do. Those are two major business lines. So just to give you a feel for it, we'll complete construction of the Dakota Plants project in 2022 and then we've got Wisconsin project that will go in service in 2022 as well. And we got a third one in New York that will likely be placed into service in '22 or early '23. And in addition, we have the Co-Gen Facility that goes online in 2022. All of that builds for our growth into 2023 and beyond as well as we've got a handful of really strong opportunities in the pipeline in the Energy space and co-gen space that we'll keep up marching along, again $15 million in your net income is something that we feel is reasonable to achieve each and every year; and that's how we got through our $90 million for 2022 by not knocking oﬀ $15 million a year for 5 years. So we're just going to continue on that trend and deliver for you all."
"Got it, that will make sense. I just want to follow up a little bit on the electric cutbacks and kind of thinking through the voluntary renewables and you said 950MW and another 400 is kind of in advanced negotiations. How should we be thinking about like what is kind of currently embedded in the current capital plan and then how much is going to (Technical Diﬃculty) program?","Well, the 40 megawatt will go way to ﬁlling up the $3 billion we've got in our 5-year plan. So that gives us great conﬁdence that we'll deliver on the $3 billion of clean generation that you will see on slide seven and is there upside, yes, potentially. You know every year, we continue to update that line item in cleaner generation as we think about coal retirements and as we think about increased voluntary renewables. All of that points towards future growth in our investments in cleaner generation."
"Hey, good morning. Team. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Well done on around here. Hey absolutely pleasure, indeed. A quick question here. I know you guys are talking about planning already all the way up to '23. So how are you thinking about just responding to the storms from this last summer. Obviously, resiliency and reliability are of paramount importance. I mean are there incremental capital opportunities here? I mean, we've heard some of your peers contemplating expanding, for instance undergrounding and other sort of reinforcement opportunities around some of these latest rounds of storms, as well as potentially baking in any incremental OpEx into your, for instance '22 plan as you think about responding to the PSC here.","Well, so let me take those one at a time Julien. So you've seen that we made a regulatory ﬁling to take some of the favorability in 2021 that we're experiencing and rolling it into $70 million, at least $70 million in incremental Tree Trim. So that's the immediate response and that's going to fund 200 to 300 people, incremental tree trimmers coming to the state to trim trees, to get the trees up our wires. So that's the immediate response, and so that will run through our Tree Trim tracker that we have, and that will be a good thing for our customers to get to improve reliability for the next summer and a subsequent summer. So we're really looking at accelerating our Tree Trim program with that incremental investment.  And again, that will be sized somewhere between $70 million to $90 million of a pull forward and that'll be the, source of that will be favorability in '21 that we're experiencing. The second thing that you'll see is in our capital plan, we raised our distribution infrastructure investments from $7 billion to $8 billion in response to our detailed planning that we put in front of the commission as it relates to resiliency to accommodate worsening weather patterns and also to accommodate the eventuality of the electriﬁcation of the transportation ﬂeet; that's going be a big deal for us in the second half of this decade. Currently, we're starting to see over a 1,000 connections to our grid from EVs and that's grown from a couple of 100 last year. So all of that is pointed towards creating that $8 billion towards creating a more resilient reliable and more eﬃcient grid."
"Excellent, alrighty. And if I can just to come back to that $15 million if I remember right, I think that the $90 million baseline, you talked about here was oﬀ '22 if I remember, almost seems like the 165 is even little bit better than the 15 cadence, but I could have my numbers oﬀ slightly there, but it seems like that's a good trend. And if you can, again not to rehash too much of that last question, but the line of sight (Technical Diﬃculty) versus today, you know, certainly it seems like at least at a minimum good placeholder and excel it with an accelerating backdrop relative to what you've already picked up at $15 million a year. You would think that there is potentially even more opportunity there? So you may have spoken it a second ago, mentioning the incremental Co-Gen, but I'm just trying to push you a little bit further on how much clarity you already have against that $165 million versus incremental?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Dave, I'll let you start and then I'll jump in as well.     Yeah, I'd say like Jerry said, we have really good pipeline of projects within our DTE Vantage business right now. And so getting that $15 million a year is right within our sight and one of the keys, Julien, we've gone through this before is staying within 10% of our business being non- utility. And so that's also one of the drivers that kind of keeps us from pushing that too much. There is always other ways that we could look at that if we did ﬁnd some more growth, but that's also one of the limiters for our growth as well.     And Julien, that gives us the opportunity to be really selective. Right now, we're still seeing RNG projects that we're going to work originating and they're all greenﬁeld and that's how we're creating the greatest amount of value. We're seeing 3 to 5-year simple cash paybacks and IRRs in the teens, unlevered IRRs in teens. So we like the approach that we have, and it also meets with our strategic goals of (inaudible) keeping a 90-10 split between utility and non-utility."
"Right. No I was -- I didn't mean it that big. I was just suggesting that the 2026 seems like it's even better than 15 a year and I was just coming back to that, sorry. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. I'll leave it there.",Thanks Julien.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
"Yeah. Thank you. A lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but just on the ﬁnancing side of things, you've laid out through 2024 now minimum equity needs and when we think about this additional billion dollars over the roll forward 5-year plan, any insight into that '25 and '26 period whether at least in this base plan for now and whether you'll need any more equity in terms of that back half of the plan?",Yes. We see really good cash ﬂow generation through our 5-year plan. And so that minimal equity needs like that's consistent right now within our plan even bring it in this additional   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   billion dollars of capital into the plan.
"Okay, understood. And then my follow-up question is Jerry, your company has had a track record of being pretty conservative on your annual guidance and always exceeding or outperforming that and this, whether it's 2022 or whatnot, the 6% that you've highlighted it does make sense. The question is given for this year at this kind of the second time to your raising guidance, are they are not as many opportunities just from like an operational constraint basis to pull forward more cost into the next year, so that from a year-over-year cadence perspective for earnings growth that it is a bit smoother. Just wondering, I think given, some of the investors and people on the street are used to or looking for more stability and predictability of annual earnings growth despite you guys always having the track record of outperforming your guidance, so just any color there?","Sure. So I'll start by saying that if you look at our track record over the last decade, you would see that our EPS growth on a CAGR basis is one of the highest in the industry, and I think it's tracking probably well over 8% at this point in time if we were to include this year. So we're pretty proud of our EPS growth track record. We are conservative in our planning in the sense that we do put contingencies in to you anticipate any potential variations in either load or weather at our 2 biggest income producers, which are our utilities. So again, as I mentioned for 2022, I feel really good about the level of planning that's gone into 2022, and if we do not consume, our contingency will be tracking towards the higher end of that guidance. For 2023, we're putting that year together and I expect that that will come together just as nicely as '21 and '22 in the last decade."
"Wonder if you could give some thoughts on the latest developments in the gas rate case, the various ﬁlings there?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Sure. So we've had multiple interveners including the staﬀ and the AG and now the administrative law judge ﬁled their positions. When we take all of that into consideration, we feel pretty good about the outcome that we expect from the gas rate case. We really believe we'll get a productive outcome and that will meet our needs and our investors needs."
"Okay. Is the sensitivity around that 2022 guidance, is that, is there a sensitivity in there in terms of what the ﬁnal outcome might be on that gas case?","Well certainly, part of our contingency planning is to try and accommodate various scenarios. But I would say that you will see productive outcome on ROE, which is really important to our investors. The Commission has taken a past practice of gradual approaches at the ROE and has also taken a pretty fair stance on our capital deployment plans and any investments that we've made in the gas business. So I think we're going to get a really productive outcome that will help us deliver our 2022 targets."
"Okay, great, and that's all supportive of the CapEx numbers that you're putting out there for the next few years, right?","That's correct. And we've got strong support from the commissioners and the staﬀ on our CapEx program at the gas company. It really is about infrastructure renewal. We're replacing about 200 miles of gas main every year from replacing the cast iron with new PVC piping and also moving about 30,000m from inside the home to outside of the home. So all of that is pointed at future safe and reliable operation of our gas infrastructure. So lots of support for that strong support, not only from the commission, but also from the administration who (inaudible) infrastructure renewal in the state."
"Hi, just one question on the gas utility CapEx plan. You said I think there is this $0.5 billion of incremental opportunity sitting on top of the base plan, which is sort of similar to how that look last year and possibly the year before, I was just checking. But, Jerry, can you give us a sense of what's in that and what the timing and sort of forum for getting some of that into the plan would be?","Sure. So we've brought in about an extra $100 million into this current 5-year outlook incremental, and we are always looking for opportunities to bring more. You've got a very large inventory of infrastructure renewal needs at the gas company, primarily starting the point towards some of our transmission assets like aging compressor stations, and also aging pipelines that are going to start to need some level of replacement in the transmission portion of our operation. So what stands in the way of getting incremental capital into the plan is really us planning aﬀordability opportunities to oﬀset the rate pressure that these investments would create. So that's what would bring it in, Jonathan. And so we'll continue to update that plan each and every year and try to bring more CapEx, and then the plan to accelerate our work as it relates to infrastructure renewal."
"Okay. So should we think of it as part of the next, the future rate case cycle as opposed to other regulatory value?","That's where you will see it, that's where it will be most transparent."
"Thank you, Jerry. And then just on the tax items in the quarter in the Corporate. I think you mentioned that there was this item that's going to reverse $50 million in the fourth quarter, but you had also mentioned the one-time true up in third quarter. I was wondering if Dave could unpack those, how much those two diﬀerent items impacted the quarter and which direction the true-up went in etcetera?","Dave, you want to take that.     Sure. As you said, there were two big drivers for the variance in the quarter, Corporate and Other that were tax-related. We do still expect to hit our guidance for Corporate and Other for the quarter and our increased guidance for the year, but on the tax, the one-time true up, that was a valuation allowance that was against the tax deduction that we are carrying forward. And so when we had lower pre-tax earnings as a result of the spin, we looked at this diﬀerently and realized that we had to reduce that a little bit, and there would be about $18 million delta for that was negative. But then on the tax timing, the eﬀective tax rate; that's an adjustment that we do for GAAP and it's just because as our pretax earnings and credits aren't earned ratably over the year, we have an entry at Corporate and Other that trues that up to the eﬀective tax rate, and so that was about the same amount for the quarter and then we had some of that from the ﬁrst three quarters that all will reverse in the fourth quarter and that will be the $50 million that we discussed that we'll see favorable in the fourth quarter."
That combined to about $36 million in the third quarter.,"Yes, right around that. It's all a little less than that actually relative to last year, but yeah, it's about that."
"Great, thank you. And just one other thing, you mentioned in talking about '22 Dave, conversion. But if I'm not wrong, that really hits really at the end of the year, so wouldn't that be more of a '23 headwind and is that just sort of how should we think about that as you're trying to set up the smoother growth, etcetera.","Yeah. It comes in November of '22, so we see (inaudible) in '22, We see a sixth of that in '22, but then '23 is when it does have a little more of a headwind for us that will be growing through   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  that."
"Okay, all right. I just wanted to checkout to remember that correctly. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Ryan Levine with Citigroup. Your line is open.
"Hi, thank you for taking my question. What's the current gas hedge position for DTE Gas heading into the winter?",So the current hedge position for Gas is 90% heading into this winter and about 65% heading into the following winter of '22-'23.
Thank you. Do you have a sense of what the net customer bill impact will be this winter as a result of that hedge proﬁle in the current gas prices?,"It will be pretty minimal since we have secured about 90% of our gas supply at ﬁxed prices. In other words, the prices are ﬁxed around 90% of the portfolio, so we see a very minimal impact."
"I appreciate that. And then switching to the storm impacts, there has been, I guess the Governor letter and the Commission requests for information on some of the worst performing circuits. I guess the question is what do you, what's the incremental cost for undergrounding that would make that option more viable and is there any developments that could switch your current plan away from tree trimming to some other alternative form of mitigation?","So I'll start by saying at about little over 30% of our system is underground now, in the 70s when we started to underground all new subdivisions and all new developments. So we have been under the ground for quite a few years. What remains above ground in residential   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   neighborhoods primarily is infrastructure that's older than that. We've looked at--we've looked at and continue to look at ways to strategically underground. One, it is very expensive, so you have to be very strategic about how you do it. So just to give you an idea about 7 or 8 ago, I was asked by a Mayor at one of the communities that we serve, whether we can underground the whole system, and it was a community of 14,000 residents, and the cost to underground was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The cost to trim those circuits was $200,000 to $300,000 and which would give us about 95% of the same reliability impact. So it's, again, undergrounding is great. I think we have to approach in a strategic manner. That is a question that we're addressing in our distributions plan, 5-year plan that we put in front of the Commission, and we'll continue to work to ﬁnd ways, strategic ways to underground. But it is very cost-prohibitive to take existing systems in underground and also disruptive to our customers, in the sense that the locations where you have to underground, you have to remove the trees, turn up front lawns and driveways as well as that backyards, potentially when the systems are in the people's backyards."
Appreciate it. And maybe one last follow-up in terms of the potential penalties that could be described for the future storm outages. Any color you can provide around how you're approaching that potential issue and if any of these mitigation eﬀorts could weigh into that decision?,"While many of the mitigation eﬀorts that we're deploying increased tree trim, and of course an $8 billion investment agenda in the Grid I think will go a long ways to fundamentally improving the reliability of the Grid. In terms of customer credits that we provide, we are revisiting that with the Commission and we expect to resolve that over the next 12 to 18 months. We think that the $25 credit for extended periods of outage are -- is outdated, and we agreed that it needs to be increased. And we just need to arrive at a level that makes a lot of sense, because all of the money that you put towards credits can also be used to improve the infrastructure. So there is a balance there, but also recognition of some of the diﬃcult situations that, say for example, that our low-income customers ﬁnd themselves in when we have outages that may last 3 or 4 days."
"Just to elaborate on the winter gas prices, you just talk about the hedge position for gas. What about the electric side, can you remind us what tools you have? I think you had some hedging programs and access to storage; is that right?","Well, for the electric side, we were primarily burning coal as our primary fuel source at this point in time and also nuclear fuel, and those are well hedged at this point in time. And we burn a minimal amount of natural gas at this point. Now, when we bring on our combined cycle plant, we will be burning a signiﬁcant amount more natural gas and we'll look to hedge those products as well as we, as that plant comes into service in late 2022."
"Next question is on the electric rate case ﬁling coming up, I believe you're planning to ﬁle by year end. Remind us, will the $70 million tree trimming initiative be part of that or will that be resolved before you ﬁle and beyond that should it be a pretty plain vanilla case or are there any other unusual items to focus on?","So Andrew, we're planning to ﬁle in the ﬁrst quarter of next year, so it won't be the end of this year. And the Tree Trim matter will be resolved before that ﬁling. Again, we'll use a special accounting order to take, what I would say favorability for the 2021 to roll into our Tree Trim program and that'll be sized anywhere from $70 million to $90 million. And then of course the ﬁling that we will make in the ﬁrst quarter, early ﬁrst quarter, will be primarily driven by the the capital investment agenda that we have for the electric company, both our renewables agenda and our Grid agenda."
"Great, thank you for clarifying. And then just one quick bookkeeping question. The $70 million Tree Trim program, I believe that will be expense and included in operating results and not stripped out, right, and if so, would that be a fourth quarter item?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Dave.     Yes, it would. Yeah, we'd be setting up a regulatory liability and it would be, it would impact the fourth quarter as well."
Okay. So that's included in the updated 2021 guidance?,"Yes, its included in our guidance right now. And even with that $70 million, still really conﬁdent, we're going to hit the number and the upper end of that."
It just seems like yesterday when everyone was questioning NEXUS and now we're at $6 gas.,Yes. EPM is doing quite well in this environment as we expected.
"I just have one question, kind of a follow-up from one of the earlier questions. I mean, I think you talked about bill impact is minimal, it seems that DTE has a strategy with nuclear plants, coal   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   plant, gas plant, and the bill impact is minimal. Do you sense so that showing your strength of having the diversiﬁed portfolio, there may be a change in regulators supporting retiring coal earlier given it is really mitigated to bill impact?","We haven't seen that yet, Anthony; but I would say one of the things that I hear a lot in the industry that we are also considering is to keep all our options open, right. We've seen some signiﬁcant reliability impacts by retiring baseload generation and replacing it with intermittent resources. Now, we d love renewables, we obviously are a big investor, the largest investor in renewables in our state; but we also feel that reliability is paramount. So when we think about our coal plants and the conversion of those or retirement of those, we really need to think carefully how and when we do it, because the ﬁrst thing our customers want is reliable power and aﬀordable power and cleaner power. So all of those have to be balanced. So I would say, keeping our options open to ensure that we have reliable power as we make this transition is going to be extremely important and you'll see that in our IRP. We will accelerate our coal retirements in our IRP that you'll see next fall, but you'll also see careful consideration on how that's done to ensure reliable power and aﬀordable power and clean power to go with it."
"Great, thanks for taking my question. Looking forward and see you guys down at the EI.","Yeah, look forward to seeing you too.  Operator  There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Norcia, I turn the call back over to you.     Well, thank you and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll just close by saying that we're feeling really good about the remainder of 2021 as you've heard, and also have developed a very strong position for 2022. I hope you everyone has a great morning, stay healthy and safe. And I look forward to seeing all of you live at EI in November. Thank you.
