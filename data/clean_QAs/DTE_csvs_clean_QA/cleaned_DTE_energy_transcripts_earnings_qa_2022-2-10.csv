Question,Answer
"Just as we're looking at the new guidance for '22 and the longer-term EPS growth rate. You've pointed out that you're growing faster amongst peers on a trailing basis. And going forward, there's less volatility post-spin obviously. Can you elaborate on what brings you down below the 7% growth rate going forward? And maybe some of the assumptions there on plans surrounding load growth and going on contingency.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Sure, Constantine. Great question. So, as you mentioned, we've raised our guidance this year to 7% growth, and we've had a long track record of having best-in-class EPS growth in our industry. We're also for the ﬁrst time in almost three years ﬁled an electric rate case and are going to ﬁle an IRP in October. All of that will instruct our long-term capital plans, and also our long-term growth rate. So more to come on that.  Operator  Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Just wanted to start with thinking about the rate case coming up here. We're seeing some inﬂation concerns throughout much of the economy. And just how do you think about customer bill impacts in this type of environment, and also, in light of I guess recent rate case ﬁling?","Sure. Good question. I -- what I'll say is that, we've stayed out of electric rate case for almost three years at the electric company. And that was really in response to the pandemic, and making sure that we maintain aﬀordable bills for our customers. This rate case that we ﬁled is primarily about capital infrastructure. And that's investing in our grid and preparing our grid for continued climate change, as well preparing it for demand growth from our EV adoption, as well as building for a cleaner energy future. So, it's all about capital. If you look at our rate case ﬁle, you'll also see for the ﬁrst time in my memory that we ﬁled for lower operating expense, which will make us distinctive -- continue to make us distinctive in the industry."
"Got it. Thanks for that there. And then, just want to pivot towards the coal plants. And just wondering how -- realistically how far can DTE pull forward some of these retirements over   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   time, especially in Monroe here? And I guess, how do you think about the replacement capacity needs in conjunction with that?","We're certainly going to accelerate Monroe from 2040. How far we accelerated from 2040 is something we're having -- doing a lot of analysis on and having a lot of conversation with our stakeholders. But I think you can expect to see a signiﬁcant acceleration. What limited is, really, how do we ensure that there's good aﬀordability and also reliability. I mean, those are the two premises that we really need to nail here as we complete our acceleration plan to exit coal."
"Got it. Thanks for that. And then, last and if I could real quick. Just with Vantage here, it seems like RNG opportunities highlighted growth there. Just wondering if you could update us I guess on hitting targeted returns in light of -- it seems like a highly competitive environment on the RNG side. And then, just taking a step back, Vantage overall, just how -- who are that businesses, having spun the midstream business recently? Just want to see Vantage is still fully core, I guess in your mind.","So, Jeremy, the projects we're pursuing, we're still seeing high IRRs, unlevered IRRs in the mid- teens after-tax and simple case cash paybacks. So, three to ﬁve years. Going forward -- and that's all organic development. In our latest projects, actually, we're taking some of our biomass and biogas projects that we're feeding small power units and converting them to RNG. That's providing us a signiﬁcant runway for future development as well.  So, we're limiting that business as you know to 10% of our earnings growth, as well as 10% of our overall portfolio, and it really pointed at complementing our ESG agenda. From an investor perspective, 90% of our focus is really on utility growth. So I would say that's the cake, and the high cash ﬂows and high returns from Vantage, is sort of the frosting on the cake, if you will, for our investors. So, major focus on our utilities, and obviously, growing this business slowly and attracting really high returns."
"Yes. Thank you. My ﬁrst question is on -- related to the upcoming or the current rate case in Michigan. And then, thinking about the growth rate beyond '22. Obviously, I think your peer in the recent case had some rate base or capital items that were at least deferred to the next case. So when you think about the potential range of outcomes that could play out in your case and combine it with the converts happening later this year, should we still think that with the contingency that you guys have in place that 5 to 7 is a pretty good benchmark for '23 on a year-over-year basis?","So I'll just start that by saying that 5 to 7 is rock solid for us as guidance for 2023. We're working on those plans now and ﬁne-tuning those plans for 2023, and that will start to shape up. And I think you could expect us to deliver some more results next year than we've been delivering in the past. In terms of the rate case, again, it's the capital plan. We've spent a lot of time with Commission staﬀ and Commissioners themselves before we ﬁled to really create a strong understanding of the investment that we are making in the grid, why we were making the investment in the grids that we are making, and also the impact on reliability. So there's a strong understanding of what we plan to do.  And if you'll recall, last year, we ﬁled the ﬁve-year plan, 10-year plan and 15-year plan for the grid. So, we spend a lot of time socializing our plans with the Commission staﬀ and the Commissioners. So, we believe there's a strong understanding of the grid investments. And then with our renewable plans, much of it is voluntary at this point in time. So, again, that's well understood. So that in combination with the fact we've been out for almost three years, we're feeling pretty good about delivering a constructive rate case outcome."
"Understood. Thanks for the color there. My only other question is on, for this year and maybe just going forward, what's the right level of whether normal electric or gas demand growth that we should be embedding?","Dave Ruud, you want to take that one?     Sure. We continue to see really good trends across our customer classes. And so, if you look from '21 to '20, we were up overall about 3%, and what we saw as our commercial load and our industrial load really coming back to kind of mitigate any of the decreased activity we saw with the COVID. We see that little more growth continuing across commercial and industrial. Residential was still high relative to pre-COVID.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We saw -- '21 had no real change from 2020 at those higher levels. We've seen that come down a little bit recently, but we're still seeing right now residential load somewhere around 5% higher than what we would have expected pre-COVID. And we do expect that to come down and taper oﬀ this year as more people go back to work and closer to how they did before."
"So, for 2022, should I -- should we assume that something like 1% overall growth is the right number? Or is that even more conservative than that? Just relative to what you're baking into your assumptions?",Probably a little more conservative due to the residential load coming down and tapering oﬀ as the year goes on. We've had really high residential in the '21.
"Yes. Good morning, Jeﬀ. Just a, -- Jerry. Sorry. Just -- in previous slides, you have this, Dave this disclosure on earnings growth for segments. 7% to 8% for electric and then 9% for gas. Just for a model, is that still sort of how you're thinking about the growth through 2026 in those -- in the segment?","So what we see is we see higher growth in these early years. So, '22 and '23 at electric and gas that allows us to grow at 5% to 7% through the converts that come in this year, the $1.3 billion of convert. And then, it comes down to where EPS and our growth in our utilities kind of match. So, we have a little bit higher in these early years, but then as we get to the out years, you'll see EPS and earnings of our utilities closer to each other.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. And then just on the CapEx upside opportunity, Jerry, just, can you clarify one thing for me? The $35 billion, is some of that already baked into your current plan? Or is that truly all upside on the electric side?","Yes. The $35 billion, certainly, the ﬁrst ﬁve years are in our plan. The reason we put that out there is to show that we have a very large inventory of investment opportunities. And that does give us the opportunity to pull forward our investments. So, that's really the opportunity. And I think you've seen we've got a pattern of increasing investments in our ﬁve-year outlook every year that we update."
"Got it. And just a quick follow-up on that and I'll jump back into queue. Is the EVs load increase, 5% to 10%, obviously, very robust. Is that incorporated in the $35 billion number? Or will that be -- will that drive further additional CapEx in rate-based investment opportunities?","That could potentially drive incremental investment. We've assumed some level of investment, obviously, to harden our grid and prepare our grid for the future. But depending on how quickly that EV load comes on in the out years, beyond our ﬁve-year plan, it can certainly drive acceleration of investment in the grid, as well as investments in generation.  I mean, we're seeing the placement of EV manufacturing facilities in the state of Michigan. They are highly energy-intensive facilities, more so than traditional assembly plants. So, to give you an example, traditional assembly plant can consume anywhere from 20 to 25 megawatts of power. An EV assembly and battery plant, you're talking north of 70 megawatts. So it's -- these are signiﬁcant loads that will come to the state in addition to the demand just from the vehicles themselves."
"Excellent. Thank you, guys. Congratulations on the great quarter.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Thank you. So I wanted to follow up on Vantage. I think, if you look at your stock, there seems to be an imputed discount to your closest peer, which I think we all associate with, that business. And so, you keep adding new projects. The market for RNG products -- projects, like we sell, those RNG products -- project seems pretty hot still. So, if you could tell us if there is any plan to have a strategic review regarding Vantage? And if yes, what would be the potential use of proceeds? Thank you.","So, Angie, I'll start with that. I -- right now, we're seeing RNG business grow nicely. Quite modestly in terms of the overall DTE portfolio. We're generating anywhere from $7 million to $8 million a year of new net income from that business and the returns are really, really high. And as you said, the market valuation for RNG assets right now is pretty hot, right?  And so, we're constantly looking at other opportunities to continue to optimize our portfolio. And so, that's really the work that we constantly do to evaluate who values that the most, our current slate of investors or other investors. And I think you've seen we have a reputation of, if we see signiﬁcant opportunity to optimize value, we will take that move. But no plans at this current state to do that as we see continued growth and high returns and high cash ﬂows."
"Okay. And then, just going back to that notion of maintaining that 5% to 7% EPS CAGR. And I understand some deceleration of growth in operating earnings for utilities beyond '23. But do you really see yourself below 7% for -- in this sort of steady-state utility growth given all of the -- given the IRP and voluntary renewables and additional growth drivers that you've talked about?","Angie, again, I -- what I'll point to is that, and I think you've said it, we've been delivering extraordinary EPS growth results over the last decade, including last year, and even this year we're forecasting 7%. Looking forward, this is something we're examining very closely because   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   we're getting a lot of feedback from analysts and investors, what will your growth rate look like beyond 2022? And we're doing a lot of work on that.  We feel that the ﬁling of the IRP in October, as well as, we would be moving very close to the conclusion of our ﬁrst-rate case at the electric company at three years. That'll be very instructive in us laying out our long-term growth plans, as well as our long-term CapEx plans for this -- for the company. So, more to come on that Angie."
"And then, lastly, the last remaining coal plant. So, I understand the IRP ﬁling is in October, but is the assumption that at least some of this capacity would be replaced by a gas-ﬁred plant?","I would say that, yes, is the short answer. We will need dispatchable generation. And so, you will see gas in our plant. You'll also see an extraordinary amount of renewables. You'll see battery storage in that plant. And you'll also see demand response initiatives. So you'll see many initiatives to replace that coal-ﬁred generation. So, gas will be part of it. We are also looking very closely at enabling any new gas facilities that we install or propose that it will have carbon capture and storage capability, as well as the ability to burn hydrogen."
"Hey. Good morning. It's Darius on for Julien here. Reminding us how you're tracking against the 16% of the FFO to debt target, and when do you expect to achieve that?","In '21, we were a little bit higher than that because we still had the cash ﬂows from DTM in there for part of the year, but we'll be getting to that 16% in '22 and going forward."
"Hey, Jerry. So. Just wanted to quickly circle back to the discussion on potentially pulling forward some of these coal plant shutdowns. Is there a possibility for fuel switching as well for replacement?","There is, and actually at the Belle River Power Plant, which we pull forward to 2028. In our ﬁling with the EPA and other agencies, we indicated that we would be using the Belle River Power Plant, which is about 1,200 megawatts of coal right now as a gas peaker. So there is that opportunity. And we view that as favorable for our customers because, one, it provides a reliability source. And secondly, it allows the continued depreciation in the plant for longer than -- well beyond 2028. And I think at Monroe, we're examining similar opportunities for either fuel switching or voltage support on the grid, as well as using some of the existing infrastructures. We have to put some baseload gas down there."
"That's great. Thanks. And then my other question was, so you guys continue to add to this voluntary renewables program. Just wanted to get a sense of how you're doing on some of the projects associated with that demand? What's embedded in 2022 in terms of new wind or solar farms being added? And are you seeing any delays or pressures related to supply chain or inﬂation there?","So we have 1,000 megawatts that's signed and underway from a construction perspective. And then, we have another 1,300 megawatts that are in advanced stages of negotiation. And so, we're in really good shape on the demand side. On the supply side, we've got all of our '22 and '23 resources, physical resources lined up for that, whether it's solar panels or wind turbines. So   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   we're in really good shape there. We have seen some supply chain stress, if you will, but that's beyond the timeframe that we're securing assets for right now.  Dave Ruud, I don't know if you had other comments you want to add?     Yes. And even for our future builds, we're seeing the supply chain constraint to ease up now. So, we're going to be ﬁne getting those two. Pricing may be a little higher than what it was a few years ago, but it's going to be consistent with the rest of the market and also good for customers' bill too."
"First question is on the 2022 guidance. I see that you've up the forecast for each of the three major segments. What's driving that? Is it individual business-speciﬁc factors, or general cost controls, or maybe simply removing some conservatism?","Dave?     Yes. Really, it was the latter. As we ended the year and we looked at our plans, we just gained even more conﬁdence in each of the businesses and where we could come out. And we were   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   able to bring up the bottom end of those.     Also we're seeing --"
"Great. Very good. Then, my other question is, can you elaborate on your commitment to helping vulnerable customers in winter months? What exactly is that? And what -- how are these programs may be diﬀerent from your typical low-income assistance programs?","One of the most impactful programs that we have, Andrew, is, our low-income self-suﬃciency plan. Something that we develop (inaudible) customers' income levels. And then apply a credit to their bills using federal funding and also some value that comes from our rate (Technical Diﬃculty) $75 a month or $50 a month depending on what they can aﬀord and the balance of that payment comes from (Technical Diﬃculty) the year in terms of federal and state assistance to our customers. So that helps our customers keep their heat-on and their lights on through the winter months, and it also creates a sense of dignity for our customers because they're also paying in for a portion of the bill. So that's the most unique program that we have."
"Yes. Hi. So, on the RNG technology, I'm just curious if this technology at this point is pretty, I guess mature? Or are you still seeing potential for price improvements there that will potentially drive the -- pretty much going to be stable at the level where we're at based on what technology is doing?","Sophie, we saw some technology improvements over the last couple of years that drove costs signiﬁcantly down in this arena, and we've adopted that technology for several of our projects in Wisconsin, and even in, we're considering it in the Dakotas. So, we have seen technology price movement. We have not seen anything recently, but it has helped with boosting our returns beyond our expectations by adopting some of this technology."
"Got it. And then, I also have a question on the EVs. And this is I think one of the ﬁrst times when you start talking about the potential impacts of the EVs on road and we begin hearing more about the EV penetration in general. I'm just curious if you -- how do you see your particular territory adopting? How do you see the speed of adoption in your particular territory I guess? I get it that the auto manufacturers out there, but the territory is not particularly aﬄuent or high penetration of renewables. So, should we expect Michigan to be at the forefront of the adoption of EVs? Or maybe elaborate in that aspect, like how should we think about that?","We see signiﬁcant adoption potential here in the state of Michigan. I think as you mentioned, with our voluntary renewables, there is a strong desire to green the environment. And we're seeing that with many customers, the large institutional customers, as well as also residential customers. So, EV adoption is something we've also started to see a ramp up in the state of Michigan, it's still quite small. Last year -- actually in 2020, we were seeing maybe several hundred a month, now we're getting close to 500 to 1,000 a month of EV attachments to our system, and that's signiﬁcant. So, we'll see a continued ramp there as new models are introduced. So, there is the ability to see the adoption and we expect it to happen."
"A quick follow-up on the EV topic. You talked about the 5% to 7%, I understand that the head of volume load, I am just checking if that's correct. Any -- can you comment on what you think it might do to peak load as you start to sort of think about rate design following this demand?","Sure. That's a good consideration. What we're seeing right now is that, most of the EV adoption, people are charging at home. And all of the feedback that we're getting from the OEMs, from the large autos here in Detroit is that the customer preference -- 80% of the customer preference at this point in time is to charge their EVs at home. There's a lot of convenience in being able to do that. And most of that will happen in evening, so that's beneﬁcial to our grid.  So we see the early adoption of EVs being very beneﬁcial to us because it won't require a lot of investment. So in the early years, the adoption -- the EV adoption would be quite good for our load and our margins, and also help support much of the grid investments we need to make for the future. As you get deeper in the EV adoption, I think you'll start to see a signiﬁcant amount of investment required in a grid to support usage throughout the day."
"Great. And what is your assumption on penetration, Jerry, just behind that number you shared with us today?","Dave, do you have any thoughts on that?     I don't have the penetration number, but we can get back to you guys on that.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Hopefully just a couple quick ones. I think in one of the earlier questions, you talked about maybe the growth rate. And I don't know if you use the word review here looking at it. When does the -- when you believe you'll be done with that review, is it you're going to wait for the rate case in IRP to play out? Or is that something that you think may conclude sooner?","At this point, Anthony, we are thinking it's going to be at the time that we -- in and around the time that we ﬁle our IRP, we'll have a lot of our long-term growth plans, especially as we think about replacing our generation ﬂeet laid out. And that's the current timing that we're thinking about."
"Great. And then on the IRP, I believe in Michigan when you ﬁle it and you talked about maybe on the rate case you had a lot of -- before the ﬁling you met with a lot of policymakers and   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   maybe get support. On the IRP, have you begun that dialogue and has there been any particular issues that maybe require more discussion than others?","We have begun that dialogue with many stakeholders as it relates to our IRP. And the dialogue ranges from strong support around what we're planning to do, as well as you would expect people asking us to accelerate. So, we view that as all positive and constructive, and it will help us build a really solid IRP that we'll ﬁle in October."
"Great. And then my last question. I think some of the earlier questions really are focused on maybe on the 5% to 7% growth rate you've given out, maybe on the higher end. But if I could ﬂip the question like, what do you see that would cause you to be at the lower end of that range? Like what -- not that I'm hoping that happens, but just what do you have to say operationally or something that may be where we should be focused on that 5% of the range?","As you know, Anthony, we've never even come close to delivering on the lower end of that range. I think if you look at our track record, we've been at the top end of our range pretty consistently. And we strive to accomplish that each and every year. And if we don't, we would be very disappointed. So, that's our plan going forward. We aim for the midpoint, but certainly, we try to do all we can with our plans to deliver the top end of that range. And I think you're seeing that again this year. And if you look at the last decade, we've done that pretty consistently. So, it'd be a pretty remote possibility, I mean, we've weathered economic collapses, we've weathered pandemics and have delivered well above that 5% as you know."
"Yes. Absolutely. Thanks again, and the solid quarter. Thanks so much for taking my questions.",Thank you.  Operator  Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller from Morningstar. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Thank you. Two follow-ups to some of the comments you made on the 10-year plan. One, if you start to invest in the fuel switching, some of the -- one or more of the coal plants, does that eliminate the need for a new gas plant or some other new non-renewable source of generation?","While the switching coal boilers to natural gas is a good peaking resource, Travis, but not necessarily good baseload resource because of eﬃciencies. The new gas turbines, for example, they've got very low heat rates, around 7,000, whereas an old coal boiler might be up around 10,000. Meaning, just -- it just means they burn a lot more fuel to produce the same energy output. So, they're good peaking resources, but it would be -- they would be very expensive as a baseload resource. So we do see at least at this point more gas turbines in our future that would have carbon capture and hydrogen consumption capability."
"Okay. Yes. That makes sense. And then, you just mentioned it. As you look out those 10 years, and Jerry, you had mentioned long-term storage. How does that play into in terms of hydrogen, if not directly into the plants like you said right now but some other way?","Yes. Hydrogen -- I think it's a great question. And you've seen in our rate case that we ﬁled for hydrogen pilot. So, we're going to start experimenting with using hydrogen, small-scale hydrogen storage as well as hydrogen consumption in our new gas turbine, which is the Blue Water Energy Center in St. Clair County, that will go into service this summer. So, we're going to start experimenting with the use of hydrogen to see how the turbine responds, and also start to understand how to handle, and move, and store hydrogen.  Longer-term, hydrogen is a good fuel to store electric energy because it has high energy density and also its -- it can be blended with natural gas and stored in natural gas facilities up to some extent. So, we're going to start experimenting with all of that so that we can understand it more deeply. And I know some of our peers are also doing that as well."
Yes. Great. Thanks so much. I really appreciate it.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Thank you.  Operator  There are no more -- no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.     Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And I'll just close by saying that we had another strong year in 2021 as you've seen, and I'm feeling really good about delivering a strong 2022, which will position us for the future and deliver premium returns for investors, both from an EPS growth perspective, as well as a dividend growth perspective. So, hope everyone has a great morning and stays healthy and safe.  Operator  That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
