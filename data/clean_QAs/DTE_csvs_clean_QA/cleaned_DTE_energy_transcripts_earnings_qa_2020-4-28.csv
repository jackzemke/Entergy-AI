Question,Answer
"So just a couple of questions here. First, you do call out that $60 million headwind with plans to sort of oﬀset that in Slide 7. Just -- what scenario from Slide 8 are you embedding in the $60 million assumption for the year? Is it the May, is it the slow-start scenario? And does, sort of, that $60 million oﬀset get you to the midpoint of the 2020 guidance range assuming normal weather, obviously.","So great question, Shar. So I'll start by saying it does address the May start in terms of earnings impacts from sales reductions. So the $60 million is just to go through it. Deals worth a COVID sales reduction at $30 million, the incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and also incorporates the results of the ﬁrst quarter that were driven by weather and the trust performance as well as the favorability of the non-utilities and also considers the original contingency in the plan.  So that delivers the $60 million earnings pressure that we have to go and ﬁnd and replace with further contingency development as well as we're also considering further delay, the other $20 million in our contingency development and potentially unfavorable weather in the summer and fall. So those are the things that we are building in addition to the $60 million. So we're going to build response from $60 million, in addition to that we're going to build contingency around that $60 million to address potential further degradation in sales or unfavorable weather.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. And Shar, this is Peter. And with that, the contingency build is going to be about -- it's about double that $60 million. So we understand there is uncertainty in the plan, so we're going to be developing contingency really to cover that."
"And then, just the normal weather. If we assume normal weather and summer weather does return, are you comfortable sort of with the midpoint of that earnings guidance?","Yes, we're comfortable with the midpoint and we're actually even building contingency beyond the $60 million, Shar, to accommodate things like cooler than normal weather or perhaps a warm fall."
"Perfect. And then, the detailed lean plan is targeting that $2.5 billion O&M budget. Would, sort of, those lean actions you guys guide to on Slide 9 that's embedded in the $60 million oﬀset, do you need to sort of rebuild this contingency throughout the remainder of 2020? How much of it is sort of locked down? And how much of that sort of O&M budget you expect to ﬂex as one-time? Is there any of it that could be perpetual for sort of forecasting purposes? And maybe, just a little bit more speciﬁcity. And I guess, any dollar amounts in that $2.5 billion budget you think you can collect?","Well, as Peter mentioned, our target to build the contingencies is approximately $120 million to $130 million, which is much more than the $60 million and the reason we're doing that is to ensure that we have plenty of contingency in our $60 million go-get [ph]. And the tactics that we'll be using will be delaying additional hiring, minimizing overtime, reducing our contractor and consultant spend and really deploying our people into that work as well as, Shar, we've developed deferred -- we've developed a bank of maintenance work over the years that we can now defer without sacriﬁcing safety or service.  We'll also be looking at other items such as reducing materials and support expense. Those are the big items and we've got a very detailed plan. I will tell you that, about a month ago, we saw this evolving and we started to study our load and then looking at how return-to-work could happen. We sprang into action and have built a very detailed plan at each of the operating units to go after this $120 million to $130 million of contingency built. So we're in execution shuttle at this point."
"And so are you -- you are well placed around the nature or the one-time nature, how much is sustainable?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Right, right. Right now, you'll -- where most of these are -- majority of these are going to be one- time in nature. We know we got the bridge between rate cases and we plan on ﬁling another case in summer. So -- and with a 10-month process we know will get trued up on sales then. Not to say that as we do these, is there new eﬃciencies and productivity that make more sustainable and we deﬁnitely would like to do that, that provide more headroom for capital investment."
"Terriﬁc. And then just lastly on sort of the equity. I mean, you obviously mentioned in the slides you're at the low end of guidance in 2020. How do we sort of think about equity needs in '21. Does that increase the equity needs in '21? The reason why I say that there was obviously some - - little bit of credit rating pressure in recent months with DTE and I think agencies are somewhat not comfortable with the level of the midstream exposure. What do you sort of need to do to oﬀset the concerns there? Do you need more equity down the line? So how do we sort of think about the equity guide beyond 2020?","Yeah, Shar I'll take those [ph]. It's Peter again. First on the rating agencies, we had a recent action by Fitch, which was anticipated. We have a strong investment credit rating across all the agencies now. They're all at the same level with a cushion with them all. Our plan is not actually to use that cushion. We really want to keep a strong balance sheet as we move into these are more uncertain times.  So we are driving to the low-end of the targeted range and we have a $1 million to $300 million range here in 2020 and that's not going to be deferring equity into next year. It's really going to be based on the strength of cash and the balance sheet for this year. And we do have some plans. I mean, we talked about the earnings contingency we're building. We're also looking at cash as well. And because we're now, we would like to, where we can, minimize the equity for this year."
"Hey. Just to be clear, I just want to make sure the guidance does hold up under the slow start scenario? I want to make sure I'm clear on that. And also, what is the monthly degradation rates for the summer under the slow start scenario, assuming things drag on?","So I guess the answer to the ﬁrst question, Michael, is yes. The guidance does hold up under the slow start scenario. We've modeled that way and we've also modeled our contingency build that way. So we're comfortable that the plan that we have today can deliver under the May start and the slow start.  We've given the annual impact on Slide 8 from sales reductions. We really haven't -- we've modeled -- we've got various scenarios and a band of scenarios that get you between the May start and slow start scenario on a monthly basis, but we haven't laid that out here."
And how much of that $120 million to $130 million contingency that you're planning on is coming from capex postponements versus opex cuts?,"Our -- we're maintaining our capital guidance. So we basically pause some of our capital projects, as you can imagine, due to the shelter-at-home order from the Governor, but we're resuming our construction activity here in May and we plan to catch up on our capital investments and deliver on our capital guidance for the year."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   And is there -- has the IRP -- the new, the reﬁled IRP and also the one, the new our renewable plan. Has any of that changed any of the capex forecast going forward?","It has not changed the capex plan going forward. As a matter of fact, the IRP recently got approved and we ﬁled our contracts associated with our renewables plan. We expect approvals of that in July. We feel good about that as well. And that's both the self-build and some amount of PPAs."
"And just to conﬁrm, it sounds like things are moving along pretty well for Gas Storage and Pipeline business, but just want to conﬁrm that in the Haynesville especially, that the current forward curve of gas which is building, is supportive of growth (Technical Issues) producers and your customer -- your producer customers. The long-term growth plans are supported by the forward curves.","Yeah, the positive for the pipeline and storage business in the ﬁrst quarter is that it's delivered better than plan for the ﬁrst quarter. And so that's been a positive start to the year. And I think if you look at Slide 29 and talk about the price complex in the gas business, you see that the reason that the price complex is being inﬂuenced in a positive way is that the associated gas at the front-end of that dispatch curve is expected to decline in terms of production volumes and what that does is it starts to -- on that cost curve starts to slide you right in order just to replace supply that's slowing today.  So the price -- pricing that's in the market today and what our producers are hedged at is well to the right of where our resources dispatch. So you can see, for example, the blue is our Haynesville assets. As you can see, they're at the very front of the dry gas dispatch curve, well within the current price complex for both 2020, '21 and '22. So we're feeling that our resources that we ship on our pipelines are extremely well-positioned in all our basins that we operate in."
"Hey, good morning. Absolutely. So okay, let's do a cleanup by following some of these questions here. So if I can go back to the ongoing nature of the cost reductions that you just alluded to or just talking about that in ways [ph], how do you think about balancing the ongoing elements of this cost reduction relative to rate increases and how that frames your future capex spending, given what that implies for rate increases? So I know that applies more holistically to the industry, but since we're speciﬁcally talking about cost reduction today and what the shape of that looks like, can you speak to that a little bit? And especially in the context of -- it seems like you all are very speciﬁcally conﬁdent about being able to cash up on your contemplated capex in '20 despite some of the hurdles here, which is impressive. So just want to talk about the other side, about that, on recovery, etc.","Sure. As it relates to cost, Julien, I think you know that we've got a long track record of managing our costs to our customers and also managing rates and bills at rates less than inﬂation over a great number of years and we will continue with that. This event has presented a unique challenge where we have to pursue some one-time items to reduce cost. But like Peter said, we will have the opportunity perhaps as we go forward here to persist with some of those cost reductions and if that happens, what that will do is it will provide more headroom in our investment plans.  I think we've mentioned before that we've got $2 billion of capital sitting on the sidelines, looking for aﬀordability headroom. Well, I think this event may provide the opportunity to bring some of that in as we go forward. But the ﬁrst thing we need to do is secure this year and as we look forward, we'll look to see if some of these cost reductions provide an opportunity for us."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay, fair enough. And then, turning to the other side of the business here, on the non-rec side. Can you talk to what the implications of higher gas prices are? And I know you've already done that so or thus far in the conversation, can you speak speciﬁcally to incremental opportunities? Right. So I suppose the perception is that this is largely de-risking to counterparties, etc. And how does this potentially accrue to your trajectory in that business altogether when you think about it?","Well, we're seeing that most of our -- most of our growth, Julien, in the pipeline business has been contracted over the next three years, but we are seeing a lot of action in the Haynesville where small projects that are starting to emerge. The fact that we will have a pipeline that can move signiﬁcant volumes from north to south and could be doubled in capacity very economically, that's also starting to show signs of promise in terms of opportunity.  So too early to tell, since we're new in that basin. But I think we're starting to see some really positive movement and potential growth there, and they will be small projects with very high IRRs, so very accretive. We've also seen movement on NEXUS, we're seeing some very positive movement there with customers showing interest and also value, valuing up -- the value of that pipeline, valuing up in the short-term markets and even the medium-term markets and even our Bluestone asset, which is mature, we're starting to see some activity there as well. So I think it's positive that the price complex is moving in the right direction and I think it will help to propel some of our developments."
"Just quick question, just -- you mentioned both GS&P and P&I were ahead of plan in the ﬁrst quarter. Can you be a bit more speciﬁc on what drove that variability versus plan?","Well, the ahead of -- the pipeline and storage, which is ahead of plan, primarily due to favorable volumes in all our platforms, our ﬁrst [ph] platforms as well as our gathering pipelines, and so we're seeing favorability there in that regard. And P&I was primarily driven by the new projects that we brought online are showing some favorability."
"And given the nature of those areas, curious just what's the source of variability there?","I would say that the pipeline favorability, unless there is other events that undue that for the balance of the year, we plan to hold on to that favorability for the balance of the year at great contingency in the plan. We're not completely counting on that, Jonathan, so we're building contingency in and around both the pipeline business and the P&I business in order to have the conservative outcome for the balance of the year. So we've got approximately about $30 million of favorability in the ﬁrst quarter for our non-utilities and we're not going to count on all of that for the balance of the year and build some contingency around that $30 million."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just to the assumption you have around residential sales -- well, actually before that, are you making any -- what are you assuming around natural gas? And how signiﬁcant is that to your contingency plan for the current situation? Or are you primarily focused on weakness in electric sales?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Well, our -- in the pipe -- you're talking about the natural gas utility, Jonathan?"
"Can you just help us sort of bridge to how you have conﬁdence that, that number is, I guess, as high for the year as a whole, when you're assuming that we kind of -- it will have eﬀectively been a month or two at home and then, starting to kind of move back.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Sure. We are very close to the plans that the state is developing in terms of return-to-work and so we have a pretty good understanding as to when oﬃce workers will return-to-work as well as when industrial workers will return-to-work. So we understand that schedule that's being planned and obviously, we've modeled scenarios around those return-to-work plans both a May start scenario as we call it and a slow start.  And so, what we do is we migrate our residential sales from 10% to 11% higher than planned here in April and part of May and then we slowly start to drift that down back towards normal by the end of the year with the milestones embedded in the plan that we are aware from the state."
"So ﬁrst question, I just want to clarify the $30 million to $50 million potential impacts from COVID. Does that mean $30 million would be the May start scenario and $50 million would be the slow start? Or is that just kind of the range for the May scenario?",$30 million is the sales impact for the May start scenario and $50 million is the sales impact with a slower start scenario.
"Okay, great. Just wanted to be clear on that. And in terms of the contingency, can you compare the $120 million to a $130 million to what you were able to cut in '08, '09, if you had the memory to get that back that far?","While, it's similar, we targeted back in '08 and '09, a $150 million but that was pre-tax. So this is a $120 million to $130 million after tax, but we are a much larger company at this point in time and have a much larger base to pursue."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay, great. Then on the IRP, congrats on getting the modiﬁed version approved. Can you remind us and walk us through the changes you made, particularly on the self-build generation side? And what would happen if the economic downturn is deeper and longer-lasting? Is there a risk to the plan to add a lot of generation capacity?","Well, we are actually ahead of the plan on our voluntary renewables, we had planned to sign up about 600 megawatts over the next three or four years and I'm happy to report with the most recent announcement just weeks ago from General Motors to sign up for another 250 megawatts of voluntary renewables, that we were actually at 650 megawatts of sold against the target of 600, which was a three or four-year target. So we're well ahead of plan on this and so, that's quite exciting and we continue to market the product. Obviously, our marketing eﬀorts and sales eﬀorts have slowed a bit here, but we plan to resume that in summer. A great amount of interest in this product from both our industrial customers as well as our commercial and residential customers.  In terms of what we ﬁled for self-build, we ﬁled 225 megawatts of self-build, which is a wind park and also we signed some PPAs for solar to meet our 15% requirement. That's our RPS requirement for here in Michigan of 15% by 2021, that's what they -- it will ﬁll that requirement. The 650 megawatts of voluntary, we had 400 of that approved last year. And so, this summer we will be pursuing 250 megawatt ﬁling with some self-build -- with a lot of self-build and some PPAs."
"Okay, great. And then lastly, just to be abundantly clear, can you describe do you have any appetite for potential additional midstream M&A given the turmoil in that space?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We've essentially, what I would say, ﬁlled the order book for acquisitions in the pipeline space. We are in the process now of really digesting what we own. We acquired the Haynsville asset, we've got the Link asset and we have NEXUS. Those are all sort of new platforms, if you will, and we're going to pursue highly accretive and high return expansions and organic developments in and around those platforms. That's our plan right now."
"The April data that you provided, do you have just like overall sales when you net for the company for that?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yeah. The total -- this is Peter. Yeah, the total load was down 16% to 18%."
And then I think there were some talk in the CMS call yesterday that there could be a cost oﬀset to the deferral though. Could you talk about that at all? Is that something you need to monitor?,"Sure.     Yeah, the...     The commissioning indicated that they would consider extraordinary cost related to this pandemic. Things like cost to sequester employees in hotels, cost for a home reserve workforce and also cost for incremental PPE. So they have asked us to make a ﬁling to take all of those   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   costs into consideration. So there'll be a case for future, something that we'll have to look for in the future.     Yes, Steve, that suﬀered from the uncollectible, the uncollectible kind of stand stand alone they're asking for comments now on around potential deferment of real direct COVID-related costs."
"Okay. And last question is, just -- it's hard to compare exactly, but it does seem like your sales sensitivity is a little bit less than then CMS sale sensitivity, do you have any way to kind of maybe better explain that? Do you have higher ﬁxed charges maybe or some other component there?","Peter, any thoughts on that?     Yeah, one of the things that's embedded in here and I know we've had some questions on the residential. The residential increase, we're saying, is 3% to 4%, obviously less than the commercial, industrial down but 1% change in residential about $15 million positive for us and it's about 2.5 times commercial and 15 times industrial. So I think we have done a really detailed job of forcasting out for the whole year, the residential. And we did see residential up even in the ﬁrst quarter 2%, it really related to that March shelter in place. So I think that's some of the diﬀerence and as it that's also a diﬀerence back in 2008 and '09 we had a housing crisis back then, we did see residential decline. So that's -- it really is oﬀsetting and the overall load reduction, even though we're down 68% the residential is really helping to net some of that exposure down."
What are you seeing -- or what's your EBITDA and capex for the midstream business this quarter and where do you see the favorable variance in terms of which asset?,"Well, the -- I'll start with the -- where we saw the variability. We saw it across all platforms. We saw positive movement, as I mentioned in our Haynesville platform as well as our NEXUS platform and Vector platform, which go together as well as our Bluestone assets and Millennium assets. So we -- again, it was across all platforms. In terms of the EBITDA for the ﬁrst quarter Peter, is that something that you have handy?     Yeah, we don't -- we haven't broken that out yet. As you know, we've recently introduced this EBITDA overall for the year, but it's -- there is proportional to the earnings, I'd say, so we did see some EBITDA increase as well along with those earnings. Or maybe something in the future that's going to..."
"Okay, great. Okay, great. Appreciate it. And then recognizing your Haynesville contract structure, are you and your customers considering a mutually beneﬁcial delay to the expansion that's expected for next quarter?",We are not. The construction in that pipeline is progressing on plan and actually our customers are very excited to start shipping gas on that pipeline. So none of those conversations are happening.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And then just to follow-up on the bad debt expense, is there any data points that you could point us to that you've noticed?","It's modest, the uptick. So we're watching it daily, right. We have to watch daily and I would not say that is pressuring UCX at the moment. But then again, we're not early in the aging buckets. As you know, the more the accounts age, the higher the reserve. So we're early in that and do expect some pressure there. But we have an accounting order that diﬀers that expense and it gives us the opportunity to recover in the future rate cases."
Okay. And then in midterm you mentioned that you can't -- you're not disclosing the quarter EBITDA. Are you able to share the capex spend for the quarter?,"Peter?     Yes, we have not provided that and that may be something, I got Barb on the line, you can see we have, we can those public documents that potentially we can point you to to give you that number.     We did provide the non-utility capex of $338 million for the quarter.     Yeah, in totality we did."
"On the, kind of -- good morning, yeah. On the customer non-payments, potentially right and I know it's been deferred for -- from account in order and it looks like you can recover that cash quite quickly because of your cadence of rate cases, but just give us something that we shouldn't be concerned as far as balance sheet pressures as a result of that or is it something that you looking into?","Well, we've modeled the cash that comes along with higher arrears to bad debt expense and our corresponding actions to respond to that pressures involve a lot of cash actions. So we believe that the oﬀsets will come through our cash initiatives and earnings initiatives. Most of our earnings initiatives are cash initiatives as well. So that $120 million that we're targeting will oﬀset any pressure that we may see from arrears.     Yeah. And this Peter, and I guess, Sophie, just to add to that, we are seeing that in those package some cash upside for us. The tech AMT is going to be accelerated. If you recall back in 2018 AMT has eliminated with a three year refund for us and I guess it's related to two years. So I -- just one example that's about $75 million availability. So we're going to continue to look for opportunities on the cash side as well and we are modeling both earnings and cash with uncollectible separate and our goal would be to oﬀset that cash impact."
"Got it. Of those things that you realized this year that one-time that you're talking about, how much of that could be kind of stick in and being run rate going forward as opposed to just being a one-time going lean and then going back to some base line?","Well, that's a great question, because we've had the same discussion in '08 and '09 when we started a similar initiative. What's started out as one-time items over time, we were able to convert some portion of that into permanent cost reductions, which of course, creates a beneﬁt for our customers and with our aging infrastructure, it gives us headroom to invest without creating aﬀordability pressure for our customers. So I view it as a positive over time, but it's hard   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   to quantify right now, because we're early in some of these one-time items. But our goal will be to try and use this opportunity to create headroom in the future."
"Got it. And the last one for me, maybe given the topography of your gas network in the Marcellus, is there any incentive at all for some of your oﬀ-takers to potentially reject their contracts with you guys in favor of maybe other routes to market, if they were to become ﬁnancially distressed or proactively seeking some kind of relief?","Well, we've looked at that very closely, especially when the gas complex was heavily pressured from a price perspective. What we look at is obviously a lot of the -- of our customers are captive to our system because of the infrastructure. The infrastructure is hard to reproduce to deliver, to source and deliver the gas to locations that are being sourced and delivered to, so that's one. Two, we also look at the competitive nature of our contracts in terms of pricing and we're very competitive with all our contracts. Three, our contract structure is very strong and has strong credit provisions in it as well."
Just going back to the IRP and speciﬁcally kind of the RFP result that you guys laid out there. I know you touched upon this a little bit when you were talking about the wind that you're going to self-build and own in the solar which is going to have more PPAs. I was just hoping you could maybe walk us through kind of how you see DTE's competitive position compared to other bidders when it comes to wind versus solar?,"Sure. So we were in this most recent ﬁling, which was a compliance ﬁling to meet our renewable standard in 2021, we're very competitive with our wind resources. And so that we had that project well developed, it was a self-build and we actually developed it from scratch. So that was a very competitive project. We also layered in some solar PPAs that were very competitive. So basically, what we did is, what was right for our customers, we oﬀered the most competitive product both a combination of self-build and solar. In the future, we will likely be focused on solar. And at this point, we feel really good that we can be competitive with self-build, but we'll also introduce PPAs where it's beneﬁcial to our customers. We will always do what's right for our customers in the long-term and that -- so far that is supporting our capital plans in this space and overall."
"Okay, that makes sense. And turning over to the voluntary commitments, as you mentioned earlier, you've already kind of sourced the 600 or so megawatts by the early 2020s, which is what you've been showing in your slide deck. I think when I went through the IRP, I saw through 2024, it was more of a 790 megawatt kind of expectation number, would that be upside to the capital plan you kind of outline for us or is the closer to 800 megawatt number for the voluntary segment, what you guys are embedding? Or is that upside in the capital budget?","I believe there could be upside in this space simply because we had plan to sell 600 megawatts in three years and we're at 650 sold now in the ﬁrst year. So we seem to be selling the product faster then we expected. Now, well that -- whether or not that continues, remains to be seen, but there is tremendous interest in this product. Even at a residential level, we've sold 10,000 contracts already for this product and we're also targeting smaller commercial and industrial customers who may have an interest in this space, but certainly, I would say there is the wins in our sales on this one. There is a great desire for this type of product in our communities."
And do you have more ﬂexibility on that to pretty much -- is it guaranteed that it's more self- build on the voluntary side or do you go through a similar RFP process that was outlined in the past?,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We're going to go through a similar RFP process. And obviously we want to compete and build as much as we can. But there are times when other developers can oﬀer as competitive of a product as we can oﬀer and we'll take those as well. But we certainly target to build as much of it as we can. But then we have to be realistic and know that there are others that perhaps have small advantages that we'd like to take advantage of for our customers.
"No losses this year, yeah. Just most of my questions have been answered. If I could just jump to I guess your GSP assets, speciﬁcally on -- in the eastern region. There have been multiple delays on getting other pipes build over in the East Coast. Have you seen any increase in customers looking to subscribe to any of your assets on the East Coast? And if you want to opine, do you think those assets get built anymore, I guess, any more assets get built on the East Coast?","Well, let me start with our assets, Anthony. We are seeing more activity on all our assets. We've actually seen some nice favorable movement on pricing in NEXUS as well as interest levels, but primarily interest level on NEXUS has been demand pull. Initially the pipe was built with a combination of supply push and demand pull producers putting gas into the pipe under long- term contracts, and then, of course, LDCs pulling it up the other end under long-term contracts.  We're starting to see a lot -- few more LDC show up and running some contracts as well as some power plants along the road and industrial customers that we connected to NEXUS. So that all of that has been quite positive. In terms of the pipelines going to East Coast, it really remains to be seen, it's been a long time and then getting their approvals. And I believe that some of it -- some of that infrastructure would get built. I'm not sure, but all of it will be built. But I think that is all positive for us in terms of how that may play out over time, whether it's just delay or perhaps some of the infrastructure doesn't get built."
Thanks for taking my question. And I hope everybody stays healthy.,"Thank you.     Thanks, Anthony.     We too. And same to you Anthony.
