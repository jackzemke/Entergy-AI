Question,Answer
"Hey -- hey maybe you could go through some of the highest priorities you're going to have with the electric ﬁling, as it comes up eventually. And what would be the focus of that -- that rate ﬁling?","Sure. The primary focus will be our capital investment plan, continuing to build out, modernize our electric grid. So our investments in the wires business will be front and center in that ﬁling, along with continued investment in clean generation. And of course, typical capital investments to maintain the system in good working order. So those would be the -- the key priorities."
"Right. And along those same lines, as you maintain the 5% to 7% growth rate -- growth rate going forward, what is the -- where do you think the most of that backﬁll will come from -- from the elimination of the GT&S segment considering if that was a pretty high growth segment contributing.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. I think, as we've shown in our -- in our growth plans at EEI, we have a very large backlog of capital infrastructure that needs to be deployed both in our electric business and gas business. And then our P&I segment is obviously focused on renewable natural gas and cogeneration that will drive a nice growth proﬁle there. So overall, based on the large inventory of capital that we need to deploy on behalf of our customers, we -- we see a very good strong growth rate for DTE post spin of 5% to 7% EPS growth."
"Okay. Is that driven just by better results, more cash ﬂow or --",Yeah. We had really strong cash ﬂow in 2020 that positioned us even better.
"Okay. It's not -- it's not a reﬂection of rating agency, more, more laxness, I guess in your credit rating targets (Multiple Speakers).   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, you can -- you -- well, you can also see that we have in -- on one of the slides that we were targeting 18% FFO to debt prior to the spin. But we have talked to the rating agencies, and this spin will be credit enhancing for the company. And so we're able to reposition that 18% to a 16% FFO to debt and still be in a consistent place on our ratings and our positions there."
Is -- is that a driver of being at the low end now of equity needs or is it mostly just about having more cash ﬂow than you expected?,"When we talked at EEI, this was part of how we were able to be -- to be at the lower end of our equity needs or to lower our equity needs. But now this additional cash push us down to the lower end of that."
(Multiple Speaker). Okay. All right. That's all I got. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
"Just wanted to start oﬀ on the Midstream side if I could here. And just want to see if the -- the frigid temperatures that have been coming through the nation, if that, kind of impacts some of your -- your operations there as far as ﬂows that you might be seeing or even if I guess, maybe higher gas prices might inﬂuence producer activity. Just trying to think through the diﬀerent -- diﬀerent ramiﬁcations of what we've seen this past week?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","So I'll start by saying that our assets operated quite well across all of our platforms. Some of our customers in our Southern platform had issues, but perhaps I'll let David Slater to describe that a little more detail.     Sure. Thanks, Jeremy for the question. And that's very topical given it's on the news everyday. So yeah, ﬁrst oﬀ, our Midstream assets performed really well. I'm proud of the operating team in the ﬁeld. They -- they saw that weather coming in and started to take actions in advance to that to make sure system operated reliably. So it has.  We have seen from a customer producer perspective, well freeze-oﬀs and it's really driven by an extended period of very frigid weather in the Louisiana Texas area, and that over time, it does aﬀect production. That said, it looks like the whether is breaking today and tomorrow. And we expect that those -- those volumes will come back online over the weekend and into the beginning of next week. So there has been a short term production reduction that occurred and -- but it's going to be bouncing back fairly quickly."
Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the volatility in the market there wondering if that could create opportunities on the Energy Trading side that could -- could beneﬁt you in the ﬁrst quarter?,"Well, I'll say this that at our Energy Trading operations, we've got very small positions and typically were long. So we have seen some favorability that will roll through the Energy Trading business for sure."
"Got it. That -- that's helpful. Thanks. And just for [ph] Midstream, as we think about the shape of earnings across the year, you talked about growth in that business. I'm just wondering, do you see kind of a ramp across the year here or any other color you can provide as far as just the shape of Midstream earnings across the year, as we see it now.","David, do you want to take that.     Sure. I can take that. I think it should be fairly steady across the year, Jeremy. I -- I don't see any signiﬁcant lumpiness over the year. So it should be fairly steady.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it. Maybe last one on Midstream if I could here, and I'm not sure if you're in a position to discuss it much at this point. But just when you think about your Midstream business and you think about what other publicly traded comps out there, are you able to kind of provide any thoughts on how you think your business compares versus others. What you think is the closest comps?","David.     Yeah. Jeremy, when we -- when we've talked about this in the past, the two that I referenced would be Equitrans and Williams. Equitrans is similar size. They are focused in the Appalachia. We are more diversiﬁed than they are. But in terms of size and portfolio composition, we're similar to them. And then, Williams, they were larger than we are. But again, in terms of focused primarily on gas and the portfolio composition. So those are the two that we kind of point to as proxies. I believe that we're going to have a pretty strong portfolio and with a -- with a strong clean future in front of us. So we expect to trade, to have a strong multiple on our EBITDA."
"Good morning. A couple of clariﬁcations if you don't mind. Number one, with respect to what's happened here in Texas. How do you think about the energy trading impact. I just wanted to clarify the last response that indeed your book across its various exposures is intact. And then -- and then I've got a more substantive question,","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So at the highest level. Julien, as I mentioned we have small positions, but we ﬁnd ourselves typically long in those positions. So the -- the impact on commodity prices has actually provided favorable trends for our trading business certainly in the last several days."
"Okay. Excellent. Sorry. I just wanted to clarify about trading speciﬁcally. Then separately, if I can, obviously just very successful 2020. How do you think about taking some of those tailwinds and putting them into '21 here. I guess that there are a number of one time items, including cost savings in '20. But how do you think about that moving forward in '21 here, as it goes. And then if you can speak to it as well, I just noticed the cash ﬂow steps down probably again oﬀ of some one time items into '21, if you can speak to that a little bit?","So Julien, I would say that 2020 positioned us extremely well for 2021, as the year begins and progresses here we are seeing favorability and also likely trending towards the higher end or beyond the midpoint of our -- of our guidance, but still inside our guidance. So I -- I feel very positive about the year, as it's starting to progress. But more -- we'll speak more about that as the quarters progress here. But feeling really strong about how 2021 is shaping up.  Dave Ruud, do you want to add some thoughts on the cash ﬂows or earnings for this year.     Yeah. Sure. You're exactly, right, Julien. 2020 was a really good year for cash for us, primarily driven by strong performance in the business. But we also did have some one-time impacts from -- particularly from the CARES act, which gave us some really good favorability. So 21 -- '21 cash is lower than 2020 as we adjust for those one time things that -- that won't repeat. But it's still -- we feel a good solid cash here for 2021 too."
Just to -- just to (inaudible) going back on equity just for a second. Isn't the low end of the range excluding the unit zero? I just -- maybe I'm really slow on that. I just want to --,"Yeah. The low end -- the low end, yeah the low end there is zero. And we're just in case, there were some internal equity issuances or something we're just saying here the low end. But we -- we don't see a need for much equity issuance at all beyond the converts over the next three years?     Yeah. That's what I was hearing, but just wanted to clarify, and thank you. And then, just -- just to follow-up on the question of sort of seasonality around Midstream. Yeah,it looked like the fourth quarter and to [ph] step back to the 72 million range, which is kind of where it was in Q1 and Q2, and then just had this really big third quarter over 100. I mean, are we saying that -- that was an anomaly in 2020 and then we should just have much more of -- because your kind of -- your guidance would seem to point to the 75-ish each -- each quarter, if it occurs ratably. So I just wanted to maybe get reminded will happen in Q3.     David Slater?     Yeah. I'm just thinking out loud here in Q3, there may have been a few one-time items that roll through the portfolio in Q3. But -- but again, I think, as I look forward, I don't see any large bumps quarter-by-quarter right now."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good enough. And then just one ﬁnal thing on your corporate segment numbers in the fourth quarter. It looked like they -- they came in good bit better than guidance for the year. What was going on there? Did you have some conservatism or were there some onetimers [ph] or just -- maybe a little more color?,"Dave.     Yeah. You -- you nailed it there. When we -- when we did our revised guidance on the third quarter call, we did still have some conservatism in there to protect ourselves from any other variability that would come up. And then as things played out, we did see some upside as well from one-time interest expense, interest income, and some investment returns that caused that to go higher."
"Right. Thank you. And then, if I may, just to Jerry, more sort of big picture. Is -- is there -- could you potentially look at accelerating your 2050 net zero for the electric side. And if so how would you go about it. And is that something you're starting to think about?","Jon -- we are thinking about it Jonathan. I -- we are running many scenarios right now internally understand, is there an opportunity to accelerate our retirement schedule for -- for our coal assets. As you know, we still have a very large coal operation. And currently, we've forecasted the retire of Belle River Power Plant, which is about 1,200 megawatts 2030. So we're looking at ways to accelerate that which is our ﬁrst retirement that's in our lens this decade.  And then, our Monroe Power Plant, which is a very large coal facility almost 3,000 megawatts. We're looking at ways to potentially accelerate the retirement of that up from 2040. So much more to come on that. But we are deep into that analysis, right now, and we're required to ﬁle an IRP in 2023, and we'll detail all of that then.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Okay. So you're doing [ph] -- there might be some sort of interim updates along the way. So it's kind of a long way out.,Yes. There will be interim updates along the way. We expect that.
"Hey, team, good morning. Just -- Good morning. Just one question from me. Good morning. Everything else you guys have answered. Maybe just give us any color to the extent that you can as to what to expect when you start doing these roadshows like, should we expect a -- for the Midstream business, should we expect a sort of a ﬁve year look or just in terms of how many years worth of projections. And part two of that question, how should we think about dividends. You're saying the post spin-oﬀ, the dividends are going to be higher than pre-spin that sort of suggests a materially higher growth rate for the -- versus the peers on the Midstream business right. Am I thinking about that the -- that right way?","David, do you want to take that.     Yeah, Well, I'll take it, and Dave Ruud you can -- you can ﬁll in. So maybe I'll start with the roadshow and what to expect on the roadshow. So that will be the opportunity for DT Midstream to provide guidance basically for the ﬁrst time, as a standalone company. So as we work through the debt raise and sort of lockdown a lot of variables, then I think we'll be in a position to provide more clarity and color.  Our goal is to provide best-in-class guidance in the midstream space. As you know, the midstream space, what's normal there is diﬀerent than what's normal in the utility space. So our   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   goal will be to provide as much visibility into the company and really be distinctive in that regard.  In terms of some of the details around the dividend, we're publicly communicating we'll have a two times dividend coverage ratio. We've not provided the exact number on the dividend. And again, you should expect that in the -- in the roadshow. But Dave really I don't know if you wanted to add any more color to the dividend question?     Yeah. I can -- I can explain why that looks higher in 2022 than what it would have been together in 2021. So the goal for each companies have dividend that's consistent with the best peers that we have in that industry/ And so for DTE, we will have a dividend consistent with the highest performing peers and consistent with where we've been, and a payout ratio that's around 60%  And then Midstream, as David mentioned, we'll have a dividend that set to a -- dividend coverage ratio of approximately two times the distributable cash ﬂow. When you put those together it does result in a higher dividend and it's -- it's really a result of that two times distributable cash ﬂow equating to a -- what would have been a higher payout ratio. So that's what makes 2022 look higher than what it -- would have been -- would have been otherwise, how the company has been together."
"Good morning, Jerry. So I was actually interested question I guess for Dave, just on both the net zero target for Midstream and also as in coming Head of INGAA. Just -- could you maybe give more of your high level view of how natural gas ﬁts in decarbonization and energy transition. You don't have to go that long. But just high level. Thank you.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Sure. Thanks, Steve. Yeah, that's a very good question and topical in the country right now. So ﬁrst oﬀ, in January, we announced a net zero by 2050 target for the Midstream business, with a milestone of getting 30% of the way there by the end of this decade. So there is -- there will be lots of actions that will take around that. But I'd say, at the very highest level, Steve, there is a signiﬁcant opportunity to decarbonize the -- the energy infrastructure that carries natural gas. Just to frame it up,, it carries about a third of the energy we consume every day in North America. So it's a massive energy distribution system.  And just as DTE has successfully decarbonized and is in our pathway to decarbonize the electric grid. I believe the same opportunity exists for the natural gas energy distribution system. So that I expect that over time that's going to take capital investments and creating the policy framework to enable those capital investments.  I think is important. So I'm kind of pivoting now to the INGAA conversation. And at INGAA, I announced two weeks ago a statement on behalf of the industry, that the industry is committed to a net zero aspiration by 2050. So there is deﬁnitely a desire to move in this direction amongst all the industry participants and work closely with the new administration and just societal requirements to move to a lower carbon footprint  So again, I think over time, this is going to create investment opportunities in the infrastructure. And I think the task before us right now is to -- we have a lot of rate technology that can be deployed quickly that's what I'll call on the shelf technology, working with the regulators to create the framework to allow that to happen across the industry broadly."
"My ﬁrst -- my ﬁrst question, I want to follow up on the cost cuts. You did a tremendous job in 2020 oﬀsetting the headwinds from the pandemic and your usual course, of constant improvement. You mentioned that it positioned you well for 2021. My question is what's your latest thinking on how much of those savings are permanent or sustainable as opposed to being one time in nature.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, I'll start, then -- then I'll turn it over to Dave Ruud. But certainly the success that we expect in 2021 is driven by some of the work that we did in 2020, as it relates to the cost reductions. And -- and then also strengthens our planned long term, as you saw at EEI we pull forward $2 billion of investments into the -- into the electric business in order to accelerate our modernization program for the electric grid. That was a result of a lot of the learnings that we experienced in 2020. Now some of those cost reductions are one-time in nature, and I'll let Dave Ruud describe some of those as well,     Yeah. You're right, Jerry. We -- as we -- as we look at the initiatives we implemented in 2020, our goal is going to be to keep as much of that going forward as we can. We consistently have through our normal processes always looking at cost. But in 2020, we did see some additional reductions. Some of those of course are one time. We had more people working capital and we had some delays in some of our work due to COVID. But some of the things will be -- will be real and will stay with us. I'm conﬁdent that we're going to ﬁnd some real eﬃciencies by how we learned to work this year and having more people work remotely. And so we're going to be able to take a lot of what we learned and roll that forward some -- somewhere in probably half of what we saw we're going to be able to look at trying to ﬁnd ways to continue that -- that on in 2021 and then continued cost savings again, as Jerry said so that we can have more room for additional capital that we need to help serve our customers."
"Okay. Perfect.So about half, I think I heard. Then on the regulatory front you've historically been an annual ﬁler, now you're staying out of rate cases for both electric and gas. Could this be something of a paradigm shift or is it a unique one time thing, given the economic challenges, so many of your customers are facing?","Well, certainly, we'll target the delay rate cases as long as we possibly can. We think that's a beneﬁt to our customers and we'll continue to look for creative ways to do that. We are exploring ways to do that right now with the commission staﬀ. So we'll -- we'll report more on that as the year progresses and that's related to our electric rate case Right now, we're targeting a May ﬁling. But we're looking at creative ways perhaps delay that even further. So more to come on that. But always working on ways to reduce the impact of our investments on our customers."
"Great. One last one, bit of a curve ball here. I'm well aware that auto isn't a huge exposure for you in terms of volume or margin. But with all the headlines around the chip shortages impacting manufacturing for the automakers and their supply chain, are you seeing any disruptions or reduced operations from those customers?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","We've not seen anything that's impactful to our -- to our earnings this year, our guidance this year. Dave Ruud any further thoughts on that.     No, I agree, Jerry. At this point we haven't seen -- haven't seen the impacts. Our -- overall our industrial load outside of a few key customers has come back really well from where it was at the low points in the pandemic.. And so we're -- we're -- have not seen those impacts yet."
"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.  Good morning. I have two -- I have two questions for you guys. First just can you discuss if we might see some creative approaches to your gas rate case like mitigation measures, similar to what you have done recently in electric or should we expect the gas case to be fairly straightforward?","Yeah. At this point in time, we expect our gas rate case to be pretty straightforward. It's really about our main replacement program and our meter newbuild [ph] program. So it's really all about infrastructure renewal. So we expect it to be pretty straightforward."
"Got it. Thank you. And Secondly, a little bit of a high level question. With this situation in Texas, right and the failure of basically electric heating right when (inaudible) electricity, the natural [ph] grid failed or generators failed and people couldn't heat their homes. Do you see that dynamic can aﬀect in the conversation of around building electriﬁcation and sort of the gas utilities and their roles in the infrastructure mix moving forward?","Well, certainly, I expect the conversation to be around and making sure that there is enough base load generation and a well functioning capacity market in certain deregulated markets.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   What I will say about Michigan is that we're highly regulated market here, and such that you can allow for good planning, good, long-term planning and making sure that we have reliable sources of generation. So I feel really good about our position in Michigan. I think in deregulated states, there probably would be a pretty robust conversation about the suitability of capacity markets."
"Hey, Jeﬀ, congratulation on the new position also well deserved. I guess my ﬁrst question maybe follows a little oﬀ of some of the previous questions. I guess it's related to your gas utility. And I don't know, if Michigan has experienced a volatility in natural gas prices than other parts of the Midwest fab [ph]. But I just want to know if -- with that volatility or if you've experienced it, how does it impact customer bills. I mean, is there a chance customer bills could really ramp up because of the high cost of gas or it's just DTE have storage or is that kind of sit on your balance sheet and defer it for the future rate case? And then I have a follow-up.","Sure. Great question, Anthony. So I'll -- ﬁrst I'll say that the volatility in Michigan was much more muted than it was in the rest of the country. So that's one. Two, our gas utility when it enters the winter is usually 95% ﬁxed already in terms of price. And then for the prompt year, it's about 50%, and then the third year 25%. So we have a good hedging program, if you will for   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   commodity prices. So this volatility even though was muted in Michigan, we'll have -- I would say negligible impacts on our -- on our customers."
"Great. And then, I guess the follow-up is a little oﬀ of Sophie's question earlier. Just I think we've talked about natural gas as maybe a bridge fuel or review diﬀerent thing to describe it, we talked about maybe cold weather LDCs get treated diﬀerently, but I guess, that's all through the investing community. I'm just curious when you talk to regulators or policymakers in your state do they share the same view as this or how do they view gas, I guess. I'll leave it at that.","Well, I'll say this, when we speak to legislators and regulators in the State of Michigan, they view gas as fundamental to our energy future and to our current status. It was minus 5 degree here in Detroit couple of days ago. And I got to tell you when it's minus 5 degrees, I think there is a very strong appreciation for our ability to deliver natural gas to homes and businesses to make sure that they stay warm and comfortable. So in cold climate, natural gas is highly valued by our customers and by our legislators and by our regulators."
Great. Great. Thanks so much. Looking forward to catching the wings game with you guys.,Thank you. Look forward to it as well.  Operator  Your next question comes from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Just a -- just a question on RNG here. I think Paul has been pretty thorough so far. But I was just wondering on your guys' perspective on how you've seen the economics kind of evolve for RNG over the past couple of years. We've seen a range of kind of companies start to announce similar projects especially as the LCFS market has tightened. So I was just wondering, if   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   competition could start to impact returns or just overall demand for low carbon technology likely outweighs this over time?","So David, we're still seeing a strong pipeline of growth opportunities. And I have not seen our unlevered IRRs being impacted by new entrants. We're still able to originate and ﬁnd really strong returning RNG projects. And I would say the simple cash feedbacks [ph] are still in the order of three years to ﬁve years."
"Okay. Thank you. And then just also thinking about what's in your guidance both on the ﬁve year and kind of the one year basis when you think about P&I's. It tends to -- I guess, similar to most of your businesses ends up being a little bit conservative. But I'm just wondering how you kind of guide around kind of the LCFS and the RFS kind of prices. Do you take more of a conservative approach or is that kind of where they currently trade.","Well, we have seen -- the LCFS has been a very stable market and well-deﬁned by the California regulators and they continue to advance interest and requirements on that space to make that market very attractive. The RFS market had a little bit of volatility the last several years. So we took a pretty conservative view of that market and continuing to do so. But we're starting to see, last year we saw more stabilization there and it was really around volume requirements, where we needed things to see things stabilize and we have started to see that. And with the new administration and leadership by the EPA, I think that, that will -- that trend will continue the stabilization and certainty of the federal markets. So it makes our RNG projects quite attractive to have a strong, stable LCFS market, as well as a stabilizing federal market,"
Okay. I always appreciate all the insights. Congrats on a good year.,"Thank you.  Operator  This concludes the time that we have for the Q&A portion of our call. And I would like to turn it back to Jerry Norcia for ﬁnal comments.     Well, look, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll just close by saying again, that I'm extremely proud of our team and how we've delivered during 2020. We are well positioned to achieve our 5% to 7% operating earnings growth target in the future. And I hope everyone has a great morning and stay healthy and safe.
