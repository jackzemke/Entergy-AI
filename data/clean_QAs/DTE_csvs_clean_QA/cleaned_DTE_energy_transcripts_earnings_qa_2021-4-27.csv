Question,Answer
"With the delay in the electric rate case, how would you say that that aﬀects what you're going to ﬁle for? I mean, is this going to result in a larger rate ﬁling than would normally be the case? Or is it basically the same case just delayed six months?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I would say it's generally the same case, Michael, delayed six months. It'll be a forward test to your result as well we'll be ﬁling for."
"Yeah. And I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more information on the RNG business. RNG has been coming up a lot lately and talks about how gas utilities might be able to reduce their carbon emissions exposure on a net basis. Do you see this -- do you see RNG business ramping up signiﬁcantly outside of the states that you're already operating in as you expand that nationally, as sites are developed?","Sure. So, maybe I'll just start by commenting on our own utility where we have -- we are essentially oﬀering a voluntary oﬀset program that will be driven both by forestry products and RNG and we may be one of the ﬁrst in the country to oﬀer that type of package to our customers and it's a very interesting oﬀering where for $4 a month, you can oﬀset about 25% of your carbon footprint as a gas customer. So, it's a unique way of packaging carbon oﬀsets through RNG as well as forestry products that deliver a lower carbon footprint for our customers. I do see that expanding across the country, Michael.  Right now most of our eﬀorts in RNG at DTE Energy and our P&I business are focused on very gas going into the California markets, which gives us very nice returns both from our renewable fuel standard as well as the -- low carbon fuel standard in California. We get -- as I've mentioned in prior calls returns where we see our simple cash payback happen in three to four years with pretty modest investments. Lots of projects in the pipeline as well going forward."
And is this -- has this come up at all in any of the Democrat's infrastructure spending plans to ramp up RNG production or maybe even expand the fuel credit to natural gas as well as biodiesel?,"I have not seen those details yet, Michael, but we are looking for them. Most of the credits seem to be targeted at wind and solar at this point in time as far as I can see, another clean sources of energy."
"Got you. And just one last question, on guidance. Guidance is unchanged even after a really nice quarter and just curious is that just part of the -- it's just early in the year at this point, you're also looking at possible lean or lean in initiatives later in the year to keep guidance --","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   What we're looking, yes, what we're looking at is, using favorability to really build strength for 2022 that's our ﬁrst goal, as well as investing customer-centric projects in '21 in order to make that happen. And as we get more visibility into the balance of the year then we'll continue to provide you updates on our next quarterly call."
"Great. Anyway, good quarter. Thanks a lot.","Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Andrew Weisel, with Scotiabank."
"My ﬁrst question is on midstream actually, are you able to isolate any ﬁnancial impacts from the extreme weather in mid-February in Texas and surrounding areas? I don't know if that impacted your Haynesville system or more broadly, any operational surprises or any counterparty risks or issues.","David Slater, do you want to take that.     Sure. Andrew, we really didn't see a signiﬁcant impact to us from an economic perspective. We did see operational challenges probably three or four days into that cold snap. It was primarily upstream of our facilities where we were just seeing the producer struggling to maintain their production at the wellhead, but as soon as the weather broke those volumes came back rather quickly. So from an impact to the midstream business, it was pretty modest."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay, great. Then ﬁnancially, you were pretty clear that you'll have the IPO style roadshow for DTM in the coming months. When can we expect an updated ﬁnancial outlook for '21 and beyond for the remaining utility focused DTE? Will we see guidance before the DTM share start trading or would it come more or like with second quarter earnings in late July.","Dave Rudd, do you want to take that?     Consistent with the timing of when we're going to go out with the DTM roadshow; we want to be talking about DTE guidance at that point as well. So we -- as we come forward into post- June, we will be coming forward with our DTE guidance post-Midstream for '21."
"Great. Then one last one if I may on the voluntary renewables program seems like you're seeing really strong demand with the additional megawatts. For middle of the decade, are you thinking at all about a potential cap or ceiling from this business and if so what would be the limiting factor? I don't imagine it would be demand. Are there, any physical constraints around land access or regulatory constraints of any sort or could this just continue the pace of growth through the end of the decade?","I don't see any limitation other than demand. So, we're -- as if you followed our last settlement ﬁling where we operate 800 megawatts of incremental renewables. That makes us about 400 megawatts long, but I can tell you that we eat up those long positions, pretty quickly. The   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   demand is extremely strong right now for our voluntary renewables program. So I don't see any limitations other than the customer demand."
"And just on the quarter, just big picture, Jerry, and maybe the rest of the team. I wanted to get your thoughts. So I believe just yesterday, I mean, I think, there's some news ﬂoating around that the Biden administration is now pushing for essentially doubling the clean generation going from like currently 40% to 80% over the next decade. Obviously, this is less aggressive than certainly zero -- net zero goal by 2035. Just, your thoughts on, how is DTE positioned? How is the sector positioned? Is this even achievable?","Well, I would say just to remind everyone of our goals at DTE where we want to be net zero by 2050, 80% carbon reduction by 2040, 50% by 2030 and we're already at 30% heading into sort of the 2023 timeframe. So I would say we're well advanced, I would expect that the DTE plan will accelerate over time. We are deep into conversations with the -- and as an industry with the Biden administration and I think there will be some consensus we hope as to, how do we all accelerate our plans, which we view as beneﬁcial to DTE's plan. And certainly it will be beneﬁcial to others as well. So yet to be determined, the plans that were described during the election process are very aggressive, but we also saw -- I think we see a meeting of the minds here perhaps to compromise over time."
"Just maybe -- just a quick follow-up, I mean, how high of a priority this is for the Biden administration and just your sense talking to key leaders there as to when could we actually see something tangible on this front? Just open ended just thinking about timing and what to look for over the next few months?","Yes. Based on the level of engagement within our industry association, I would say it's very high on their priority list to move forward a plan that aﬀects climate change. So, we're feeling positive that there's a possibility to get something done. All the elements that are being discussed seem quite positive as well. We're just going to need to see how this all plays out in the next several months. I think we'll know probably heading into the summer and fall whether there is something to do here. But it feels positive at this point."
"Quick -- could you -- would you mind breaking down the kind of quarterly upside at DTE Electric and Gas just a little more? I mean, how much was -- were the rate cases? And then maybe, the beneﬁt plan items, could you remind us what that was? And also curious, if are you continuing to see mix beneﬁt and COVID-related sales factors and yet to what extent was that driving the upside?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Dave Ruud?      Sure. Hi Jonathan. As we look at the quarter, the majority of the upside we saw was from the new rates coming in. We did see some weather diﬀerential versus last year. It was still a little negative, but it was better than last year and also at DTE Electric, that's where we had those beneﬁt plans that you mentioned, and that was about a $20 million to $25 million diﬀerence. So we had a loss last quarter, of course, that's going to be a gain in the second quarter of 2020. And then we since have taken all the actions to make sure we don't see that market variability again. As far as gas, again, in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, we had a really negative weather. That's what we were trying to come back from throughout the year. So, we had better weather this year and then the rest of the upside that we would see would be from the new rates coming into eﬀect."
Can you quantify how much the rate case helped the quarter on the electric side?,I think -- what I think we can get back to you on that one to make sure that you have the right number.
Okay. And then any comments on the mix -- sort of the question?,"Yes, on the load at electric, overall quarter-over-quarter sales were down about 2%. So, we are -- our residential was up versus Q1. It was up about 3%, commercial down 2% and industrial down 7%. But as we discussed before, we were seeing some upside from COVID related sales at residential. And we're still seeing that right now.  So our residential load in the ﬁrst quarter, versus what we would have thought it would have been pre-COVID was up about 5% to 7% still and then our commercial and industrial were basically back to where we would have expected pre COVID may be between 95% and 100% of the way back. So our residential usage continues to come in marginally better than expected with more people continuing to work from home and we're seeing that trend continue a little longer than we thought until people go back to work."
"Okay, great, thank you. And then just maybe on the -- if I may on -- I was looking at the CapEx disclosure in the slides, seems to be a little bit of a slow start relative to annual guidance even adjusting for the normal seasonality. Just anything you can oﬀer there in terms of what you're thinking about the full-year plan and just how we are -- when we ramp up to it?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",I think the main thing that was a little slower there was one of our wind parks was scheduled to come on in the ﬁrst quarter. And that will be coming on now in the second quarter and that's will be catching up with the capital there.
"You also get about 100 odd million down on base electric, Dave. I'm curious, is there anything driving that?","It's timing of -- just timing of projects and when they come in for the year. There's no -- when we look at our annual plan for capital, we're still right on target, but the timing for a few of our projects was a little slower in the ﬁrst quarter, but ramping up now."
"Hey, Jerry, just you mentioned that I think GSMP is tracking ahead of plan. Could you maybe say what's driving that?","Sure. David, do you want to take that?     Sure, I can. Steve, I think the big driver quarter-over-quarter is leaping in service this ﬁrst quarter, then I'd say generally across the platforms just running modestly ahead of plan across   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   all the platforms, there isn't any one item that I would call out. It's just a little modest blush across all the assets."
"Okay. And then also for GSMP, which I guess will be obviously DTE Midstream. The -- when you look beyond '21 as kind of growth, could you maybe give a little color of what drives growth beyond '21 there?","Yes, Steve, it's really no diﬀerent than I think what we've shared in the past. I mean we're looking at, what I'll call in out our Appalachian footprint and then our Haynesville footprint. We're sitting in really good locations in both of those basins. We are sitting in and around some of the best resource in the country and with pipeline connections to really the best markets in the country. And we're just seeing incremental activity around all those assets right now and as you know some of the assets have some runway on them that give us opportunity to do incremental business.  So I would expect and continue to expect to see that organic accretive growth as we ﬁll in around those assets."
"Okay. And just for the Form 10, just so we know is that primarily going to be just historical information actuals for DTE Midstream? Are there any projections in there?","Steve, what you'll see in there is you're going to see the past three years audited standalone ﬁnancials. And you'll also see the ﬁrst quarter of this year kind of standalone ﬁnancials. And you'll also see a pro-forma for the full year as a kind of a standalone. So that's what we'll be in the package when it becomes public, which you'll have an opportunity to look at."
"Okay. Great. I have one last quick question. Just the RNG business, do you have handy what that business expects within your guide for '21 in terms of earnings or whatever other measure?","We -- Steve, we haven't broken it out between our co-gen and our RNG business from a new development perspective. But if you recall we've been landing this $15 million or more each year of new income generation at P&I. I'd say the way to think about that is about half of it has been RNG and the other half has been co-gen. That's how we've been progressing over the last three or four years.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"A quick follow-up on the GSP and kind of appreciate the kind of the color that was provided. And just thinking about the spin of the business and kind of unlocking the value of potentially growing the platform kind of both organically. Just curious to get an update on kind of growth opportunities you're kind of looking at a 10% CAGR through 2024 kind of before the announcement and just curious to know how that view has evolved and kind of in light of the improving commodity conditions, some of the recontracting like on NEXUS and potentially some updated strategy on GSP for post spin?","David?     Yes, sure. I can take that. So, as we've talked in the past in terms of what I'll call our capital investment agenda is for this segment, really not seeing that changing at all. And I think as we   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   approach the spin, we will be able to provide a little more granularity and visibility on what I call the DTM Standalone kind of view going forward.  But if I just look at this year just as a proxy, we're going to deliver strong growth this year, year- over-year. And if you compare us to what I'll call the Midstream sector, we got sector leading growth rate this year year-over-year.  So, the portfolio is strong and healthy. And I look forward to talking to you in more detail about the DTM speciﬁc forward view shortly, as soon as we can."
"Excellent and I kind of have a follow-up on, maybe two-part on kind of the post-spin unregulated exposure. Just given the scale of the commodity impact of businesses that's shrinking within the RemainCo, does that kind of mean the need for DTE Energy Trading kind of remains or just some of that business activity move away post spin?","So just as a reminder, 90% of our earnings going forward will be utility-based with about 10% being non-utility, and any growth that comes from our non-utility sector will come from our two business lines, co-generation and RNG. We don't expect any growth from our trading company. It's a quite a small operation, generates anywhere from $30 million to $40 million of cash ﬂow for us but also provides us great market insights into some of the non-utility businesses that we're in co-gen as well as RNG where they help us manage some of our market positions there as well as manage risk in, and around some of our utility portfolio. So, it's a small business, we don't expect it to grow and we'll continue to run it that way."
"And a short follow-up on the RNG piece and kind of the P&I segment. Just with the local and kind of federal decarbonization eﬀorts ramping up -- eﬀorts ramping up, are you strictly looking at RNG opportunities to potentially expand the oﬀering may be hydrogen value chain, carbon capture et cetera?","We're primarily focused on RNG at this point in time, that's where the investment opportunities are and I would say really nice returns as well from that business line. As we start to understand more and we are starting to understand a lot more about carbon capture, we will look at that as an opportunity, but that seems to be somewhat into the future at this point in time. Hydrogen again is very early, but certainly promising. So more to come and we'll see how our utilities and perhaps our non-utilities business can play into both those opportunities."
"A lot has been discussed already but I just wanted to double-check with you guys about the qualiﬁed plans in the electric business. So when you say that you took measures to reduce volatility in that segment going forward, can you clarify what that means? Is that does it mean that you diversiﬁed the assets in those plans diﬀerently or is it an accounting measure? Like how should we think about that?","Dave Rudd?     Sure, yeah, the main thing we did there is we matched up our assets and our liabilities. So, any movement on one side will be matched on the other and so that will take away any of the market variability that we were seeing there in the past. And we limited the size of the plan a little bit too. So we're conﬁdent that we're not going to see these market movements past the second quarter of 2020, where you'll see that the losses that were in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 came back in the second quarter."
"That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question was on the GSP business -- I'm sorry, P&I business, it looks like it might have a little bit of a catching up to do to for the full-year guidance in the last three quarters of the year compared to what we would think as a ratable distribution of your guidance throughout the year. Is that something that you envisioned? Or is it something is causing such of a project there? Or how should we think about that one?","Maybe I'll start and then I'll let Dave give a little more details. But we fully expect P&I to hit its targets this year. I can tell you, we're not concerned about that at all. So feeling real good about the targets and the progress for the balance of the year. Dave, do you want to shed a little more light on this?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Yes, you're right. In the next few quarters, what we see is some of the RNG projects and the beneﬁt of some of those new RNG projects come in a little bit better for us and so. We're conﬁdent in that coming back and meeting the full-year guidance."
"Understood. And then just, this might be a little bit early, but obviously part of the payment for the infrastructure plan that Biden proposed is the potential increase in tax rates. We've gone through this cycle as an industry of the past few years ago, and just assuming the plan that's in place goes into eﬀect. Just any initial thoughts on your end, especially in terms of cash or rate base and rate base growth?","Well, I'll start. Certainly, we don't expect our growth trajectory to be impacted by the new plan. It will put some pressure on rates and aﬀordability at the utilities that we'll have to manage, but we think all of that at this point in time will be manageable. Dave Ruud, do you want to add to that at all?     Hey, Jerry, I think that's the right high level. When we saw the tax rate reduction in 2017 and we could -- that was a 14% reduction. Now it's looking like what Biden is saying is about a 7% increase and that could come oﬀ as about a 1.5% increase we would see in rates. Also, it would improve our cash position a little bit because cash taxes would lag the book taxes. So it would improve our FFO-to-debt by 0.5% to 4%. But as Jerry said, the key we'd have to do, there's   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   continued to work on cost structure to oﬀset the increase in rates. So it wouldn't impact our capital plans as we continue to improve on our customer liability and clean energy transition."
"Got it and my apologies if you've already got into this or -- and I am just picking up, but from an O&M perspective over a multi-year period, is there a general guidance that we should be using or potential opportunity for more?","Dave Rudd?     Yes, we are continuing to manage our O&M and trying to keep it well below inﬂation. And it's so one of our plans going forward. We haven't given long-term O&M guidance on that, but it's deﬁnitely an area where we're going to make sure that we can continue to have opportunities for increased capital and infrastructure that's needed for our customers.     I think you'll also see that if you look at our O&M performance over the last decade, we've been quite distinctive in the industry with our continuous improvement plans where we've had a very low to no O&M increases on an absolute basis."
"Jerry, great move on swapping out the multiple Jerrys on a call with multiple Daves. Just I guess -- just two quick questions, one is I think you talked about 1,800 megawatts of renewables. I believe, that's mostly if not all in the regulated utility. Is there any thought to growing renewables or what's the thought process for renewables either in the regulated utility or the P&I business?","Well, certainly, we've got a signiﬁcant eﬀort to continue to increase our renewables position on our regulated businesses. I think as I mentioned, we've got 900 megawatts of voluntary renewables lined up and we expect over the next ﬁve years to invest about $2 billion in regulated renewables inside our electric utility. As far as the non-utility business, our niche play has really become RNG where we see that as a very lucrative renewable resource and we are a ﬁrst mover with unlevered IRRs after tax in the teens. And as I mentioned, a simple cash paybacks of three to four years and we see nothing, but demand growth for that product. So we are pretty excited about our position there and how that continues to grow."
"Great. And then last and it's kind of touches on your response, I guess. How do you balance the returns in the renewable project with how it would impact the company's net zero targets or such as, hey, this really contributes to the net zero target, but the returns are lower. Is there a threshold or what's the balancing act of, hey, it's a really, really green project, but maybe less of an economic beneﬁt or how do you handle that?","Well, right now, all of our regulated renewable investments inside our electric utility attract the regulated rate of return, 9.9% and a 50/50 debt equity structure. So it's a -- these are very accretive projects for us and we continue to see lots of opportunity to ﬁnance these renewable projects in that manner. What we are trying to manage through the voluntary program is our customers pay a slight premium in order to make sure that there's no impact on customer rates. So, sort of a win-win for both our customers and our investors."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions and great job on the quarter.,"Thank you, Anthony.  Operator  Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America."
"If I can play -- hey, if I can do a little cleanup here. I just want to go back to this RNG conversation. It has come up a few times, but I want to press a little bit on targets here as you think about the forward guidance that you guys have. What kind of assumptions have you reﬂected there just to reset against your $24 million baked into RNG, I heard the $50 million per year comment earlier. But I want to come back to just understand what's reﬂected against your earlier comments about looking at other states and other perhaps opportunities they are in?","We have -- I think at our last VI [ph] meeting we provided guidance for P&I business overall. And Dave Ruud, if you -- if I recall correctly, we are in the $130 million to $135 million in terms of income targets for that business in the 2024 timeframe.     Yes, that's right. And it's continued to -- our historical development of $50 million of new net income a year. A lot of that within RNG, but also continuing to look at cogen and other opportunities within the kind of ESG space to grow that business."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Then let me perhaps let me phrase that slightly diﬀerently. When you think about the emerging opportunities outside of California, should we say, how do you think about that reconciling against that? Is this something that you want to keep small? All your comments earlier about keeping energy trading small for instance, do you want to keep RNG small within those parameters or is this something that you are willing to organically grow into whatever opportunity may exist behind it?","Well, I will start this way, Julien. We are trying to keep our mix at 90/10. So we will pursue as we watch both our utilities and our non-utilities grow. We will continue to pursue RNG and do great projects and as basis we have been. Could it become sort of more dominant in a P&I play? Perhaps, but I think it's something that we will have to watch. Right now we are seeing like I mentioned a pretty even split between cogen and RNG, and that feels good to us. The cogen projects come with 15-year and 20-year agreements, which feels more like utility -- utility like type investments and capital deployment with higher returns in our utilities. And then RNG comes with really hot returns, right, and sort of shorter timeframe commitments in terms of price ﬁxing."
"Right. But maybe the point is that if you strip out the GSP side of the business, you still have latitude within that 90/10 mix even in the forward years?","I think the 90/10 that we put out there took into account the spin of DTM or Midstream. So as we deploy capital, the mix that we are looking at, Julien, is about $17 billion going into our utilities and about $2 billion going into P&I. So that kind of gives you a feel how we are planning -- that's our base plan and how we plan to allocate capital right now."
"Thank you. So I realize that you guys are busy with the Midstream spin-oﬀ. But I was just -- and then seemingly you have plenty of growth opportunities at your own utilities. But just looking beyond the spin-oﬀ, it looks to me that your credit metrics will look very strong given the improvement in the credit proﬁle, the risk proﬁle of the business at about 16% FFO to debt. So, typically that strong credit metrics would support some M&A transactions on the regulated utility side and I was just wondering what's your take on this.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Angie, good morning. We -- our base plan is really to grow our company organically. We see that being the most accretive way to create value for our shareholders. And we have got a $17 billion plan in front of us, which we are always looking for opportunities to accelerate. And one of the reasons we are primarily focused on the organic growth around our platform, current platforms is that you get in a book value and your shareholders get a multiple of that book value from a value perspective. So it's the most accretive thing we can do. Having said all that, if there's assets that could become available to us and create value for our investors, we are always open to that. But it's certainly, Angie, not our primary focus at the point in time."
"But do you have any preference as to electric versus gas? How about electric transmission assets? I mean, any comments to that eﬀect.","Sure. I -- our views probably has been changed in the last couple of years and we are really focused on electric investments. I think if you look at our capital plans, it's very heavy electric both in the renewable space, as well as in wires and -- renewables and wires are primarily electric investment focus right now. So if we were to do more -- we had the opportunity to deploy more capital and we would deploy it in those two spaces, wires and renewables -- regulated renewables."
"And just as a follow-up, given that the voluntary renewables program seems to be ahead of your expectations, is that in a sense increasing your expectations about the earnings growth at DTE Electric versus what you had stated before or is it just that it oﬀsets some of the other rate- based growth that you would -- you have contemplated?","Yeah, certainly, what we are seeing and we updated at last fall is that we put our renewables growth at $2 billion over the next ﬁve years of capital deployment. So we move forward, we will continue to update that number, Angie. But I will tell you I have been pleasantly surprised with this program. As soon as we have supply available, it just ﬂies oﬀ the shelf with our large industrials and commercial customers have a very strong appetite for this. And even our residential customers, we are signing up thousands of customers every month and we are sitting at about 30,000 customers right now on a residential level. So it seems to be a very appealing product. So more to come on that, but I do expect these investments to continue to grow. But right now we have got $2 billion in the plan as we see it."
How is the commercial development opportunities in the Haynesville progressed in the last few months and are you seeing any more meaningful developments there?,"Sure. I I'll answer this question, because David Slater is having some phone problems; otherwise he would take this. But, we're seeing lots of opportunities in and around the Haynesville assets and actually doing some nice small projects that are highly accretive. So David and his team have been quite successful. Nothing very large yet, but I think as we evolve that platform, we've got a very signiﬁcant opportunity with the fact that we were a ﬁrst mover in building a 150 miles, 36 inch pipeline that takes volumes in the northern part of the Haynesville to markets in the Gulf Coast as well as the LNG export markets.  So we are in discussions with various shippers to see if we can get a project oﬀ the ground there. So it's early, but I would say encouraging because as you know, expanding new pipelines can be very economic and also accretive."
"Great. And then maybe just one on RNG, post spin, reached 10% threshold that you had highlighted. But in terms of deal structuring, is there any change in appetite around taking LCFS or other credit risk? And is there any diﬀerent approach that you may take pro forma for the spin given the changing tax position?","So, I would say this that you asked about RNG markets certainly and hopefully this is answering your question. We are using ﬁnancial instruments to hedge those markets and that's what our trading company is doing for us. So, we're taking a portfolio approach where we hedge we also have ﬁxed price contracts for term and then we leave some of it open to the market. So, that's the portfolio approach we're taking with RNG both in the LCFS markets and the RFS markets.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay, but in pro forma for the deal, would you look to take any more duration risk or less in light of the more utility focused company that you'd be managing?","Certainly, we always look for length in our contracts. So that's what we -- that's how we approach it. We will give up a better return to get length in our contracts, but we also do look for a portfolio approach."
"Just wanted to come back to GSP, if I could and kind of slice it a little bit diﬀerently maybe. For the ﬁrst quarter, the pace you landed there would handily beat guidance and was the strength due to seasonality and how should we think about seasonality for the business overall at this point?","While the primary strength as David mentioned in his comments was driven by the fact that the LEAP pipeline which was a brand new pipeline that came into service last August. We are starting to see the full impact of that on our ﬁnancials year-over-year because in the ﬁrst quarter of last year LEAP wasn't in the -- was not in the portfolio, it was under construction.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So that's the primary lip that we got year over year. And then, as you mentioned, we got moderate favorability from all of our platforms and that's what created the ﬁrst quarter favorability year-over-year, those two factors. But predominantly the in service of the 150-mile 36-inch pipeline that we put into service."
"Got it. So, no seasonality to think of in the business overall for GSP?","Typically we don't get seasonality in that business. We are getting a little extra juice from the all the platforms ﬂowing a little higher than we expected. That's likely due to, -- as you know, we plan conservatively and have contingency in our plans. And that's starting to play on that platform somewhat in addition to LEAP pipeline which is a big investment that came online."
Got it. Separately for Midstream. Could you discuss how advanced the carbon capture initiatives that I think you're alluding to before were in?
