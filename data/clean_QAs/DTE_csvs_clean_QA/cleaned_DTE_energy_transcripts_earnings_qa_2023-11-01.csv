Question,Answer
"Good morning. Morning, morning. So, Jerry, just appreciate the tough decisions this quarter. I mean, obviously you removed the language around the 6% to 8% growth rate, but reiterated the long-term fundamentals and you stepped a bit of outside of the normal cadence as we think about the '24 early outlook. I guess can you just maybe elaborate a bit more on your thoughts going into '24 as we think about the cadence of updates for guidance and CapEx? I mean, obviously the rate case decision is a gating item for '24. Would that be the new base for long-term growth, and will you extend the growth rate into '28? Just a little bit more color would be helpful.","Yes. You bet, Shar. So, certainly the fundamentals of our business remain really strong in the long-term. The opportunities to make tremendous amount of investment in our grid and our transition to clean energy, those -- the opportunity remains intact. We are awaiting the commission order and that will happen in the ﬁrst week of December. The next scheduled meeting is December 1, but it has to be essentially dealt with before December 10.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So, sometime in that ﬁrst week of December, we expect an order. We feel it's prudent at this point in time to post that rate order as when we will basically roll out shortly right after the order. We will roll out our 2024 guidance, our long-term growth rate, and also our capital investment proﬁle, and we'll do that for both utilities and Vantage. So, that's the plan going forward, Shar."
"And then just -- it does. Thank you, Jerry. That's helpful.",DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Yes.
"Got it. No, thank you for that. And then just on, lastly, the $270 million oﬀsets. That's obviously a pretty impressive number. And you called the response out as being one-time kind of events. I guess do you anticipate, under normal weather, the full amounts could be replenished or is there some carryover of savings through '24? I mean, I guess is there deferred maintenance that would need to come back? I'm just trying to get a sense about these cost cuts and also the potential read through they may have on the GRC as you try to get this case over the ﬁnish line with some very tough interveners. Thanks, guys.","Thank you. So, what you'll see is that much of the cost will ﬂow back in. Some will stick. I think when you go through one of these periods of severe challenge, you always learn new things about your company. But much has to ﬂow back in. So, maintenance that wasn't critical this year becomes very critical next year that we can't continue to postpone.  We've made that very clear in our ﬁnal reply briefs. And I think we'll see much of that ﬂow back in. Now some of that will stick, will help for next year. And -- but we plan to return to our normal planning process where we would anticipate certain levels of storm activity and certain levels of weather variation in our planning going forward. So, that is our goal at this point in time."
"Okay. Perfect. Let me let me jump back in the queue. I'm sure that there's enough questions. Thank you, guys, so much. Appreciate it.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Could you elaborate a bit on the settlement discussions that you had in the rate case? Just what challenges may have arisen that prevented you from getting across the ﬁnish line there? Any kind of learnings? And does that potentially continue forward into future challenges and other rate cases in the future or are there unique factors here that came into play?,"Certainly. So, as you know, we had a very successful integrated resource plan settlement, and then we quickly transitioned to our rate settlement discussions. I would say this, that the major agencies that would be involved signiﬁcantly in representing the economic interests of our customers were at the table, and we were moving towards settlement.  But that was a handful of parties, key parties, very important parties, but there was another 25 or so parties that were interveners in a rate case that essentially did not want to engage in rate case settlement discussions. That was unfortunate, but I think the practice in Michigan so far is not to pursue contested rate settlements.  When you say what learnings are there that might be something we have to explore in the future, is the ability to pursue or contest the great settlements when you have the bulk of the economic interest represented at the table. Not a common practice in Michigan, but a common practice in other jurisdictions."
"Got it. That's helpful context. Were there speciﬁc aspects within the case, whether it was the undergrounding, the IRM, or speciﬁc requests here that led to the sticking points with those other interveners?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","I would say not. So, I think it simply said it was a reluctance to engage. I would say that the handful of parties that did engage, we were moving towards what I would call a productive outcome. So, we are feeling positive until, I would say, the last moments of the discussions where there was a reluctance to engage by some of the other parties."
"Okay. Understood. Thanks for that color. And thinking about the go-forward earnings power, looking at the 2023 Vantage and Trading results, quite a bit stronger than the original guidance on 2023. Was wondering if those could be considered new baselines for growth, or if you could give a sense for how much one-time or non-repeatable strength we saw in those two businesses. Do those also kind of revert to the original 2023 midpoint as you think about the growth going forward?","Hi. This is Dave Ruud. Yes, we did see some strong growth in those businesses this year. At Vantage, we had three new RNG projects, a new custom energy services project commencing the growth that we expected. There also was some one-time things in there, as we mentioned, on some up to six steel contracts that we did this year, too. So, we look forward on Vantage. We will be growing that oﬀ the 2023 original guidance, but still seeing some great growth there and some great opportunity this year.  Trading also, like as you saw, is having a great year, and we've increased the guidance there, too. A lot of that favorability that we've seen has been through contracted, like full requirement services, and also in our Gas business. And we've seen some of these higher margins on these contracts, and we'll be looking at what that means for 2024. But right now, not increasing any of the guidances, but we'll give you a full update. As Jerry mentioned earlier, we'll give you a full update on that in December."
"Thanks for all -- good morning, Jerry. I really appreciate all the detail that you provided around the cost mitigation impacts. And so, thank you for that. Hey, listen, I just wanted to kind of think through the implications of a year like this, a pretty aggressive year on storms, to your go- forward earnings proﬁle. Can you remind us? So, this year, right, when you add all those numbers together, it's $150 million in impact, which is roughly 10% of your earnings, normalized earnings power this year. Can you remind us what level of allowance or costs are baked in for storms in this current ongoing rate case and going forward?","Yes. In the -- in our rates, there's about $55 million pre-tax that's in there for storms."
"Okay. Are there other opportunities like trackers or deferrals that you could pursue, or would that be more legislative?","I think those trackers and deferrals have been pursued in the past, Durgesh, and can be pursued in the future. Like as a matter of fact, I think our sister utility is pursuing some of that as well in their current rate case."
"And is that part of your current request as well, like are you asking for in this case?","It is not in our current rate case at this point in time. But as Dave said, typically we budget for one standard deviation and weather variances that deal with weather variances as well as storm activity variances. I think what was unusual this year is that we had a much cooler than normal summer line up with excessive storm activity, which is very unusual and very anomalous, and beyond our planning scenarios certainly. And when we think about the totality of it, we had about 30% of our earnings challenged, and we responded with 21% response. And so, pretty signiﬁcant response in light of extraordinary challenges. So, we view it as a very anomalous year.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it. Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the color. And then maybe just quickly hit on storm investigation. I know the Liberty Consulting Group was hired. What do you expect as next steps there, and when could we see sort of a ﬁnal recommendation timeline there?","So, there's been a very positive set of interactions with Liberty. The exchanges have been very collaborative. They are requesting information, which we're providing. I think the next series of steps is they'll conduct some ﬁeld work as part of their tabletop exercise, and we expect a report sometime next summer, ﬁnal report."
"Hi. I think the question has been touched on a number of diﬀerent ways, but I just wanted to be very precise and very clear here as we think about the base business, as we think about going forward. There's a rate case. It's going to have some impact on 2024, unknown at this point. But if you think about the base business past 2020, '24, does DTE still grow 6% to 8%?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Jeremy, we're going to have to ﬁnalize all those details. I know everybody is anxious to get those details, but again, we certainly don't want to get in front of the regulatory process. What I will say at the highest level is all of the opportunities that we've discussed before that supported the long-term growth of our company are all there today. And what we need is strong support from the regulatory construct to support '24 and beyond for that matter.  So, we're waiting for a strong signal, and we'll continue to move forward and execute these grid investments for our customers. What I will tell you is that the Governor, our customers, our commission, legislators, every Mayor I talk to are clamoring for these investments. This is something that our customers want. And the rate relief that we're requesting is not extraordinary.  If you look at just the capital that we're deploying, some of the interest expense that we have to recover, as well as the correction in the sales ﬁgure, since May of 2020, we'd be looking at an increase of roughly 1.6% per year, well below national inﬂation rates of 5.5% since that period in time and well below some of our peers where they've seen over 5% bill growth since that period of time, since 2020. So, we feel like we're delivering a very compelling, and what I would say, competitive package to pursue for the commission, and we're conﬁdent that we get strong support for the investments we need to make for our customers."
"Got it, got it. Understood. Maybe pivoting a little bit here. As we look forward, there's been just a change in regime and rates being -- rates moving up a lot recently. And we're kind of tracking HoldCo reﬁnancing risk in note that DTE has a number of hedges in place to mitigate some of this risk. I was wondering if you could provide speciﬁc details on those hedges as far as what the reﬁ looks like. Is this something that's just kind of a short-term hedge? Is this the longer-term hedge? What type of levels? Just trying to get a sense for how much of a headwind reﬁnance risk at the HoldCo could be.","Hey, Jeremy. This is Dave. So, I'll ﬁrst say at the highest level, we've incorporated these increasing interest rates in our plan and had considered it and contemplated it and had the ﬂexibility in our plans prior to this. So, we're monitoring this, and we'll continue to manage the interest expense increase through timing and structure and tenure of our future debt. Now you're referring to the parent debt that we have that will come due at the end of '24. (Inaudible) We have put in hedges for over a quarter, 25% of that, through the year. And we'll continue to look for opportunities and monitor the market for additional opportunity for that as well."
"So, just to clarify, that 25% would be whatever the new tenure of that reﬁnance would be, be it 3, 5, 10 years, 25% is hedged for that length of time?",Right.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Got it. And then maybe just as you think about forward planning in weather, and you provided a lot of helpful thoughts there, that's been great, thank you. But if you think about, I guess, the sample set that you apply the standard deviation against, is the reason to revisit that just given the severity of this year, or anything could happen in one year? Just wondering how to think about, I guess, how to best budget for storm impacts in future years?","Typically, what we do is we look at our 15-year weather patterns and we build a plan. After that, our rates are also built oﬀ a 15-year average, if you will, and then we build in a one standard deviation in weather for consumption. And in addition to that, we carry a storm budget that's based typically on a ﬁve to seven year average. So, we'll -- we're revisiting some of that as we speak as we've experienced more severe weather patterns in the last handful of years. So, that'll continue to track against those types of averages.  That's how we build our portfolio, and we've been quite successful in delivering in the last 16- years by using that approach, and even in the last ﬁve to seven years. And so, we'll continue with that approach, and we'll continue modifying it as we see patterns continue to change. And we roll forward our 15-year averages for weather, and that's just temperature that I'm talking about there, CDDs and HDDs, and then we'll also look at storm activity as it continues to build, as it has. So, we'll continue to increase contingencies for that."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for all your thoughts today, and looking forward to seeing the team at EEI.",Thank you.     Thanks.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
"And again, what kind of items are they? I'll leave it open ended.","Yes. No, good -- great question, Julien. So, some portion of the $1.31 will be sustainable, but I just want to make it clear that we're not slow -- snow plowing incremental costs into 2024. We will return to our normal levels of maintenance. As you know, over the many years where we had favorability in our plan, we pulled forward maintenance and banked it. So, we were able to take these one-time pauses and non-critical preventative maintenance. And so -- but next year, we're going to return to our normal pattern. So, I don't want people to think that we're snow plowing any kind of cost into 2024. We'll return to normal levels of maintenance expenditures. Hopefully, that helps, Julien."
"Right., i.e. it's not an outsized year '24 to get back to a run rate in '25, if you will. Just to make sure --",That's correct. That's correct. We're going back to our normal run rate that we otherwise would have had in '22 and '23 and returned to normal maintenance level of expenditures.
"Got it. Excellent. And Jerry, in the same direction of things, residential weather norm sales oﬀ 2.6% year-to-date here. I mean, that seems like an outsized impact, but obviously with weather   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   years -- with outsized weather impacts, it's hard to be precise. I mean, how do you think about that impacting '24 onwards and whatever this return to oﬃce environment is for you guys on resi?","Sure. So, I'll start with the weather part, and I'll let Dave talk about residential load and what we've seen this year compared to what we had forecasted for this year and what we plan to forecast for next year. So, from a weather perspective, Michigan, believe it or not, when we do the analysis, was the only state in the Midwest that experienced cooler than normal weather. And by more than one, cooler than normal weather for sure. And then we also experienced more than one standard deviation in warmer than normal weather in the winter.  So, very unusual combination. And then package that with excessive storm activity, twice the number of catastrophic storms, and that's essentially a unicorn of a year. And we had -- I had my statisticians roll through that analysis and it's a 1 in 50-year probability.  So, of course, we'll work with the 15-year averages. It'll impact our 15-year average and our ﬁve- year storm activity average, and we'll build that into our plans going forward. But Dave, you want to comment on residential sales?     Sure, yes. Our sales this year have come in pretty much as expected for the year, consistent with our budget, consistent with the rate case ﬁling we had. As you said, residential is down a little as we knew people would be returning to work, so we saw that we saw that come down. As far as our forecast, we, in the rate case, we forecast residential sales remain somewhat ﬂat and there's been no dispute in our forecast going forward here either. So, we should get that -- that shouldn't be an issue here coming up in this rate case."
Okay. All right. Fair enough. And so -- but you see consistent pressure going into '24 just as you think about building out the plan on '24 and '25 on resi or is it more of a transient piece?,We won't see pressure from the residential forecast in '24.
"Hey. Just a quick balance sheet question and a follow-up. I think Moody's maybe put out an update earlier this year with the company's FFO to debt metrics probably the lowest they've been in several years. I guess the impact of this year's storm activity, mild weather, and the rate decision, I guess just where do you think you end up in the end of '23 and how does that rate relative to your downgrade threshold and what are you thinking in '24?","Yes. Anthony, we remain in a (Inaudible) position with our balance sheet. We did meet with all the rating agencies this year and even ahead of this call. Now the FFO to debt from '22 was really due to lower FFO from our fuel cost and that's getting recovered this year. So, we'll see that FFO to debt in '23 come back as we recover our PSCR primarily at our electric company. So, we remain in good position, good headroom to the thresholds, any downgrade thresholds in any of our rating agencies at this point."
"Great. And then if I could think of a, Jerry, a longer-term question. I know there's a pending rate case, we're all waiting for a decision, but when you think of the volatility, as you just said, Michigan was the only state in the Midwest that had mild weather. It seems that there's much more volatility in weather and storm activity we're getting in Michigan.  It seems every year or two, there's a catastrophic storm or an ice storm or something. I mean, when you ﬁle your future rate cases, thoughts on maybe the risk return or the risk involved in operating or the challenges in operating utility in Michigan, do you maybe change what you think the ROE that you need goes up higher?","I think two things, Anthony, could go that route, which is a more challenging route in terms of lifting ROEs, but -- and it's certainly a possibility, especially in the light of rising, continued rising interest rates. There will be pressure to move ROEs up in the future if this interest rate construct continues to get worse or remains at the levels it's at.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   But I feel that in the past, if you research our history, when we entered periods of very volatile storm activity, in order not to whipsaw the level of investment that we can make in our maintenance practices and also capital deployment, there have been storm trackers that have existed in Michigan in the past. And to me, that could be a very viable path going forward."
"Hi. Appreciate all the details on the mitigation eﬀorts and the headwinds. Obviously, it's been a tough year. Most of mine have been answered. Just two follow-ups, please. First of all, just to set expectations around the rate case timing, let's assume we get a reasonable or normal or constructive outcome, whatever adjective you want to use, how soon should we expect the next rate cases? In other words, not trying to get ahead of the current outcome, but should we assume the more or less annual ﬁling pace going forward?","Andrew, I would say that we have an infrastructure recovery mechanism built into the current rate case request. If that's adopted by the commission, which we hope it will be, we will be in annual rate cases until that builds into a large enough infrastructure recovery mechanism for our distribution capital, primarily to keep us out of rate cases for longer periods of time.  Like if you look at our gas company, we're able to stay out between one and three years depending on what's transpiring inside the gas company. But it will reduce the frequency of   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   rate cases if the commission chooses to adopt an infrastructure recovery mechanism. It'll just take a couple years for it to happen until that mechanism builds into a large enough amount to track enough capital to keep us out for a while."
"That sounds consistent with what you've said in the past. Second question is totally unrelated. A question about supply chains. You're spending a lot of capital both on renewables and on improving reliability. How do you see the availability of these grid level equipment like transformers or switchgears? And if you do see shortages, is there a risk that might slow down your plan to pay for spending?","Well, certainly, we're very well aware of supply chain challenges with relation to transformers and switchgear, and we've expanded our reach beyond U.S. borders and are bringing in that equipment from international sources, which is working out quite well so far. We've done a lot of testing and a lot of investigation and due diligence over the last several years, and that's taken some pressure oﬀ of our supply chain. So, right now, we feel good about it, Andrew, in terms of how we're positioned to execute our large capital programs, both in the distribution business as well as the renewables business."
"Okay. Great. So, just -- so like in the past, you've had rate cases and been able to give guidance in rate case -- with rate cases pending. So, should we think about this being diﬀerent just because of what happened last year with the surprise in the sales forecast or just the tough conditions this year? Just how should we think about what's diﬀerent this time versus in the past?","I would say realistically, Steve, our posture has probably gotten a little more conservative based on what happened last year, and all signals are positive. I mean, there's strong consensus prior to ﬁling the rate case with commissioners and even in their public statements, supporting large levels of investment into the grid and into renewables.  We're also getting that from the Governor's oﬃce where there's strong support for investments in infrastructure, and again, a clamoring from customers as you've probably seen, especially this summer, wanting for us to invest and make the grid better and also support, strong support for the clean energy transition.  So, we're likely in a more conservative posture based on the challenges that we've had in the regulatory process, as well as some of the challenges we've experienced this year. So, we want to make sure when we tell you we're going to do something, we're going to deliver on it."
Okay. And it's -- and how much if anything is related to just other things than just the rate case in terms of just wanting to take more time?,"No, we don't need more time. We just need a data point here to ﬁnalize our plans for '24 --"
"Morning. So, a couple of questions, if I may. With respect to the storm activity, right, so we've seen now it seems like every year, once in a 50-year storm, right, something like that and diﬀerent predictions. And as this type of weather volatility increases, and you see now it's Michigan, is there, in your mind, a need for a more, I guess, structural solution to that?  Maybe it should be done to a legislature that goes beyond trackers and riders and what have you, but maybe it's a securitization program for storms, some sort of a surcharge on customer bills for storm escrow. All those mechanisms have been employed like in the south where storms are an annual event. Is there something to learn from that and potentially it may be implemented in Michigan?","I think the straight answer to that and simple answer, Sophie, to that is absolutely yes. We have to consider all of the above and those are great thoughts that you've oﬀered. And certainly, we're thinking about similar approaches as to how to take this volatility out of the plan, because as you mentioned, what it does to a utility when you get into these volatile environments, storm environments, is it starts to whipsaw your maintenance plans and potentially even your capital deployment plans, and we don't want that to happen. We want to make the steady investments and perform the regular maintenance we need to have in order to run a high-quality grid and a   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   high-quality operation. So, very good thoughts. We're very supportive of your thoughts, and we'll be pursuing them in the future."
"Got it. Thank you. Another question is this. Hypothetically speaking, if you were not entirely happy with the rate outcome in the current rate case, what is, I guess, a way for you to communicate that to the stakeholders, right? And some of your peers in other jurisdictions, when they were in such situations chose to signal that by cutting some of the non-consequential investments, but that is politically more charged, such as maybe EV infrastructure and things like that. And I was just curious if you've given some thoughts as to how you would proceed in that situation.","So, Sophie, I'll say this much: certainly, any good company faced with uncertainty, any type of uncertainty, we do scenario planning, and we're in the midst of that. I think we're well advanced in our thinking and once we receive a rate order, we'll roll out our plans and our reaction. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves at this point in time and we'll await the order from the commission, and then we'll provide our guidance and long-term plan, which I believe at this point will all be very positive. I don't sense at this point that there would be a disruption in our ability to invest. I feel conﬁdent about the need to make the investment and that there's alignment. But then again, in order to be prudent, we were also doing a lot of scenario planning to ensure that we can respond to whatever happens."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   You've answered most of my questions here, so just two real quick ones. In terms of the coming announcements, in terms of guidance and capital investment, long-term growth, what about the dividend, the quarterly dividend announcement? Will that also come after the rate case and the planning?","Yes, that will come then. I think it may come even a little bit before that, depending on when that ﬁnal rate case comes out."
"Okay. Perfect. And then the interveners that you mentioned that really weren't all that keen on settling, have they been in previous rate cases? Have they been interested in settling before? Did you know these people before, and were they familiar with the rate case process?","I would say that the -- we know them. Of course, we know them, we've been involved with them in many other rate cases. As we tried to bring all these parties to settlement, I would say the parties that typically don't have strong interest in the economics of the case are the ones that we had challenged bringing to the table. Not all, not exclusively all, but I would say most. The majority of the parties that we were not able to engage in settlement discussions probably had typically their function or mission is not tied signiﬁcantly to the economic interests of our customers."
"Morning. On cost-cutting, were there additional tools that were decided not to use in the third quarter, or should we think of Q3 as the max from a cost cut for the company?","Yes. We looked -- we've been looking across our company ever since the end of last year for any opportunities that we had, and we saw that we put all we had in place through the beginning of the year. You saw that $270 million of oﬀsets that we had. So, we've -- a lot of this plays out still through the end of the year. I mean, these are annualized numbers. They play out through the end of the year, but it's going to be a consistent number with what we've done now for cost cuts."
"Okay. And then on storms, I know that's been asked and answered, but in terms of the longer- term outlook, your neighbor utilities, some studies out talking about directionally 25% increase in storms through 2050. Is there any comparable analysis that applies to your jurisdiction, or how are you thinking about the longer-term impact? I mean, is that $55 billion number appropriate, or kind of what's the growth rate that you think is appropriate to apply to it?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yes. We continue to look at that. We've seen the increasing weather patterns also and look at the increasing storm impact that has. And so, we do build in some contingency beyond what's in rates. But again, as we've talked about, we're going to look at what we need to budget going forward, as well as what are some of the other mechanisms we can use to manage storm going forward."
Hey. Good morning. You mentioned you're expecting to get some cash back this year in the PSCR. Can you quantify that?,"Yes. Our under-recovery last year was about $420 million. And so, we've been recovering that throughout the year. So, we're going to get the majority of that back through -- in this year. So, it's a little over $380 million we'll be getting back through this year. So, that's obviously swings the cash and FFO for us quite a bit by $800 million year-over-year."
Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   This concludes our Q&A for today. I turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.,"Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll just close by saying I'm excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us, including further strengthening of our electric grid and preparing for increased demand from electriﬁcation on our system, and accelerating our path to cleaner generation. We continue to be well positioned for future growth and we'll provide (Inaudible) details after our grid case wraps up. Hope everyone has a great morning and a safe day.
