Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, Jerry. Hey Dave, the weather EPS impact is very clearly broken out on the slides. Maybe just can you give us a sense of how much of a headwind storm expenses were this year in the ﬁrst quarter.","Sure, yeah, like we said, we did see headwinds in our electric business from -- in the ﬁrst quarter from both weather and storm and the storm is in there at -- it was $20 million. We also -- this storm was kind of heavy one, where it hit a lot of our wires, so it was a little heavier O&M. So after taxes around $70 million. But again, we see great opportunity in our other businesses through the year to kind of overcome those headwinds and again, all the cost reduction work that we've been doing and kind of focused reductions has really been coming through too. So, we've had these headwinds in the beginning of the year. We see great opportunity still to work through this and with normal weather and storm through the end of the year to be able to reach our guidance."
"Got it. And then maybe just, can you comment on, I mean, you guys have pretty good at building up contingency and protecting your plan before the year begins. Can you comment on how much contingency you may have used up and sort of how much room you may have to ﬂex as the year kind of progresses.","Yeah, the ﬁrst quarter, the weather and storm we just talked about were pretty impactful. We came into the year with some challenges. So, through the end of the year, we need normal weather and storm along with some management actions to oﬀset some of that, but we'll need normal weather and storm prevail[ph] to hit our guidance.

"Perfect, that's very helpful. And maybe just one last one, can you sort of compare and contrast the weather normalized residential sales trends that you're showing on slide 13. How does that compare and contrast to your rate case ﬁling. I mean, that's a pretty steep 4.5% decline quarter over last quarter on the residential sales front (inaudible) initially in the last rate case.","Yeah. Our sales we're forecasting or that has come in, they are in line with what we had in our budget and they are really close to what we had in the current rate case as well. We did see people returning to work a little quicker in the ﬁrst quarter than we had expected, but we think that'll bounce oﬀ through the end of the year. So it is very consistent with what we saw, what is ﬁled in this rate case and a little -- a little below what we had in our previous rate case events."
"I just wanted to bring maybe a little bit of a ﬁner point to the question on contingencies here, as you see the balance of the year, you talked about the midpoint is the target for the year for EPS, does that assume kind of you've exhausted contingencies across segments or are there still contingencies in place should something go adverse to plan.","Well, at our Electric business, we've worked through the contingency for that we have for weather and storm combined, so -- but within our other businesses, we are still seeing   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   favorability that can continue to make up for that as we go through the year.     The other thing we're seeing, Jeremy, as well as we initiated our continuous improvement eﬀorts and cost reduction eﬀorts, we are seeing some favorability there as well, which will also be helpful. And just to be clear for everybody on the line as we embarked on these cost reduction eﬀorts, which most of them are one-time eﬀorts to move through this year, we are investing at record levels in our distribution grid. This year we will invest about $1.5 billion in our grid. And also, we have not touched our tree trimming budgets, which both of those two combined are the most impactful things that we will do to make our grid more resilient and more reliable."
"Got it. That's helpful. So just to be clear there, outside of Electric, in the other segments there are still contingencies that could -- that are not in plan yet, that could be used should something move adverse to plan at this point.","Yeah. So, yeah, that's what we've signaled is that there's favorability within those businesses that they can oﬀset other things."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just kind of pivoting away, I guess, to the RNG business within Vantage, just wondering if you could talk a bit about how you see the opportunity set there, kind of you see higher competition. Just wondering how you think about returns in opportunities at this point.","Yeah, primarily our Investment opportunities in RNG are driven by assets that are already under our control, where we're converting existing landﬁlls to produce RNG and so that's what we're seeing opportunities and those are still really nice returns, IRRs that are in sort of north of 10% and into the teens in some instances, unlevered, after tax. So, those feel real good to us. We're also seeing a resurgence in our energy solutions area where we're -- a lot of the sort of repatriation of industrial activity in the United States has given us opportunity to look at incremental investments with some of our large industrial partners. So we're also excited about that line of business."
"I wanted to see just if there's any appetite from your end or just with the State to pursue decoupling going forward, either through a rate case or just overall as a strict strategy or regulatory structure that would be appealing?","You know, traditionally in our area, even in the Midwest, that's not been a practice that's been widely adopted or endorsed. So I -- we don't see that as a high probability outcome. We have not asked for, because it's not something that there seems to be appetite for at this point in time."
"Got it, understood. You know, I was thinking -- I was curious to your view on as you pursue one- time savings initiatives this year, the one-time you obviously get them reversing going forward. Are you thinking about 2024, is there a certain kind of level of headwind or natural oﬀset into 2024, such that there's any risk going forward if you dig too deep on the one-time cuts this year.","Well, certainly the one-time reductions will be reversed and just to be clear, again, these one- time reductions are not areas that would have signiﬁcant impact on reliability and certainly not safety. And we will look through our continuous improvement initiatives to see how much of that can stick, obviously that's something that we're always looking for to make our operations more eﬃcient through our continuous improvement initiatives and as you know, anytime you embark on one of these initiatives, you do ﬁnd opportunity. So we'll try to make some of those continuous improvement initiatives stick, but many of them will be, if at all will be reversed."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. Got it, understood. And I was wondering, how are you thinking kind of strategically about how to manage the more extreme weather that you've been facing in Michigan. I'm wondering if you've obviously laid out a number of CapEx pursuits in O&M targeting, is this something that you could bring as kind of a separate initiative to the Commission, whether it's some kind of undergrounding plan or just weather resiliency types the plan or would you expect it to go through the more traditional rate case process over time.","We have two processes and that's a great question. One is we do have to update our distribution grid plan for the Commission this year and we're in the process of doing that and as you said we really have several realities facing our grid investments. One is, what used to be historic storms that happened every 50 years or every 100 years have now become more frequent and seemed to be happening every three to ﬁve years. So that's one reality.  The second reality is that we've got signiﬁcant demand growth opportunity that we're facing with the electriﬁcation of the transportation ﬂeet and we're also seeing, what I would call, high levels of economic development in our state, especially as the auto industry starts to retool and rebuild to build electric vehicles. So, when we think about all of that and we think about our ﬁve-year plan and 10 and 15-year plans going forward, several things really come out.  One is our ﬁve-year plan right now is projecting approximately $9 billion of investment going into the grid. And there's really three fundamental areas. One is continued grid hardening. Also, the full rebuild of our lower voltage system, our 4.8 kV system, we have approximately 16,000 miles of 4.8 kV system in our grid and that will need to be rebuilt. It is the oldest part of our grid and the need for rebuild is driven by several things, one is age and the need to modernize, but secondly also the ability to accommodate incremental demand due to electriﬁcation of the transportation sector as well as the economic development activity that we're seeing. So that's number two.  Number three, we were pursuing full automation over this period of rebuild, 15 to 20 years, but with the reality of the new storm activity that we're seeing on a more frequent basis, we want to accelerate that at the ﬁve to six years, which is the full automation of our grid. What that will do is it fundamentally move the duration of outages and that's where we need to make the most improvement in our grid in the near-term.  And, of course, the level of investment that we're making in tree trim for ﬁve years through seven-year very aggressive tree trimming program where over the last ﬁve years, we've invested $800 million in tree trim and we'll continue at that pace for a few more years and then we'll return to a more normal pace of aggressive tree trimming once we've sort of remove the backlog, if you will. So those are the fundamental things that you'll see in our distribution grid plan and then obviously as we get support and endorsement for that, that will formulate the basis of our rate cases going forward.  So it's a very good process here in Michigan, where we attempt to get alignment around our distribution -- distribution grid plan and then we -- each year, we take out a piece of that plan, if you will, in our rate cases.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Hey, Jerry. So maybe just picking up on that last one, is there any way some of the things you're thinking about on the liability spend can be factored into the currently pending electric rate case or do you kind of have to wait until this distribution grid plan gets ﬁled and then falls then into future cases.","Some of the -- certainly the grid hardening is already in our plan in this current rate case. The tree trimming is in our current rate case and that's in front of the commission. The beginning of a 4.8 kV rebuild is in -- is in our rate case and actually as part of the infrastructure renewal mechanism or the tracker that we're proposing that we feel there is strong support for, is to start attracting capital investments for this rebuild and the full automation, the acceleration of that is not in our current rate case, but we're going to start anyway. We think this is so fundamental, that we're happy to start this investment and pull-forward this investment and there may be some regulatory lag with that but it won't be signiﬁcant.  And the other thing that I wanted to mention, Michael, this 4.8 kV rebuild, we're going to get really aggressive trying to understand how much of this we can put underground. You know, we've got -- the way I look at it is we're going to rebuild 16,000 miles of grid, the older portions of our grid and we should attempt to put as much of that underground as possible as economically feasible and that's something we're going to start experimenting with. We have several pilots that are in this current rate case, that we're hopeful that the Commission will approve and that will start to get our feet wet and I have actually met with the Mayor of Detroit, Mike Dugan. Him and I talked about how we start that in Detroit and really start to experiment   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   with that as he replaces watermain and we replace gas pipe and we try to attempt to create some synergies here with infrastructure renewables[ph] in the City of Detroit."
"Okay, that's really helpful and Maybe just like with all this incremental spend, how we should just be thinking about the CapEx budget and customer rate impacts. Are there other things that get shifted out or do you see incremental headroom to absorb some of this additional spend on the grid.","Well, we've got $9 billion in our ﬁve-year plan and this year we will invest $1.5 billion in the grid, and we feel that to accelerate -- the piece that will get accelerated here fundamentally is automation. We're going to try to ﬁnd that opportunity inside the $9 billion by becoming more eﬃcient with our capital deployment, but we'll update -- we may also have to increase it modestly over the next ﬁve years, but we'll update that likely in November at EA[ph]."
"Okay, great. And then last thing, I just wanted to circle back to the quarter results and the guide. So, I guess, just to conﬁrm, if we do get more storms or mild weather at the electric business over the summer, how much more can be absorbed there or should we think about that as it starts to become too much to oﬀset.","Well. We have storm budget left, obviously, as we try to move forward in our plan here for the summer. We have assumed normal weather. If we get cooler than normal weather, it will put pressure on the plan, and we'll have to look for other opportunities, but Dave, do you want to add any color to that.     I think that's right. We are looking -- if we have normal storm and normal weather, we're in a good place to hit our guidance, but again, we'd have to ﬁnd some more oﬀsets if things are outside of the normal."
"First question on the reliability spending in automation in particular. Should we expect structural day-to-day O&M savings from these investments. I think the primary goal is to reduce outages, but would these come with (inaudible) customer pressure.","Yes, it's a great question. You know, as you think about automation, just to describe it quickly, you know, you have a interruption caused by tree falling on a wire and taken wires out between two poles for example and what automation gives you the opportunity to do is to isolate that outage and restore customers on both sides of that outage. So, instead of having a 1,000 customers waiting 24 - 48 hours for restoration, you can reduce that impact, perhaps to 100 or 150 customers waiting until that damage is repaired.  So, that's one, makes the restoration faster. So, it starts to kill duration, if you will, of outages, which is where we need to make the most improvement to be best-in-class, if you will, in the industry. And then secondly, Andrew, in terms of eﬃciencies, it points you to the location of the outage. So that you can properly go there more quickly, like right now we have to patrol the circuit and look for the outage and that could be in the middle of the night, which consumes hours. And that just means it's more hours that people are controlling, more costs of restoration, so it make the restoration eﬀorts more eﬃcient and lower cost."
"Okay, great. Then the follow-up to that one is you mentioned a few diﬀerent buckets of reliability spending, in terms of dollars and potential impacts, where do you see the most opportunity or the most value.","The most signiﬁcant investment will really be in two areas and I believe the ﬁrst -- the top one would be the 4.8 kV rebuild and 16,000 miles of rebuild over the next 15 years to 20 years will be the most signiﬁcant investment we've ever made in our grid. This is a portion of the grid that was built anywhere from the 40s to the early 60s, if you will. And secondly is the grid hardening. We've got 46,000 miles of total circuit miles and 16,000 is the 4.8 kV and perhaps another 15,000 to 16,000 is 13.2 kV system, which is a newer system and newer meaning it was built in early 70s and into the modern times here.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We need to make sure that that's hardened because some of that equipment is getting older as well. So, we need to replace old (inaudible) pole top equipment, wires, transformers, so on and so forth and automate that. Those are going to be the two major buckets of investment in the grid, but the automation will also be a signiﬁcant investment, but it won't be as big as the rebuild and hardening that we need to do."
"Okay, that's really helpful and just one last one, if I may. Deferred fuel balances, can you talk about where that stands versus year end levels.","Yeah, on our PSCR we are collecting some this year, we were down -- we were about $400 million cash last year that we're going be collecting this year and over the next year. And then our GCR has come way down, our gas balances has come way down in price. So that was at around $5 last year, and it's now come down into like $3 without a balance there."
"Good morning. I was hoping you could provide some color on kind of how the O&M cuts -- the one time O&M cuts are going thus far, I believe you said on the 4Q call that you had about $120 million of cuts. So, any clarity on where you stand within that number as things stand today given the challenging weather and storm activity from Q1.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah, it's a good question. We came into the year with a challenge and went through our normal process of how we would go about that and setting -- setting some good targets and budgets for our teams and we are well on our way to achieving that. In fact, we are over- achieving a little bit as we've started the year. And again these are -- we have taken advantage of attrition, reduced some of our contractor workforce limit over time and then shifted some of our less time critical work.  So, it's really going very well for us. We're hitting our numbers. Again, we're not doing anything that impacts our customers, impacts our reliability. In fact, we're continuing to invest a lot in everything we need to do to improve and help reliability, but across our business, we're seeing these reductions like really take hold."
"Okay, I understood, and then 120 is to hit the midpoint of guidance, correct.","Yes, that was putting us on target to hit the midpoint."
"Okay, thank you. And then just kind of quickly ﬂipping to the rate case side, it seems like the two big issues in the last electric rate case were kind of a lack of precedent for your forecasting methodology and then a lack of extensive back testing. It looks like you've revised your forecasting methodology slightly in this new case, I mean, the direction it seems more aligned with what you've traditionally used in the past. But if you could provide any color on how you believe you've addressed Commission intervene on concerns sort of as you work through this current case would be appreciated.","Yeah, particularly on sales forecasting and what we had in the last rate case, we are actually seeing the sales come in kind similarly to what we had forecasted. In fact, a little below that. The methodology change you're talking about is we are using some Google mobility data that would help us to -- help us determine the percentage of people coming back to work, that's not available anymore. So we use the (inaudible) data which from Castle[ph], and it's really just as accurate or more accurate.  But, I would say about our forecasting, we're doing a good job, we're right on with what we submitted in the rate case, but there's also a lot less variability in how this forecasting will be done now, because we are kind of working through this return to work, and so we don't really expect there to be the big variations in forecast across groups as we go through this next rate case."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Understood. Yeah, deﬁnitely coming out of the challenging time makes it more straightforward, I imagine. And then just ﬁnally on the rate case front with Commissioner Phillips leaving the MPUC in the coming months. Can you give any clarity on what the process looks like if one of the Commissioners leave, sort of, halfway through your case, is his replacement get to rule on this current case or sort of how we should think about this development playing out.","Yes, what will happen is that the governor and her staﬀ will appoint a new Commissioner to replace Commissioner Philips, and of course we wish Commissioner Philips all the best in his future endeavors. So, that's what will happen. If one is not appointed, two can rule on a rate case and the IRP that is in front of the commission for our Company and I guess the last question you had, yes, the new Commissioner will have the opportunity to weigh in depending on timing, of course, if its late in the process of one or both proceedings and typically they may not choose to participate, but if they have enough time to spend with the case, then they typically do rule on it."
"Okay, thanks so much. That's all from me and congrats again on the quarter.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your line is open.
"Good morning. So, Jerry, you've talked about sort of these one-time O&M cuts this year to get back and arrange and mitigate some of those storms. Obviously, Jerry, you talked about reviewing that as you move forward to what's -- what's permanent and what sticks and what sort of one-time as you work through all of it. I think you're going to have to have that conversation with the Commission as well. Just maybe give us some color and context as we look forward into that conversation of how that conversation has gone in the past, right, there's going to be a debate about what's one-time and what's more permanent.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Absolutely and those conversations are happening and also are continuing to happen with the staﬀ at the Commission to create understanding as to what's one-time and what's permanent. So, I think it's a work-in-progress, Ross, with the Commission staﬀ and ultimately, there'll be a decision, hopefully a settlement here that addresses not only O&M, but also the other features of our capital investment plans and our capital structure and returns and so on and so forth. But we hopeful that we will have settlement in this case, and we'll work really hard to make that happen and we're actually encouraged by what's happening in the IRP. We seemed to be progressing conversations there. So we're going to take the same approach with the rate case."
"Thanks. And excuse me, following-up on sort of Commissioner Philips, I know every time this happens, it's a little bit diﬀerent, but is there a general like average time it's taken to replace a Commissioner when this has happened in the past or should we not look at that as a guide post for looking at this individual process.","I know the process is underway and is already my understanding, obviously we're not on the inside of this, but my understanding is that there is already a list of candidates that are being considered. And so we're encouraged by that, that the Governor's oﬃce is moving quickly on this. So, I would expect in several months that we would have a new Commissioner unless there is diﬃculty that's encountered and ﬁnding the right candidate and I think they're being -- my understanding is that they're being really as they always are selective about who they put on a commission.  In light of the fact that this is a historic time for utilities in Michigan, in terms of investment and really rebuilding the way we deliver energy and also the way we produce energy. So it's really historic time in terms of transitioning the State through a much cleaner and more reliable future."
