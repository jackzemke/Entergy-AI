Question,Answer
"Yeah, Gerry. I think a lot of the legislation discussion has been, in part, addressing the energy policy, but in part kind of trying to get ahead of the CPP a little bit. With the legislation having taken a lot longer than anybody would have expected. Do you see this as a reason or a cause for legislation to slow down again, or a reevaluation of kind of some of these priorities would seem to be focused on addressing CPP issues?","I don't think Mike Nofs will see any reason to slow down. I think he understands that we've got a lot to take care of on the energy front over the next 10 years to 15 years, and that things come and go in terms of regulation, legislation and policy. As I said, I'm not here to speak for Consumers, but they've got a bunch of plants retiring in the near term. We do also, we've been pretty visible with the older plants that are going to be coming oﬄine. So both companies and the state will need to backﬁll those with investments. And this legislation is – really recognizes that we're headed into that period. So, there may be people who really don't like the Clean Power Plan who'd say slow down, stop, but Mike Nofs won't be one of them, nor will we."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And I guess just on the NEXUS front, with two-thirds contracted at this point in time. What is your feeling for when you guys might ﬁll in more of that to get to a fully comfortable position on the pipe? And can you just remind us how much of that is maybe percentage wise covered by utilities rather than producers?","About half of that is utilities and half is producers. And I'd say a couple of things, and then I'll ask Jerry Norcia, who's here and President of the group, to add his thoughts to mine. But I mentioned during my comments that we have very active discussions with other parties interested in the pipe. So we're hopeful that those will play out this year. The other thing I'd say is, we and Spectra both continue to evaluate this pipe, and the fundamentals of it are just so strong. When you look at the fact that it arguably runs into the very best dry gas region in North America, and then connects that to the largest storage hub, market storage hub in the Midwest- Northeast and supplies into Ontario, Michigan, and the Chicago markets via the pipeline networks, that we really are strong believers in the fundamentals.  Get back to the original question, we would think that we'll bring additional demand on this year from some of the discussions we have under way. And then that 1.4 Bcf of interconnection across Northern Ohio, we think, will add demand over time beyond that.  Jerry, any thoughts you'd add in addition to this?     Well, Gerry, you said it extremely well, so, again, I just – really to summarize, pipeline with great market access to Ontario, Michigan, and really supported by LDCs, and I think that really distinguishes this pipe from other pipes. I mean, I think you're seeing that other pipes are somewhat struggling with routing issues out of this basin, as well as market issues. And I think the fact that we've got a strong LDC base distinguished this pipe when we ﬁrst proposed it, and now it's even a greater distinguishing factor.  So we're still very supportive, moving forward. Everything is on schedule from a FERC perspective. The feedback we're getting from FERC is that we've submitted a high-quality product. We've got a great partner in Spectra, that's very experienced in executing these type of projects. So we're feeling real good about where we're at right now with our market, as well as our supply."
"I had a follow-up question on NEXUS. It seems like, on the demand side, it's really strong. How are you – generally, how are you viewing the discussions with the producers right now on the upstream side? Obviously, a lot of guys are feeling pain. Is there any discussion on delaying the pipe, or do you feel strong from that perspective?","It's a really good question, and sometimes (42:06) developments and there's stress in the sector, you have people approaching you, trying to restructure or retime things, and we are just not getting that. And I think it's because of the quality of the assets in the region. So, we continue to get strong support and no waiver from the participants in the project, either producer, and obviously not utility. That answer the question?"
"Yes. That's great. Thank you. And then, on the power and industrial segment, in your Analyst Day, you brought up the steel customer. Could you just talk about the general appetite from industrial customers, given that there's some concern over an industrial recession coming up, and speciﬁcally how that relates to you in your conversations?","So the projects in that industrial portfolio are contracted, but they do roll over. So I think our average duration is seven years or so, but that means every seven years, some of your assets on average are going to roll. But in between, they don't have volume or commodity price sensitivity. So we're not worried about the balance of the portfolio. This one was a coke battery. It rolled at a time when pricing was down, and so we had to roll with the market when we re- contracted. And so, that took some earnings out of that segment, but we had growth elsewhere and we're able to – the segment is not growing this year, but we're able to hold performance. So those are the dynamics. We don't have any other important contracts that have exposure to industrial weakness here."
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"You're welcome.  Operator  And our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Thank you.     Hey, Julien."
"So, perhaps to follow up on the legislative question, just wanted to make sure I am hearing you right. Are you feeling comfortable about the outlook for earnings growth, sort of even if the legislation is delayed beyond this year, or if it just simply doesn't happen? I just wanted to get a sense of the puts and takes in your budget and your comfort within it. Obviously, you work with a certain amount of ""white space."" How are you feeling about it?","I guess I would say, I don't think the implementation of the legislation, if you were to try to draw a direct link between that and earnings, there really isn't one. The legislation was targeted at two things. One is, if we're going to remake our generation infrastructure, we should have a good planning process for doing that. So the legislation focuses on an IRP process, and having a process where a variety of parties can get their oar on the water to talk about what the mix of generation should be. And I still think we need to do that.  The second one was really focused on fairness which was around retail open access. If we're going to be investing in generation, everybody should participate economically in those investments. So, that's a fairness question. But if you try to move from those two things, a good planning process and fairness to our earnings, there really isn't a link between the two. We think the legislation is important to have a really well-deﬁned and fair process for moving forward, but we're going to move on with the distribution investments and the power plant retirements and so forth. Either way, we really have to.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Some of these power plants are just old. I'll give you an example. We got one I can see from where we're doing the call here that just had a major component failure. That unit's not going to run, and we think it's highly likely and the reason is it's just old enough and marginal enough that we've got to move on. And so, we've got numerous assets in that sort of position where we really are evaluating just how much longer it makes sense to invest versus move on. And some of the plants that are from the 1950s and 1960s, it's time to move on. So, when I said earlier, I don't see the early years of the Clean Power Plan, maybe the ﬁrst half of it being aﬀected much, that's why.  Now, when you move on into the later years close to the 2027, 2030, then you'll start to get into some of our larger somewhat newer assets. They could be aﬀected, but I'll tell you, there's a lot to happen between now and then. So there's continued action on NOx and mercury and other fronts, water, that will be thrown into the mix in terms of how we evaluate those plants and their lives. So I think it's really early to talk too much about what this stay might mean for both our earnings and really for the Clean Power Plan because it's very possible that they'll send it down to have a couple of speciﬁc issues reconsidered or reconﬁgured. The EPL address those and then things move on. Or it could be more fundamental than that. And we really don't know right now. So, hopefully, that gives you some help in the way we're thinking about it."
"Great. And just to follow up on the white space question. I'd be curious, in the slide deck, it seems that you haven't included the white space CapEx. Again, is there anything to read between the lines on that? How are you feeling about particularly the midstream side of the equation when it comes to the ability to execute the upside here? Is there something we should be reading from the slides here?",Were you talking speciﬁcally GSP or were you talking in the utilities?
"Well, I was thinking – well, I mean, you tell me on the white space, either way, with the Michigan legislation and/or what's going on in midstream, if that has kind of come in on you? I suppose the question was more speciﬁc to the midstream side, and I'm thinking more on the gathering potentially, but more broadly. Is there ability still to execute on the upside here?","I'll address both. So I think we previously have talked and I mentioned earlier that particularly in the distribution side of the electric utility, there's a lot of demand for investment there. So we've got the $6.5 billion in our base plan. I said that if you look at the fundamentals of the aging of that infrastructure and the reliability needs, the constraining factor is not how much demand there is for investment. There's a lot of investment needed. So we're really metering that tied to customer aﬀordability. And that has not changed since we talked about it at the Analyst Day in the fall. It's very much the same picture.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   On the midstream side, nothing has changed in terms of, if you look out over the ﬁve-year period, what we think is going to happen in the Marcellus and Utica regions and the amount of activity there.  I mentioned the gas sector is very, very diﬀerent from the power sector. Put gas wells on the ground and a year later the average decline is 15%. So you've just got to continually drill in order to meet the growing demand for natural gas.  And in doing that, I think one of the messages we've seen out of the stress in the E&P sector is it needs to rationalize, and people are going to rationalize it to the very best drilling locations. And I'm not blowing smoke when I say that the Susquehanna County and the Marcellus and the area of the Utica that NEXUS serves are the very best dry gas geology in the country.  And so, through simple common sense, you come back to say, these are going to be very high- activity areas over the next ﬁve years. And so our continued sense is NEXUS is a good project and that there'll be more development and expansion of Millennium are tied to those factors.  In the very near term this year, does the E&P sector need to work some things out? Obviously. We're watching that closely, we're managing it, but I think long-term fundamentals, you get down the road a number of years, this will be in the rearview mirror."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So it looks to me like you guys just tried to sort of evolve your slide deck a little bit. One of the other – I apologize if you've answered this already. Slide 14, you no longer have the upside case of $10 billion and change for potential spend in the utilities. I am not assuming that you're signaling the bet's oﬀ the table. You just kind of modiﬁed your slide a little bit. Is that fair?","Yeah. It's analogous to the last question (51:25) There's no change in plan or need. We just got the base case shown here. But I think it was in the Analyst Day we showed that if you talk about what's in our plan at $6.5 billion, you talk about what we look at as fundamental demand for renewed infrastructure. It's more or like $10.5 billion. And how we walk between those two really has to do with demands of customers for reliability versus aﬀordability. And what we've got in the base plan of $6.5 billion, we think is a good walk between the two. That make sense or answers the question? I think it gets that where you were asking."
"Yeah, 100%. Second question, you always talk about your internal planning is for sort of 7% to 8% overall operating earnings growth, and then after share issuance and contingency, you seek to be in or at the high end or above your 5% to 6% earnings growth target. So your share issuance number now over the next several years is obviously going to be a lower number because of bonus depreciation. But should we assume that if you were to theoretically update that slide, the operating earnings growth rate would be slightly lower but the share issuance would be slightly lower, and you'd be in the same place because of bonus?","Yeah. Peter, you might want to just take the topic of bonus and the way it impacts us as a company because it's a little diﬀerent from the way it may impact some other companies. I'll let Peter answer that and see if it gets at your question. If it doesn't, we'll pick it up from there.     Hey, Greg."
"Got you. Yeah. So if I were to summarize, if you were – if I go to page 12 of your December business update, you give a bar (54:13) that says we aspire to grow operating earnings 7% to 8% and then after share issuance and contingency we're at 5% to 6%. Theoretically, 7% to 8% is slightly lower but the share issuance is also lower and net-net, you're still in that 5% to 6% range. Is that fair?","Yeah. That's a good way. And if you look at the remix of the guidance from the early outlook, we did temper down the Electric segment a bit because of the rate case from the ROE. We did temper down a little bit as we reﬁned the impact of the contract in the power and industrial segment. So that was oﬀset by the reduced share issuance to hold us at the point of the early outlook.     And then I think more broadly, your take is right that given our combination of our tax position and equity issuance, when you – bonus does aﬀect growth in the utility side because it's eﬀectively zero return cost of capital. But it's very minimal impact on EPS, given the dilution oﬀset we have. So it doesn't turn out for us to be a material factor."
"Gerry, one comment you made was that you see opportunities in the face of market dislocation in the pipeline space. Can you be a little more speciﬁc about what kinds of things you might be alluding to, how signiﬁcant they could potentially be and how close you are – we are, you think, to the point where something might actually materialize? How do you manage the sort of quality bias in the portfolio through something like that?","A couple of comments. So you've been watching the sector and there are obviously companies stressed. Now, companies tend to ﬁrst hold on and then try to push out assets that they really don't want. They really don't want them; we don't either, generally speaking. We've had some people approach us with assets of interest. I wouldn't say we're close on those, but I think we got to watch across the balance of the year as companies continue to deal with pressures, and I think there will be asset sales that result from that.  Our cost of capital is much better positioned than it was a year ago to look at those. So we don't have anything built into our plan right now tied to this. We're simply signaling that the environment is pretty diﬀerent than it was a year ago. We think there are going to be assets to change hands, and we're open to that, if the right one comes along. That said, we're not going to do things that aren't strategic or that we don't feel good about. No sense buying things that really don't have much upside or strategic value to you. So we're working our way through it, and we'll see what comes of it."
"Could you talk a little more there about what you would see as being particularly, strategically interesting? Is it more pipe, is it storage? Is it...","It would be pipe, potentially gathering, but I'll let Jerry Norcia comment on that as President of the union.     Yes. So we got a handful of conversations underway where we're looking at say – I would say, primarily assets that are tied to gathering and transmission to main lines. I think as we see   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   producers under a lot of stress, they are looking to monetize assets. And I think as Gerry said, we're being very selective. Some of the ﬁrst opportunities that we've seen are perhaps not as strategic as we would like, but like I said, we continue with a handful of conversations that we're hopeful would yield some value for us here."
"Okay, great. Thank you. Just one another topic, we were slightly surprised that you ﬁled your electric case so soon after the last one. We thought you would kind of try to leave a little bit more time. But any comments about what drove the timing there, something we should – some context we could put around it.","Well, I think a couple of things. One, it had been a very long time since our prior rate case. So there was a lot that we were addressing in the rate case directly proceeding. And then, if you simply look at the pace of capital expenditure last year and projected this year and the forward test year, it's a signiﬁcant spend that we have underway, and we need a rate case to deal with that.  So I think historically, we've tried to spread our rate cases out and have been pretty successful in doing that. Our prior case had been four years since the preceding case. That won't be the case in the future, given where things stand. We're investing in both distribution and generation at a healthy enough pace that we're going to need to be in every year, year-and-a-half.     I think, just even to add on that, to give you a perspective, the case we just ﬁled is $1 billion rate base increase, on ﬁnal order we just received. To just give you the sense of, I'd say, the pace of capital spend that we have over and above depreciation."
"(59:59) so that comment you just made, every year to 18 months, is kind of the new expectation.","Yeah, I think it is.     I would say, probably in every calendar year, at some point in that year, we'll be ﬁling."
"Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",Thank you.  Operator  And our next question is from Mr. Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc.
Did you talk about the earnings impact of bonus depreciation?,"We did. Generally said that, given the share issuance eﬀect, the combination of the two makes it a very modest impact for us. So it's not a signiﬁcant player in our plan (1:00:45) pulls our share issuance down fundamentally. Does have some impact in utility earnings, but the two heavily oﬀset each other."
That lower utility earnings is all bonus depreciation?,"There is bonus depreciation, and for the Electric segment, there was a ﬁne tuning of the ROE (1:01:37)   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Thank you. And then lastly, at gas storage and pipes, as you look at your counterparties, or potential counterparties, are there any parties out there that are causing a little bit of credit concern?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, I think, if you look at the whole sector, there is quite a few that – whose share prices have come down fundamentally and are sub investment grade. So we're watching those. But as I said earlier, we don't – so they are sub investment grade, but we aren't picking up, in our counterparties, kind of the scramble to rework timing or rework commitments. In fact, on one of our pipe positions, we had credit requirements that caused them to post collateral, and they went ahead and did it, because the position is important to them, and so they want to continue on. So we'd be silly not to be watching our counterparties carefully, but we haven't seen any yet that have tilted into the mode where we think there's something near term."
"Just one quick one. One quick one here. As I look at the past few years of EPS growth versus DPS growth, your earnings have been growing by about almost 100 basis points faster. Obviously, that's going to be putting downward pressure on the payout ratio. Any thoughts on potentially increasing the dividend growth rate going forward? Obviously, you're still planning 5% to 6% earnings growth, as you talked about, but in order to catch up the payout ratio, any thoughts on maybe accelerating the dividend growth?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We've been working that payout ratio. So we have a stated payout ratio. And what we've generally done is, push it up into the middle of the payout range, and it falls back to the front end, and we push it back up to the middle. So that pattern is probably what you can expect in the future. You're right. We've grown earnings a bit faster than we have dividend, so we'll keep an eye on what you suggested."
"Just very quickly. I think you've answered most of my questions. So, basically, if I'm to understand it, you see turmoil, you're monitoring it in the E&P and other energy sector, commodity sectors, but you really see no potential or signiﬁcant potential, at least in the near term, of anybody not being able to meet their commitments as a counterparty or as a partner or anything like that, correct?",Right. We don't see any evidence of that. And...   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Okay. Great. And then just ﬁnally on the legislation, how should we think about the delays and stuﬀ? I mean, what are the sticking points, if there are any? Is there any particular issue that seems to be sort of holding it up or causing more of a problem in terms of sort of nailing it down?","Well, I think there was – there were – predictably, there are some parties on the retail open access (1:07:42) do prefer the things simply stay the way they are. So there was some noise about that. I think the key to that would be putting together, I mentioned a coalition, and Senator Nofs is working on a coalition. I think the key is to get a business coalition that comes together and says, actually, these are the right things to do. It's the right future direction for the state and it's fair. And I think we'll be able to put that business coalition together.  So, you can probably imagine who it was saying that retail open access is ﬁne just the way it is. It was some alternative providers and a few people that they were backing. But I do think we'll be able to deal with that issue.  Beyond that, there are – I'd say there's some back and forth on exactly what the IRP process should look like, but I don't think that will be a hold up."
