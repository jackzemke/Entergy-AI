Question,Answer
"Hey. So, quick ﬁrst question, perhaps obvious, given the trailing 12 months, what are you thinking here in terms of the fourth quarter in implied results? It seems perhaps it could even be potentially down year-over-year. Is there something about reinvestment, O&M, et cetera? You might imagine.","Yeah, we'd just like to reiterate that we are conﬁdent with the earnings guidance that we put out there. The electric utility in particular last year was on a lean mode. That's really, if you're looking quarter-over-quarter, kind of a fourth-to-fourth, that's what you're seeing happening there."
"Got it. So, does that actually mean that there is added strength or more of a tailwind that you're reinvesting in the fourth quarter into 2016 or perhaps, as you just alluded, was it more of a 4Q 2014 phenomenon such that this is more of a normalized pace in 4Q 2015?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","It's more the latter, last year's fourth quarter phenomenon."
"Got it. Excellent. And then perhaps secondly, just of late, any developments on the gathering front with Southwestern?","Our gathering business is going very well, and as you know, our raising of guidance in that segment in particular was with the volumes associated with the gathering with the Southwestern Energy. So, the well performance is great. Their drilling program continues to be strong in that region, and their gathering earnings are ﬂowing nicely there."
"Hey. Just on the legislation in Michigan, with the hearings done, do you guys have a read on when something can get formalized or resolved between the House and the Senate and a vote where this ﬁnally gets cauterized. Is there something that we can look forward or is there a schedule you guys see right now?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   It's not a ﬁrm schedule, but as I mentioned, the extensive hearing process is done and as you know you mentioned that as well. There are some ﬁnalization of language that will happen both in the Committee and the House and then they will move it (23:24) the Senate and the House and from there, there will be reconciliation. We're anticipating that will start happening early next month, but going more likely into the month of December."
"Okay. And then I guess your second question when you think about the – it looks like you're going to the idea that Choice has to get a ﬁrm capacity somewhere between three years and ﬁve years. Is that something that you guys would look at providing, or are you not going to be in the business of oﬀering capacity to those customers?","No, we're not in the business of oﬀering capacity to those customers. We'll oﬀer to our customers."
Okay. What is the year-to-date weather beneﬁt on that after the good third quarter?,"Jeﬀ, you have that?     Yes. Ask that one more time just to make sure we're answering what you're looking for.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"How much year-to-date weather beneﬁt have you guys gotten? Because you gave the quarter, I don't know if you had the year handy?","Yeah. So, for the full year, if you go back to page 24 in the pack, I think that's what you're asking, so I will just guide you back there. So, versus normal, I'm on the left-hand side there in the middle, see DTE Electric 2015 and see what it was for the quarter, and we talked about that. And for the year-to-date, you can see it's at $12 million."
"Okay. And my last question just on the pipeline tap-ins now that you got 1.4 Bcf of potential customers, when do those start converting either in the contracts or something more substantial and what should we be tracking other than just kind of these quarterly updates?","That will happen over time as the pipe gets built. That 1.4 Bcf is nonbinding, but we do anticipate that a number of that will potentially turn into nice investments for us lateral or gathering type of opportunities. That will more likely happen once we're done with the construction of the pipe."
"Just wanted to follow up on the guidance and the full-year guidance kind of implying that the fourth quarter would be down year-over-year. You already commented on some reinvestment at Electric. It looks like at the non-utility segments, the guidance also implies earnings would be lower year-over-year. Could you talk about what might be driving that or should we kind of expect that the Electric reinvestment could oﬀset some of the earnings there?","Yeah. The electric utility is, we mentioned, I'm feeling comfortable with the guidance range we have out there. There was a phenomenon last year, fourth quarter, around lean. We're in a normal investment cycle this year in the fourth quarter. But our non-utility businesses are performing strong. On a year-to-date basis, there's strong performance. And if that strong performance continues in the fourth quarter, those businesses will more likely end up in the upper end of those ranges."
Great. Thanks. And just hoping you could provide a little more color on the change in timing in CapEx at Power & Industrial projects.,"Mark, you want to take that one?     Sure. So, that, as you mentioned, is timing related. When we did our original guidance for the year, and we provided a range this year on the non-utility businesses, recognizing that those businesses and the timing of the way a project show up has some variability. As we get closer to yearend, we have better visibility as to what's going to occur here yet in 2015 versus what may occur early in 2016. So, it's a timing-related item at Power & Industrial speciﬁcally. If you step back and look at our early outlook for 2016 and the growth plan that we provided at our Investor Day, this has no impact on any of that. It's really just a timing item."
Got it. And is there any speciﬁc projects that you can highlight there or...,"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I'd just add a little commentary to Mark's comments. The Power & Industrial projects, in particular, we do have an acquisition strategy there where if it's opportunistic, we'll acquire small on-site related type of projects. And they have the tendency to be kind of lumpy in terms of when they show up. And when they do show up, we've had one back a few years ago with the Duke projects and the on-site projects. So there, I don't want to be too concerned. When they do show up, sometimes they show up and they're relatively sizeable. We'd like to have a placeholder in with the capital for that business unit in particular. So, it's really just timing related to these small acquisitions we'd like to do in the Power & Industrial segment."
"Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to revisit just timing of the legislature you laid out when you – the steps you see. Are there some deadlines that we need to hit in order for this to be all accomplished in calendar 2015? When do the session end, and at what point would we need to see it out of conference? How much wiggle room is there I guess?","This is not a ﬁrm schedule. The ultimate deadline is before they move to the holiday break which will be the back half of December. But the momentum we're seeing right now with the hearings being concluded, like I said, there'll be some tweaking of the language from both the House and the Senate and then, at that point, a reconciliation. The good thing is both the House and the Senate, especially with Eric Nesbitt's move to move a bit closer to where Mike Nofs is at, I see that process hopefully happening relatively quick once it starts."
"Good morning. Just one question on the decoupler. I know it's a little bit preliminary, but Peter, are you looking for a full decoupler which takes any kind of load out of your earnings mix or sort of more of a partial decoupler that accounts for energy eﬃciency in DSM?","We'll explore all the options. The ﬁrst is you kind of get that option for the electric utility to have a decoupler in legislation. That's being proposed right now. So, we like that to give us that option, the ﬂexibility. As we're thinking about it, we really would want it really focused on the energy eﬃciency. That's our early thinking at this moment."
"Got it. Got it, okay. So, you have some potential leverage to macro probably okay. And then just on the pipe, 1.4 Bcf is non-binding, but it's a little bit preliminary. But is there any indication that you could reach that through laterals and compressors from a demand side or it's too early?","The overall pipe we're putting in is a 1.5 Bcf, that's expandable to 2 Bcf with compression. The major markets, when this pipe ﬁrst was put in was gone and Michigan, as Michigan goes from a coal plant to gas plant conversion. So, it's really nice, actually, this Ohio market is actually showing up as well. That wasn't originally anticipated. We kind of knew that when we placed this pipe. We deliberately placed it in the Northeast Ohio around these industrial centers. So, we're hoping that this 1.4 Bcf – a portion of that gets converted over to this industrial lobe which are the ones (31:18) will spur the lateral and gathering. But we feel comfortable right now that we'll be able to expand the pipe to meet that. That'll be a nice problem to have."
"Yeah, exactly. Thanks, Peter. Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   We have no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","I'd like to thank everybody for this morning, joining us on the call. And once again, we're going to be at EEI and hope to see many of you there. Have a great day.  Operator  This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.
