Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about how far you are along on track for P&I replacement of one-third of the expected $40 million for new projects that you have targeted for 2021.","Good morning, Michael.     Yeah, we, we have announced three projects this year. And this quarter we announced the details that we've been talking about this Industrial Energy Services project at the Ford complex. So this is real visible sign that we are right now, one-third of the way there in terms of the backﬁll. We are targeting at this point $40 million of backﬁll for 2020, which is a good portion -- a portion of the REF earnings, the REF are short duration contracts that we have asked our Power and Industrial segment to backﬁll a portion of that with long-term contracted earnings. We have also have a great pipeline of additional opportunities that we're looking at, and at EEI, we are actually go into lot more detail on the nature of those opportunities."
"Got you, and for Nexus, are we -- at this point, when do you expect to start construction, and is there any remaining FERC rate issues that need to be dealt with?","I have Dave Slater here, the President of our -- that business unit. I will have them answer your question.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah, Michael. We actually commenced construction on the 16th of October. So we're underway and it's primarily right away work that we're commencing and we have a plan to do a number of HDDs working on the compressor stations and that will play out over the course of the winter, with main line pipeline construction commencing in the spring."
"Got it . Okay, well, thank you very much. And I'll cede to somebody else at this point.","Thanks Mike.  Operator  We'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.     Hi, Greg."
"Thanks, well I will table the questions on Power and Industrial's future outlook for you guys, give you a question on that. So when we look at the quarter the underlying growth trends that you're seeing in terms of economic outlook at DTE Electric, I know the weather has been pretty big swing in earnings over the last few quarters. We're seeing really strong economic activity, across the board here.  My Chief Economist this morning just pointed out how strong the data looks, both in the US and globally. Are you seeing from the auto industry or any other big industrial segments in your service territory signs of accelerating growth? And how would that impact your outlook?","Yeah, we are seeing -- for us the best indication of the unaligned economic growth is, we take a look at customer counts within the region. So we are seeing a steady increase. We have seen a steady increase for last ﬁve or six years, of about a 0.5%, and I would say overall the Michigan economy has been diversifying over the years, and I think it's very solid and we continue to see solid performance.  And for the automotives and the automotives right now, they were at a pretty high level of 80 [ph] million units. Now they're talking about 60 [ph] million units which still is a good level for them to make some proﬁtability. But overall there I'd put it more -- characterize it as solid economics for Michigan."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   okay. So you are not seeing any change to the upside.,"At this point, we are still projecting it by relatively ﬂat loads, probably underlying growth of around 1%, but we continue to see energy eﬃciency happening. And we have a really robust energy eﬃciency program that paying dividends for us, but it's relatively ﬂat. That what we are planning for on a ﬁnancial basis."
"Hey, so a quick question on the P&I side real quickly, does the additional projects, has it shifted all the roll-oﬀ and the timing of those credits at all by any meaningful amount, or is that still sort of the expectation that you laid out before.","The expectation is these -- there will be a roll-oﬀ in 2020, and then 2022. These projects -- this has been a great business line for us, as you know, a lot of earnings, a lot of cash. These additional projects will actually, more than anything give us additional cash. We have a signiﬁcant investment program ahead of us, that we are targeting right now. You'll hear at EEI, we're really targeting kind of in state, non-REF, post REF. For each of the business lines we will give an update at EEI."
"Got it. And then turning back to the utility real quickly, some of your peers are talking about Greene's Harrison [ph] oﬀering those as another growth avenue at the electric utility side in Michigan. Any opportunity there on your side, you guys are looking at?","We have a Green (inaudible), and obviously, we'll continue to work. That's deﬁnitely an area of focus for us and our commission and our customers. We do have a program similar to that."
"Got it. Excellent. All right, well thank you very much. Really appreciate it.",Thanks.  Operator  We'll go next to Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Let me just -- I know you are going to discuss this a little bit more at EEI, but it sounds like, from your prepared comments you've done a very good job of ﬁlling sort of any kind of gaps, as the earnings step down from REF, and it doesn't appear, or that there is a concern that the fact that you're adding additional incremental sites that you're just essentially the earnings cliﬀ is sort of growing. So is there a concern there or do you sort of talk about, at EEI are you going to account for that, is it the tenure of the contract.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yeah, that is a good question. The REF units does -- do provide over and above what we originally had, but it really cash at the end of the day for us, that really is going to help us near term. But we are targeting right now a post-REF, basically plan that gets us to the 5% to 7% growth proﬁle. I wouldn't think about this as additional earnings. Actually it's good news, good additional cash. We're going to continue to optimize this business unit over [ph] the next year or so, to  continue to deliver value in cash."
"okay, great, that's helpful. And I guess we'll get more color at EEI. And then just on Nexus, do you plan on providing any sort of updates as far as the -- any updates to aﬃrm commitments or interconnection agreements at EEI.","Yeah, at EEI, we deﬁnitely will provide a more thorough update around Nexus how we're -- how we're seeing about that. We will also try to give you a sense of where we are in terms of looking at the potential opportunities out there in terms of contracts, new contracts."
"Okay. And just to clarify, I think was Julien's question, these new sites at REF don't change the timing of the wind down but just are more cash producing?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah, that is the way to think about it."
And then just Nexus has slipped from late '17 to 3Q '18. Can you kind of -- what -- is it still negligible impact on earnings power on '18?,"Yeah, the way to think about it, is that -- and we do get the AFUDC accounting. We have talked about that. So it is pretty minor for '18, okay."
"Can I just ask on -- so on the guidance increase for this year on the P&I segment, is there -- is that all REF or is there anything else going on behind the scenes?","It is all REF. We've had two guidance changes. The ﬁrst one was related to REF as well, which was really more volume and capacity, really good plant performance at existing sites. And this is related to new incremental units that we have."
So the rest of P&I is just unchanged or is that actually -- could that have strong kind of REF is growing more or what's the dynamic between the two?,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   One way to [ph] think about this from a normalized basis is go back to the original guidance for that segment. And that's the way --
"Okay, and just more general -- I know you are going to talk more about the strategy further out, but I just want to be clear that what you're announcing today, this Ford deal is the large CHP deal that you've been talking about really since the beginning of the year.","That is -- yeah that is correct, Jon. And it's really -- kind of given you the details of this exciting new project."
"Right, and the other two are the landﬁll gas transactions that you announced I think two quarters ago, now.","That is correct. And we'll give you more update around the nature of these bunch of new opportunities, and how we are booking for -- at the segments."
"Right, I just had the sense that you -- earlier in the year, you would have been anticipating having more of this to announce by now. So I am just curious what the -- how -- if you can   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   comment on the sort of momentum, in the -- currently and ﬁlling in this gap as opposed to maybe the sort of plan.","We are -- we actually internally, we do track this. We are on target right now with the backﬁll. I think that we have a few years for the backﬁll to occur. This segment overall has 70 projects. So we knew, it's going to be a handful of projects replacing the portion of REF -- REF in P&I segment to replace. So in terms of pro rata actually they are -- we have done really good right now with the projects that we executed as well as those are in the pipeline."
"Okay. And is this sort of -- I think the last time you talked on this, the idea was it would be pretty more skewed towards the smaller landﬁll gas deals then additional forward type deals, is that still the thinking?","yeah. All these opportunities we kind of bid them out [ph]. Those are the two areas right now that we're looking at. It's hard to say which ones will come from one segment or the other, at the end of day, but both of them will -- this is one area in particular that we'll talk about in a little more detail at EEI, to give you the sense of the nature of these type of opportunities."
"Thank you. Peter, the Ford project, you have an ongoing relationship with Ford. Is this just a one- oﬀ or is this -- should we anticipate that maybe Gerry talks about what's downstream with Ford additional CHP projects?","Yeah, this is really -- they are going through -- like a lot of the automotives, Ford particularly has gone through how do they set themselves up for the future. And so they are redesigning and upgrading to campus. This research engineering center was one, in particular. And they wanted to have renewable green power there and they partnered with us. So it is a special kind of one type of project, but we do have a great relationship with Ford, as you mentioned."
"You have assembly plants that you provide a similar service to them, to Ford [ph]?","Yeah on site energy. Yeah, we provide the onsite power, chilled water, utility type of services at the assembly plants. Yeah, and so this one would be under a newly constructed. It's more of a -- on the campus really housing their engineering center."
"Okay. Well, congratulations on that. Thank you. Look forward to hearing Gerry's presentation at EEI.","Thank you, Charles.  Operator  We will go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So -- sorry to sort of go over this REF thing but I am not completely clear. I understand you guys are doing better in that business, et cetera, but you also mentioned the impact of -- by -- sound like it was partners. I was just wondering if you could describe a little bit more detail. I was just was missing in terms of what that impact was or what I am -- if you could just clarify that again?","Yeah, no, I deﬁnitely will clarify it. These projects generate tax credit, that's really where the value of those tax credits -- those tax credits are immediate for us. And we can utilize that in the future, going forward for [ph] tax, tax cash. When we look at our cash position right now in terms of our taxes, it makes sense for us for some of these projects to enter into partnerships where we essentially sale a pro-rata piece of the partnership and the credit. So it's really the -- for us is the timing of this, that we are in the process now of looking for some partners for these units. In the meantime, we're enjoying some really good earnings around these projects. But we will be entering some partnerships. So it's a really an earnings for cash trade [ph], so you'll just see this in the segments over the next year or two. If there's additional relocations we may do -- you may see a temporary kind of up in earnings related to tax credits. But as we maximize cash and value kind of a down a bit on those on that op."
"Okay. So this is sort of a temporary beneﬁt because of the increased REF tax credits but that will be decreasing, I guess in the next few years as you're monetizing it with these partners, is that the way to think about it?","Right as we start to permit [ph] out the cash now, and we have a signiﬁcant investment portfolio ahead of us, so this deﬁnitely -- the cash is needed now to help fund that."
"And what is the -- how much should we think about that, REF earnings projection going -- as we go forward in this, how should we think about that earnings associated with REF, could you quantify that a little bit more?","Yeah, we -- the way to think about this segment overall, is you look back at the original guidance in the segment, which was it would go up to the $95 million. So once we get through a lot of this, so the partnership monetization, and getting the cash outﬂow, we will peg it back to a normalized REF. So these units are going to be throwing up additional cash and some earnings for us over the next few years. But you can think about it by looking back at the original guidance. That's the best way to do it."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And then just in terms of the Ford deal, how much of that you are going to be -- how much CapEx is associated with that?",We haven't disclosed that amount? At this point in time we will -- once again it is a great investment for us and part of that overall backﬁll strategy for REF units.
"Actually all my questions were asked. Just one follow-up, just on the Ford announcement. So that's a one-oﬀ, there's no expansion opportunities there on that one particular project?","No, it's an -- kind of onsite project for us with their new engineering. We have additional opportunities, with similar type of ﬁnancial projects with other type of customers. But this one really is -- it's just kind of a standalone type of project. Once again we're very excited to be working with Ford on this one."
"Okay, great. And then at EEI, will we get numbers around that project, just to kind of ﬁgure out what the opportunity is longer term on other similar projects or that will just be part of overall the guidance that you give?","We will give a description of this area little bit more, and the nature of potential opportunities, additional opportunities in this area, we will provide that at EEI.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Just a question on the -- on the monetizing the REF credits going forward, do you have like a deferred balance right now that you would monetize, or is it just basically selling the earning stream to somebody else going forward?","It's really selling the earnings stream yeah, we do -- yeah, we not -- do have a deferred balance on our balance sheet. That's the reason why we -- periodically we take a look at this and see what the cash value to us in the future on tax beneﬁts versus monetizing and getting into a partnership."
"Okay. And in the original guidance, we go back to our early look from EEI last year. I think the P&I segment was 90 million to 100 million, which I think is the base you were pointing back to. What's the REF percentage or REF amount in there?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We really don't give that type of disclosure, but I can tell you that this segment overall is supported by 70 projects -- this segment for last 20 years. It is a series of a lot of diﬀerent projects. They basically come and go. Currently at the moment, a good majority of the earnings right now is related to the REF projects. And that's one of the reasons why we have a bank [ph] of strategies. So we've asked -- got these real short-term duration earnings. A portion of that we're going to add to our P&I segment to -- at the backdrop. But probably a straight answer is the majority of earnings at this point in time is really through REF. But we're very excited in terms of the new projects and really terming out those short-term earnings in terms of long- term contracted earnings."
But in the original guidance?,"Yeah, the original guidance, we did have the 11. And this, -- these are really related to -- we had two incremental, potentially projects come online. One of them was a relocation, and we potentially continue -- may continue to do that over the -- over the near term. The other one was an acquisition. So they are both ran, but this is related to the timing of getting into these partnerships. So we're recognizing now and beneﬁting from the tax credit earnings and when we start the partnerships we will be beneﬁting from the near term cash ﬂow stream."
"I got you, and just last thing, the 5 to 7 earnings growth is oﬀ the original guidance and that's what we should be using as a base to project through the out years?","Yeah, I'd say for now that would be the best approach."
And what is the original guidance?>,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   It was a midpoint of 5.31..
"A midpoint of 5.31, that's what we should go 5% to 7%.","Yeah, and we just -- and I don't we have it in our current presentation. But if you go back to original guidance, that's the best -- the project really normalizes for weather at both of our utilities, as well as for the REF, (multiple speakers) We will be giving you an update here at EEI in terms of our growth rate projections and how to think about that going forward."
"Perfect, thank you very much.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Peter, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Thank you everybody for joining us this morning, and I deﬁnitely look forward to seeing a number you here at EEI over the next couple of weeks. And once again, I think we have a really good message to tell and we'll give you the update, as I mentioned earlier. Till then have a good rest of the day.
