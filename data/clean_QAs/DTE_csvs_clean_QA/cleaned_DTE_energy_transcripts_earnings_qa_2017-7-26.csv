Question,Answer
And I think you mentioned that you're in talks to expand Link further with producers. Can you give us an indication how far along those discussions are? What point may you be able to discuss the natural expansion with some numbers around it?,"We're seeing the producers – it's Jerry Norcia. We're seeing the producers drill and ﬁll their capacity positions, and we are on a number of conversations that could lead to an expansion. But we haven't secured any of those at this point. But we're feeling very good, both the volumes and the drilling ramp that we're seeing, and the reserves that these producers are drilling into. It's certainly proceeding well in line with plans.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   One thing to remember about that pipeline is it had capacity available for producers to expand into. So one of the key jobs was to ﬁll up that volume, and as Jerry just said, we're feeling very encouraged by the pace of drilling and the level of activity in the area, and the growth we're seeing on the pipe."
"Okay. And just to conﬁrm also that we're still at 1.75 Bcf for the, it's the backlog of interconnect agreements, right, on NEXUS? Has that number changed, or are we still two-thirds contracted at this point?","Still two-thirds contracted, and, yes, the 1.75 Bcf of interconnect agreements is what we have."
"So, just let me ask you a follow-up question on NEXUS. What's the inﬂection point on the additional ﬁrm capacity? So what I'm – I guess what I'm trying to get at is, do you – knowing what you know now, do you expect additional interconnection agreements to transfer to ﬁrm as you get a FERC certiﬁcate, or do you expect the additional demand-pull to come when you're well under way in construction?","We've got – as you mentioned, we've got signiﬁcant interconnectivity along the NEXUS Pipeline, that I think will yield more ﬁrm contracts.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   In terms of timing, a lot of the conversations are revolving around providing those potential shippers with certainty as when the pipeline will go into service. And I think the moment that we get a FERC certiﬁcate and we start construction, we'll start to move to close on some of those ﬁrm service agreements."
"Excellent. And then, Gerry, I think we've discussed, you're pursuing a bit of a – some sort of a capital tracking mechanism on the electric side. Is there any status there, and when do you expect this study due? And then how does that sort of ﬁt as far as your coal retirement and in your carbon reduction targets?","So I think step one in working with the commission is work we're doing on a distribution investment plan. So we were asked by the commission to ﬁle a ﬁve-year look at distribution investments. And we took that as a very positive collaborative eﬀort. They understand that we need to invest to modernize the system, to automate the system, to improve reliability and so forth, and it's a signiﬁcant investment. So, the ﬁling is really for them to understand it better and for the commission and DTE to be on the same page. That's step one.  The second question is, how to fund that construction? And I think there is some interest on both sides for alternative mechanisms for the portions of that build that are straightforward and well understood, once the plan is well understood. But I guess I'd say, I wouldn't put the cart before the horse, so to speak. We want to get a good plan that's understood by the commission. And then if we can put a recovery mechanism in place that helps both sides, that's great; if not, we'll proceed as normal. I'd expect those sorts of discussions to be – about recovery mechanisms to potentially be playing out next year, after we work our way through the distribution plan this year."
"Got it. And then in a successful, if you get a capital tracking mechanism under the assumption that it's something that's substantial, expect to stay out of a rate case for multiple years (25:17)?","Well, that would be one of the advantages, would be to spread out the time between cases and keep the cases focused on the things that really are out of normal, so to speak. So if we can have routine things covered in tracking mechanisms and the non-routine things covered in cases, that would be ideal. But, again, I think that's an agenda we'll work next year once we've got greater clarity on – an agreement on the investment agenda itself."
"Peter, sorry about the Tigers, but all you got to do is get hot in August, right? 8.5 games is not that bad. Just quickly on P&I, do the stronger expected earnings at P&I also go away as the REF credits expire, or is there a higher expected ending point when – what's that (26:17) 2021?","Yeah. Our REF units will expire in tranches, the ﬁrst one is the end of 2020, so 2021, and the other one being 2022. So this is tied to those units and the credits that will expire in that timeframe."
"Okay. More earnings in cash in the near term, but the uptick here also rolls oﬀ in 2021?",That's correct.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
Can we just talk about the – are there any drivers in the 3% or down 3% industrial growth here today or just some of the puts and takes there?,"Yeah, some of its related to the auto production. There is some retooling as they move over to new models, that's part of it. The other is the steel-related earnings, which we make very little margin on, were down quarter-over-quarter."
"Okay. And then just lastly, I didn't see mention of the 5% to 7% EPS growth rate, is everything still intact there or is it just kind of lumpy from year-to-year just given the last two strong years?",We're still on track for 5% to 7% that's the plan.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
"Good morning. Gerry, I heard the other day that the Senate leadership was talking about putting all four of the nominees forward at the same time, even though only two have gone through committee. Have you heard anything like that or is it even worth wasting time in trying to ﬁgure out what's going on in the Senate?","So I'd say a couple of things without wanting to be too speciﬁc. I'd say number one, we're very close to this. We've got not surprisingly many people who are working closely with our senators and with members of the Energy Committee and people close to the whole discussion.  Second, I can tell you that the discussion is very active. So the Senate leadership gets it that there's the country's business waiting to be done as not only these nominees, but other nominees sit out there unconﬁrmed. So they get it and that has led to very active discussions about deals and approaches that could move things along, hopefully move things along in packages and so forth.  But I guess I would say that the discussions are ﬂuid, and I'm not going to try to be overly speciﬁc in terms of how it might play out. I think we've got to leave that to McConnell, Schumer and company. But hopefully I guess the last thing I'd say is, you'd be concerned if there was kind of radio silence on the other side as they dealt with some of the big issues that they're dealing with. That's not the case. Now the discussions are very active on this, and there's a lot of interest in getting this done, hopefully. And I think there is hope that that would be before the August recess, but if not quickly, after they come back in early September."
Okay. That's a pretty fair answer. Thank you. That's all I had.,Thank you.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
"I wanted to go back – good morning. I wanted to go back to NEXUS. I know, you've already answered a number of questions about it. But is there any take away for NEXUS from what's going on with Rover?  I mean, I understand that there are delays on that pipeline, but it seems like a shipper might feel a little bit relieved that the delays are happening, because they actually don't have enough gas to feed in that pipe. I mean, is this the same phenomenon for NEXUS, and how do you think about the project if you were not to sign any additional contracts besides what you already have?","So, we're very aware of – this is Jerry Norcia, very aware of the technical issues that Rover is experiencing. What I will tell you that Enbridge/Spectra and ourselves have been involved in many pipeline projects and have a tremendous amount of experience in building pipelines, and we feel that we'll proceed in a way that's environmentally responsible and follow best practices in the industry.  So, we have not in our past experienced these types of problems, and we don't expect to experience any of them on this pipeline either – our pipeline."
"That addresses any construction issues. But I'm asking more about contracting concerns, simply given that the drilling activities actually not that intense around the area?","So we've got – our current commitments are underpinned 50% by LDCs, so it's a demand-pull, and our LDCs are actively in the region looking to secure supply. We have not had any issues in that regard. The other half of our commitments is from producers, and as we converse with our producers, they are prepared when we go into service to build the pipe."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Okay.,"So we're not seeing issues on that front. I mean, you really asked two questions. Construction, and Jerry said, look, we built a lot of pipes in the past and we are planning to do it the right way. We're planning to do it in an environmentally responsible, well-planned way.  And on production, they're going to put drilling activity in place when they need to, to meet their commitments on the pipe. They're not going to let a commitment on a pipe sit empty. So we are in active discussions. They plan to do that. And as Jerry said, we and the Canadian utilities are in active discussions to secure supply to fulﬁll our commitments and that's going well too."
