Question,Answer
"Just a few questions here this morning. First, on the utility side, as you're thinking about the upcoming RFP and the ﬁve-year distribution plan, are there any additional CapEx opportunities that could develop from that. And then secondly, are there any regulatory mechanisms that you're looking for under that plan to ensure more current recovery of the spend?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So I'll start with the distribution plan. We are working very closely with the Public Service Commission Staﬀ right now. In fact wrapping up a process, where we've been laying out the distribution system needs over the next ﬁve years. It's been a really healthy open process. And I think what that is going to do is essentially lay the logic for the capital expenditures that we have in the plan that we've laid out for you.  And then on the IRP front, I think the IRP is consistent with -- with what we have said before that we're going to retire -- if you look over the next ﬁve years or so, retire those two coal plants, we need this gas plant to backﬁll those. We will continue to add renewables, both up through 2021 when the state target is 15% but really beyond that as well. I fully expect that we'll continue to add additional renewables as the price on those continues to go down and some of our customers want us to do. So as far as additional CapEx to be honest, I think the plan we've laid out as one that's -- it's got a healthy amount of work to renew our utility Infrastructure and that's what we're focused on executing.     I think -- this is Peter, Josephine -- I think you also asked about a recovery mechanism. This deﬁnitely will lay the potential groundwork for that and that we are in some early discussions with the staﬀ and the commission on that."
"Awesome. Great. And then on the P&I side, I'm curious if you could just give a little bit more color on the guidance increase. Is that just tax reform or does that also include volumetric and eﬃciency improvements?",It is just tax reform.
"Just tax reform, okay. Awesome. And then just one last question for GSP, as you're earning AFUDC on NEXUS right now and then the project moves into service, how are you thinking about the return proﬁle on the project? Is there going to be any shift there in the earnings from NEXUS?","The AFUDC is earned over time as you're doing your capital spend. So when you look at a year- over-year, there's not going to be a material change between the two and as we put in service, it gives them just the negotiator rates we have and it's a healthy targeted cost of capital, we have on the project right now. More than anything, it really lays the groundwork for additional expansions and investments around that platform."
"Could you just remind us the extra equity -- the 300 million of incremental equity and in addition to this 500 million at EEI. What's the method for that, is it secondary or is it ATM?","So we expect this year that it will be internal mechanisms. We have capacity for about 300 million in internal mechanisms although it varies year-by-year due to pension contributions and other things. But I think for the foreseeable future, we expect a vast majority would play out that way."
And what -- how long do you think it will be before you actually ﬁnish it completely?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Well, our forecast is to originate the 45 million by 2022. So I would say we are well in progress, if -- with having two-thirds completed this year and we'll have to revisit our targets the end of this year to see if there's any potential upside to that.   Yeah. We've been -- gotten a fast start on it. So we said last year 45 million incremental needed, but we really think at the end of this year we will be about 30 million into the 45, two years into the ﬁve years. So we'll just keep evaluating if the market keeps oﬀering us opportunities at that pace as Gerry said there could be some upside to what we talked about."
"Okay. And maybe you could just remind everybody, look what you're -- what your thoughts are on M&A these days. There's a lot of activity going on in your region, a lot of speculation, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on M&A in the industry as a whole right now is based on. Especially now and with rates starting to rise and the valuation of the group as a whole, how do you view things?","I view it pretty much the same way we always have. So we put a high bar out there for something that we think would actually be additive to what we think is a good strong plan that we have. And so we look, but I think the characteristics you need are something that actually genuinely brings eﬃciency and cost reduction, and maybe a handful that could do that, but as you know you can't pay some of these really high premiums for that or all of that is given away and more. So if we ever found one that was great for our customers through eﬃciency and could be done at low premium, maybe. But just say, we put a high bar out there for it, and don't see it at the forefront of our strategy, right now."
"Good morning guys. How are you doing? So you guys have never been capital constrained, right? Rates have always sort of been the governor. 3% reduction in rates from tax reform is somewhat material. So does this sort of provide an opportunity for you guys to accelerate some spending opportunities, or asked diﬀerently, many utilities seem to be submitting plans, to give back the tax savings through time, and they seem to be getting some preliminary support from the various commissioners. So why not retain some more of the savings and redeploy into sort of infrastructure needs, since you sort of have the opportunities to do so?","When you say retain some of the savings, what do you mean Shahriar? Just unclear on the question you are asking?"
"Well, sort of subsidized additional opportunities to accelerate some of the infrastructure needs that you have?","Yeah, I guess our reaction to this is that, we are actually very happy to have this reduction go back to customers and to have it go back quickly. Because as you said, the thing that we worry most about, as we go through this, having infrastructure renewal cycle, is keeping it aﬀordable. I think the one thing that diﬀerentiates, and actually if you look back over time, companies that do well, as you go through a heavy investment cycle versus those that don't, is how they manage it for the customers, whether their customers and regulators remain supportive. And a lot of that is tied to how aﬀordable it remains. And so when we saw this, our reaction was good, it helps us achieve our targets for rates and rate levels.  Now I think what in the end that's going to do is make feasible in a way that works for everybody, the capital plan that we have laid out here over the next ﬁve years, which is we have been saying, that's some very heavy infrastructure investments embedded in it. So that's the way we are thinking about it, and when we generally get asked about upside as a result of this, we are trying to retain some of the tax savings for upside. That's not the way we are thinking about it, we are really thinking that it's a really helpful aid to the plan we have laid out, in terms of keeping things aﬀordable."
"Got it. So supportive of the plan, but not in any way to accelerate the plan. Got it. And then just on NEXUS, Jerry, I appreciate the sensitivity of the discussions. But on sort of the conversations   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   you are having on the demand pull and supply push sides, can you at least sort of disclose if these opportunities are enough to ﬁnally fully subscribe the pipe?",They certainly are. The size of the volumes that we are discussing would ﬁll the pipe.
"Yeah. Good morning guys. You just answered my ﬁrst question, so moving to some of the P&I tax uplifts. Could you just unpack the mechanics behind that a little bit, given the proportion of the earnings coming out of REF, just how we get -- where the uplift is coming from?","Yes, Jonathan, this is Peter. A portion of our facilities we have there, we essentially have sold down from a partnership perspective. So we have current kind of cash and earnings related to that, that's where the uplift is coming from.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Now as we mentioned, the $0.10 accretion here will go to $0.13 to essentially, that managed utility, and that REF will be replaced by utility accretion at the back end of the plan."
"So eﬀectively the incremental coming, because you have to make up if the REF piece steps down?","Right, REF -- there is some tax beneﬁt from REF, just because -- with those facilities that we have partners with."
Okay. But that's what's driving the uplift in 2018 (inaudible) in the partnership?,"One way to think about it, by 2022, that is gone. But that's fully replaced and then some by utilities."
"Right. Less than being $0.03 incremental, it's actually more than that.","So its -- just to add there, obviously there on the partnership positions, there is some tax savings. We also have that are in REF, where there's obviously tax beneﬁts as well on your current contracts. And other point Peter is making is, we go through the transition Jerry Norcia was describing is we had RNG projects and industrial projects and so forth and current projects of that type, we have beneﬁt on future projects. I expect it'll be a shared beneﬁt, where some of that goes to the customer and some of that comes to us."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then just another -- a little tax detail. So, I think you mentioned that you have assumed, it's 190 million upfront for the reduced tax charge, and then an assumption at $70 million a year on deferred excess ﬂowing back. Can you just unpack that between protected and unprotected, and then what sort of time frame you assumed on each?","Yeah. There -- but maybe I will give you the broad context. There's going to be three diﬀerent proceedings. One is going to be on the current, which is the 190 you mentioned. So there'll be proceedings in terms of how do we give that back to customers. So maybe a little bit diﬀerent   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   for each of our utilities, because where they are at in terms of the rate case cycles. There will also be a portion on that current, that will catch up from January 1, and then on the deferred, as you were talking about, there is going to be a separate proceeding second half of the year. There is -- good majority of it is to protect the depreciation, probably two-thirds of it, some of it isn't. But we have history and precedents around all of that being normalized. So we expect all that could play out in the proceeding in the back half of this year."
"And then, in your 70 million, what do you assume about the one-third that's not protected?","It will be normalized -- it's part of the 70 million, we have 1.4 billion roughly at electric company, 300 million at the gas, so combined 1.7 billion that we are going to need to give back to customers over time -- that includes both protected and unprotected."
"A third of which is unprotected and for the time being, you are assuming that's also normalized. Am I getting that right?",Yes. And there was precedents around that back in 1986 when we did this with the commission.
"And then, looking forward, when you report ﬁrst quarter earnings, if there is no resolution of tax issues at the commission, how should we think about you'll just -- at the utilities, just strip that out, it's -- like kind of reserved revenues?",That is correct. It's a regulatory liability from an accounting perspective. So we will be putting that on the balance sheet to get back to our customers through these various proceedings that I described earlier.
"Congratulations on a solid year and raising guidance, and that's all I have. Thanks.","Thank you.  Operator  We will go next to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Hey, Steve.   Hey, Steve."
"Hey, Gerry. Everyone, good morning. So ﬁrst question, just in clarifying the growth rate guidance. The 5% to 7% oﬀ of the 5.78% in 2018, so that number obviously includes trading. So I assume you are kind of giving -- when you are giving that, you are including trading kind of throughout the period. And if you want to exclude that, we just take that out and grow 5 to 7?","But we do include it. So we are growing up the total number, trading for a couple of percent of our total, so."
"Okay. So I guess, and -- it's a small thing, but in theory, it's in fact -- you are probably not assuming that growth and the businesses ex-trading are probably growing a little quicker?","Could be or we might see a little growth in trading. I mean, when do you do the math, it's a few million dollars, so it just doesn't swing much in the growth."
"Okay. And then just to clarify, the bullet in the slide on tax on the improvement in the economics, future non-utility projects may be shared with customers. Is this mainly in the P&I segment?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I think it's both. If you think logically about it, every project has lots of variables that come into determining your return on capital. But one of them is competitive dynamics, and how many opportunities -- they are competing for the opportunity. And so if there is low competition presumably, and you really are the one best suited to serve the need, you might have a higher share. If high competition, the share might be lower. And then I think a lot of cases that we play out in, will see a split of that value. So we try to be conservative and not play a lot of that future tax value on future projects into our projections. But I think we're going to -- I think we will see it, and will help us in our achievement."
"But you are not talking to an impact on kind of current non-utility projects, will you share some?","The ones that are already existing are in hand with negotiated contracts in place, will obviously get the beneﬁt of that."
"Yeah. Okay. And then, can you just talk a little bit to the ALJ and your electric case? And I think they came out with like a 9.6 ROE, which was not only down a decent amount from where you have been, but also lower than CMS like, what is the explanation for that, and how are you feeling about the outcome?","So you know we are in an active case, Steve, so I am probably going to leave most of our commentary for that venue. But that said if you have watched our ROE proceedings and our rate case proceedings over the year, it's not unusual to see positions out there that are lower than what we have or what we've ﬁled for. But when you set back from all of that, I feel we are going to get a constructive set of outcomes in our Electric and Gas cases, and constructive on the ROE front that will support the plan we put out for the year or so."
"Okay. And then last question, just is on -- in the Midstream business, just high level, maybe you could talk to trends that you are seeing. Obviously we have a lot more gas production, we have demand increasing, but bottlenecks starting to get -- slowly get resolved. Just what are you thinking strategically next for the business? Are you worried about pricing and too much supply, or do you still see a lot of opportunity to grow the business?","Certainly, with our current slate of assets tied to the Marcellus and the Utica, I kind of see a world-class resource connected to very proximal markets on the East Coast as well as Midwest, and markets in Midwest, which is what our NEXUS pipeline is pointed to, you are going to see a   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   fundamental shift from coal use to natural gas use over time, as these plants age out, as you can see from our own sort of plants for generation.  So I see very strong supply growth as well as strong demand growth in the regions that we are going to serve with NEXUS. And I think that will bode well for additional bolt-on projects for NEXUS, as well as our Link asset, which is already connected to the NEXUS. So I see a really strong story in our future. I think also, the evolution of the export market in the natural gas industry, I think will be an outlet for what continues to be a growing supply of natural gas in North America.  So overall, I feel our Midstream business with its sphere of inﬂuence if you will, in the Great Lakes region, is well positioned to capture that growth, both supply and demand.     Steve, just to add on to that, our position in Pennsylvania, Bluestone and Millennium, we hit a record production level last year, and as we mentioned, we got pulled for more there, down on our Link assets. We just had a producer there double their position with us.  And if you come up to NEXUS, one of the interesting things there is to, I think in a region where output is growing rapidly, the producers are deﬁnitely scaling up operations there. And NEXUS is, for the next couple of years, likely to be the only path out with any capacity. Now, we're working to make sure that capacity doesn't exist for very long, as we ﬁll up the pipe. But we are an option out of the region, or out of that zone right now, as it scales up production."
"Thank you. I actually wanted to follow up on NEXUS. So I heard your explanation, thank you. Now the contracts with Industrial customers are for the facility existing capacity or for expansions of NEXUS?",They will be both.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"And can you give me a sense what type of industry this is, that would be willing to sign contracts for gas?","Angie, once we execute the agreements, I'd be happy to disclose that. But at this moment, we can't."
"Okay. And so -- and separately on the drillers' demand for -- from capacity on your pipe. It seems like Rover is still not fully subscribed, so and again, it seems like Rover's pricing is a little bit lower than yours. So what would be the advantage for a driller to choose your pipe versus Rover?","Well, let me be clear, Rover's rates are not lower than ours. And I think you and I have had this conversation before that, our rates are very competitive with Rover. So we are happy with our position in the market that way. And in addition to that, we've got much greater signiﬁcant -- or much more signiﬁcant market access along the pipeline. And we've got 13 interconnects that we are building immediately, and all of those interconnects with large demand centers, are already starting to play into some of the discussions that we are having with counterparties. So we feel very good about ﬁlling this pipe."
"Okay. And then lastly, when you show us the net income range for '18 for the GSP segment, does it account for the incremental long-term contract, or is basically the delta year-over-year largely ﬁlled by short-term contracts?",Are you asking about long-term contracts on NEXUS or other pipes?
"I mean, other pipes as well. I mean, will they materialize between now and the end of the year, and to contribute to '18 net income?","So NEXUS not materially, since it goes into service so late in the year. So it's really not relevant for '18. And the other pipes do have growing positions. So for example, we mentioned Link in a growing position there. Now that will take a little time to come into, but could contribute, some   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   are going to be growing over the Bluestone. So the projections we have for both '18 and future years are taking that sort of growth and those sorts of contracts into account. But the contracts on NEXUS, just isn't enough time in 2018 for those to really be material."
"Okay, that is what I was -- and then second question on the P&I, getting to two-thirds of the way to your goal by the end of the year, did you say that's an expansion of the forward agreement or is that a new project you intend to announce?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Well, these are -- the one project that we are looking to ﬁnalize agreement -- we're very close to ﬁnalizing agreements with an R&D project currently, and we are looking at other industrial energy projects in the region.     We have a number of cogen projects for example, and one of the discussions with an industrial counterparty is -- I guess we'd just say very late-stage development. So I guess the likelihood of them going forward is high. I mean, we were a year ago forward at this point, it's the way that project (inaudible). So we've got one of those, we have got an RNG that's -- that we think about ﬁnalized. And then more of each of those behind those two projects."
