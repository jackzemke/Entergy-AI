Question,Answer
"Good morning. Obviously, just real quick, CapEx is moving higher and the credit metrics are strong and obviously you're highlighting that you have minimum equity needs in the current plan. I guess, Dave, can you just touch on funding sort of incremental spending opportunities, maybe using some rule of thumb as we think about the percentage of equity needed to fund every new dollar of CapEx above this base plan? Maybe the answer is zero. And there's been obviously some mentions of an RNG sale in the media, just given sort of the cash versus earnings attributes of that business, is that an accretive recycling opportunity? Thanks.","Yes. Hi, Shahr. This is Dave. I'll take the ﬁrst part of that. Yes, as you saw in our plan, we have really strong cash ﬂow generation that allows us to maintain our FFO-to-debt at the rate of 15% to 16% while issuing minimal equity. And it does give us some headroom to the downgrade thresholds, too.  So, though we haven't given a rule of thumb for how much new equity we would have to use for any new CapEx, but we still have some ﬂexibility within our plan that would allow us to kind of work around any new equity that we'd have to do. But our plan, as you saw, has $2 billion of new capital in it, which we were able to bring in really due to the capital generation, and then some of the favorability that we're seeing from the IRA tax credit as well.     Yes, and Shahr, I'll take the non-utility assets. Certainly, we're happy with all our assets there, but we're always looking for opportunities to -- there was an opportunity to create incremental value for our investors. We would take that opportunity in terms of optimizing the portfolio. But I would say at this moment, certainly we don't have any incremental cash needs in our plan. And so there really isn't anything imminent at this time.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Perfect. And then just lastly on just the regulatory, maybe just expectations for '24, you have a notice of a potential ﬁling with the MPSC for March 1st. I guess, can you just elaborate on that ﬁling? I guess, what do you see diﬀerent from the prior case, which wasn't easy to get through, especially as we're kind of thinking about the IRM, sales forecast, rate design, et cetera? Thanks.","Sure. So, if you're referring to a potential electric rate case, we're looking to make a ﬁling late in the ﬁrst quarter, early second quarter. I would say that most of that ﬁling will be about the capital investments we're making to upgrade the grid and transition to cleaner energy. So, again, it'll be a CapEx driven ﬁling, is what we expect at this point."
"Good morning. I guess just to follow up on the Vantage portfolio optimization comments, just if you don't have cash needs in the current plan and there is an opportunity to do something, just how do we think about those use of proceeds?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   If we did pursue some form of optimization, obviously, the cash proceeds would go to oﬀsetting debt issuances and even potentially the repurchase of some equity. But as I said, there's really nothing imminent at this point in time."
"Appreciate that. Okay. And then I guess just as you kind of wrapped in the Michigan legislation to your outlook, you're probably looking at changes to the supply portfolio. Can you just remind us what your philosophy is in terms of owning these assets versus doing PPAs? Are you going to target to do a mix or do you want to do all renewable ownership? That would be helpful.","So we certainly like to own assets because we think it's much more accretive, both for our customers in terms of providing lower costs, I think we've been able to show over and over, is that ownership provides lower costs to our customers and also it provides greater beneﬁt to our investors in terms of EPS growth.  So we prefer to own. I think you'll see in the IRP, with -- in the IRP settlement, we did agree to share some ownership and it breaks out somewhere between two-thirds and one-third ownership, between us owning two-thirds and others owning one-third in the IRP piece. I think the legislation also did not talk about ownership, which we -- and was neutral on that point. So we are pleased with that and in addition to that, it also provided for a compensation mechanism for PPAs that will give us some upside as we sign PPAs."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Hey. Just wanted to dive into the capital program a little bit more if we could, looking at the $25 billion ﬁve-year plan as you laid out there. Just wondering if you could peel back the onion a little bit more on the $2 billion increase in cleaner generation at DTE Electric. Just wondering what speciﬁc projects, opportunities, how you think about that new capital?","Yes. Jeremy, if you'll recall, when we updated, we didn't provide an update at EEI because we were awaiting the outcome of rate case to make sure that our capital plans were supported, which that happened. And so when we updated in December, it really reﬂected the IRP settlement and a new legislation were both in ﬂight.  And so I would say the combination of those two events, signiﬁcant events, created incremental opportunity in our clean generation space. It accelerated our journey in terms of billing out renewables as well as a battery system. So that's really what drove the increase."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the capital program, I guess, broader and think about the Vantage, the non-regulated side. Just wondering, what do you think about, I guess, run rate expectations for CapEx there? Did some capital move from Vantage into regulated? Just trying to get a sense for how much capital could go there over time, how that could potentially shift depending on what regulated opportunities you see in front of you?","Yes. Right now, we're showing $1 billion to $1.5 billion investment over the next ﬁve years and -- which is pretty consistent with our prior ﬁve-year forecast. So we really haven't made any signiﬁcant changes there just yet.     Yes. We will see that can be a little lumpy depending on the projects that come in, too. So the project that Jerry was talking about on the prepared remarks that one will have a little more capital associated with it in '24, so the $1 billion, $1.5 billion can be a little bit lumpy as it comes in."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And then just wanted to see, I guess, as it relates to CCS, if we could dive in a little bit more in, I guess, how do you think about timeline for when that could become more real, I guess, as far as capital is moving in there and as far as the -- I guess, the regulatory environment being supportive enough where you feel comfortable to kind of move forward there?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yes. I would say that in terms of carbon capture and storage, we're well advanced on three projects. And we're ﬁnalizing our arrangements with counterparties and some conditions precedent there to make sure that we got a viable transaction. But I would say it's feeling better than 50-50 that we're going to start executing on some capital there in that new business line. So pretty exciting.  They're small projects. Each of them are -- each of the three are anywhere between $50 million to $100 million. Pretty simple projects that doesn't require a lot of pipeline, pretty short pipelines. Most of the pipelines are right on the property of the customer, so is the wealth. So we're deep into it and we'll continue to give you updates on that. But it's a nice synergy with our utility -- electric utility, because we're, as we think about future power plants and using natural gas, we're going to need to capture the carbon and store it. So I think dipping our toes into this new business line creates value for investors, but also creates value for future utility investments that we'll need to make."
"Got it. Very helpful. One last quick one, if I could, just as far as reﬁnancing new bonds. How much of the, I guess, the open rate exposure on reﬁnancings has been hedged at this point and derisked?","Yes. So as you saw, we have about $2 billion of reﬁnancings coming up at the end of the year this year, and the majority of that is hedged. It's $1.7 billion has been hedged of that at rates that are a little bit better than what we're seeing out there in the market now.  So we just -- we continue to like our overall debt portfolio like -- and with the rates we're getting that, that's all included within our ﬁve-year plan and consistent with our strong investment- grade credit rating and our 15% to 16% FFO-to-debt that allows us to issue minimal equity within our plan. I know it's a little more of an answer than you were asking, but we're in a good place with that."
"That's all very, very helpful, all those details. Thank you very much for taking my questions.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, Jerry and Dave. Just maybe can you comment on the ﬁnancial implications of the January storm? That's part one. And then part two, as we think about the rest of the year, what level of contingency you have in the plan as it relates to worse than expected storms, bad weather, similar to what we had last year. So those two things, please. Thank you.","Yes. We've -- just let me take the storm expense. We certainly have increased our storm expense in our planning process, as we've seen storms increase over time and the cost that brings. So we feel pretty comfortable about the plan that we're carrying right now. And as you know, we also carry one standard deviation of weather, for example, in the winter, warmer than normal weather and -- or in the summer, one standard deviation of cooler than normal weather. So that's how we're planning.  And at this point in time, we feel pretty good about our plan. We're moving along and right on track. I think the storm that came in January consumed some of the storm expense budget, but of course, as you would expect, we're working to replenish some of that so that we can carry a full summer storm budget. So that's really where we're at with that."
Okay. Perfect. Awesome. That's really all I had. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Next question comes from line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Let's see, you've got a renewable energy plan ﬁling coming later this year, I think. I'm wondering if that could be an opportunity to reassess again and potentially increase the renewables in your outlook.","Well, certainly, our voluntary renewable plan is progressing really well, David. I'll just tell you that we've got 2,500 megawatts subscribed in our voluntary program and 2,600 in our ﬁve-year plan. So, we're -- it's likely that over time it will increase. We'll have -- obviously, our next ﬁling will address the next couple of years of in-service requirements for our large industrial customers that we signed up and commercial customers. So, it could potentially be upside to our plan in the future as we continue to update our plan. So, hopefully, that helps."
"Got it. Yes. That's helpful. And I was wondering, does your current plan kind of fully embed the opportunities arising from the legislation as you're thinking about maybe beyond the renewable energy targets but also considering energy eﬃciency and the FCM and the potential upside on PPA contracts?","I would say that our current plan does anticipate incremental build-outs for the IRP and legislation. So I told you, our ﬁve-year plan for voluntary is 2,600 megawatts. We have an additional 1,800 megawatts that comes in as part of the IRP in that ﬁve-year plan. So that's all built in to the $7 billion clean generation number that you see on our slides.  In terms of PPAs, we're going to have to continue to assess what incremental value that will bring as we go along here. But it could bring incremental value.     Yes. And then as we look out past that, we're going to have to ﬁle a new IRP that will take into account this legislation even more. And so that will give us an opportunity to bring some more capital in. Maybe near the end of the ﬁve-year plan, but really probably a little bit past that, just more opportunity to do this clean energy generation.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Hi. First question is on the $300 million of lower fuel cost savings, very impressive number. Can you just give a little more detail? First of all, is that a year-over-year reduction, and how much of that relates to the fuel cost itself, the natural gas prices being lower than 2022 levels? And as a follow-up, just quickly, do you have an early read in 2024 in terms of forward curves?","Yes. The $300 million reduction in '23 that was really the recovery of the over collection that was in 2022. So, in 2023, we were kind of on our plan and just recovering what we needed to recover into -- not recovering from '22 in 2023, and then comes oﬀ our books for 2024. So far for this year, there's a little bit under recovery left, but we're forecasting things to be pretty ﬂat with our plan for this year.     And in the gas business, we're fully recovered there. We're in a good position there."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Great. Then one more, if I could just sort of ask you to elaborate on the non-utility CapEx. So, we've been asked similar questions in a diﬀerent way. Last year, the CapEx was $167 million. That was well below guidance of $300 million to $400 million. And now you're guiding to $550 million to $650 million for 2024. Can you just walk us through that a little bit?  I heard you mention there's some lumpiness, maybe certain investments were deferred. I'm guessing some of the high spending this year is related to that Ford announcement. I guess just overall, how conﬁdent are you in that 2024 number given how high it is?","Yes. Good question, Andrew. It's -- the capital investment really follows the development projects that we do within that business. And last year, we did three RNG projects and one custom energy solutions projects, but a smaller one. And that allows us to continue with the growth we need in that business and meet our targets.  This year, you're right, the Ford project that we're doing that we talked about in the prepared remarks is -- makes us conﬁdent that we're going to invest this. We talked about this a year or so ago. We had about $200 million of investment plan for this year from that. We've expanded that deal with them, and that's going to make up a good portion of the capital investment on non- utility this year. Still working on other projects as well, but it's really that custom energy solutions project with Ford that's going to take up a big chunk of that capital investment in '24."
"Hey, guys. Maybe just wanted to ask on the trading business that did really well in '23, and I think Dave, you mentioned some of that ﬂows through into '24, but just how conservative do you feel that range is for '24? And is this like a new normal that could extend even beyond '24 based on what you're seeing?","Yes. Michael, you're right. We did have some really nice favorability in 2023. And again, this is due to the premiums we get on the structured physical power portfolio. So it's all contract and hedged, just had really nice premiums in '23. As we said, we expect some of that to continue on into '24, probably not to the same extent as '23. But some of those contracts, they're one and two years. So we see some of them coming into '24 as well.  Now going forward, we'll have to see what happens. We're not guiding to anything higher than that. We get the same level of contracts as a business we've been in for a long time. We get the same level of contracts. We've just seen really good premiums in '23. And we're seeing those come back down. So it's probably not something we're going to guide to going forward. But it is good favorability. And exact same risk proﬁle that we've always had too."
Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. And then I just wanted to pivot to the PBR proceedings at the Michigan PSC and just what are your guys thoughts on kind of where that stands and how that ultimately plays out?,"Michael, it's moving in the right direction in terms of sort of narrowing the variables that we'd be looking at for PBR. So we felt that, that was quite constructive in the latest release from the commission on that process. We still feel it'll be a symmetrical sort of beneﬁt and incentive to perform. So we feel good about that. That's still holding together.  And we expect that there's really no timeline stipulated for the conclusion of the process. So we're thinking sometime between the middle of the year to early next year is when this process will conclude. But we're feeling that it'll be a productive process and a well-balanced process."
"-- taking my questions. Hi. I have a couple of questions here, right? I guess staying on the energy trading business topic, right? Could you elaborate a little more on what market conditions enabling this relative strength and like what should we watch for in terms of this potentially reversing in the future or continuing for longer if you will?","Yes, these are markets where we bid in to utilities within PJM and New England, mainly, and to serve their load. And as we bid in, we get contracts, and those contracts will have premiums associated with them. We just saw really nice premiums in '23, some of which carry on into '24. So we'll be able to -- as we go through '24, we'll be able to let you know more about what we see for future years on those premiums.  And then, the rest of that business is really gas physical business, which again is contracted and hedged. So it's really just kind of success of our trading group in setting up these structured physical and hedged positions that is making it have these successful years."
"Got it. And how much visibility do you have in that? It sounds like maybe less than 12 months out, if you would be updating us as you go.","That's right, it is -- most of these contracts are one year. Some go a little longer, but most of them are for like for one year and then kind of see where they come in again the next year. That's why we continue to guide usually the $25 million. We went to $35 million because we see that, but we're not pushing to something higher than that in the future years."
Got it. And then I just want to be clear on what you're saying about your capital plan. How much of the new energy law opportunities is reﬂected in it? It sounds like what you're saying is that you have reﬂected opportunities that would be presented by the new energy law in Michigan in your plan already. So the incremental opportunities stemming from this legislation should be fairly limited. Am I hearing this correctly?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"I would say in the ﬁrst ﬁve years, that's correct, Sophie. We've -- the IRP and the legislation is reﬂected in the ﬁve-year plan. And we'll continue to update that as we go forward. It's not beyond the ﬁve-year plan. There is some further acceleration that we could see. But we'll continue to update that each and every year and hopefully in November -- between November and the end of the year."
"If you just think about last question -- hey, good morning. Just with respect to the last question there on what's reﬂected in the plan, I just want to clarify on the PPA ownership piece, or the PPA earnings piece, the compensation mechanism there. That is reﬂected for the one-third piece in the IRP settlement and therefore in your outlook rate. So again, as you talk about this, the diﬀerent pieces, the substantive upside from the legislation really moves beyond the ﬁve- year period at this point. Just on the compensation, speciﬁcally.","So. Yes, again, the ownership component is reﬂected in our capital plan. The $7 billion component of clean energy generation, that's in our plan. The ﬁnancial compensation mechanism, we'll have to see what levels we sign the PPAs at. Obviously, as you know, it's tied to the price that we sign the PPAs for. So as we sign those, we'll continue to update our plan. But it will provide some incremental value in our plan as we go forward, if that's what you're asking.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Yes, right. So the FCM is included at least preliminarily to the extent to which that might need to be updated later.","There's thoughts -- we have something in there for it now. But as we sign PPAs, there should be some upside in the plan to that, what we have in there now."
"Got it. All right. Thank you for clarifying. I know it was back and forth here a little bit. All right. Excellent. And then just coming back to the top of the roster on the Q&A, real quickly on the RNG conversation brieﬂy. Sounds like that was non-committal and frankly, it seems like opportunistic to the extent which you might see something of interest to you given where your balance sheet sits.  Is there something about like resolution and IRA's regs on RNG and how that's treated under IRA that's driving some decision tree here for you guys? Or I just want to make sure I heard that right. That it doesn't seem like that's a particularly pressing subject for you guys.","Yes. I would say that it's not imminent. Some sort of optimization of our RNG portfolio. We like the returns, we like the cash ﬂows from it. And actually the IRA, Inﬂation Reduction Act has been quite beneﬁcial to that business from an ITC, Investment Tax Credit perspective. It's made projects more attractive and higher return.  And we're also seeing positive movement in some of the markets, like the federal market moved in a very positive direction under a renewable fuel standard that is. And in California, the California Air Resources Board is looking to tighten up the carbon intensity targets. So I think as that plays out that will provide even more upside in those markets as we see them today."
All right. Excellent. Right. So it doesn't sound like you're too worried about the way the IRA's regs came out in terms of being able to move.,"We are monitoring that and we're commenting, but we're not overly concerned. We don't think that it's really consistent with what the congressional intent was there either. So we're just continuing to -- we're continue to watch and monitor and comment, but not overly concerned."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. Wonderful. Excellent. Thank you guys very much. All right. Take care.,"Thank you, Julien.     Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Just following up on the RNG, are you able to provide how much that contributed in 2023 and also the steel business?","Yes. We saw -- we did see some good upside from the RNG because we brought in three new projects in '22 and in '23 and associated with some of that there's some tax credits that come with that, that helped out in '23.  The steel business was the other part that gave us the favorability that we saw in 2023. Probably a little over half of what we saw there and that's was due to some opportunistic sales of some of our byproducts, some of the other products we're making within that business, and some other kind of one-time things that we've done there. So it was some good one-time opportunity that we saw in the steel business and the RNG development."
"And how are you thinking about the returns in the RNG business, just how they're trending?","We have noticed it's gotten a little more competitive as more people have come in. We used to say we got high-double-digit unlevered after-tax returns. We're still seeing good returns,   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   particularly where we see it is in our conversion projects. We have projects that now make power that we can convert to make in RNG. And so in those projects, we continue to see what we would say are very strong returns. And then there's still a good development pipeline that has strong returns as well.     Yes. We're still seeing unlevered returns, and I would say, north of 10% unlevered after tax, so in the teens, low-teens."
"Hey, just two quick ones. Most of them have been already answered my questions, but just, I think you talked about a potential rate ﬁling late ﬁrst quarter, early second quarter electric ﬁling. Just, do you expand the undergrounding program in that ﬁling, or as much as you'd like to disclose thoughts on expanding the undergrounding in the ﬁling?","Anthony, we put 5 miles underground in last year in 2023, and it went really well. And what we're doing is proposing that we continue to do more. This is going to take a few years to ramp, Anthony, as we kind of work with our commission. We actually had the commission staﬀ out looking at some of the undergrounding that we did in the last few days. And so they -- I think there's a process here to make sure that we're working together with our commission to come up with a reasonable plan.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I would say the key part of it is we need to ensure that on an NPV basis, undergrounding is going to be at least equivalent or better than putting it up in the air. We've got 19,000 miles of infrastructure to replace. It's very old. It's a 4.8 kV system. So a huge opportunity from a customer perspective to improve infrastructure for the future. And we'd like to put as much of that underground as we can, but we're going to have to prove out the concept.  So we're in the early stages of proving it out to ourselves and then secondly to our commission. So that's where we're at with it. I think it's going to take a few years before we can ramp it, but we feel pretty good about how smoothly the ﬁrst 5 miles went. It's all directional bore through very highly congested urban areas. So very cool project, more to come on that."
"Great. And then just a quick follow-up, I guess I'll throw it to you, Dave, or Jerry, if you want to take this, it's ﬁne. Just, I guess, on a credit metric basis, where did you end 2023? And I think your target range is 15% to 16%. When do you believe you'll hit that target range?","Yes. We did end '23 right around 15%, Anthony. And as we look through the ﬁve-year plan, we stay within that range throughout the ﬁve-year plan that we talked about, even with the minimal equity that we're issuing."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.,"Thank you, Anthony.  Operator  The next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.  Excuse me, Mr.Ryan Levine, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question."
"I apologize. Yes, so good morning. Hoping to follow up on the utility ownership versus PPA of some of the generation assets. Is your plan largely solidiﬁed at that point or is there opportunity to convert some of the owned assets into PPAs given the incentives that the law provides?","I'll let -- Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll let Dave to elaborate, but I'll start by saying that we prefer to own the assets for really two reasons. One is, if you look at the value to our customers,   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   it's much more aﬀordable for our customers for us to own the assets. And then secondly, for our investors, it provides a much greater signiﬁcant EPS growth opportunity if we own. So, we don't see converting any current ownership to PPAs.  Dave, did you want to add to that?     No, that's exactly right. It's better for our customers. We've gotten really good at developing these projects, and we're the leading renewable developer in the state and continue to do it. And what we see is the lowest price, which is kind of borne out through the auctions that we're in. So, we think it's better for our customers.  And then, on an EPS basis, investing the capital is better for our shareholders as well. So, I don't know that we'll be converting any. We'll do what we need to do, but in the FCM it's great. It's great addition for the PPAs that we do, do, but it's still much better for our customers and much better value if we continue to develop these."
Okay. And are you still pursuing opportunities to build dedicated pipelines to chemical plants in your service territory but that you maybe have been pursuing in the last few quarters?,"Are you referring to carbon capture and storage, Ryan, when you --"
