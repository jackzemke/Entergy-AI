Question,Answer
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good morning. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the IRP, I know it's pending and coming soon, but you could potentially see a meaningful kind of CapEx opportunity out of this, and how should we think about funding any kind of incremental CapEx to the base ﬁve-year plan today especially when we kind of think about common equity funding, any thoughts there?","Dave, you want to take that?     Sure. We are -- as you mentioned, Nick, we're going to give more guidance on our capital plans at EEI, but you're right, we have a good opportunity with the IRP and the IRA to invest in additional capital. We do have a strong balance sheet, and rating agencies are comfortable with where we're at in our position. So we have a little ﬂexibility there with our capital structure that we can support these investments before we have to use additional equity to. So we'll give more detail at EEI, but I think you're right, we do see some additional capital opportunity to the IRP and what the IRAs allowed us to do."
"Got it. Thanks. And then I guess it just relates to the electric rate order or not order, but you got an ALJ rack, I think you ﬁled some exceptions as well. Just when do you see that kind of coming to fruition? And do you still kind of feel comfortable, and kind of giving this outlook if, my understanding is that proceeding comes after when you give the outlook? Thanks.","Yes. We feel comfortable with where we're headed, both the ALJ positions and staﬀ positions. If you take various components of that, are quite supportive of our plan. So we view it as supportive of our long-term plan. And certainly, there's strong alignment to make the investments in a grid, as well as clean generation. So there's strong alignment there as well."
"To Jerry, just starting oﬀ with the IRA, and how that has impacted your thoughts, I guess around the IRP. I mean obviously there's clearly customer beneﬁts and lower cost, but does that trigger kind of any sort of a revision to your planning inputs verses prior to the enactment, right? Because we've been talking about this IRP for some time, so we've got a bit of a sense there, did the IRA change, I guess the calculus and what we've discussed before in prior slides? And then just to remind us, do you have any sort of tax equity embedded in renewable spending, where we could see an opportunity to avoid that tax equity and increase rate base? Thanks.","Great question. So, the IRA had a very positive impact on our IRP from two perspectives. One, certainly lowered the cost of all of our investments in renewables as well as long-term it improved the outlook for carbon capture and storage in our IRP. So, very positive beneﬁt to aﬀordability, which allowed us to accelerate our transition. And so I think you'll see that when we roll that out next week, so very positive impact from the IRA, and of course you know what the tax credits are $26 from regular on solar and wind and PTCs on nuclear.  All of those are going to have a beneﬁcial impact to our plan. In terms of tax equity with the IRA and provisions in that IRA making tax credits transferable, we don't longer need tax equity structure, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes our plan but also removes an investment partner. So we have now the opportunity to investor greater amounts in our renewables, the build-out. But very positive impact overall."
"Got it. Perfect. And then just, it sounds like I mean you guys are even more constructive on the Vantage segment post IRA, but simultaneously there's obviously been some really high premiums paid for RNG assets. Did IRA kind of change your thoughts or even internal debates and whether you would ever put Vantage under a strategic review, and conversely since IRA potentially accelerates Vantage's growth, does it even make sense in terms of the business mix for DTE guys target, as we're thinking about regulated utility exposure?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","The way we're looking at Vantage right now, Shahriar, is that, it'll be our non-utility business will be 10% of our portfolio, but the IRA, the investment tax credit for RNG of 30% just made the projects we were looking at even more economic signiﬁcantly lifted the IRRs, and many of the projects that we were looking at. And then the Cogen investment tax credit of 30%, that also helps projects that we've got in the pipeline and become much more economic.  So we're excited about that, so that 10% that we're looking to create and continue to create an advantage has just become much more economic. The last one is carbon capture and storage, which we've started to explore and have some interesting small opportunities in that arena as well, which not only will be beneﬁcial to Vantage but will also be beneﬁcial to our electric utility as we think about carbon capture and storage as it relates to our generation assets. So, really starting to understand that business in a deeper way. So overall I would say the impact on Vantage from the IRA again was quite positive. This IRA has had and this can impact in our thinking as it relates to our electric utility as well as Vantage in terms of creating more opportunity in both business segments."
"Got it, terriﬁc. Thanks guys. And Jerry congrats on a side comment on the latest addition to your family. See you guys soon at EEI.","Well, thank you. Thank you, Shahriar.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good morning. Just wanted to start oﬀ on RNG landscape if I could, given the Archaea sales here, and what looks on the surface to be quite a robust valuation paid there, just wondering any thoughts from your side on that transaction? And whether that impacts your go forward RNG strategy?","Yeah. Hi, Jeremy, this is Dave. As we've said, we're always looking at our portfolio considering options. We did see the Archaea sale and I think it really highlights the value that other see for RNG and really the growth potential for RNG. And so ﬁrst gives us conﬁdence that we're going to ﬁnd more high growth potential projects but also can will make us continue to look to make sure that we're doing what's best for the long-term value of our shareholders. Right now, we're just really conﬁdent in our business development pipeline, we continue to grow that and continue to ﬁnd really accretive projects for us."
"Got it. So even with this level, I guess of interest in this space and strong valuations, you still see new projects clearing your hurdle rate. There's not too much competition out there to drive down expected rates of return on these projects?","We have some really good projects that are in our pipeline right now, some of these are conversions and some and with the IRA some of them become even more attractive. So we still have a really strong business development pipeline that we see in the Vantage business.     Yeah, look at the -- our business development pipeline as we look at a few years is well stocked with high return projects in the RNG space and we've also got a few industrial projects, Cogen projects that were pursuing that will bring values long-term value to the Vantage business unit. So, it feels like the pipeline to us is very strong in terms of growth with high quality investments."
"I was wondering if you could give a perspective on the commission's audit that they recently kicked oﬀ related to outages and safety, wondering what you think should come out of this in terms of potential policies, or penalties or anything like that?","Sure. So, as we look at the commission order, our discussions with the commission continue to be really collaborative, and I would say the relationship is in a good place. Ultimately, I think the result of this order is that, it will create even stronger alignment as it relates to our investment agenda. Just to give you a feel for at our system on average operates at about 99.9% availability, our best-in-class is 99.97% availability of the grid.  So, you can see that this is a highly reliable industry when it comes to providing power to our customers. And all of our investment plans are really pointed at, how do we get to that 99.97% availability for our grid. So, I feel that this process with the commission will create stronger alignment, and there's a lot of value for our customers to go even from 99.9% and 99.77%. And we'll start to lay all that out, and it'll be I believe, it'll be a good process, and it will come to a good conclusion."
Got it. Thanks. And does that sound like more operational changes or CapEx investments or how could that improvement play out?,"Well, when I look at our circuitry, we've got systems that need to be replaced and modernized and automated and as we rebuild new circuits and upgrade those circuits and modernize them, it's going to require a signiﬁcant amount of capital investment and I think you'll see that in our planning as we rollout our new plan at EEI, we continue to accelerate this strategic capital. There were investing in a grid, in addition to our maintenance capital, but it will be primarily capital driven process."
"Got it, that makes sense. And I was just wondering if you could comment on results so far for the year, and whether you've been able to, or just what level of kind of expense you might have been able to pull in to 2022 so far? What are you thinking for the rest of the year here just as you set up into 2023 earnings guidance, can you pull forward more expenses into 2022 given the strong results?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yeah. We have had a strong year in 2022, and as we look at our portfolio over the few years, we do try to balance what we can do in '22 and '23 across all our businesses. So, we have been able to ﬁnd some opportunity to help 2023 as we go through this year too, because as you've seen '22 has been a nice strong year for us."
"Yeah, thank you. I think just one for me remaining just as we think about I guess the updates that you guys will give at EEI especially the long --long-term growth rate. A lot of positives here that you mentioned, what are some of the I guess oﬀsetting factors that we should consider and on a net basis do you still see overall developments as a positive. I guess on netting out basis I would think of whether its cost inﬂation or maybe holding company leverage reﬁnancing, those type of items. Thanks.","I'll start and I'll turn it over to Dave, Insoo. But overall net positive we view our ability to invest on behalf of our customers to really transformer generation ﬂeet to a cleaner and more reliable ﬂeet as a signiﬁcant opportunity and that will be the basis of our IRP and also the investment of the grid to drive increase resiliency and reliability of the grid will be a signiﬁcant opportunity for us.  So this is going to create a transformative opportunity to, and how we deliver power and produce power for our customers, but also create a very signiﬁcant investment opportunity for our investors to invest against all of us. And many of our investments are pointed at areas that will reduce operating costs as well, so for example our generation transformation will be a net positive to our customers, investing in our grid ultimately would be a net positive to our customers. So, we're pretty excited, and this historic transformation that we're undertaking at DTE for electric company."
"Got it. Maybe I will throw in one more. As we think about the updated growth brand coming out of EEI, what is the base I guess year or EPS that we should be contemplating when you give your role for? Thanks.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","And we do our role for we always go back to original guidance, so those will be on 2022 original guidance."
"Just want to follow up on a comment, you made about interest rates. You said, if I heard aright contemplated higher rates in the plants, that no one packed on long-term growth. Just to clarify, is it that you assumed kind of rates up here, or is it that you have other oﬀsets with a cost elsewhere in the plan to dampen that impact and fully oﬀset?","We had to have a tendency to plan conservatively and we look at a lot of risk and opportunities in our plan. We look at that every week and look at the challenges. So we are conﬁdent, depending or irregardless of how rates move -- regardless how rates move, we will be able to oﬀset those with other things within our plan."
Okay. Great. And then probably could you discuss kind of how demand has been on volunteer renewables throughout 2022. I know it's been a very eventful year at the large automaker announcement on solar this summer and if you could discuss kind of incremental partnerships using that model from for that you're contemplating? Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Well, it's been an extraordinary year for our volunteer renewables program. Actually, matter of fact, this week, we executed -- we're in the process of executing an agreement for another 400 megawatts of sales long-term commitments. This takes us now to a total of 2,100 megawatts sold, which is well above our expectations at the world we would be at this point in time. So, we'll provide an update at EEI, and how do we see this progress in a successfully impacting our long-term plans. So, we'll update you on that, but it's been an extraordinary success story."
"Okay, great. And to follow-up on it super quickly. Do you think you can replicate the kind of success you've had in 2022 in 2023?","We've got signiﬁcant opportunities in front of us, the pipeline is strong, and we'll continue to grow that program. And then as we look at transformation of our generation ﬂeet that will also bring new opportunity to the renewables ﬂeet. So, renewables will be a big part of our agenda going forward here at DTE."
"Hey Jerry. Dave, this one's actually for you, just following on the AMT impact, can you just let us know what you're assuming for the repairs tax deduction on your kind of end result there?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah, thanks Mike. Yeah right now we're looking at as written so we think that the way it's written it does apply to things like storm repairs and doesn't get the favorable treatment under the BMT even with that we don't see that this is going to have a big income or cash impact on our plan. We do know that EEI is advocating to have this included and that we would beneﬁt from that also, but we've already modeled that we can mitigate any cash or income impact from the BMT for the most part."
"Okay. Okay, that's super helpful. And then just sticking with that, I think you mentioned some cushion versus credit metrics. Can you just refresh us on where you're at on FFO-to-debt and what the thresholds are?","Yeah for -- it's a little diﬀerent across the agencies, but right now we're around 16% FFO-to-debt. You can see the thresholds by rating agencies are in the 13% to 14% range. So, we do have some cushion there to those ones."
"Hi. With respect to the IRA, was enough detail out on that such that the full IRA impact would be included in the IRP? Or is there something more to come? I know you'd be able to incorporate into your own forecast but it's 100% of it incorporated in the IRP?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   It is. It is incorporated. Dave, do you want to add any thoughts to that?     We will see the details as they get speciﬁed over the next year. But understanding what's going to happen in the at the high level for our generation can all be incorporating the IRP and then how the how it goes into our plan. We can we feel like we can model that but how it plays out speciﬁcally is still yet to be decided as you know."
"Okay. Great thanks. And then just real quick, any election issues in Michigan that would have a material impact on either short-term or long-term outlook?","Well, certainly we've worked well with various administrations over history republican dominated administrations, democrat dominated administrations. We'll see what happens in November, but it feels like the compact that exist today will likely remain intact in terms of the political structure but we'll know more after election day, but whatever the results we feel that we have productive relationships and that there's clear understanding by republicans and democrats what our investment agenda is and what the purpose of our agenda is. And strong support for that."
"Jerry, Dave, good morning. Congrats on a good quarter.","Good morning, Anthony.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Hi Anthony."
"I just have one quick one and I appreciate if you want to hold an answer until you make the ﬁling to the IRP which is just if I understand correctly, there's a lot of consensus building prior to the actual ﬁling, just looking for some inside data, is that still accurate in any particular topic or issue that you've got the more feedback than others?","Well, I would say Anthony, we did an extensive amount of stakeholder engagement throughout this process more than I believe we've ever done. And so that's been quite valuable to us. And what I would say most revealing for us was when we tested our customer opinions across broad demographics, what we saw was strong alignment with our IRP, and that'll certainly be very evident when we ﬁle the IRP engagement with other stakeholders, regulators and legislators I would say support, of course as we get into the details, we'll have to work out those details and I'm sure that some state leaders will have diﬀerent opinions, but I'm pretty conﬁdent we're going to work through all of that, and end up with a really strong IRP that supports a transformation -- fundamental transformation of our generation ﬂeet."
Great. That's all I had. Looking forward to seeing you guys down in Hollywood.,"Thank you, Anthony. See you soon.  Operator  Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good morning. Given the tax incentives for RNG in your comments around higher IRRs. What is the constraints to accelerate these growth projects in your portfolio and for your outlook?,"I would say the constraint is keeping that portfolio at 10% of our overall enterprise in terms of earnings and EPS. But, what I do see with high IRRs is the greater contributions to sort of more eﬃcient capital deployment, if you will as we see higher IRRs, so very juicy projects that that means we'll invest less capital and get the same EPS."
"Okay. And then given the large changes to LCFS prices, are you looking to evolve your hedging strategy with these projects?","We've had a pretty strong hedging program with LCFS and also how we place some of our federal products. And we've got a combination of what I would call ﬁnancial hedges against the sales as well as ﬁxed long-term sales price that are priced, that's helping to balance any sort of ﬂuctuations that we may get as well as we build contingency in that I plan to accommodate any positions that might remain open."
"So, given your constraint or your stated constrain around 10% of your portfolio contribution to these assets. Do you view DTE is a long-term holder of this portfolio. As I suggest that the growth prospects may be higher for somebody else.","Well, look at it, if we saw an opportunity to harvest and get more value than we see we're always open to that and I think we've got a long track record of doing that and non-utility businesses, we've reinvented ourselves in that space, three and four times since I've been at DTE and we've always been very successful in building these businesses and at the time presents itself and the opportunity presents itself the harvesting create incremental value for our investors, we're up for that and we're looking at that all the time."
