Question,Answer
"Excellent. So perhaps ﬁrst just to kick it oﬀ, good progress on the nuclear plant thus far. Curious on where you stand with respect to any end point recognizing that there is still some time before you actually shut these units down. How are negotiations and progress going there? And how also at the same time are you thinking about cash ﬂow and the net cash ﬂow comment in light of some of the mark-to-market improvements in the last few months in the Northeast more broadly?","Hey, Julien. This is Drew. So on the ﬁrst question regarding Indian Point, as we stated previously our intent is to follow the path similar to Pilgrim and Palisades and Vermont Yankee on Indian Point. The good news is we have a lot of time. As you've mentioned it's going to be a while before those plants are shut down. And we are receiving heightened interest because we've had success with Vermont Yankee on the NRC. So we're actually going to take some of the time to get the best deal we can and we're not going to probably talk about speciﬁcs of the process and where we are in the process as we go along.  And on the second question regarding, sorry, mark-to-market, when we were thinking about the cash measure we were thinking about potential for contributions to our decommissioning trust funds and the current market expectations through the last couple of days are reﬂected in our expectation of positive cash '19 to '22."
"Got it. Excellent. And then quickly as a follow-up, good success on the regulated front as well. Are you thinking about the execution against the higher equity ratios across your service territories as well? It seems like you've had some of the settlements coming already.","We have. I think if you look at Texas it is close to 51%, the New Orleans request is about 50%, Louisiana is around 49%. The ones that we are still working on moving up are in Arkansas and Mississippi. I think Arkansas is the lowest at about 46% or so. So we are working on moving those up. But it'll take a little bit more time."
"Got it. And how is that reﬂected just in the case of Arkansas in the context of what you've ﬁled, I believe, as part of a settlement there too?",I think that was what we anticipated when we made that ﬁling. And we are expecting to move it up over the next few years.
"Hi. Appreciate, Leo, the update on the legal topics proactively. So appreciate that. On the quarter I wanted to ﬁrstly talk on load growth. The load growth year-to-date you mentioned is about 0.5% but your guidance assumption was more like negative 0.7%. So just wanted to understand what's driving the improvement year-to-date and is that more sustainable do you think or is that more 2018 speciﬁc?","It's Rod. I think driving the year we saw continued strong industrial growth. But what was diﬀerent was the residential and commercial sector being stronger than we anticipated. But to your question about how we think about that in the outlook our outlook haven't change given the guidance we gave you through, I belief, 2022. So we're not making any adjustments to our long-term outlook.    (inaudible) we're expecting AMI as we deploy that will give our customers better information and that will actually put some pressure on residential and commercial sales as we go forward (inaudible)."
Got you. Fair enough. And Drew maybe for you the second question more on ﬁnance and like the credit side. It looks like your FFO to debt obviously has gone below the 15% target that you have and the debt to cap has gone above the 65%. Wanted to understand are the rating agencies allowing you some time to deal with this ADIT credit and kind of allow that lower than 15% for a couple of years? How is that pressure or discussion with the agency going?,"Yes. Praful they're fully aware of where we are and our plan associated with the excess ADIT. And what we've committed to for FFO to debt is 15% or above starting in 2020. And they're aware of that. And if you actually back out the excess ADIT you will see that we're still at 15% on that. There's a reconciliation in the back of the materials. On the debt to total capital, I don't know that they focus on that as much. They're going to be -- the main measure that Moody's in particular is looking at is that parent to the total debt. And so we're maintaining that at or below 25%. And that number should start to drop over the next few quarters as we pull down on our equity forward."
"Got you. Much appreciated, guys and look forward to catching up at EEI. Thanks.","Thanks, Praful.  Thanks, Praful.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is now open."
"I'm just wondering when we see you guys at the EEI and we talk about the capital plan, I mean your capital plan has been dominated by -- well not dominated by, but a large portion of your capital plan has been focused on building large -- medium to large size CCGT's combustion turbines, the rice plant in New Orleans. How much should we expect your -- the type of capital you are spending to evolve with regard to thinking about renewables, battery storage, energy eﬃciency technologies behind the meter as we move into the paradigm that other regions of the country, other utilities have sort of been compelled to or proactively embracing in terms of technological change?","Yes, Greg I'll start and let to Drew jump in. At Analyst Day we talked about the continued need for new generation. Obviously that's actually when we had identiﬁed the Mississippi need at that point. If you think about the generation that we have, we will still continue to need to refresh that as we get through time. We still have a signiﬁcant amount of legacy generation that we can replace with new or more modern, more eﬃcient better environmental footprint type of stuﬀ. But as we also mentioned there is a dynamic of renewables battery storage becoming economic and competitive with central station generation and that's why as we've announced in the past we've got 1,000 megawatts renewables under development at the moment.  So we continue to look at ways to test out battery storage either as we have it with our New Orleans solar facility right now or even on grid and other areas where it would be useful for us to have battery storage. This is not necessarily only for the backup of generation, but some to me the T&D needs of the system. But as you might recall also when we are at Analyst Day we started to talk a lot more about grid modernization and where we could go with customer facing types of investments. So we see that picking up as well. Really in addition to and post AMI, we should have a signiﬁcant amount of investment where devices that give us more information about the grid, give us more capability to do things remotely, give us a little bit better troubleshooting capability and all that in addition to how we manage information and data and analytics that go to our customers. So I guess the bottom line is we continue to have a lot of the traditional investment, particular given the growth in the service territory but you should see more and more of our investment start to pick up on the P&D side as well as we put together more of a grid modernization package.  So the bottom line is we are wanting for capital expenditure ideas. We're just managing those with what are the things that give us the most bang for a buck for our customers that continue to keep us as the lowest price utility in the United States and to continue to improve our reliability all -- managing all of those at the same time with a keen eye on where we're going from an environmental footprint standpoint.  Each one of those new power plants that we add adds a new resource that's signiﬁcantly more environmentally friendly that we want to replace. Certainly we would go renewables and battery storage more and more and that will improve our environmental footprint.     And then as Drew mentioned AMI and some of these other technologies will get us in a mode that actually drive our customer usage in a way that we're producing less such that we've got lower emissions as well. So a lot of win-win opportunities out there as technology starts to improve."
"One question on follow-up, diﬀerent topic and I think I applaud your desire to simplify your earnings disclosures. They are very, very, very complete and new but probably we could use some simpliﬁcation going forward. But on that front for many, many years you've had a very successful ability to bring in earnings through tax and while that's created a lot of volatility it's created value. How deep of a well should we assume you have, I mean there must be a ﬁnite opportunity to go back and work with the IRS and the states to improve your tax positions pro forma. It's been so many years since year-after-year you've been successful in making that kind of a proﬁt center. How long should we assume that can continue?","Greg, this is Drew. So certainly we think about that like we think about other line items and to the extent that we can beneﬁt our customers, we would certainly continue to go look for opportunities. And so that part won't change and so I think we will continue to drive in that direction for the time being and for the foreseeable future. We do think that there might be other things out there but they're not well baked enough at this point to be able to articulate exactly what they would be or when they would come."
Just a question. I believe when you recently announced the Holtec deal you indicated that you felt that it would be quicker to get through the NRC process second time around and you put some parameters around that. So I'm just curious having completed the Vermont Yankee do you still feel that's the case? And can you remind us sort of what your thought process around getting the Palisades and Pilgrim done would be time-wise?,"Sure. This is Drew. And as you remember Jonathan, the Vermont Yankee deal is kind of a ﬁrst of a kind deal. So everybody was learning through that process and certainly the NRC was learning through the process and we would expect that there would be some kind of learning curve associated with it. And so our current anticipation is that we'll complete the Pilgrim process by the end of next year. The Palisades process of course won't commence until 2022. But we would expect sometime second half of 2022 is whenever we would be able to close that particular half of the transaction."
"Okay. Did I hear you right that you'd ﬁle with the NRC on Pilgrim this quarter or early next year? Sorry, I missed it.",We're aiming for this quarter. We're aiming for this quarter.
Thanks. I guess you mentioned sort of a commitment to an improved FFO to debt ratio by 2020. Can you just elaborate on how you go from the current level to the committed higher level that you've promised for the rating agencies?,"Yes. Paul this is Drew. So I think the main diﬀerence is just absence of returning -- assets returning all that cash. So I think of it as a top line deﬁcit of year-to-date $342 million. You add that back in it should to improve. The other thing I think that will improve is just the business as well. Things like the Choctaw transaction, Moody's actually wrote about it as a positive thing because we'll go into rates as soon as we close and we'll start to collect on that. There won't be any lag associated with it and it's a signiﬁcant investment. So that should improve our cash coverage ratios."
Okay. And you don't anticipate then any need for equity over the next several years then?,Yes. It's no diﬀerent than what we said at Analyst Day which is nothing expected until 2021 or beyond.
"Slide 37 on the special items, just had a couple of questions on that. Fourth line down the gain/loss on sale of assets, that line is driven by the performance of MBT. Is that correct?","A little bit. And ARO as we mentioned, for Pilgrim this quarter the ARO change that's a decreasing cost estimate change. And it actually changed the amount of the loss that we would have experienced in 2019 next year and moved it forward to this quarter. So you saw that come down a little bit as it relates to the Pilgrim transaction. The other thing that's been going on is we've been working hard on some deferred tax assets that we have in those companies -- those project companies. And to the extent that we can ﬁnd ways to utilize those we wouldn't have to write them oﬀ."
So the ARO revaluation you move that to '18 and that went up in what line two? And then there was also an improvement in line four on the gain/loss. Is that -- did I get - -?,"Yes. but it would have been in diﬀerent years, yeah. So it would have gotten in in '18 and out in '19."
