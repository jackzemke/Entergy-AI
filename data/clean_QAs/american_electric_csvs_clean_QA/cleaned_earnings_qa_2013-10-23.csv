Question,Answer
"Thanks. A couple of questions. Thanks for so much detail on your perspective on sales growth. When you look at -- for planning purposes, when you look out over the next 12 to 24 months, when you normalize for a lot of the idiosyncrasies of what is going on in your service territory, what are the range of expectations for best case/worst case/base case sales growth going forward?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Well, Greg, good to hear from you. We have been assuming that load growth would be relatively ﬂat. And that is what we're assuming in our modeling because you can't ignore what is going on with the economy.  And really, it is hard to tell what impact it would have in the future. Everybody is expecting -- you talk to economists, and every quarter it seems like the next quarter we are going to see an economic recovery. Well, that has been going on for years. So we are being deliberately conservative on that. And we will continue to be that way."
"Okay, Nick, that's great. Good to hear from you, too. So your plans to drive the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration are anchored in the assumption that you are going to have to plow through the relatively ﬂat sales growth picture.","Yes, I would say it really is ﬂat load growth. It is certainly cost containment through the eﬃciency eﬀorts that we have ongoing. And capital allocations, those areas where we can get more concurrent growth and better ROEs."
"And Nick, on the earnings growth aspiration, is there a speciﬁc end-date to that? Or is your goal at EEI going to be to show people that you don't just have the ability to grow at that rate through 2015, but that you have the ability to oﬀset post-2015 headwinds and continue to grow at that rate?","Yes, you got it. We will show that, based upon that original 2013 guidance range that we gave -- and if you look at that, the bottom line 4%, the top line 6% -- we will be in that range."
"Okay. A ﬁnal question. The pension funding looks amazing. We have got a tax and accounting team here that has done some analysis here at ISI on the impact of higher discount rates on all of the companies in the S&P 500. And utilities in particular, given their large pensions, seem to be particularly large beneﬁciaries of that going into 2014.  As you look at your planning, should it be our expectation that your pension, GAAP pension expenses, should decline dramatically next year? Or are you going to do things like take down the expected return because you are now so well-funded, which would mitigate the impact of that decline?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Greg, it is Brian. So we have over time been de-risking our pension portfolio, shifting more of the assets into ﬁxed income and away from equities, as we have become more fully funded. We are anticipating that in a step-down basis, our pension costs will start to approach our annual draw on the pension, which will be close to about $100 million. So next year, we anticipate it will be close to $125 million. And then we expect the expense over time will approximate that $100 million-per-year level."
And what was your pension expense budgeted for this year?,"We are anticipating it to be closer to $200 million, about $175 million, $180 million."
"Great. Just on the load growth questions Greg was asking. If we were to draw it out and you think about the breakdown in customer growth on a more durable basis, do you think the commercial side continues to show momentum, and the laggards are going to be industrial residential? Or how do you think within a ﬂat load-growth proﬁle do you see the customer classes behavior?","Yes, that is a great question. We see all three classes continuing to oscillate. And there is a large discussion whether you are, just in general nature of the American economy, moving to an   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   industrial manufacturing, to more of a service economy. That would bode well for the commercial side of things.  On the other hand, you want some fundamental base of industrial and manufacturing to enable the sustaining nature of commercial, and ultimately, residential growth. But to us, I think the beauty of AEP is that we are in so many areas of the country. And as Brian talked about, diﬀerent parts of the country are experiencing diﬀerent types of growth.  And based on that diversity, and the diversity of the margins related to the components of the classes of customers, I think we are probably in pretty good stead to remain, at least from the overall perspective, being relatively ﬂat, going forward. It would -- when you look at the components of the economy, though, in our service territory, with the shale gas activity, with the energy-related economy that we have in place. If we really start to see consumption pick up by a vibrant economy and there is more focus on the energy infrastructure and the energy resources of this country, it is going to bode well for our service territory.  So you could see those kinds of measures pick up. But like I said earlier, that is all conjecture on all of our parts at this point in time. I think it is going to take more of a federal and state policy and regulatory policy that supports that kind of thing. And also, with the tax issues and things that need to be worked out by the federal government, you are not -- you won't see much growth until we see some clarity around how to invest in this country. And when you see that, I think you will see a diﬀerent makeup of what we are dealing with from a load cycle perspective.  But like I said, we have been very conservative about it. We will continue to be conservative until we see indications otherwise. But when you look at the shale gas oﬀsets, the chemical manufacturing picking up a little bit, that is an early indication that maybe something is happening here. But it's hard to tell."
"Nick, just on the shale gas-related activity. How much of your industrial load is that today? And can you just give some color on how much that has been growing as an underlying class, since it doesn't get broken out?","Yes. Brian's got the detail on that.     I do. Let me get to the proper page here. And I'm having trouble ﬁnding it. So the pipeline and oil and gas extraction are smaller percentages. It is in the 3% to 5% of our total industrial load.  But the pipeline transportation, in particular, grew at 26% for the quarter. And then well in the double digits for the year-to-date period. So although it is smaller portions of our industrial load, the growth in those areas has been spectacular.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      When you look at the Eagle Ford shale area, for example, there is a whole list of industrial manufacturing facilities that are coming online in Texas. Now, some of them have been delayed in terms of their start-up. But you can see that kind of activity when you have a vibrant and a shale gas play in operation.  And you are now seeing Cline, and there is another shale gas operation now in west Texas that is picking up as well. Oil and gas activity is deﬁnitely not in the positive for the territory. And I think that is why you are seeing some of the commercial activity in Ohio pick up as well. Although the Utica shale is not as far along as the Eagle Ford shale yet.     Let me give you more detail on that, Dan. Oil and gas extraction is 3.8% of total industrial load. Pipeline transportation, our 10th largest sector, is 3.8% of industrial. And oil and gas extraction is up almost 27% relative to the pre-recession peak. And the pipeline transportation is up 16% relative to the pre-recession peak. So some pretty signiﬁcant gains there over the last couple of years."
"On the dividend increase, obviously two increases within three quarters here. And I get a cumulative total of about 6.4% increase. What can we take away from this in terms of likely future growth in the dividend? And when should we expect dividend change announcements in the future?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Well, probably can't comment on the dividend changes in the future. But I can say this is consistent with what the Board has laid out for us in terms of the expected range, the payout ratio, the 60% to 70%. And they have also said that our dividend payout will be commensurate with the earnings capability of the Company. So those things, as long as it continues to play the way it is, then we should be in good shape."
"And how about -- so Nick, you can't tell us anything about -- should we expect dividend increases in the First Quarter, as previously, going back to that pattern? Or will it just be uncertain for a period of time?","Well, typically, we evaluate dividends in October. But like I said, we will have to look at the situation at the time with our Board, and make that determination. But typically, it is October."
"Right, fair enough. And one other area to touch on. Previously you have had a slide where you show 2014 EPS range of $3.15 to $3.45. But I didn't see that in here. Are we just in a quiet period for 2014 at this stage? Or should we continue to think about 4% to 6% growth in 2014 oﬀ of the previous range for 2013?","Yes, we haven't changed 2014. That guidance is still good."
"But you had mentioned that in your long-term guidance, you are assuming ﬂat, low growth. We have seen some challenging quarters here in terms of low growth. If low growth were to continue to trend negative as it has been, how much of a headwind is that to your overall growth aspirations?","It just depends on the components of what the load decreases are. Because we have a lot more margin in not only commercial, but residential as well. So it will depend on the components of it. But I can tell you that if we continue to see load deterioration, then we believe we have the process in place to respond to that.  I keep saying, this business is about optimization now. And you've got to remember, too, that I don't think load growth gives you the entire picture of the earnings capability of the Company. Because we are having to reinvest in the grid, we are having to invest not only from the distribution perspective, but also the transmission enhancements associated with it. And keep in mind, too, that we are producing earnings on the retail side beyond our own service territory.  So typically, we have always looked at load because it was all like one integrated utility. And we only had the load increases, and really it is pretty measurable in terms of what the investment capability was. But we are in a diﬀerent picture now, where there will be more contributions from diﬀerent areas. But as that load changes, we will obviously be watching the make-up of that load, the ﬁnancial impact of the margin capability of that load, and making adjustments accordingly.     So to Nick's point, Stephen, some of the challenges that we have seen in industrial so far, we know we are going to see at least through the Third Quarter of next year because of what has happened at that large primary metals customer. And to some degree, that will be oﬀset by what we are seeing in chemicals, pipeline transportation, oil and gas extraction.  But in this year, we have seen that we are down overall load 1.7% year to date, but it has only impacted earnings by $0.02 so far. So Nick's point that the combination of where we have load increases or declines makes a huge diﬀerence as to what our results will be.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Yes, and the large customer that shut down, even looking at that contract -- and it was a special contract obviously. When you look at that kind of ﬁnancial impact, it was still negligible, and we continued with the earnings guidance that we provided. So I think you have to look at it really on a customer-by-customer basis, and what type of customer they are."
"Just shifting over to the merchant side of the world, we have seen a more challenging gas environment. Gas basis has been trending negative. As you think about the long-term merchant earnings outlook and think about the future, how does that factor in? Is that in your current thinking in terms of -- it's moving so quickly -- but just curious how you look at the headwinds in terms of the local gas price and the impact on power prices.","Yes, it absolutely is in our thinking. Gas prices remain relatively low for a long period of time. And I still believe they are going to remain low for the foreseeable future. And it is something that we have to adjust to from an unregulated standpoint. Chuck Zebula, who has taken over the generation, the unregulated generation side of the group with the retail piece of it, he is very focused on bringing down his cost structure to enable his business to continue to operate in a positive fashion.  And I mean, there's several things you have to look at. One is certainly the natural gas picture. The other is the capacity markets themselves, and the inability for those markets to actually pay long-term investors in an appropriate fashion. And that is something that we are working on as well.  And then also the impact of distribution. Although it is pretty minimal in our territory, you think about those things, they're forcing functions for us to reform our business so that we can succeed in that kind of environment. And that's what we are focused on. And our Board is very focused on that as well."
"Hi there. A couple of the things we are already on concert [ph]. But I just wanted to -- on Greg's question about how long your -- whether there is a deﬁnitive end point to your 4% to 6% growth aspiration, I wasn't sure you really addressed that piece of the question.","No, that is our long-term growth forecast. And it is as far as we can see at this point."
"Okay. Great. And then secondly, just as you look at it, assuming your load forecast of around zero is the scenario you're dealing with. Roughly how much of the 4% to 6% is coming from costs and continuous improvement and investment? Can you give us a little preview of some of these EEI build-ups? Is it half from cost savings, half from growth investments, or some other mix?","Well, we will certainly have more detail on that in November. But we obviously are making pretty good headway from a continuous improvement and cost reduction perspective. But you have to also think about rates that have been put into eﬀect, the transmission investment, and all kinds of things together. So I wouldn't look at one single area to determine what we are doing. But we will certainly have more detail on that in November."
"When did Ormat quit taking power, and what is the strategy with Ohio as to potentially mitigate that?","Well, they shut down completely just probably two, three weeks ago. And right now, there is no plan. I mean, obviously from an Ohio perspective that was taken before the Ohio Commission. The Ohio Commission dealt with it in the best way that they could.  I think it was a situation where the world markets had a tremendous impact on all of the primary metals suppliers. And that is really -- I think that is going to be the primary driver as to what could happen in the future, relative to those particular types of businesses.  So at this point, we are continuing on as business as usual. Although it is unfortunate that you line up in a situation where so many jobs are impacted. But we have a lot of customers that have that kind of experience. And certainly we did everything we could possibly do from a special contract perspective, and from other areas and working with the commission to enable them to stay in business as long as possible.  So I think we did everything we could do. The commission, in our belief, did everything that they could do. And I think it is a matter of the business case itself, supporting that kind of business in the future."
"And can you just -- I don't know if you have already shut the door on this next question, but which LA [ph] is thinking about Ohio generation strategically?","Yes. We get that question a lot. From an Ohio generation perspective, we are still on path to -- our ﬁrst course of action, obviously, is to complete corporate separation, to get that done. And   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   then secondly, Chuck is busily working on what his cost structure is going to look like in the future, to succeed, and even a $59 per megawatt day environment. We need to fully understand what that means.  And also, we are pursuing changes within the PJM market construct to enable long-term investment decisions to be made. Those are prerequisites for us to determine what the nature of that business is, and does it ﬁt within our portfolio of companies? And I can't say at this point the timing of that. But certainly, I can tell you that our management, just like our investors, are fully engaged in trying to determine that result. And our Board obviously is very focused on those types of issues as well.  So it is not that we are sitting and waiting for a corporate separation to complete before we start thinking about it. I can assure you that a lot of thought is being given, not only in terms of what milestones need to occur, but also in terms of the information we need to make that kind of decision for the future."
Just on the topic of corporate separation. Could you just clarify what are the remaining steps to get that done?,"Yes, so we have the West Virginia case that we ultimately want to complete. And then there's three FERC-related cases that we intend on getting completed by the end of the year as well. And Brian, you know the details on those? There is --   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      I don't. We got half -- we ﬁled for six. There are three more that are left to be done. And we don't have signiﬁcant opposition in those. So we anticipate getting those shortly after we would be able to get what we need from West Virginia.     Yes, one is a pool agreement. The other is -- the operating agreement is in place. And then there is an interim agreement that would be put in place as well. If you need more detail, Rich Munczinski is here and he can describe those for you."
"But right now, it looks like those should all potentially be done by year end.","Yes. Three of them are already done, and three to go in FERC. And then the corporate separation."
"Okay. Just a clariﬁcation from follow-up on the dividend. So you increased it another 2%. You had increased it 4% beginning of the year, the indicated rate. So that would be over 6%. But then you're saying that this is a 4% increase for the year. I assume that's the dividends paid?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, that's right."
"When we look forward to think about growth in the dividend, is it oﬀ this dividends paid in 2013, or the indicated rate? It is just a diﬀerent way of looking at dividend growth than we normally look at it, I think. So I'm just curious.","It is just math, Steve, as you know. So what we are trying to do is, as the Board adjusted their stated dividend payout ratio to that 60% to 70%, we are trying to stay in that range. And I think you will see us grow earnings with regulated earnings over time."
"Hi, good morning. Just hopefully two quick questions. One is, I think you call it the equalizer slide, slide 4. And you give GAAP ROEs. Is there any way of getting a regulated ROE here? Because I think there is maybe some distortion, where Texas may include some securitizations. Or I think you state all systems sales in Ohio Power.  And the second question is related to the aluminum sector or primary metal manufacturing, where Brian said some of the manufacturers are using this opportunity to retool their plants.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   With the retooling, do you think that makes them competitive in the current environment? And we get back to a pre-recession load, or where do we settle back in it?","Let me start with the second question ﬁrst, Anthony. So for instance, some of the things that we have seen some people do in terms of retooling -- we have one customer who is taking down three boilers that they had, and are replacing it with a single more eﬃcient boiler. So in that case, they are becoming more eﬃcient and we don't expect the load to come back to the pre- recession load.  In other instances, people are saying -- hey, prices aren't high enough here for us to continue operating at the levels that we were. We are going to take the plant down. We are going to do preventative maintenance and get the plant back on line at a time when aluminum prices recover.  So it is really a combination of both of those things. Some of it is eﬃciency and the load will be reduced when it comes back. And another is just taking opportunistic outages.     The interesting thing is we are seeing is, with the customers that are obviously still connected to the system that haven't gone out of business, those are still the demand charges. The demand ratchet that is in place for the industrial customers has not diminished. So that is a positive in terms of an indication of where they are at this point in time. Oh --     And then the equalizer graph.     Yes, the equalizer graph.     Anthony, we can deﬁnitely get for you the GAAP ROEs that are represented there. But you are correct. In a place like Texas, we are having the eﬀects of the securitization. And absent that, the regulated wires return in Texas is much closer to 10%.  So we can get you the detail on those for each of these, a GAAP return, rather than the pro forma-earned ROEs that we have listed on the slide. And as Nick was saying about Ohio, if we had reﬂected the impact of the write-oﬀs that we had, that 12.3% return that you see there in Ohio would be signiﬁcantly lower than what we are showing there, much closer to 6%."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So other than Ohio and Texas, the GAAP and regulated ROE are within the same ballpark. It is just those two outliers? Just because, if you think about the Company can keeping manages costs, but one gets to where it is -- hey, you can't really manage costs in Ohio or AP Texas, because you're already at 12%. Whereas maybe the middle ground on this slide -- I guess the exception of Oklahoma -- you could manage costs. But I guess if there is a big diﬀerence between GAAP and regulated, there is some nice opportunity there.","Yes, you got it. Those states in particular that you mentioned, Texas and Ohio, are outliers, for the reasons that we discussed."
"Two quick questions. One, in the past, you guys had used to lay out for us, as it related to rate increases, how much of next year's rate increases were already in hand. So if we did the same for 2014, looking at the stuﬀ that has already happened, how much of the planned rate increases for next year would you say are already in hand right now?","We will provide you more detail on that at EEI, Ali. For this year, for what we had anticipated getting, we have most of those increases in hand at this point."
Okay. Also --   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"And the magnitude is smaller, too, than it used to be. It used to be huge."
"Okay. And then on the growth rate, just to be clear. I don't want to be lengthy here, but the 4% to 6%, as you mentioned a couple of times, oﬀ your original 2013 guidance. The fact that your original 2013 guidance has now gone up, if you just focus on the midpoint. So when 2013 is an actual number, presumably higher than what it was previously thought to be, would you stick to the guidance of the actual 2013 number? Or would you keep coming back to the original guidance?",We are going to keep coming back to the original guidance.
"Okay. So the implication would be, Nick that if 2013 ends up higher, mathematically, the growth rate slightly becomes lower than that. Is that the way to think about it?","Well, actually, it is 4% to 6% from the original 2013 guidance. And there is a bandwidth there, and we will be operating within that bandwidth."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Yes.  Operator  We do have a question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.     Hi, Paul."
"I want to ask you about the Texas case and the write-oﬀ that we got there. Is that -- it sound to me that you guys were hoping to have that revised somewhat in your favor. Does the write-oﬀ reﬂect any change in that, or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?","Yes, well, we got a little bit surprised. Because the commission -- during the entire case, we had a cap put in place that was originally our estimate of the cost of construction that did not include AFUDC. And during the whole pendency of that case, there was never an indication that the cost of ﬁnancing or AFUDC would be included in that cap.  And the commission -- at the previous commission hearing, they indicated that AFUDC was included in that. And that surprised us, surprised everyone, I think. And then they issued an order saying that it was included. So the write-oﬀ is commensurate with the obviously, the recognition that if the cap is truly inclusive of that AFUDC cost, then that precipitates a write-oﬀ from our perspective. So we did that.  We are going to ask -- we are going to ﬁle for re-hearing and show, I think, a pretty credible case that it never was discussed. And something that, through the entire case, there is no record of our ability to respond to that kind of component being included in the cost cap.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So I think it is a pretty serious issue for the Texas Commission to take up. Particularly when you have a power plant that is the ﬁrst of its kind, it is probably, out of the large projects that have occurred, it is been deﬁnitely the closest to budget. It has been lower than what we anticipated from an eﬃciency standpoint, which inures [ph] to the beneﬁt of customers on a fuel cost perspective.  And it has won two power plant awards. And we won the Edison Electric Award for that plant as well. So to have that kind of positive investment that is made, and it is found to be prudent, and to have a substantial amount of the costs of the plant essentially be disallowed, is not a good message for those who are thinking about building capacity in the State of Texas. So --"
"Sure. I hear you on all of that. And it all makes sense. But what I'm wondering is, the write-oﬀ, though, doesn't reﬂect any beneﬁt from reconsideration? Or does it?","It does not.     No, it assumes --     We have an order from the commission that does not allow for the recovery of the AFUDC now. And we will go for a re-hearing. If we get a positive outcome from re-hearing, then we will adjust accordingly. But right now we can't assume anything for (multiple speakers) purposes.     That's right. There is just no basis for that recognition."
"Brian, I want to make sure I understood your commentary about pension costs for the income statement purposes. If I interpreted it correctly -- and I may have totally missed it -- you are basically implying that it is a $100 million tailwind for 2014, versus what you had expected for 2013?","Pension costs, pension expense will be about -- between 70 -- it will be about a $50 million improvement 2013 to 2014."
"Okay. Meaning a reduction in the O&M expense that, that pension drives.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes, now let me be clear. That is total pension costs. That doesn't include the amount that is allocated for CapEx versus O&M."
"Understood. Completely understood. Also, I want to make sure we think about it on the asset transfer dockets, both the Kentucky approval and West Virginia. Can you talk a little bit about the bottom line, what drops to the bottom line? I know you got the $44 million surcharge. But I'm just trying to think about what the cost oﬀsets to that would be, and trying to do the same thing on the West Virginia side.","Well, in West Virginia, we don't have an answer yet.     Yes. But oﬀ-system sales, obviously, because that is not included, so that oﬀ-system sale impact. And I guess --     And then the capacity settlement we get to keep, as we had previously. So the capacity payments that were in rates that Kentucky used to make to Ohio Power remain in eﬀect during the period of the freeze. So it is the plus $44 million, keep the capacity payments, and you keep the upside of oﬀ-system sales until we go back in for the next rate case."
"Okay. And then when I think about the West Virginia request -- just the request, I know you don't have an answer. Can you give similar details about the bottom line impact on there the items which are a bottom line impact there?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   It is a little complicated at this point because of the Mitchell component that is up in the air. But we would not anticipate a signiﬁcant diﬀerence versus where we are today. But that will the signiﬁcant component of what the settlements are. Particularly in regards to how we handle the Mitchell assets in regard to the Wheeling merger into APCo.
"Got it. I will follow up oﬄine on this one. Thanks, guys.","Thanks, Michael.     Thank you for joining us today on today's call.
