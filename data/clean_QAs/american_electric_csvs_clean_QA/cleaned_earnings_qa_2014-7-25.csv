Question,Answer
I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your comments on the new proposed regulation on CO2. And I was wondering if I could maybe draw you out a little bit on how you see the rule being implemented in the states where you have generation? I appreciate that you're submitting comments and that the rule will be changed but are you anticipating any particular form of regulation in the major states where you have coal-ﬁred power plants?,"So, that's a great question. I don't know that I have a good answer at this point. I'm not sure anybody does. We're working extensively and have outreached to all of our states trying to understand exactly what this plan means. And you know, even our generation, we're just a part of each state that we serve and that's why I stress these are state plans. So we've got to go through the process with them of understanding the generation that's out there, the commitments made around the generation, what that means to the overall plan for the state response. And some of our states obviously have taken a very aggressive view in terms of litigation and it remains to be seen how that whole process will work out.  I think this plan is more far reaching than anything that's ever occurred before. And when you change dispatch order of units within states, when you change resources within state and give guidelines that are pretty signiﬁcant, that really minimizes the other options available, it really makes it challenging for the states. And that's something that we're trying to work through the process to fully understand.  We'll get back with EPA on the facts that we see from a state-by-state perspective and have discussions about it and speciﬁc examples of areas that are of concern, and we'll have to work it out. But I really can't tell you what the process at this point. As you know, the rule provides for 2017 and then 2018 if the states decide to get together, which that will be interesting in itself. As one participant in part of that overall plan, it's hard to imagine how this thing is all going to come together in that timeframe. And then many of the requirements really hit in 2020 so you really don't have much time, probably not enough time, to get what you need done.  So this thing has a long way to play out and I think certainly the comments to the EPA are critical and certainly the EPA needs to be cognizant that these states are dealing with very, very   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   detailed, very complicated issues and also the companies involved. So, Hugh, that's a long answer, long way of saying we don't know at this point."
"One question on the transmission side. When you're – you did this in the ﬁrst quarter and now you're doing it again in terms of updating your transmission capital spending guidance for the year. Can you give us a little more insight on where that spending is occurring? Meaning either speciﬁc jurisdictions, speciﬁc transco or even whether it's just embedded within the VIU, T&D or is it actually at the transco sub? Just trying to tie together your CapEx versus your segments.","It's occurring all over the place but primarily in Ohio, Oklahoma and Indiana. They're RTO- mandated projects, they're other projects, reliability projects, customer connect projects. About 70 – as I recall, about 75% of the mix was in the transcos and 25% was in the regulated operating companies. So this is all block and tackle mandated spending and we have a list of projects and it's not like we're just allocating another $100 million to transmission and say, go ﬁnd something. We have a list of what exactly those projects are by individual project. And it's, I don't know, Brian, it's like 20, 25 separate projects on the page that certainly show the detail."
"So does this mean that you're moving stuﬀ that you had planned on doing in kind of 2015, 2016, 2017 into 2014? So maybe 2014 CapEx, you're kind of accelerating the earnings power but you're not necessarily making, I don't know, the year-for-year ﬁve earnings power higher? Or is this an increase in capital spending if you think about a three- to ﬁve-year budget?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So it is, obviously, ﬁrst of all taking care of that green section of the graph, the incremental transmission that we had for the year. And then we also advanced some projects from future years into this year. But that doesn't mean that all those – there's no additional identiﬁed projects along the way. There's a lot of other activity going on. The green sections were only deﬁned projects that we knew exactly what they were and where they would be done; and then of course the work continues on continued rehabilitation of the grid from a transmission perspective and additional projects. So while it's advanced from future years, that doesn't mean that there won't be incremental projects as well."
"Okay. And last item. And, Brian, this may be more of a detail one. On the O&M change for 2014 you talked about, can you reiterate what's the amount? And you said that it's largely going to be second half of 2014. And which parts of the business is that actually impacting, meaning VIU, T&D, elsewhere?","It's going to impact all of them, Michael. It's about $60 million and it's going to impact the Vertically Integrated Utilities and AEP GR in terms of plant outages. And it's going to impact all of them in terms of – it's going to impact Vertically Integrated Utilities and Transmission & Distribution Utilities in terms of some transmission forestry spend that we're going to do. And then there are other customer-related projects that'll be in all of the segments that we deal with where we'll be trying to pull those costs forward."
So it's costs that you will pull forward into 2014 but therefore wouldn't necessarily have recurring in 2015?,"Yes, it's really – we're trying to take those 2016 costs out because you know we have that challenge associated with the capacity revenue falloﬀ in 2016 so we're trying to take costs out of 2016 and pull them into 2014 and then not have those costs be recurring in 2016. So if it's plant outages, if we can get ahead on transmission tree trimming that we then get the beneﬁt of that for our customers in 2014 but will not have the resulting spend happening in 2016 to help us ﬁll that gap."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated and congrats on a good quarter.",Sure thing.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Your next question is from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
"Listen, I guess just, Nick, just going back to your comment on the Ohio generation, you said you'd addressed it in a timely fashion and enhanced shareholder value. I guess can you give an update on progress you're seeing as far as long-term contracting of those assets as an alternative to keeping them? And then with the pullback in power prices and that sort of thing, is that having a bearing on potentially delaying when you guys would want to do something hoping for a better environment, particularly after AES pulled their project?","The way we look at it is the way we originally told you, I guess last year or the year before, we're looking for certain things and certainly the hedging of that generation is critical, certainly from AEP retail and wholesale side. We continue to work on the PPA issue in Ohio, focused on trying to bring some sensibility around the risk that customers are taking on in Ohio. And certainly the market areas that we've been working on with PJM and others to enhance capacity and then with the energy markets themselves improving on average, those are all things that help us determine what the future of that business looks like.  And obviously, we're not just stopping there. We're looking at all the cost structures around that business and really treating it like any other investor would treat it. So it's really important for us to reach those milestones to fully understand what the valuation of that business looks like in the future.  And then the one thing we have is time to focus on those activities and make a decision. All along the way we're keeping our Board up to date on what market conditions look like, what the areas look like in terms of the options available to us. And that's all I'm saying at that point is we will decide what to do with that business when we feel like the time is right to make sure we maximize shareholder value."
So that sounds like 2014 will be consumed with – or part of 2014 will be consumed with making a decision but there's not necessarily anything getting done this year?,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, so 2014 obviously is a year where certain milestones have to come into play. We have several. We've already gone through a capacity auction that was improved. We still have some changes that are permeating through PJM with the demand curve and so forth. We've got other things we're doing and we believe that in 2015, like I mentioned with 80% of that capacity running, it's going to retire mid-2015, so the very real impacts of the retirement of that generation is going to be reﬂected to the capacity and energy markets. So that will give us a real view of what that valuation looks like.  And also from a cost standpoint, Chuck Zebula is doing everything he can do to get the cost structure itself down. And with the lean activities, the plants are running very diﬀerently than what they ran in the past. So all those things are coming together and 2014 is a year where we're going through the process, determining what the milestones are and what the options are available."
"Thank you for that. I guess just one other question on the load growth trends. Obviously there's a lot of enthusiasm in the ﬁrst quarter trying to decipher between weather and usage was a question. We saw residential kind of taper oﬀ comparably in the second quarter. How are you guys feeling about the outlook for demand growth kind of beyond 2014? And are you as encouraged today as you might have been, say, at the end of the ﬁrst quarter?","I'd say we're just as encouraged because if you look at residential, for example, quarter by quarter it was pretty high change in ﬁrst quarter and then it shows a slight decrease in second quarter. A lot of times, residential sort of gets skewed from quarter to quarter based upon whether it be number of holidays, whether it be areas where we're having to – residential parties may be dealing with their loads in diﬀerent fashions in diﬀerent parts of the year because you could have like last year, there was that federal furlough that was done that people stayed home, residential went up. So this year, it sort of shows it goes down during this time last year.  So it's things like that that will make the residential sort of come in and out each quarter. I tend to look more at the averages of residential load. You don't see that so much with commercial and industrial load. And with commercial showing a consistently positive and then in particular the industrial continues to expand, it expands more every quarter, that's a good thing because we've always said industrial leads commercial, commercial leads residential. So I think it's a good indicator for the future."
"On Dan's question just on the Ohio generation, is an outcome in Ohio around the PPA a gating issue for your decision?","I think certainly it's part of the decision process but I think the real reason why we're doing the PPA arrangement, number one, is bring some stability to the generation in Ohio. The second reason, obviously, is our customers are at risk in terms of the volatility of the market so it's important for us to get some measure of that in place. It's just like you buy fuel or anything else or a stock portfolio, you're in it for the long term, you're in it for the short term. Long-term capacity and energy needs to be there in Ohio.  For the ﬁrst time, Ohio is short and Ohio is going to be a purchaser on the market if it's not careful in reinforcing the value of this generation. So yeah, it's a big part of the decision process for us because you make very diﬀerent decisions about generation unless you have long-term purchase power arrangements whether they're form at the (44:55) the base rate or within the retail side that we're talking about. So there's an opportunity there and I think there's legitimate concern on the part of many, including the industrials. And they should be concerned and that's something I think that we're focused on answering that question during this year."
"Just switching gears, the cost shift from 2016 to 2014, should we think about that as allowing you to get to the 4% to 6% or putting you comfortably within that 4% to 6% growth 2015 to 2016?","I think all of the activities that we talked about doing, the lean initiatives, the cost shifting and the incremental transmission spend are meant to have us inside that range."
"Good morning. You gave some good color in the presentation on the growth of shale gas activity. Is the kind of growth that we're seeing, is this in line with your expectations? Is it accelerating above your expectations? Can you give a little more color on the degree of activity that you're seeing?","I think in some cases it's above our expectations because – and I know I heard the other day our president in AEP Texas said that we have in the last year put in like 20, 25 – about 25 substations in that territory, which means we're connecting a lot of load. And we're doing more in terms of transmission. The substation in a box, we call it, but the skid stations, so that we can connect these customers more quickly. We're expanding that eﬀort because we deﬁnitely want to keep up with the expansion that's occurring. So I'd say it's ahead of expectations in areas and it's probably at expectations in others.     Stephen, one of the things that we saw last year was a lot of the shale gas load that we expected to come on earlier in the year last year did not come on until later in the year. And whether that's logistics problems, permitting problems or whatever it was, it was stacked up and really didn't come in until later this year – later last year, earlier this year. As we're looking forward, our shale gas related forecasts are actually increasing from the base that we had. As we   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   looked to the end of the decade, we just had to increase our load forecast for those regions by 20% given some updates that we've had on some of the developments in those areas."
Okay. And just wanted to ask you (48:52) about that increase of supply. We've seen a lot of volatility in local gas prices. Do you have a point of view on the impact either near term or long term just on all this increase in shale gas and what that might mean for local gas prices versus what you might see quoted on Henry Hub?,"Yeah, we're seeing some pretty signiﬁcant basis diﬀerentials around our combined cycle gas plants. Waterford, for instance, which takes oﬀ with Texas Eastern at Zone M2 has frequently been trading at a signiﬁcant discount to Henry Hub; whereas our Lawrenceburg plant, which is on Texas Gas Transmission zone 4, is frequently trading at a $0.25 premium to Henry Hub. So even in our own service territory, areas that are not that far apart, Indiana to Eastern Ohio, we're seeing some pretty signiﬁcant basis diﬀerentials.  When you're in the production area and they don't have the infrastructure to take the gas out of the production area, we're awash in gas and it's depressing prices. In places where you don't have those constraints and you're pulling from the Gulf, you're trading at a traditional premium to the Henry Hub. So it's impacting local prices pretty signiﬁcantly in our service area.     A little caution on that, when you look at the volatility of prices, it's a matter of perspective how much the prices are coming oﬀ. It's still higher than our coal prices. And when you look at the retirements that are about to occur next year, you really wonder what it's going to do to natural gas prices going forward. And even to depend on it even more with the Clean Power Plan, it will be amazing to see what the eﬀect could be because I think the price is moving around in a relatively thin volume level. So you see storage creeping up a little bit. Well, it wouldn't take a hot summer, we'd lose storage if there's a hot September. But when you retire generation, particularly that's running as much is that generation is running, it's going to move to natural gas and I would fully expect energy prices to move up as a result."
"Not to speciﬁcally ask about M&A, but there is in Texas a utility that looks like it's for sale potentially. And you guys are in Texas. But also you made some comments in your opening statement about potential M&A and what you were looking for. And I'm just sort of wondering about the potential deployment of leverage and whether or not you see opportunities such as Encore or what have you?","Yeah, so, I guess ﬁrst of all the patent M&A 101 answer, we look at a lot of things. But certainly when you make a decision like that, it continues to be more of a strategic move. And with the amount of transmission spend that we have available to us, like I said, with no premium and I fully expect the Texas process to be pretty robust, it remains to be seen how that process is actually going to work out and in fact, who all is involved with it.  But our course of action is what we know today and that's focused on the transmission investment that we have indigenous that we can continue to improve earnings per share for our shareholders. And anything else beyond that would have to be something that achieves a strategic hurdle that overcomes the transmission spend and that's a hard thing to do these days."
"Okay. And then I just wanted to turn back to Ohio and this PPA rider. Generically speaking, what's the interaction you guys are having generally speaking with oﬃcials in Ohio and their thoughts about fuel diversity, what the market is providing them, and their appetite or their policy perspective on potentially going for something like the PPA rider or what have you, a sort of a hybrid situation in terms of if they want to have more fuel diversity or what have you or if they're willing to sort of just go pure market kind of thing? Just what kind of – incrementally, what have been getting from, as you're getting further in the process, from the oﬃcials in Ohio?","I think there's legitimate concern. Now what happens, I think probably the – you already have a test case out there with the ESP ﬁling that we made last December that has a PPA for the OVEC generation. The staﬀ recommended against it. But they said, well, Commission, if you decide to do this, this is how to do it. So basically they punted to the Commission. And it'll be a matter of the public policy in Ohio what the result winds up being but that will be a clear indicator and   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   you probably will see more of that as we go forward because there's a huge amount of generation out there that is at risk. And from an Ohio perspective, it needs to be locked in in some fashion.  Now that might not be all of it, but certainly just as you do with any other portfolio, there needs to be a long-term approach and for Ohio to depend upon PJM market conditions to preserve some sense of lack of volatility for customers, that would be a huge error. So we continue to have discussions. And there are obviously others like industrials who are concerned about it from an economic development perspective in Ohio. There's concern about it from that perspective. And we'll continue to shake the tree on that and I think that's important for us to progress. So I'd see that playing out this year."
"Okay. Any sense of any sort of timing? I mean, you said this year but I'm just sort of wondering do you think, is it going to be just basically, should we check out the ESP process? Or do you think there might be another way this might manifest itself?",I think certainly the ESP case is a clear indicator because that may be the ﬁrst thing that the Commission actually deals with. But there could be other ﬁlings that we would make as a result as well.
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I wanted to clarify a couple of points. First on the transmission side, on the slide that you laid out for us, the base case and the high case, so just to be clear if I look at the 2016 numbers, you still have about a $0.06 diﬀerential earnings-wise between base and high. So does some of the incremental investment that you've made capture that? Or when should we see that $0.06 starting to get captured visibly from our side?","Yes, so you should – it's inclusive in that and you should see that rolling through when the projects are completed.     With the very short lag that we have on transmission spend, as we make incremental this year, you'll start to see that in earnings next year."
"I see. Okay. Then secondly, on your Ohio thinking, Nick, as you laid out the various milestones, et cetera, is it still a scenario for you to look at that portfolio and think of either a tax-free spinoﬀ or a sale to unlock some equity value? Is that still something you're considering? Or is the focus primarily on trying to make it ""as you'd really like"" as possible?","I think all those options are still open because we have to credibly look at this business, do everything we can to fortify the value of it, and then make decisions about what the optionality is concerning those – that set of businesses. And I think we're looking at that in terms of maximizing shareholder value and you have to look at all the options when you do that."
"If I have heard you right, the EEI is probably not the forum where you'll give us your strategic conclusion but maybe year-end earnings call next year? Would that be the kind of timeframe we should be looking at?","Well, I certainly would be hesitant to talk about the timing of that. I doubt that we'll be saying anything about the disposition of our decisions on those particular assets at that point in time. November will really be a time where we focus on the guidance for the forward-looking years so you'll see a new version of that. But in terms of the unregulated generation, we'll have to see how the processes move through in Ohio and other areas."
"Okay. And last question. Can you just remind us for budgeting planning purposes, what is the weather normalized load growth you assume for this year and kind of normalized longer-term?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","In our budget for this year, we were assuming negative 1.1% including Ormet, and excluding Ormet positive 0.1%. Obviously as we've come in hotter for the ﬁrst half of the year weather normalized, we would be oﬀ those numbers today and we generally don't reforecast what the individual components going into the guidance were once we get into the year. We have been forecasting negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% in our guidance and we will be revisiting that as we work our way towards putting together more formalized guidance at EEI."
"Thanks, guys. I'll make it quick since you've answered a lot of the stuﬀ I wanted to ask. Looking at one of your slides, your date, you've put 36% of your volumes at the generation resources business into the spot market. Obviously, you've done very well because we had a lot of volatility in the ﬁrst and second quarter but prices are oﬀ quite a bit. Did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve in the second quarter to hedge out at better prices some of your load for next year? Or do you expect to run substantially open again?",They're continually hedging in the market and really those hedges have continued to be of beneﬁt to us.
My question is did you take advantage of higher prices out the forward curve that have since fallen oﬀ precipitously to change the mix of what you might be putting into the spot market next year?,"Greg, we've taken some advantage of that, but a signiﬁcant portion of that portfolio is going to be open to spot markets going forward, probably in that 30% to 40% range.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
