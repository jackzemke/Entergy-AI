Question,Answer
"Just wanted to start oﬀ at load growth trends. If I could just on, just want to conﬁrm here. The full year load growth estimates have not been updated for year-to-date actuals or is there any reason to expect a fall-oﬀ in the back half of the year?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Good morning, Jeremy.     That is correct. We have not updated anything yet. We are cautiously optimistic, will give you an updated view as we get closer to our Analyst Day at our Analyst Day on October 4 so standby for that. As far as what you can expect for the second half if I look at, for example, the residential load obviously talk of recession and how inﬂation is outpacing wage growth could potentially have residential customers shift in their behavior, a little bit, we'll see.  So we're, again we're cautiously optimistic there. But we do expect that there could be a little bit tempered on this particular customer segment by inﬂation, energy cost, mortgage rates, the lack of no new stimulus, those things that everybody knows about. So no surprise there, but just general trend. So we're going to continue to keep a close eye on that particular segment.  On the commercial segment, I mentioned earlier that we had great performance in nine of the top sectors, of our 10 top sectors with hospitals being the only one that was down. Again we're keeping an eye on things like inﬂation, labor shortages, supply chain and borrowing costs. But again, at this point, we don't have a reason to shift away and things continued to click along there and similar on the industrial side, we see a lot of large customer expansions that are expected to come online throughout the rest of the year, which should support the momentum, but again we're cautiously optimistic because we know that the Federal Reserve has a big job in front of it. In-house and tap the brakes.  So, we'll see how that ultimately impacts all of these, but so far, we're in a really good place, a really good place so hang tight and we'll be able to give you a little more granular view in terms of our expectations when we come to you this fall.     We told you I guess as probably a quarter or two ago about reinforcing our service territory, particularly as it relates to energy, as it relates to onshoring and our certainly our territory has been very strong in terms of both of those categories and manufacturing as well and that's clearly become a beneﬁt for us.  So and really when you think about what's going on the world today associated with security aspects that's really going to drive more toward the ability for onshoring to occur and...and certainly for energy security. So, it bodes well for our territory."
"Got it. That's great to hear there and just want to pick up with, I guess we'll hear more details at the Analyst Day on these points with load growth but also wanted to see what else we might expect to hear at the Analyst Day, I suspect, both the sales processes, we'll get some more color there.  But is there anything else we should be looking for at the Analyst Day?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, there is actually you have the sales process obviously everyone know about Kentucky, but also the unregulated contracted renewables there'll be new data points on that as well. And then of course '22 Earnings Guidance Update, 2023 guidance range will be introduced and also will probably roll forward, the ﬁve-year capital and ﬁnancing plans through 2027.  And then there could be other things too. So, we'll hold that till October 4."
"Got it. We'll wait for that. And just the last one if I could. Any thoughts on the renewable sale? Whether it makes more sense to do as an entire package or in pieces? I realize it's very early stages here, but just wondering if you had any thoughts to share on that.","Yeah. The team is looking at that and certainly I think the base case would be to sell all at one time but if there are opportunities exist to stage that out with the capital needs, that would be great. So we're still going through that process and we will go through, as we talked earlier, will be going out to the market here in the September time frame.  So we'll know a lot more at that point in time. So more to come in October."
"Hey, Nick good morning to you for the opportunity. Appreciate it. So maybe just a follow- update in brief on this operating arrangement and the two states here. I mean, just what do you need to see from Liberty to be able to move forward here at this point in time. I just want to make sure I understand exactly, is this just about them as we are seeing to sort of the updated   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   position from the two states or do you really need to resolve say a speciﬁc transfer value etcetera here?","Yeah, Julien. Certainly Liberty has been great partners through this entire process and...and we certainly want to be fair to them because they were obviously looking for certain things out of the transaction we were looking for certain things and I think it's going to be just a matter of going through the process and deﬁning risk going forward.  So it's not...obviously it's not gotten saying it's going to be the existing agreements and tough luck, we'll move on. It's really an issue where there is an opportunity for us to get together with them and deﬁne that future because we're going to be partners in that...in Mitchell going forward.  So we [ph]must all get comfortable with that relationship, 100%."
"Yeah, I noticed in the comment...in the various comments you made in the prepared remarks on inﬂation, can you elaborate a little bit more into as to how that ties into both near and longer term. Again, I get that you guys are providing an update in a couple of months here, but just elaborate a bit on the pressure points that you are seeing of late. Just if you can deﬁne that and how that cascading through, maybe speak a little bit to the cadence of labor arrangements, for instance, et cetera.","Yeah. I missed the ﬁrst part.     Yeah. So, Julien. I'll let Nick talk a little bit about supply and labor. But we're also watching is in addition to our own costs and working with our individual parties around making sure we have material supplies, equipment and folks to actually do the work. We're also paying attention to what's going on with our customers.  Because as we talked earlier today load is a big piece of our driver for earnings year-to-date in this quarter so far and we hope to see that continue. But as we know, as the Fed needs to take some action and tap on the brakes, that could have some dampening eﬀects as it relates to actually all three of our individual customer segments.  Now as I mentioned earlier, industrial segment looks reasonably healthy based on the customer expansions that we see in the pipeline, et cetera, but I don't think everyone can entirely escape the consequences. So even from a commercial standpoint, if you look at the real estate segment, in particular interest rates have a direct impact on that piece of that sector in that business.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then of course on the residential side that choose into the wallet because if you know years it's sitting in a situation where your wage isn't growing as quickly as your costs are, you may tend to want to tap the brakes there, not to mention mortgage costs go up as well. So keeping an eye on it from a customer perspective, managing through it as it relates to our particular P&L but I know, Nick, if you wanted to say anything about supply chain and labor....     Yeah, Julien sorry, I missed the ﬁrst part of your question. So Julie ﬁlled them for me. Supply chain has certainly been an area of focus for the company, and they've done a great job. the supply chain organizations on a great job of getting out ahead of that understanding the delays that are occurring relative to delivery of transformers and those kinds of things.  And then also size of inventories and other things come in the question, but in our case, you know, we're a large electric utility with a lot of requirements, largest transmission system in the country, distribution, obviously widespread. So we have some of what we have abilities to really focus on the supply chain aspects in a positive way by expanding suppliers and certainly exerting the leverage we have associated with the large buying that we do.  So, we're in good shape from that perspective. Now that being said, you know the entire industry and AEP are watching storm activity and those types of things and what implications that could have on the inventory levels and supply chain. So, we're watching that very closely, but we have time for the economy to really pick up and catch up from that perspective.  Labor is an issue for everyone and certainly, we continue to focus on that particularly in our front-line employees to ensure that we're meeting the customers' requirements going forward. We're very tuned in to wage rates and those types of things that are changing dramatically and certainly from a resource perspective, we also have those relationships with not only attracting our own employees, but also, contractors and so forth that they were able to pull from for various reasons. So, all in all we're hanging in there and the capital plan still remains secure in terms of the ability to move these projects forward and we believe that AEP is in a great position to continue that process."
"A super quick clariﬁcation on SPP, they're tweaked to the reserve margin. Does that impact your procurement eﬀorts at all. I know you guys you'll see things in play. Just to clarify.","No, it doesn't. We're going through. We're going through regular as you've seen, regular integrated resource planning processes with all of the Southwest Power Pool states and those processes will continue. I guess the good thing is that the things that we're putting in, obviously we already talked about transmission distribution in terms of supply chain activities. But in terms of resources, we're already putting integrated resource plans in for renewables and the timing of those renewables are such that we have time for the supply chain to catch up relative to solar and wind component. So, we're in good shape from that perspective.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Good. Nick, just on the contracted renewable sales, we're kind of thinking about the process for the sale. There's obviously some conﬂicting data points out there. Right rates have ticked up materially, there seems to be a few peers in the market selling as well. But on the other hand just given supply chain issues steel in the ground is certainly more valuable.  I guess, can you elaborate a bit more on the process when do you plan on opening up the data rooms? And it's a tight timeframe with the Analyst Day. So what data points can we get between September when you kicked the process oﬀ in the Analyst Day which is only a few weeks of process. Right? So, I guess what's giving you a sense?","Yeah. So these are well known resources and they're already there and open up a data room, can be done pretty quickly and also review will be done quickly. I would say that the interest has been very robust, and will continue to be robust because and you said it, they have steel in the ground, but also the ability to continue all of these projects in a very positive sense.  We took out Flat Ridge two so that makes the portfolio even better and certainly from that perspective, we expect the process to move very quickly and when we bought the resources, some of these resources from Sempra, we visited sites and the data room was open and we moved very quickly and for these types of assets, even though there may be others that are selling the assets, there is a robust focus by the market on a certainly attracting these types of assets. So we feel very conﬁdent we can move forward quickly and have certainly more information this year by the time we get to the Analyst Day.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Shar, this is Julie. As an anecdote when we initially made this announcement, I can tell you that even now I'm receiving calls, Nick was receiving calls, Chuck Zebula and his team is running the process, was receiving calls, a lot of inbound calls coming in. And as far as what you can anticipate, I get it. It's a shorter timeline, assuming we launch at the very latest in early September.  We should be able to come back to you by October 4 with color on how that process is going, and you're right, I mean there are other folks in the market as well. That's why I think we need to get out there as soon as we can and get business taking care of. So that is absolutely the objective and stay tuned, we'll have more color to share with you."
Do you think you could actually announce a deal on the fourth with the redeployment of the proceeds or (inaudible) type.,"No. Yeah, that'll be (inaudible) for that obviously, and they've been, they'll depend on what we get back to you in terms of one-time versus staged in, all those types of things that have to be considered and certainly we'll have more information. But, we won't have ﬁnalization of the deal. That'll be probably by the end of the year."
"Got it, thanks. And just one last one on, I mean obviously you're load growth in the backdrop in general has continued to show the ongoing strength, do you highlight the fact that its pre- pandemic levels. I guess how are you sort of thinking about '22 in general and where you're within sort of that EPS range, especially given that we're kind of into the key months of the summer with Q3.  I would think there is, obviously this is a very strong tailwind for you, especially as we're thinking about '22 even though you guys are kind of hedging yourselves a little bit on some of the uncertainties out there.","It's always good to be ahead a little bit anytime of the year you go in the latter part of the year because summer is always good and then you get in the fourth quarter with you don't know where storm activity is going to go and that kind of thing, but we feel really good about the position that we have right now.  And certainly, if you look at the fundamentals of what's going on, I mean you take charge point out of it, there is a very positive quarter and certainly one in which we continue to grow and see it. I mean your load guys pretty optimistic. So and if you know our load guy, you know, he is...it takes a long way for him to get there.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   But we feel really good about the position that we have and I think as we see more towards the end of the year, then we'll have more to say when it comes to by the time Analyst Day comes around."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks, Nick. So just a question. I think Julie mentioned the...on the Kentucky sale, the write-oﬀ you took, $0.15 is that, should we read that as eﬀectively reﬂecting your expectation of what kind of price change needs to be renegotiated. For this Mitchell issue. so kind of reﬂecting that or that's.",No it was really focused on when Liberty and AEP got together to focus on the Kentucky transaction order itself and they were requirements associated with that. So and we certainly we're focused on making sure that we completed that order and this requirements. So that's what that is.
Okay. So I guess maybe then just on the diﬀerence between Kentucky and West Virginia and how Mitchell's created. Could you just give a little more color on those diﬀerences and so we can get you kind of what you think about the value diﬀerence between the two?,"Yeah, so, and I think it's pretty obvious that Kentucky head of view of valuation in 2028 and West Virginia has this view evaluation in 2028 and the two are in very diﬀerent positions and has probably not something you're going to resolve today. So, really it becomes an issue of, okay, how do we get together and think about our continued Operating Partnership, which could be done through the Operating Committee of the existing operating agreements.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then certainly focused on a later date to consider the risk issues associated with that. So, and I think that for us. I think it's sort of a realization that there will be no doubt that Kentucky Power will continue to be a partner in Mitchell. And then when the time comes before 2028, they will have to be some reconciliation between what Kentucky wants and what the West Virginia Commission want.  And then we just want to make sure those risk parameters are taken care of on the front end."
Closing...that there would be some kind of just ability to negotiate a some kind of certainty on that.,"Because we have now we have a outside party involved with third-party from AEP's perspective with Mitchell going forward. So that sort of drives a diﬀerent view and when everything was already owned by AEP company. So you have to go through that process and determine, okay. What's the right approach for Liberty to have that ownership and for AEP to have ownership and at arm's length?"
"And then just on the on transmission, just anything that you kind of expect from FERC in the second half of the year to better identify both kind of their interest in getting a lot more transmission built, but at the same time still a little bit of kind of pressure on the ROEs. And just what are you watching there?","Yeah, you know obviously reliability and resiliency is of central focus not only to FERC, but to the [ph]Congress as well and I really believe they'll continue the process of all the areas of focus right now with the [ph]nopers, they got several nopers out actually and they just put initiated one around Weatherization and making sure that we're as resilient as possible and certainly from transmission planning, which was already done that noper along with they started the state process in terms of discussions relative to cost allocation those types of issues. So they're moving along and when they issue that original noper under transmission they made it clear that it wasn't going to be sequential.  It's a multi tasking opportunity for us to look at all these provisions and then of course the cues associated with the new resources and RTO, those are all being focused on and I think FERC is doing a very credible job of marching through this and making sure that we are able to invest in transmission in a way that secures this country in so many ways.  So, I think that process will continue. Who knows what goes on with the ROEs in the 50 basis point adder and that kind of thing that, I mean that could take years to resolve. But nevertheless, will continue moving forward with our investments and we'll continue to look forward to the rules, processes and procedures to be put in place where we as signiﬁcant stakeholders in this process are allowed to make the investments that we need to make in a timely basis.  There is no question that as we look at all the resources that are needed, the changes in the transmission system, cyber type issues that I'm sure that there'll be interested in as well and a regional activities associated with planning ensuring that we're able to invest the way that we shared on a timely basis with as little risk as possible.  And that's really important because there are so many changes occurring and for now you're seeing, you really are seeing applications relative to resiliency and reliability and I think everyone needs to sort of take a pause and ensure that we're looking at that with our eyes wide open.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And that we're doing the right things at the right time and that process continues, I think FERC is doing a great job."
"A quick clariﬁcation on the Kentucky sale process is my ﬁrst question. Just, just to be clear the your discussions with Liberty on the Michelle operating agreement and then sort of the FERC approval, the two sort of independent processes. Right? So you don't have to go back to FERC with asking for a revised approval or something like that once you sort of settle with Liberty on as it relates to Michelle.","Yeah, certainly we believe with the original agreements and the ability to operate under the Operating Committee under that agreement, we can really focus on the status quo and ensuring that we're able to move forward as it with a partner that's a third party. So the provisions of the agreement already provide for the ability to make those kinds of adjustments.  So, as our belief that we do not need to go back to FERC for additional approvals."
"Got it, okay. And then just maybe wanted to get your sort of thoughts on valuation for your renewable assets. Maybe just how have they evolved since the ﬁrst quarter call. It has been a volatile day, interest rates have been up so, just any color you can share with us there as you sort of kickstart this process in September.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Well, we obviously we know that the headwinds of inﬂation and those types of things are areas of a conﬂict with an increased valuation but at the same time, you've got a lot of robust interest in these assets and the fact that they continue to produce energy in a market that provides additional beneﬁts for whoever winds up owning these assets.  So, it's hard to tell what the valuations are going to look like right now but I don't, I mean certainly we're not concerned about all the macro issues that are involved, because these assets down pretty well over the sales and you have the positives, the negatives, But now that now and that's why we obviously took the adjustment on the Flat Ridge II because we really wanted that out of the portfolio.  So, that you wouldn't be [ph]argued with bidders about what that valuation was and what the risk were of that particular project. The rest of them are excellent projects that should bode well in the marketplace. So, like, I can't tell you, any thoughts on what we see valuation to be, I think the market will tell us.     Just to provide is a little more color, if you're trying to model aside from given your market price points, we didn't include in the presentation today on Slide number 44 the breakdown of all of the projects that are included in the portfolio. You'll see that we've essentially removed Flat Ridge two as we talked about today as it relates to asset value in that type of thing that's on our balance sheet.  If you look at our balance sheet today our asset value associated with the portfolio as it stands is about $2.1 billion. The equity position is about $1.4 billion. We do have some project debt and tax equity that total about $272 million, can plug that into your model as well and then we do get the question around how much did this contribute to earnings. So for 2022 for the Generation and Marketing segment, which is $0.31 total for our guidance and that's kind of that mid-point about $0.13 to $0.17 relate speciﬁcally to this portfolio. So you can kind of begin to back into whatever valuation you want to assign to it, there is a very low tax basis associated with it.  But we do have some capacity to absorb a tax gain because we've got some credit sitting on the bench, that we can use to oﬀset that. So don't view that as problematic or a seriously gating item for us because it's not. We will be able to hurdle over that."
"Alright Nick. Hey, Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just really quick follow-up on the Kentucky sale reduction. I just...I noticed you have 1400 of proceeds in the funding slide still. So just can you just reaﬃrm of everything going on in the past quarter that cash proceeds when you close or to be unchanged.","We're good, you're good, now no worries there. So no change in that modeling are those assumptions for good."
"Okay, great. And then I guess just question on strategy and through the Analyst Day. It had some and simplifying the business proﬁle (Technical diﬃculty) sale the underwrite sales are on the horizon. Obviously as we kind of think about funding this long-term CapEx plan, are you interested in pursuing further, (Technical diﬃculty) sales, unregulated sales, are we kind of in the later innings of this portfolio rotation strategy?","Yeah, I'll say, you know, obviously we have a lot of capital deﬁned and we have a great plan to do it. I would probably look at the ownership levels of the new renewables projects and that's going to provide the additional opportunity for us, resiliency and reliability certainly distributed energy resources.  All these types of things in our plans are really providing us the opportunity to ﬁne tune our portfolio to match what the growth expectations we have around those areas. So, no, we're not done, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to add value, from a shareholder perspective, but also to ensure that our customers are seeing the capital deployment that provides a better experience.  And that's something that we're very focused on. So, this is going...you're only seeing really the beginning of the part of our business that is going to endure going forward as we transition this company and that process will certainly continue. That's why I sort of said, it's a, let's say, but continue to execution around and I use taking care of business.  But adding in a dash of let's go crazy and that sort of says, we're going to be thinking on the edge about what can be done to make sure that we fund these real opportunities we have ahead of us.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
I'm wondering...hey how you doing? I'm wondering if you could give your latest expectations around federal climate policy here. Do you expect renewable tax credits to be in an extenders bill potentially towards the end of the year and just generally anything you would expect in terms of federal climate legislation this year.,"Yeah, I think it certainly is going to be a challenge, and I think I've said that last quarter, it is going to be a challenge. And the way it appears to be coming together is that there were some discussions going on, there may still be discussions going on, but right now, they're so focused on the healthcare pharmaceutical activities that may be bifurcated.  And then certainly the chips act now we're obviously for the chips Act because the NTL is located within our territory with that two fabs up to eight fabs and that's a huge positive. So you have things like that that are going on now, not only that, but obviously the mid terms are providing some overhang to getting even a smaller package done.  Although there has been discussions of working on that and trying to get something done by September 30, but even that is going to be really a hard thing to do. So again, I would say, post- election year probably dealing with either some form of a smaller package or extenders which that's a typical thing that happens when toward the end of the year when ITC's PTC's start to roll oﬀ again, you'll see extenders or the IRS in terms of supply chain activities being able to extend it for some period of time.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, you probably see some mandate solutions until you see a solid solution going forward. So I just think the environment is certainly very volatile right now and it will take time to work itself out and maybe even post-election, again you maybe have some sense of calmness to be able to focus in on some of these things that are important because our industry and by the way, our 16,000 Megawatts does not include any extension of ITC's PTC's but we are deﬁnitely for those extensions and expansions to a nuclear and as well to the storage, those are clear opportunities for us to redeﬁne the resource plans going forward.  Direct pay is also very important to us. But we that...would may at least at this point to sell maybe later on we can convince everybody that truly is a beneﬁt to our customers. So, anything we get from that perspective will ultimately be a beneﬁt to our customers from an economic standpoint and that will be good for not only our movement to a clean energy economy but the options that we have available to us, namely storage nuclear hydrogen hubs, those kinds of things need to continue to be looked at to make sure we're resilient and reliable going forward. So that's where we stand right now, I think."
Flat Ridge and that was the only one you plan to extract.,"That's right. That's why we separated that one. Yup, the others are good."
"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just one for me, about coal. So, between reliability concerns and the Supreme Court ruling that you mentioned, do you see any potential some coal plants online beyond their current schedule dates beyond Michelle, which is a bit of a unique situation. But would you consider extending them and if so, would they be potential backup as (Technical diﬃculty) or keep some of either intermediate or baseload resources.","Well, I think that's exactly why certainly, we said a rational and reasonable approach to move the board from a resource perspective, we have to be able to maintain reliability, resiliency and economics for the grid and to our customers and certainly for our units. We continue to progress along the path that we've already placed in line and actually you have to do that to be able to deﬁne the future, and we're very, very focused on the just transitional aspects of our communities as we make any transition.  So, you touched on a point is particularly important for resiliency and reliability reasons, the capacity provided by these units is extremely important and whether the capacity factors move down as you bring in and layer in more renewable energy and clean energy, that's ﬁne as long as you have the resource adequacy to be able to meet the demands and then eventually we have to ﬁnd a path that ensures the communities continue to thrive from a tax standpoint, ﬁre protection, police protection, school boards, all that kind of stuﬀ. We have to be able to look at that, we can just shut down these communities and then decides something else, so in areas like West Virginia with the coal-ﬁred generation, we have to deﬁne what that path is it.  May be small modular reactors, if we can deﬁne what that risk is and...and limited from a shareholder perspective, certainly DOE is very interested in that and it just so happens the jobs of small modular reactor is the same as a coal plant and paying the same taxes and those types of things that's an opportunity to take a look at, or there is hydrogen hubs or storage or other activities. So we got to be able to rationalize that but but coal has provided an important beneﬁt, the coal generation, particularly during these summer months and obviously during the winter months as well and we've got to be mindful of how that process continues, so that's why we have to say, it has to be rational reasonable and with the time frame that makes sense."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hi Nick, I know you're excited about the Analyst Day and you're probably equally as excited as having Brian Kelley down in Baton Rouge, I'm looking at the earned ROE versus authorized exhibit. Just have a couple of questions about a few of the subs, how are you thinking about what structural changes in rate making your team is going to seek in the next couple of years in a few of the jurisdictions that are earning a good bit below that, you are thinking PSO where honestly you've bought under earning for a number of years, but also thinking a little bit on APCo a little bit on SWEPCO.","Yeah, so obviously there's been substantial opportunities there and those regions of the country because actually we put in renewables, the renewables is helping from an ROE perspective and obviously from as it reduces rates to customers from a fuel standpoint and overall in the savings provided gives us an opportunity to deploy capital investment in those areas. Sometimes, obviously we'll spend capital to make sure that we're doing those things to ensure resiliency, reliability and all those activities, but particularly from an ROE perspective, rate making standpoint, equity layer has certainly been a big push of ours and certainly from a concurrent recovery standpoint with formula based rates.  We have forward looking rates in Indiana, Michigan, we like to see that in other jurisdictions, particularly with...with the massive amounts of capital that we're deploying and then typically the renewables are tracked as part of the investment until we get it in rate base and that's worked out great for us and I think, you're also seeing opportunities for us to really get out ahead with the commissions on what we're trying to achieve in terms of not only beneﬁts to our customers, but also the ability for our customers to use our product.  I look at on the customer side with distributed energy resources with the analytics and all the equipment that could be put in place to enable customers to make wise judgments, will be highly beneﬁcial not just for the operations of the grid, but also to mitigate their own fuel cost and bills during periods of time and you obviate the need for the securitization or other things that we have to do in huge storm-related environments. So, I think there is a lot of good things going on and then the trackers, I think it's 85% of our recovery is tracker base.  So, we like to improve on that as well. I think there has to be a recognition that cash coming into the utility is particularly important and we always talk about FFO to debt and the utilities with all the massive investments that are necessary, we need to be able to see the cash coming in the door, so that we can continue to make those kinds of investments. So, that's going to be a key message for our regulators going forward as well, but we're doing good things and as long as we're doing good things and spending on the right things, we believe we're a lot aligned with our commissions and our customers on the right path forward, and we feel very good about the path that we're on.     Little more help there too on PSO in particular, we've got securitization that we'll be completing here next month, so in August for the (inaudible) costs, so that should help to alleviate some of this pressure as well, and we'll be ﬁling another base case, so stay tuned for that as well and as Nick mentioned, just some reﬁnement around utilization of diﬀerent rate adjustment clauses, et cetera, not only in West Virginia, but then also as we take a look at SWEPCO we still have the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   outstanding Turk component that's not included in rates. So we've got diﬀerent ways to get after it and you'll see us talk more about that as we come out here on October 4, so stay tuned."
"That's great. And one quickie ﬁnal up just Cardinal on the G&M segment had a big beneﬁt during the quarter, just given where power prices were versus your delivered cost of coal, can you remind us how you're thinking about the future for Cardinal going forward?","Yeah, Cardinal, so we plan on completing a transaction with Buckeye related to that particular plant so they would take ownership of the plant and we would take a BPA back for a certain period and that means we will not have any generation to speak of left in Ohio on the regulated side. So and that's, it's a long way from...from where we were in Ohio but I think it's also there is a message for Ohio in terms of, in terms of generation that needs to be place in this state. So that's probably another issue I can get into but...but I'll stop there, but I think, well, that's all in the plans already.  Yeah, Michael so that PPA with Cardinal goes, I think through 2028 give you point out that as well."
"Hey, good morning and thank you for squeezing me in, lots has been discussed already, but if I may just ask a couple of questions. Western transmission. So you made a point of saying that transmission Transco remains at one of your I guess key growth engines. So I don't want to misquote, but and also at the same time you talking about not been done with the rest of curious of something. It's a non-core business, can you maybe help us frame how you think about transmission is it, are you making these comments because you getting questions about potential transmission sale and how are you thinking about that or should we not read too much of it?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No. Don't read too much into it because transmission is a key component for our not only for our investment in the company, but also in terms of what we see, relative to the transition of the future transmission is a key component for resiliency, reliability and optimization as we move to a clean energy environment.  So no, we're from a transmission standpoint, we feel very good about our role relative to transmission and actually I see distribution, continuing to grow and and certainly the renewables transformation itself, so no, don't read anything into that."
"All right, thank you for clarifying that. And then my second question was a little bit of a housekeeping question, I guess on the looking at the regulated renewables opportunity exhibit that the slide 40 and it seems like for APCo to win the opportunity has been reduced a little bit and solar increased a little bit in the 2022 sort of time frame.  And I am just going to be wondering if that's just some project to the alignment or should we be how should we be thinking about it?","Yeah, so, and the April integrated resource plan certainly showed what was needed from an APCo perspective so and I think there is probably more to come on that, but it's actually pretty immaterial at this point."
