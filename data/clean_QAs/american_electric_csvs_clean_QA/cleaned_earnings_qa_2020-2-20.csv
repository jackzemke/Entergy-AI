Question,Answer
"Yeah. Okay. And then in the past I know Nick and Brian, you've talked about when you talk about the 5%, when you've talked about hitting the high end of the range. I think today. I heard you say, upper half. So I just wanted to be clear, is the aspiration upper half or is it, the high-end, which I've heard you say in the past as well.","Yeah. So we say the upper half as far as a generalization obviously and as we go forward, there is no question. I mean we will be disappointed. It's pretty much the same thing to us."
"Okay. And then can you give us your latest thoughts on Kentucky Power and where that ﬁts in the portfolio, might that be a source of funding for North Central Wind, just how you're thinking about it currently.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Well, certainly, we're in a position now to where we can, when we have uses for certainly for capital to invest, we're able to look at our entire portfolio and determine. Okay, is there an opportunity for rotation, is there an opportunity for sale of assets, those types of things, but certainly Kentucky remains a part of our portfolio. Obviously, as we look at any future positive investment we're making, I think, it's probably safe to say, and you probably see from the FFO to debt and other credit metrics that they were fully utilized in our balance sheet. So we're moving into a stage where we have to think about optimization from an ROE standpoint for our investors and that forces us to look at sources and uses.  So, no, I'm not commenting on Kentucky, in particular, I think it's important to say that now we're fully regulated utility, we can look at investments across the board and see what the best approach is and I think that's what we're certainly alluding to as you go through this process and really with North Central by the time the investment is needed, we have time to go through that process."
"I got you. Last question, Brian. Looking at your 2020 load growth projections, what's causing residential to fall oﬀ more signiﬁcantly in '20, what is the trend we saw in '19.","It's just the normal business cycle, in that we see residential and commercial generally follow industrial and now industrial starting to come out of that and residential and commercial just haven't followed yet, it's really just a normal business cycle."
"Hey, good morning. My ﬁrst question is on dividends. The 2020 increase was 4.5% for his guidance that growing approximately in line with EPS growth at the high-end really in the 5% to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   7% range. So can you just remind us what the latest thinking is on what to expect going forward and if 6% percent would be a good bogey.","Yeah, yeah, it's unchanged. We fully expect our dividend growth to be commensurate with our earnings growth and as you know we've talked about this, the 4.5% this year and then the previous year as 8.2% or something like that, so it averages out to 6%. We focus nominally on the 6% so you can expect that in the future."
"Okay, great. Just wanted to aﬃrm that. Yeah. Next question. Pretty me if I missed it but can you describe what you're expecting around FERC approved transmission ROEs for yourselves and would you expect your PJM and SPP allowed ROEs to be within the range of the reasonableness.","Yeah. So obviously we have that case in the Northeast that as brought up at least some issues, and certainly that's being evaluated. A lot of parties have ﬁled to review that outcome of the MISO case and that was really the one that that I think sort of sent us a message previously in the Northeast, there was a mechanism for 4 diﬀerent measures and they went to two diﬀerent measures with MISO and I think it maybe had some unintended consequences, hopefully but certainly the industries responded AEP's respond as far as Transource, we have settlements in the East and the West and in the East, we have a stay-out provision and in the West, we do not. So they are there, but would not make any sense for ﬁlings to occur while the FERC is continuing to review the outcome of the MISO rehearing that's occurring. So yeah. So the stay- out was and SPP. So just want to make sure of that. But nevertheless, right now though our rates we view them as consistent with that realm of reasonableness and we continue to see it that way and I think as we get through the rehearing at FERC. I think there is certainly an opportunity for us to ensure that that's the case going forward."
Any sense of when we might have better clarity on that. I know it's a tough process to predict everything it for good stuﬀ to predict in terms of timing.,"Yeah, I have to ask that question, but, but I think that certainly I think there is that there is a necessity to get it resolved quickly because it's brought a lot of unintended risk into the the investment and transmission and I think it's important to get it rectiﬁed earlier as you might recall the FERC did start looking at actually our path project as a proxy for evaluation of what an ongoing view should look like and we view that as promising and certainly they have reacted reasonably quickly from that perspective and I think they recognize that there that the market is truly watching in terms of what philosophy is relative to transmission investment, which I believe is unchanged and actually, I think -- I think, at least what I've heard from the commissioners and public forums is that the transmission continues to be an investment that's required for   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   optimization of the grid and and historically, they've incentivized that and I fully expect them to continue to do that."
"Great, that's very helpful. One last quick one, I know the Texas rate case settlement doesn't directly impact the North Central wind proposal but did that come up at all in your discussion, did the interveners give any indication about how they're thinking about it.","No, I think they being dealt with completely separately. AEP -- AEP Texas is the case, that it's a base case and then actually, the wind project is in the SWEPCO jurisdiction associated with Texas, so it's still integrated and regulated in that part of Texas and they're used to dealing with Wind request. It's happened before there is a lot of precedence for a review of the wind projects and certainly we were building up on what we learned from the previous Wind Catcher activity and ﬁled something that we felt like addressed the concerns during that period of time, but also dealt with it in a way that's consistent with the integrated resource planning processes and something that's fairly innocuous in terms of, in terms of a view by the Commission.  So we certainly as I said earlier, I think Oklahoma and Arkansas are well on their way. Louisiana and Texas are certainly in the process, so we would certainly are hopeful that they will continue to see the beneﬁts of that project as well and get it done very quickly."
"Right. I know there are separate jurisdictions, I would just say. I think there's a lot of overlapping interveners but. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","No, there is not, there is not really, I mean. The Interveners themselves, maybe the same, but the issues are very diﬀerent."
"So just wanted to clarify again on the equity point and the credit point ﬁrst. It was helpful to get the overall perspective on how you look at the portfolio and the credit clearly. At this point, your balance sheet is being utilized well, so if not central were to move forward, is the understanding that if there isn't any portfolio optimization opportunity that some equity would be issued at some point. Just wanted to clarify the timing of that and any further thoughts on that credit and equity point.","Yeah. So I'll turn it over to Brian in a second, but certainly our view is that we sort of presented a base case of without any rotation or any of those kinds of activities occurring, we would expect equity to be issued in that 50 to 2/3 range. So I think that's at least that is going in position and certainly that we're saying the project is entirely 100% incremental to our existing capital forecast. So you would expect equity, but if there is any kind of capital rotation or sale of assets that mitigates the need for any portion or all of the equity, then certainly that will be a part of the process. Brian.     Yeah, the only additional color I'd add to that Praful is we think that we could time any equity needs consistently with when the projects for North Central wind would come online, a small portion at the end of 2020 and a much more signiﬁcant portion at the end of '21."
"Okay, perfect. And then just secondly on the renewable opportunities in which you highlight, is this more utility side renewables or is it more on the unregulated side or both. If you can just give a little bit more color and also how big do you see the opportunity to be because clearly everybody seems to be investing more on that side and there is a signiﬁcant opportunity. So if you can scale that, that will be helpful too.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah. So it's on both sides -- both sides of the ledger, and obviously we still have integrated regulated jurisdictions and the one in South Bend project in partnership with Notre Dame that's on the regulated, Indiana, Michigan Power and then also, there is projects that others have done in our regulated footprint and as well on the contracted side, we continue to advance that around the country in various forums, but not just tied to wind power solar, but other projects as well and we're sort of unique, I guess from the contracted business, we cover about every quadrant of the business relationship that customers would expect and really are OnSite Partners, our AEP Energy or AEP retail all those come together to really provide sort of an all-in solution for customers, so we see the growth occurring on both sides. I think certainly North Central is an example obviously the way the integrated resource plans of various jurisdictions are moving forward, I now added APCo. There is a solar requirement in Virginia and then there are opportunities for us to do it on the regulated side as well as the unregulated and keep in mind, we are contracted business. We limit to 10% of the business because of tax reasons and so we want the regulated side to grow to enable our contracted business to grow as well and this is a nice balance for us and we'll continue doing that and certainly I would say it's moving very much in both directions. And if you look at post North Central and what's now after the purchase of the Sempra Wind assets, we're probably I mean roughly half and half, so I think it's, it's a great diverse solution."
"Got it, that's super helpful. Given the size of your footprint, and as you said you have opportunities on both sides, do you see that as helping you achieve that higher end or upper end of the seven or even getting beyond that. I'm just trying to again dimension, how big the opportunity could be given you have it on really both sides given your footprint.","Yeah, I think that's why we said upper half because there is there is so many opportunities out there for us and for our ability to continue to grow certainly we're going to have to continue to feed the beast in a way that continues that 5% to 7% growth trajectory, but as we said before, with all the projects that we know that are out there with the opportunities in front of us, you can look at our integrated resource plan on the regulated side and see what's in front of us. And you can certainly see I think there was a report recently of AEP just the generation transformation alone, which drives the renewable piece of it along with some natural gas, it's a real opportunity for AEP to continue to enhance that growth pattern, so really the fundamentals are there, it's a matter of execution."
"Thank you for taking my question. So on North Central wind, I guess you've had pretty constructive settlements in the couple of jurisdictions by now, Texas being more or less the only one where you are still engaged in an inactive regulatory process. I'm just curious at what point do you think you have a critical mass to oﬃcially call it to go input in the plan.","Yeah, we've got that. If we get approval from the Oklahoma Commission maybe today and then we get approval from Arkansas, we have the critical mass for the project to move forward. The question is at what scale. So with those two projects together, you're already at 846 MW of the 1485 and it's already a $1.1 billion investment and if you move forward with Louisiana for example, and Arkansas remember has the ﬂex up, so the ﬂex up means they will take the additional capacity -- the wind power capacity, if it's not taken by another jurisdiction. If Arkansas ﬂexes up and then Louisiana approves with the ﬂex up then you've got the 1485 MW for the whole project. Now obviously if Texas sees this way to be a part of the project as well, which I believe they should then each of the states will participate in the full projects, so right now, I'd say with Oklahoma and Arkansas, if those settlements are approved, the project is moving forward. That's a given. Then the question becomes, okay, what scale and and that will be determined by the other two jurisdictions and the amount of ﬂex up that's enabled in those settlements. So I'd say you should be happy with the progress right now and I also think you should be optimistic about this project being fully vetted and fully approved."
"Terriﬁc. Terriﬁc, thank you for clarifying this. And then as a follow-up to the same kind of line of thinking, right. It seems like this playbook is working really better than maybe some of the prior projects you looking at, is that something that you can use over and over again as you scale up your investments in the renewables, maybe on the regulated side.","Oh absolutely. I think there is a pattern here and that's why I talk so much about the generation transformation that is occurring. We already have, we're retiring generation older generation   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   and that's coal and natural gas and certainly replacing with new resources that provide a real opportunity and that opportunity is really driven by reducing costs for consumers and this thing in the North Central is a perfect representation of overall entire project $2 billion, investment, but over $3 billion and in savings to customers and that's one of the key areas for the utility in the future is to be able to deploy capital to reduce customers' bills and that's what we're doing and that's what many of these projects allow us to do."
"I wanted to -- I had a clariﬁcation for you, just when you guys talk about your pro forma for North Central wind, is that putting you at the high end, the 5 to 7 or does it put a step up in earnings and then you grow oﬀ of that.","Yeah, it will be going to be a step up. It will be a step up a step change when North Central gets in, but will continue at the 5% to 7%."
"Okay, all right, that's helpful. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
