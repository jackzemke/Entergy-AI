Question,Answer
"Congratulations on a good year. A couple questions. First, can you repeat what you said about your --- what was the buildup for your assumptions on residential sales? And then can you extrapolate on what that means sort of going forward over the next several years of your forecast?","Yes, we are anticipating residential sales to be down almost a percentage point in 2014 and we think it is largely being impacted by a lot of the energy eﬃciency programs that we have across our service territory with Ohio, Indiana and some other states having some pretty aggressive programs. So it is impacting load, also customer counts are an impact as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We are seeing positive customer count growth in the Western part of our service territory and pretty stagnant customer growth in the eastern part of our service territory. So when you put those eﬀects together is deﬁnitely a drag. We will see how things work out as we go through the year and we will obviously be updating you quarter by quarter. But we are anticipating some load decline and the residential sector in 2014.     So, Greg, the last quarter of the year indicated some positive strength to that but I think we're going to have to sort of see that play out before we make any changes."
"I guess what I'm asking you is as we think about the guidance ranges for 2015 and 2016, not asking you to give speciﬁc drivers across all the factors in the business, but would it be fair to say you are assuming continued reductions in residential demand through time due to federal and state energy eﬃciency standards? Or do you think that your base case for economic growth beats into that and you could get back to positive net residential growth?","Our load growth assumptions through 2016 are very, very conservative. So I mean we are not forecasting to hit our numbers -- the classic 1% to 2% load growth that we had seen earlier in the century. We are anticipating that negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% load across the timeframe.     So it is relatively ﬂat, it is less than 0.5%."
"Great. Thanks. Second question is on what you are seeing -- I know you have a de minimis footprint relative to a lot of the other companies when it comes to competitive generation in retail, but it is still signiﬁcant for you. Have you seen behavior change on the part of retail consumers and wholesale buyers in the last several weeks with regard to what they are willing to pay for longer-term power contracts?  Wholesale prices are up quite a bit in 2014, last three weeks, not as much out the curve. But are you starting to see some depth and breadth to the market come back as volatility comes back or not?","Yes, Greg, we really haven't seen much of that yet. Obviously there's going to have to be a little history that plays out here with the weather. But also it is pretty clear that capacity rents are included in energy prices. So with the market reforms that are occurring plus the experiences people are having relative to this extreme weather, there may be opportunities for additional   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   hedging to occur and also for customers to ﬁnally see that we need to sort of lock things up for the long term. So it may be helpful, but at this point it is too early to tell."
"Just kind of now that the transition for the competitor generation of Ohio is kind of on its way, can you just share your updated thoughts on the future of competitive generation in the AEP business mix? And maybe what Greg was asking, are you starting to see or are you able to engage in conversations about some long-term supply agreements to help put some more visibility in that business?","Yes, Dan, I think we stand by originally what we said relative to this business, that it will hinge upon our ability to see this additional hedging occur, that we can ﬁrm up the supply and make it look quasi regulated. At this point, because capacity markets have been depressed, and recent experience aside, it is diﬃcult to tell how successful we will be in our ability to hedge that up.  But we are not standing on our laurels with that. We are aggressively looking at the cost structure of the business. We are also reforming the way we operate at our plants because they know full well their survival is at risk there. And so, we are going to do everything we can do to position this ﬂeet to where it is positive and also address the market reforms that are occurring at FERC now.  And then hopefully with the events that have transpired recently with the weather it could help us in terms of -- get additional hedges in place. But that business, our retail operation together now with that generation ﬂeet, there are some opportunities there. So we are working on all fronts to ensure that we are able to position this business as best we can. And at the end of the day it needs to look quasi regulated to us."
"I guess, Nick, from a market reform perspective, given the time horizon even to the next RPM results actually aﬀecting your earnings contribution, are there changes that can happen in a reasonable time period that would give you guys comfort to wait it out? Or are you going to need a customer to come in and buy in rather than having policy reforms do it?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That remains to be seen. We have -- I think there are two or three of the changes, market changes that PJM has ﬁled at FERC, we expect another to get ﬁled with this triennial review of the curve itself, there are some opportunities there if it is done in a positive fashion. But we are going to have to see the results actually of what FERC approves.  And it is important for us to see that FERC understands the issues that are in play here and that they obviously make wise decisions on what that market reform should be. And certainly this ﬁrst round of the two or three ﬁlings that have been made by PJM will be instructive in terms of what FERC's mood is relative to market reform."
"I think just one last question, Nick, just on -- Greg asked about residential load, but commercial also looking pretty ﬂat for 2014 versus 2013 with sustained GDP growth and that sort of thing. Is there potential that that number will start to spruce up or are you just not seeing kind of the growth in construction and commercial space to give you conﬁdence that it's coming back?","No, I think there's a chance it will. We just Dash I think one quarter a trend doesn't make. So we have got to look at the numbers for this quarter that is occurring now and we will continue to adjust accordingly. And not just only adjust our forecast accordingly but adjust our cost structure accordingly as well and our employees are well tuned into that process at this point. So this is very much about an optimization business now."
A couple of questions. At EEI you kind of indicated that your forecast didn't have any projects in the transmission side that weren't pretty ironclad. What kind of upside is there from here from what you have done since then?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Yes, so, as you recall during EEI, we had the presentation of the real projects that are in the plan right now and then we had this incremental bandwidth above that graph that showed the incremental real projects that are also in hand that we're ﬁnding capital for. As you recall, for 2013 I think we moved $120 million of capital over to transmission as a part of our regular ongoing process primarily from generation. And that has been positive for us.  We will continue to do that to achieve the capital associated with those particular projects, that is still well in hand, moving forward very well. And in fact now we are in the process of deﬁning a ridge even above that. But that is going to be -- that is going to have to play itself out in terms of our ability to come up with real projects.  We also -- we aren't standing aside on the sidelines with Transource and other activities. We continue to pursue projects outside of our footprint as evidenced by the -- I know you probably saw that we were one of ﬁve bidders for a Canadian project done at McMurray, 500 kV project. So all that is going on on all cylinders. And we're very happy with the progress there and we will continue to identify those real projects that can be done."
"Great, thank you. And then just -- you indicated you are not changing your forecast for gas or power pricing, but I assume it is safe to think that so far in the year it has been a nice tailwind. In other words, you are not having to go by power in the east side markets to fulﬁll some obligations?","Yes, that is -- Brian?     Yes, so, most of what we have for oﬀ-system sales, particularly for the generation resources side of the business, is hedged with its contract to Ohio for the year. So although our units are performing well, demand is strong, I wouldn't want to get -- have irrational exuberance over the fact that it has been cold and prices have been high at this point."
"Then lastly, just what's your early read on what is going to happen in the next capacity auction? Is it just too many things still up in the air here to predict that?","Well, I think if the market reforms that FERC has in front of it now are approved, that could be helpful. Whether it is enough remains to be seen. And that is something I think that all the generators are looking at in terms of how much surety we are going to get around the continued investment in generation for the long-term within PJM. But that remains to be seen. I think some have said a slight uptick, some have said more than that. But it remains to be seen."
"A good number of my questions have been answered already. I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color on, Nick, your equalizer slide, as you always call it, and just go through again which is improving and which is deteriorating. And also, could you provide a little detail on the transmission spend and why there is a lag there and can that be caught up. Or is that just going to -- the lag going to stabilize and we will start to see earnings grow with investment?","Yes, sure. So I will go through it. In terms of the Ohio Power, the 11.3%, that will probably continue to come down slightly because customer switching continues as part of the Ohio situation. APCo should improve; there is West Virginia base case that needs to be ﬁled during the year. And then there's also the Virginia bi-annual case.  As far as Kentucky Power is concerned, that is in sort of the middle of a settlement that occurred relative to the Mitchell transfer. Right now there is sort of a rider in place. But later in the year a base rate case will be ﬁled that includes Mitchell being moved over. And then also as part of that settlement all system sales revenues come back to the Company 100%. So that is helpful during the interim process. So we expect that to come up.  I&M continues to improve when you get the full value of the rate -- all the rate activity that they have been involved with -- I think the last report had 9.1% or something like that, it is up to 9.3%, which is positive and they will continue to improve. That is where we have the legislation for the nuclear lifecycle management projects, the environmental projects, so we have a really, really good recovery mechanism there.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then PSO is in the midst of a rate case. They just ﬁled it I think a week ago -- a little over a week ago, $45 million rate case asking for a 10.5% ROE, had some smart grid activity involved with that, so we expect a positive result there. And then as far as sweat coat is concerned, the only lagging part of SWEPCO we have is the portion of Turk that wasn't included in Arkansas retail rates. And that is being sold on the wholesale market.  But there are some increases there related to transmission related costs, ﬁlings that need to be made in the jurisdictions. And then there is some Dolet Hills expense that needs to be ﬁled in Arkansas. So they are working on that as well so we expect that to improve. And it has moved -- originally I think it was at 7%, it is up to 7.4%. So it is on its way back up.  And then AEP Texas, it stands pretty good in terms of load growth is really helping out there. And that number also includes the amortization of the stranded cost. So it looks high, but it includes that.  And then as far as the Transco, ETT is an area where a T cost ﬁling has been made and it still lags, and it will lag until the T cost ﬁling is made, which that is a pretty standard ﬁling that we have -- actually, we have already made that. But it is a pretty standard ﬁling, works much like a fuel cost recovery mechanism. But we expect that to continue to improve.  And then we have, obviously, as we address moving capital over to transmission, remember the capital is moving to transmission and we are spending at a pretty accelerated rate there. So the project spend is getting out a little bit ahead of the recovery mechanisms, even though the recovery mechanisms are good. So it is a good place to be as long as we are meeting our earnings objectives and are able to move our capital around, that is a good place to be.  And then we have some -- a little bit of developmental expense there related to Transource that still needs to be reﬂected through with the construction going on within Transource. So we expect that to continue to improve as well. So really probably the only one that could move down is Ohio Power because of everything associated with the transition to Ohio. But the other jurisdictions are on their way up and doing well."
"And just one other, to be clear, how much -- is essentially all of the transmission spend adjudicated by FERC and then passed through the operating companies, or is there state-level transmission rate case activity?","Yes, there is some transmission in the operating companies, but by and large most of it is Transco related, it is FERC regulated. And then, of course, Texas is PUCT regulated. So it is pretty straightforward. I mean we have got the projects, we know what the projects are. They are real projects and they are just plowing through the process with some favorable recovery mechanisms. So we're particularly happy with where the transmission business is going."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And ﬁnal question, do you have any kind of middle term three-year view on the transmission earnings contribution and what that is going to mean for where you are in that cone of earnings guidance out for three years?","Yes. So the Ohio case by 2015 is $0.39 a share, which was I guess the original modeling we had, had it at $0.36 a share, so additional $0.03 a share. And then by 2016 we are looking at $0.43 a share and it could be upwards to $0.51 a share. So that is -- and that is based upon those real projects, as I said before.  Now if we have incremental projects above that, then there could be additional opportunities there, particularly if some of these projects that we have in PJM that have been proposed or the Canadian projects or anything else; that will also contribute beyond what we show and what we did show in the graph back at EEI. But that EEI graph is pretty solid. As a matter of fact, it is solid. I shouldn't say it is pretty solid; it is solid. The issue for us is making sure we replow the capital back in to get that topside of transmission, and then also identify anything beyond that."
"So just to be clear, if you were to hit the top side of transmission say in 2015, the $0.39, would that mean you would come in at the top side of that consolidated EPS range?","We continue to hold on to our 4% to 6% based upon that original guidance in 2013 we gave that had a 315 midpoint. It is a broad bandwidth and certainly there is a lot of things that could happen, and ins and outs in the process. So it is sort of diﬃcult to tell at this point. But we will certainly let you know as it gets closer."
"I wanted to talk a little bit more about transmission. Nick, you had laid out on one of the earlier slides about a 9.5% Transco earned ROE for the year, but there were a number of sort of near- term impacts to that. I wonder if you could just ﬂesh that out a little bit more and then talk about going forward. And then I will shift to a bigger picture question.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So as far as the transmission is concerned, the T cost ﬁling is already made. So I think they have -- six months is it -- to come up with a solution there, I think. And it is sort of -- actually, we have been very successful with our T cost ﬁling. So I wouldn't suspect we would have any issues there. And then really the return -- the ROE of 9.5% doesn't reﬂect the authorized return at all. We are just getting out ahead and we are intentionally getting out ahead to make sure that we plow as much capital as we can into transmission.     And, Stephen, you also remember that our authorized ROE in PJM is 11.49% and in SPP it is 11.2%. And with the formula rates that we have for those trancos, they get updated on an annual basis. So the longest lag we have is 365 days and the average is 180. But we are plowing so much money into that business right now that there is some lag and that is being reﬂected in the 9.5% combined ROE."
"Well, Nick, your last comment goes to my broader sort of question when I think about execution risk for transmission. At EEI you laid out the categories of projects and many of those look honestly to me as relatively low-risk projects. But at a high level can you talk about execution risk to get to that higher case? What are the key things on your mind when you think about that?","I think there is minimal execution risk. These are actual projects that are on the same vein. We are not gold plating anything, we are focused on refurbishing the grid and enhancing the grid to respond to retirements --- generation retirements, RTO related projects. All those kinds of things are in that plan and there is minimal execution risk.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   As long as we perform well, stay on budget, stay with the projects that we have got and ensure that we have got the right message in terms of optimization and the activities we do in transmission are needed. And that is something we -- what you're seeing in that list is really needed projects for reliability, not economic projects. Those are additive if they ever occur.  So --- and the other positive beneﬁt is that once again the diversity of all of our states is a positive because we are investing not only in our states but the adjacent states and we have added Kansas and Missouri through Transource, so we have some distinct opportunities in all those jurisdictions and the adjacent areas to really have some tremendous beneﬁts here. And really ultimately tremendous beneﬁts for our customers and as well the optimization of the grid itself."
"Just wanted to ﬁrst touch base on this capacity market rent that you are seeing in the energy market. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I mean what do you see going forward with respect to this? And I know it is cold out there and what have you, but it would sort of unusually high prices it seemed in some jurisdictions, some zones and what have you. And I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more as to what you think is actually going on there and the long-term outlook?","Yes, I think you are right, I think we are seeing higher energy prices earlier than what we thought. We really thought that it would really take oﬀ when the units that we were running would retire. I mean we are retiring 7,150 MW of coal-ﬁred generation and 89% of that is running now. And if you start to see, which we are seeing, an economy start to improve and on the heels you are trying to retire that generation, you --- I mean certainly we expected energy prices to continue to improve.  But this shows -- to me it shows where the real world and the play world collides. And it reﬂects through in the energy prices. And if a capacity market is not well thought out in terms of enabling investors to invest and advance relative to construction and everything else associated with the grid itself, then you wind up having this kind of thing happen.     Hey, Paul, we have been paying in our market area for gas in the PJM part of our footprint around $6 an MMBtu for gas. You are seeing PJM prices that are $1,000 a megawatt hour during emergencies going up to $1,800 a megawatt hour. Do you think the people being paid   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   those prices are being paid for energy? They are not. PJM is basically paying people for the value of their capacity to keep the lights on.  It is not energy that they are being paid for, it is capacity. We need to start getting some of those capacity rents back in the capacity auction because PJM is showing the real value of having that capacity when they are willing to pay someone $1,800 when the price of gas is $6 an MMBtu.     I think if -- I remember back in 1984 I was in system operations and the same thing happened where you had a very cold winter, taps get frozen, instrumentation gets frozen, natural gas isn't available and it winds up being -- and energy prices go out the roof and then every one of your coal units and every other resource that you have is brought on to run.  And you also have with cold weather obviously coal piles can get frozen. But we haven't run into too much of that; we have been successful in getting through this process.  But I think it shows the value of a balanced portfolio. And when that portfolio is no longer balanced you are going to have additional risks that are placed upon the grid that we really do need to think about. And you brought up a great question that I guess we can talk about all day, but it is clearly a message that I think everyone needs to really focus on the future of the grid and what it actually means to service our customers."
"It's an interesting topic. Just back on transmission for a second, I mean you mentioned that none of this stuﬀ is economic. Should we expect really no impact on rerating of the lines, any improvement on the actual transmission lines in terms of deliverability across regions or LBAs [ph] as a result of (multiple speakers)?","Oh, no, no, we are improving the deliverability, we are expanding the ratings of lines, we are putting in additional transformers, we're putting in additional substations. And a substation -- I mean we are building a substation that costs $250 million.  So these aren't small investments that are being made, but they are investments to reinforce and increase the capabilities of the grid itself. And then as well with the generation retirements,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   there's a lot of planning around additional transmission resources to support those retirements as well."
Right. But I mean should we think of perhaps there being an improvement in terms of transmission between LBAs at all or I mean in terms of the actual change of -- I guess the ability of power to go places where -- more power to go into certain areas that need it?,"Yes, you will see it from a reliability perspective. From an economic perspective it just takes longer to do because I mean if you cross multi states then you get involved with cost allocation and the issues between RTOs and that could be sort of a limiting factor until all this gets fully rationalized.  But ultimately with the retirements, with the changes in the way the system is being used, it is clear that transmission investment will be a continued positive at least through the next decade."
"Okay. And just ﬁnally on the right of ﬁrst refusal and Order 1000, is there any risk that third parties might compete for this transmission CapEx (technical diﬃculty)?","Yes, but a lot of the transmission that we are doing is our transmission projects. So when you get into the competitive projects, that is where Order 1000 comes into play and we think we're well-positioned to compete in that environment because we have been doing it for a while. And so, not only do we have our own projects that are providing the pipeline for that critical mass, but we also have those other projects that we are competitively bidding that we're seeing success in.     Hey, Paul, what you see in our forecast for transmission spend and earnings is not subject to ROFR. Those are projects that we control that we have the ability to invest in and that are not going to be taken from us by someone else competing for them.     And that includes those incremental projects that we showed on top as well."
"I think Brian mentioned the --- in his remarks that prices are a lot higher near-term than was in your plan, but that you will be kind of over this multi-year period, actively managing outages and expenses to kind of stay within the range roughly. Could you just maybe elaborate? I read that as kind of if you are having a really good period you will use that to invest more to beneﬁt kind of the future periods, is that ---?","Yes, you are right.     Yes, Steve, so obviously as we are working our way into 2015, 2016, 2017 and you and others have identiﬁed some of the shortfall that we have associated with the transition in Ohio and then the RPM pricing that we are facing. We are going to be doing things like moving outages around during that time period, maybe pulling some forward if we ﬁnd ourselves a bit hot on earnings in an earlier period maybe pushing them out into the 2017-2018 timeframe.  And we are really going to be managing our way through this to a very high degree as we work our way through to make sure we stay in that cone that we have identiﬁed. So, if we come in --- if we see things particularly hot, whether it is weather or pricing, in 2014 we might pull some outages or expenses out of 2015-2016 into 2014 to help us manage our way through that process. So I think your description of it makes me think that you understand very well what we are doing.     And that is a process that we put in place here that I think is working just extremely well. It not only gets capital to transmission, but it also enables us to move projects from one year to another into the year and that is really a positive process for us that we have put in place.  It is worked very well; we continue to look at it. We look at numbers on a pretty regular basis to ensure that we are managing the year in the proper fashion. We will continue to do that because, as you all have pointed out, this 2014, 2015, 2016 years are critical for us, particularly 2016 because of the capacity markets. But we are managing to it and so far we are doing very well."
"Okay. And just in 2014 what is your speciﬁc savings in pension and OPEBs? I know that is within your O&M budget, but just that speciﬁc line, what are the savings versus 2013?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Let me give you some detail on that. 2013 -- and you talk about two diﬀerent things, Steve. We will talk about the pension cost and then the pension expense, okay.  So the cost for 2013 was $114 million and the expense ended up coming in being about $64 million, okay, the O&M expense. And then we are forecasting for 2014 the cost to be about $84 million and we are anticipating that the expense will be about $52 million. So the diﬀerence year on year, the $64 million to the $31 million is about $33 million."
"Just given the recent weather and a little bit of how the current situation is unfolding, can you give us some color on coal days of inventory on hand? And does this prompt you to think that there might be some changes to how you head into the contracting season for coal later this year?","Typically we pull down inventories during the winter months and we have been on the order of 30 to 35 days on average for just about the whole year. I think it was -- at the top it was around 40 days and it is down to 30, 35 days and we are ﬁne with that. And we will be very sensitive about how much additional coal procurement we do as a result.  We have a pretty ﬂexible system and some --- a lot of are contracts are pretty ﬂexible. So we feel pretty good about where we are at now. We don't have any changing conditions or requirements that we are placing on our coal buying eﬀorts because of the weather. We are just performing as we thought we would.     We have got more coal than the country has cold right now. We are good to go."
"I have a question on Nick's favorite slide, the equalizer slide. just two part, where do you think the ROEs could go or what do you think is a normalized level of ROE? And what type of sensitivity could you give us say for every 50 basis point change in this regulated operations ROE we could see a $0.10 improvement in earnings or something?","Yes, so I think when you look at the equalizer chart, I like for it to be with a 10 [ph] handle on it. And certainly we have said long-term and we are looking at around 10.2, 10.3, in that range. And you are seeing sort of a quarterly perturbation of a lot of activity that is coming into play here. So as long as it stays in that range we are in good shape. And I don't know, Brian, if you have anything you want to add?     I don't. Anthony, we could get you some type of sensitivity for across the system what a 50 basis point change in overall ROE would be, we can get that for you."
"Quickly on rate for 2014, you had at EEI sort of $1.97 penciled in, now it is $1.75, is that change in things that came in lower or lower assumption on the things you haven't yet got?",2013 came in a little bit higher. So the diﬀerence is a little bit lower.
"Okay. Great. And then secondly, just coming back to this demand question and in the context of some of your comments about sort of managing within the cone. I mean you did take down the residential forecast for this year by I think 80 basis points and commercial by 90 in what is less than three months. Are you genuinely seeing that much more concern versus what you were seeing in November or is this a little kind of conservatism to oﬀset other stuﬀ?","Yes, so you asked us two diﬀerent questions with the same answer. The answer for your prior question is the same as this one, 2013 came in a little bit higher."
"Yes, two questions unrelated. First, on the transmission side, we have seen in the MISO and in New England dockets where interveners are seeking lower transmission base ROEs. If the same thing happens in whether it is the Southwest power pool, whether it is in PJM, what do you think the tipping point is where it would change your -- I don't know, your incentive or your desire to be a sizable investor in transmission in the US?","Well, I think as long as transmission is at a premium or equal to the state rates we are in good shape. And I think clearly there is an incentive being placed on building transmission, we are happy with that. And really, once again, the FERC needs to send some messages here that from a policy perspective that we want to continue building transmission in this country. And as long as that premium is at or above the state rates then we are in good shape.     FERC was clearly, Michael, looking to attract capital into this space and what they have done with their ROEs has done exactly what FERC wanted to happen. So as long as they --- as Nick was saying, as long as they continue to send the signal that they want increased investment in this area we will respond to that signal.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      I think it continues to be part and parcel to the overall grid expansion that is going on and the resilience of the grid and there is going to continue to be spend regardless. The question is, do you really want to satisfy that precursor of transmission being built out to respond to the generation retirement and so forth to optimize the grid so that you can do that as a prerequisite and then focus on the rest of the underlying system, that is what is key.  I think you have got to get through this transitional process we are at in this industry. So transmission needs to be incentivized in that regard because that will provide the greatest beneﬁt in terms of resiliency of the grid but also in terms of the optimization of the resources that are attached to the grid."
"Got it. And just looking at your non-transmission investment, so the jurisdictions where you have distribution and/or generation rate base. Where do you see the greatest year-over-year changes in capital spending, where do you see kind of a slowing of capital spending?","Incrementally more, Michael, in the APCo T investments across our system is where we are seeing signiﬁcantly more investment. We're also seeing increased investment in our Cook Nuclear Power Plant and associated with some of the environmental investments that we are having to make to be responsive to MATS by 2015. So those are the general areas where we are seeing incremental investment.     Yes, I think we are at $3.5 billion to $4 billion on the environmental spend now over the period. And then when you look at the other capital that we are spending, it is block and tackle spending that typically is recovered from a regulated standpoint.  So we are sort of in a position where we are not having to build a large central station generation, but we are able to focus on transmission and distribution investments that are clearly beneﬁcial to customers and customers actually see and that is a positive."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   My question is on page 11. It appears there that probably half or more of your expected pre-tax earnings improvement by 2016 will be driven by generation and perhaps a quarter or less by distribution. When I think of the generation segment that is obviously one that is transitioning to competition in an environment of $60 per megawatt day capacity prices.  Distribution, on the other hand, is probably I would imagine half of your rate base, half of your O&M, a lot of that at utilities that are under earning. I wonder if you can give me some color on the skew of these earnings improvements towards generation and the relatively small contribution from distribution.","Well, I think it is just a matter that --- generation typically has the big-ticket items that can be adjusted. And when you look at consumables for a scrubber, the way all the parasitic load operates within the plant, certainly the way that you contract for the activities associated with it particularly in terms of use of contractors versus use of employees -- all those types of things are substantial within the generation framework.  And there again generation sort of functions -- each plant functions as its own proﬁt center. And so, doing that it can focus more readily on the beneﬁts associated with optimization of how they operate. And from a distribution standpoint it really is a matter of outage scheduling, management with the customers, the processes that are in place that goes back through the organization.  So it is probably -- at least in our view -- when you preach from the customer side of things you want the distribution side to be very robust in terms of the way it operates to provide the customer experience that we are asking for. From a generation side, that is all done sort of as a back oﬃce function and it contributes heavily to the beneﬁts from an OEM perspective but also from a capital perspective. And that is our expectation as we get through this. Nuclear, part of that process hasn't been through the lean activities, they started the lean activities. Obviously we are very careful because nuclear is diﬀerent. But is a heavy capital and OEM spend and there are opportunities for optimization there as well. So I think we have got the right balance when you look at generation and then when you look at transmission and distribution together you are on par."
