Question,Answer
"Good morning, good morning. I just wanted to pick up on one of the key themes at the Analyst Day talking about the transmission within AEP and a signiﬁcant growth. The potential there as you see it and what appears to be a valuation disconnect with AEP stock relative to public comps in transactions, I'm just wondering if that conversation invited any reverse inquiries on your assets. I know you said these are core to you, but just kind of curious how that's developed and any other thoughts on that side you might share?","Good morning, Jeremy.     Yeah, I'll just follow up with that I mentioned transmission, so I'll turn it over to Julie and respond to that.     Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. Let me tell you, we certainly got a lot of attention from our investor base and so I'll answer it that way. We appreciate that because that means we're doing our jobs. I think we still need to do a lot of work here and make sure that it may make it easy for you all to understand what the earnings stream is and the earnings potential of that particular business and so as we were getting ready for this call today, I'm looking at the waterfalls on pages 9 and 10 of the presentation today.  And so, let me go to page 10, just real quickly so that AEP Transmission Holdco, which is our pure-play transmission component, contributed $0.95 of the $4.04 year-to-date and as you   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   know, we've got more transmission in play across this waterfall to that shows up in the Vertically Integrated Utilities and the T&D segment. So as a swag and will do better with this as we go into 2023 to give you a more granular view of the transmission component in the aggregate from AEP.  But assume that roughly 50% of the earnings on the Vertically Integrated Utilities and T&D Utilities is essentially the part of adding the $0.95 to another -- let me say it in another way, I'm totally tripping over myself here, $0.95 from the AEP Transmission Holdco essentially doubled that, so that's about half. So half of our earnings are coming from that particular segment, the other half is coming from the Vertically Integrated Utilities and T&D Utilities.  So not insigniﬁcant when you compare that just under two bucks to the $4.04, so we'll do better and I'll do better explaining the stuﬀ as we go forward in 2023 but wanted to have that number kind of back in my pocket here in case you ask the question, so I'm glad you did.     But the overarching theme around transmission is certainly with the movement to clean-energy economy and the focus we have on renewables is being put in place. You cannot put these renewables in place without additional transmission. Transmission is becoming more constrained, so it turns out to be very positive from an AEP perspective, from an opportunities to really focus on not only the development transmission which we're the largest in the country, but also in terms of the renewables build-out and in fact distribution with distributed energy resources that will drive diﬀerent resource needs as well. So, all in good shape from that perspective, so we feel very, very bullish about our transmission."
"Got it, that's helpful and then just shifting gears a little bit, rates. Rates moving up here and so just wondering what you can say about that with regards to short-term rate moving higher and long-term debt issuance is being more expensive, just think about historic test years and lag in jurisdictions, wondering what can be done or how do you see that unfolding?","Yeah. Julie?     Yeah. No, thanks again for the question. We are keeping a watchful eye on that. You're absolutely right. So, let me kind of compare and contrast the short-term debt rate that we were realizing last year through the ﬁrst nine months was about 27 basis points to date through the ﬁrst nine months that was about at 1.46%. So, a signiﬁcant uptick and so what we'll be doing is continuing to manage across the diﬀerent buckets of tenure and using kind of barbell strategies to do our ﬁnancings going forward.  We still have a little bit of work we have yet to do this year and that's at parent, I mentioned that at our Analyst Day back on October 4th and we're assuming that rates would adjust to on a   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   longer-term basis to about 5% to 6% for us that compares to through the year-to-date, a rate of about 3.34%. We will and do have that embedded in our 2023 guidance but we'll continue to work with that.  Let me give you another ﬁner point to what I pay attention to is how much of our debt is ﬂoating rate, we generally target somewhere between 15% and 20% of our total portfolio being ﬂoating rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we were at about 14.8% that equates to about the parent, about $5.7 billion, $1.95 billion of that being CP, so we've got a fair amount of ﬂuctuation there, but that's already getting picked up in rates and this absolutely embedded in 2023 guidance. We'll have more for you to share and for your modeling eﬀorts at the EEI Conference when you get all the assumptions that we have behind the waterfall in details that you're typically used to seeing from us."
"Congrats on a solid quarter here. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one just maybe can you elaborate to the extent you can, you mentioned phase 1 of the unregulated renewable cell, just   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   who are the interested parties here or the strategics, are these privates or any additional color you can share there?","I would certainly say that the list was robust, and all the usual suspects that you would think of and beyond, but there were a lot. And I'd say, it was still generally half-and-half, 60:40, whatever it was of strategics and others ﬁnancials. And actually the Phase 2, we're going into a list with strategics and ﬁnancials. And that's a well-balanced group. One that I'm sure will hold each other accountable. They are in the process but we are very happy with the responses we received."
"Absolutely. If I can pivot still on this, if I can continue with the last question a little bit and can ask again about this second subpoena, just what's your understanding of the process from here on out again. I get that they continue to inquire here, just can you elaborate a little bit further here? Again, obviously you're complying, you're submitting documentation, but just a little bit of a sense of what you get from (Multiple Speakers).","Yeah, I mean, there's not much else we can say about obviously because it is a process with the SEC and it's really up to the SEC, what -- how they want to continue to analyze information and ask for new information and typically I guess, whenever they need new information, they'll issue a new subpoena. So, it's just part of the process and it's really up to the SEC and the only control we have is to continue to cooperate very positively and respond and we'll continue to do that.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Excellent, okay, perfect. And then if I can just with respect to West Virginia, can you guys talk a little bit about the fuel situation there? And is there an ability to leverage securitization here to address the balance there and just to what extent can that sort of fully address the balance?","Yeah. Julie?     Yeah, no, thanks for the question, Julien, and no, actually as a matter of fact that's exactly what we're contemplating. As you know, we've got a fair amount of exposure in excess of $400 million as of the end-of-the third-quarter of deferred fuel in West Virginia in particular. We want to be very sensitive to customer bills, so the plan is to see what we can do around securitization of the outstanding balance and manage rates for customers.  Right now, the current mechanism is we have a 12-month fuel clause to reset in account for the prior year, we're currently in hearing there but we want to be extremely sensitive to our customer base as it relates to that particular area. So standby, we'll have more to tell you and more to share as we make some progress but securitization is absolutely contemplated.     Yeah."
"Thank you. I appreciate it and, Julie, I wish you all the best. Good luck.","Oh hey, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Power from UBS. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Ross."
"So I just had a couple of questions here. I was going to ask about the subpoena, but we've kind of beaten that to death but the (inaudible) strategic computing that's going to happen within sort of the ﬁrst half of next year. Are there other businesses that sort of ﬁt into that same sort of potential strategic review category? I'm thinking about wholesale services or distributed resources. Are they core to you or is that something we could see in the future?","Yeah, so obviously we have three -- I guess three of the normal four burners already loaded. One is Kentucky, one is the contracted renewables, and then the retail after that and we have to do a really a strategic review around retail because it includes some of Ohio and that kind of things we need to fully understand that. And we said that we would look at other parts of the business if it fuels the growth that we're focused on relative to transmission and the movement to a clean-energy economy, and so we'll continue to do that.  I really don't want to position one business versus another at this point, but we'll continue to look at all of our business to make sure that we are being as eﬃcient as possible to, as Julie always says, actively manage the portfolio to ensure that we are moving forward from a growth perspective but also from a derisking perspective to ensure that we are spending our capital on the right things and O&M as well. So that's probably all I will say at this point. I'll leave it to Julie in the future to answer those questions. Julie?     Yeah, yeah, but I would leave you with this thought, as it relates to OnSite Partners which is our distributed energy solutions organization and we have wholesale services as well when you look at the quadrants of our unregulated components of our total AEP business. I would submit to you that you should assume that they operate business as usual. Those are closer to customer, those are things that we need to engage in to manage our day-to-day operations and we want to make sure that we're extracting all the intelligence we possibly can and taking care of the customer at the same time but if there are things we can leverage to help us in the regulated envelope, we'll be doing that as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, distributed energy solutions seems to scratch that itch, and we've gotten a lot of success in one way out of that, so business as usual and we'll keep you apprised, anything else that we put on deck like Nick said, we got all of our burners busy, you know what's on deck but the point here is to get as eﬃcient as we possibly can so that we can deliver the goods, take care of you, take care of our customer and then when we're good to go."
"That's great (inaudible), thank you. And then just maybe one more around sort of the ﬂexibility of your capital strength. As you kind of iterated at the Analyst Day many times, Julie, a lot of the capital is in transmission. We've seen some other companies maybe struggle to get transmission projects on schedule given the siting and permitting issues. Is that just a large- scale transmission project issue? And do you have sort of just a lot of smaller scale stuﬀ you can move around in that transmission and even in the distribution bucket?","Yeah, so obviously we've had the same conversations (Technical Diﬃculty) Congress. A large block of our transmission is transmission within our service territory and actually, basically the nuts and bolts of making sure that we have rehabilitation of the grid, replacement of old resources, we have some transmission lines and just every time we have our sub-company Board meeting always comment about these 100-year-old lines that come up for replacement and we're still in the process of doing that.  We've talked a lot about the amount, just this sheer magnitude of AEP's transmission system and the average age being 57 years old or some number like that and in the spend that we have ongoing now just increases it by a year. Every year it goes by like (inaudible) $3 billion. So you see really we have not had issues with the construction of our transmission. Now, if you do a new transmission with new large-scale transmission that's where you really get into permitting and right-of-way issues and that's really part of the permit legislation.  And then when you crossover states, obviously the cost allocation issues occur, so but by and large almost all of our transmission is really related to transmission that either already exists or within our territory that we certainly have the ability to move forward with and we also have and this is probably more than you asked for but from a transmission perspective, we've increased our planning associated with that. We used to do 120% of the capital plan. Now, we do 130%. We're also looking at distribution actually to do the same thing around the 120%.  So, those are mechanisms where we continue to be able to use throttles, we continue to be able to adjust based upon diﬀerent projects being either slowed down, sped up or whatever and we continually adjust to that because we have thousands of projects to be able to work that through, so that really drives that element of consistency around our ability to provide capital for transmission and in fact distribution."
"That's fantastic, Nick. Thank you. Julie, best of luck.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Hey, thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.  Operator  (Operators Instructions) We will go to the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Big weekend coming up, Alabama and LSU, we got 10 days. I hope that's not like you're looking for me from (inaudible). Hey, couple of questions. First of all, I loved slide 41. When I'm looking at slide 41, Nick, it's trailing 12 month earned ROE chart. Just curious, when I think about what's embedded in 2023 guidance, which of those get materially better in '23, which of those face even a little bit more lag in '23 than they do right now?","Yeah. Julie?     Yeah, yeah, so Michael what you should anticipate is movement on the PSO front. I mean we've got a little bit of momentum there, we've got the securitization taken care of now. We'll be making an application soon for a rate case, so anticipate that. We do expect over time that APCo is going to improve too, particularly now that we've got the Virginia triennial behind us and you're starting to see the fruits of that eﬀort already showing up in our waterfall slides.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then we've got activity regulatory activity underway at SWEPCo too, but we will give you more granular detail at the EEI Conference on a company-by-company basis across the board, so stay tuned for that, but as you know the entire objective is to move the needle and closing the gap and I would submit to you that that's how we describe another aspect of our active management. So we should be in good shape and moving in the right direction. Obviously, we're comfortable with the guidance we already put out there.     Yeah."
"Got it and then speaking of APCo and the court case in Virginia and the $37 million pre-tax beneﬁt you took this quarter, how should we think about that for 2023? I mean is that just a nonrecurring one time or should be smooth that out over '23's quarters? I'm just trying to think about how to actually model that?","Yeah. Yeah. No, I love that question because (inaudible) with that myself as we've got the good news. So yeah, $0.06 that you saw in the third quarter which is essentially like a catch-up from the under earnings from 2017 to 2019, so that's unique, so $0.06 this quarter and I'll take it a step further. Let's go to the fourth quarter because you'll probably ask me about that too. We should have about a penny of earnings associated with this particular outcome in the fourth quarter of 2022, so think about that when you're calibrating your model.  And then for 2023, we'll have about $37 million of additional revenues from rate increases that eﬀectively covers January of 2021 to September 2022 that in terms of what we should have been able to recognize but we're spreading it over 16 months plus we have that going forward a beneﬁt that starts October 2022. So what all does that mean, that means $0.06 spread across 2023 and that will be included in the waterfall guidance that we gave to you at EEI. So I hope that helps kind of (Multiple Speakers) for you."
"That does help and then ﬁnally one last thing, can you remind us what's your cash tax position will be in the coming years?","Yeah, cash tax gets really goofy with the BMT, so those numbers kind of ﬂoat all around and we can always help you behind the scenes with modeling but for cash tax in 2022, I want to say that the rate is something like 10.8% then go out to 2023 the way we're modeling, it is just a little bit over 4% but I would just direct you back to the GAAP annual eﬀective tax rate and so we're looking at the traditional 5.2% in 2022 and it pumps up a little bit to about 8.4% in 2023 but we'll be able to give you more granular there too when we roll out all the backup to the 2023 guidance.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   But yeah the BMT, it almost looks theological and we're looking at some of the modeling. I mean it works and it's accurate but it's just the rate kind of bounces all over the place from a cash perspective because you're using those tax credits."
