Question,Answer
"Hey, Nick, I know you can't control the governmental regulators, but certainly delays in Ohio and the FERC snafu last night to kind of push that timeline to clarity on the generation business, but can you walk through how you and the board are approaching a decision on monetization and then what data points you guys think you need to see before you get comfortable formalizing that decision?","Yeah, Dan. Well, clearly we were looking at the capacity auctions to look at the long-term value of that generation. The supplemental auctions are, by and large, some of the risk-adjusted items and ﬁller-in for 2016 and 2017 during those years, but in particular 2016. If those supplemental auctions continue to occur certainly before – in the September-October timeframe, even then we'll have a good handle on what 2016 looks like. But the base residual auction is clearly the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   important win in terms of long-term valuation of generation and we continue to expect those valuations to improve.  So our board has been along with us all along the way; matter fact, we just had a board meeting with them this week and went over the issues involved, and the primary issue was the upcoming auctions that would be a large part of presenting to us our options relative to the strategic valuation of generation. So that's the key component.  Now as far as the PPA is concerned, that's going to continue on; but it's really hard to tell when the PECO is going to focus on that. And I would say that we continue to push for the PPA, obviously, but the main determinant right now with the board is that capacity auction. So once we get that, we'll have a major data point for the board and we can continue our process of that strategic evaluation."
"Got it. And I guess just on guidance – and I know we're just going into the summer, but if you look at generation now above your full year guidance and transmission at a run rate that's equal to your full year guidance, what are some of the things we're seeing that's hampering the second half results to stay within even this elevated band given how far ahead you are in some of these segments?","Yeah, I think you have O&M spend. Obviously, there's timing issues with O&M. And as far as the remaining, we have – there could storm related activities, many things that we sort of hedge on. I know that sounds – makes us sound like sandbaggers to a certain point, but it's not that. It's really we're trying to risk-adjust some of these issues that can occur. Brian, you got something else?     Yeah. Dan, another big driver is the PJM, the capacity revenue decline. It's $0.35 and almost all of that is in the back half of the year; $0.05 of that was in second quarter, but the remaining $0.30 is back half of the year."
"I guess, maybe probing it the other way, how much O&M do you think you can incrementally pull forward from 2016 into 2015 just to give you a little more breathing room for next year, given some of the other kind of built-in challenges there already?","We've pulled some already that's incremental beyond what we did last year. It's around $14 million. It's getting harder and harder to do that. Obviously, you can pull some in, but you can't pull everything in. So I'm seeing that as more limited right now.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Good morning. I wanted to touch on transmission. You're making great progress in terms of incremental spend and I just wondered if there were further opportunities that you saw. If you could just maybe give us a little more color on the outlook there to create additional opportunities, what sort of – what are the drivers here as we should think about your ability to grow transmission even further?","There is lot of color here. We have a lot of incremental spending that we can do in transmission. And right now, I mean, transmission – you think about it. We have over 2,000 projects going on right now – and those are small projects, larger projects, and all that kind of thing, but it shows the bandwidth of what transmission is doing. And we look at the investment proﬁle for transmission, particularly for AEP. It continues to be – it's just a huge footprint that we are able to invest in from a Transco perspective and from an individual operating company perspective. And we mentioned this last time, I mean, just the rehabilitation of the existing grid, we're challenged to keep up with that, let alone put in additional enhancements. And we really want to do that because it improves the quality of service, ultimately, to our customers. And so, we have a lot of runway left relative to transmission; no question about it."
"That's helpful. And switching back to Clean Power Plan, after we see the ﬁnal rule from EPA, could you just talk about sort of the process overall. I know you have a bunch of states, a bunch of things to think through, but how should we think about how you might respond over time in terms of what that will mean for your overall spending plan, how the grid will look, make the power plant, et cetera? Can you just talk a little bit at a high level as to how we should see that unfold for you?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Sure, Stephen. Obviously, it depends upon what that ﬁnal rule looks like. If you look at the categories – I mean, if you're having to adjust natural gas dispatch versus coal dispatch, for example, that's one thing. That ultimately impacts the fuel cost to customers as a result, when you do that kind of switching. But in terms of infrastructure, we made the point – our initial approach to this is going to be: we get the ﬁnal rule, and if the EPA is fully aware of the issues involved from a reliability standpoint, but also from a implementation standpoint, and if they wind up being respectful to the states, of the resource process that they go through, and allow time for that to occur, and targets are more rational instead of – 11 states have over 75% of their requirement in 2020 and in several – many states there's over 50% of their requirement in 2020.  That has to change. It's too early and it's too aggressive in emission reduction targets. So if they come oﬀ of that and have a rational plan to allow technology to continue to improve, and we can actually wind up at a better place at the end of the day in 2030, that'd be a good outcome. And in that case, we could be able to work with the states because they obviously care about what we think in terms of reliability standpoint and the infrastructure to be put in place and how quickly we can do it and that kind of thing.  But it is the state's plans and the states have to have time to review those plans, and then we start taking actions based upon where our individual states want us to go. So it really – in my mind, it depends upon, certainly, the President, because the President is driving the bus on this thing. And the EPA, obviously, is looking at all the issues involved. And if there's moderation associated with the targeted implementation and being respectful of the state processes that need to occur and the infrastructure, the timing of infrastructure, and having reliability provisions that make sense, then we can get about the process of investing.  From an AEP perspective, we're in the middle of a transformation, anyway. The industry is in the middle of a transformation. We've already reduced our carbon emissions by 15% since 2005. So – and that process is continuing with the advent of natural gas, shale gas activity, the advent of renewables. We're putting in solar. We're doing wind farms, but energy eﬃciency and battery technologies are coming into play as well. So there's real opportunities for us to invest in the right things for the future and actually balance out our energy portfolio, which is a good thing for this company and the country, as a matter of fact."
"That makes a lot of sense. And assuming that, again, the EPA rule does give you a realistic path, as you pointed out, instead of a path that's really – you surely couldn't achieve, if it is realistic, should we be thinking about sort of resource plans that could be ﬁled and overall plans over time that you would submit that would lay out how you see the best path forward and what that would involve in terms of spend and asset mix?","Yeah, that's right. That's right. We'd be working with the states to ﬁle the resource plans, and then we'd start the actions associated with it. And this is a little diﬀerent than the Mercury Rule. The Mercury Rule is point speciﬁc, plant speciﬁc, so you knew exactly what you need to do. This has got tentacles in many aspects of the electricity utility business itself and it will take some dialogue – some serious dialogue and contemplation of how to address these types of issues   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   from a state jurisdictional perspective; and we'll be a part of that process. We will ﬁle our resource plans and we'll go from there, just like we always have."
"Yeah, hi. Good morning. Good morning, Nick. You referred a couple times to the 2016 risk adjusted assumptions. Could you just kind of clarify exactly what you mean by that?","Yeah. When you go into forecasting a year, you're looking at what load's doing; and obviously load's moving around on us. The customer mix is moving around on us. Capacity auctions were contemplated, whether PPAs would occur during that period of time, and then, of course, looking at any transmission investment and those kinds of things that we need to evaluate. Those are important pieces, but I think probably – and the only thing we can do is sort of come up with a plan and a budget that risk-adjusts many of these items; and some of them are externally driven, signiﬁcant external driven, like the capacity auctions and the PPA approach in Ohio.  So, as we go forward in the year, we obviously like to get more information that we can really make a quality forecast of what 2016 looks like. I think we made a lot of progress because we know what we've done relative to the continuous improvement enhancements that have occurred, that have crescendoed over time, and we expect that to inure to our beneﬁt during 2016. But these external items are more diﬃcult to tell, and really what happened last night is just another indication of how things can get adjusted at the last minute. So it's diﬃcult to tell, but I think in the next two months to three months we're going to probably see a lot of clarity.     And even with all those factors that Nick mentioned, Steve, we are still, as we look at 2016, inside the operating earnings guidance range that we'd given for that previously of $3.45 to $3.85 a share."
"Okay, and is this – part of this kind of trying to judge how much you need to manage cost and move stuﬀ around depending on how these play out? Is that also kind of what you're referring to?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we've been moving costs from 2016 into 2015 and 2014, and now we're reaching sort of the point of conclusion where we understand those cost components going into the year. It really is about load forecast and, certainly, these external issues that we're dealing with, but those will play themselves out here in the next couple of months."
So I just – how much do you just need – how are you weighing kind of answers to that – some of these questions versus just there can be periods of time where it's just hard to get transactions done?,"Yeah. So, obviously, the interest rate environment we continue to deal with, and certainly what Janet Yellen is trying to do with interest rates in the future might have an impact. But as far as the sector itself and our performance within that sector, we feel very good about the path that we're taking; and that is to take risk out of our business and to make sure that we are able to invest in those things that provide quality returns to our shareholders. And, I mean, that's what we control. And we have to be very disciplined at it and there may be external things that occur around the world or nationally that could impact it, but typically, though – even if you look at commodity prices, I think where we're at right now is, like I said earlier, somewhat of a tenuous economy because we see residential, commercial, industrial moving back and forth all during the year and it's like you're in a waiting stage.  Now, who knows what's going to happen here, but you could have an energy economy take oﬀ or you can have an energy economy that stagnates but that's based on public policy, whether we do exporting, whether we do other things that would have an impact on the commodities themselves. And I think it's important for us to be knowledgeable about those kinds of issues so that we can manage our business around no regrets investment that are meaningful to our shareholders that provide consistent returns. And that's what we're doing."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. Last question, just the page with the credit metrics, particularly the FFO to debt or the EBITDA metrics, clearly shows you're way stronger than your targets. Can you maybe give some thought on kind of what's the ultimate goal? I'm assuming your goal is not to stay dramatically above the targets?","It's to be within those targets, Steve, and part of that rationale is why we increased the CapEx for the balance of the year. And, of course, we'll be looking at what we expect those metrics to be in 2016 and adjusting our CapEx forecast, accordingly.     A lot of this is about making sure that the business is on ﬁrm and sound ﬁnancial footing so that we can make continual judgments about where we put our capital. And we have this huge hedge out there, called Transmission, that we are able to essentially do acquisitions all the time and it's a good place to be. But at the same time, we improve our currency value; we improve our position from a risk tolerance perspective. And it is an opportunity for us to reposition this company for the future. And we just retired 5,500 megawatts of coal-ﬁred generation. So you're starting to see a rebalancing of the portfolio to address what customers truly want in terms of resources. We believe a balanced set of resources is important, including coal, but we've got to get through the process of ensuring that we're advancing from the other technologies and addressing customers' concerns relative to the quality of service; and that's what we're doing."
"Can you – the $200 million of incremental transmission capital, how is that going to be divided between Holdco and the other utilities?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   About $80 million of that is going to go to the Transco and the remainder is going to go to the Integrated Utility operating companies.
Thanks. Can you just give a little more ﬂavor as to what went better than planned to allow you to raise guidance at this point in the year?,"Yeah, I think we covered that during the meat of the call, to a large degree. Rate increases and weather were stronger than what we had forecasted. The regulated businesses are doing very well and the competitive businesses are doing about as well as last year. Cash ﬂow is ahead of expectations. And you put all those things together and that gives us the conﬁdence to raise the operating earnings guidance and raise the CapEx that we talked about.     And the continuous improvement activities that are starting to culminate across the board. So it's cost control. It's certainly – the underlying fundamentals of the business are very positive and it gives us the conﬁdence to raise the earnings fees (50:10)."
"Yeah, thank you. Can you talk about the scale of the open position at AEP Generation Resources as you look out over the next few years, or how to think about that as a sensitivity?","Yeah. So, Gregg, they're trying to stay in a hedged position of about 60% to 70%, and I think they've done that to pretty good eﬀect, really, since early last year when the business started. And that allows them to do a couple of things. It allows them to hedge in what some of the earnings are going to be at prices that they ﬁnd attractive, and they do that through both retail, the wholesale auctions that they have to serve SSO load, and their normal trading activity. But then it also leaves them with an open position to take advantage of what could be higher prices like they had during the polar vortices of last year. We were able to take advantage of that and to cover things like unit outages or price – or load spikes or price spikes that can happen in the short-term period. So they don't want to be sold out, fully committed. They want to have a signiﬁcant portion hedged and a portion to cover some unexpected short-term opportunities.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Chuck and his team continually evaluate that, but the 60% to 70% has been pretty much a target for – well, actually for a very long time now. And, it's for that reason – I mean, we're just sort of risk averse from that standpoint, because that business is really focused on making sure that it continues to be an airtight business that has – like I said earlier, he's done a great job of compartmentalizing the risk and that's a part of that ability for them to do that.     The assets that Chuck has in that business are great assets and the risk management they have applied to that business has been phenomenal through some really pretty volatile circumstances over the last year and half. So we're really proud of the way they're managing that business and they've done it to very, very good eﬀect ﬁnancially.     Really, when we look at it, it's not internally what the issues are, because we can control what happens relative to how our generation operates from an operational excellence perspective and how we manage risk within that envelope. The real issue is what happens outside, with the regulatory commissions, FERC, Ohio and elsewhere. But, certainly, yesterday was another indication. I mean, the market is moving toward a certain set of conditions for the auction and it gets changed at the eleventh hour. And that's a concern, because you never know what the rules of the game are and they can change at the last minute or change afterwards; and that's troubling. So I think consistency – we have consistency internally; it's consistently externally that we need."
So is it presumptuous to say that you're bullish about power prices?,"I wouldn't say that's presumptuous. I mean, I really believe we've taken a substantial amount of capacity that's been retired and we believe that capacity process will improve."
Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.,"Good morning, Jonathan.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Jonathan.     Jonathan, are you with us?"
Any update on the River Ops transaction that you talked about last quarter?,"The process we're going through in terms of valuation continues, and that's really all that we can report at this point."
Good morning. I guess I just wanted to sort of follow up on the PECO decision yesterday to give further consideration at some point in the future of your re-hearing request in the OVEC proceeding?,"Yeah, it just looks like it's some continued delay, really. We don't seem to be getting answers, schedules or the things that we need to be able to get the answers that we're looking for. And they seem to be punting some of these decisions farther out into the future and, as Nick said, we need some clarity and we don't seem to be getting it.     I don't know how far you can delay these things. I mean, it's an issue where there needs to be an answer and I'm just concerned that we're either waiting till after the capacity auctions or whatever. But Ohio needs to be concerned about – and just yesterday was another indication of, if you're going to depend upon – from the federal side to address the market issues, that changes will occur that you may not anticipate. And I think, from a generation perspective, we've got to make sure that Ohio continues to develop and, certainly with the natural gas out there, that nothing is going to happen until there is some resolution. So you're sort of in a hold pattern. We're not going to make any investments in central station generation in Ohio, and I haven't seen many others step up to the plate. I know there is maybe one or two units that are being built out there, but keep in mind you've retired thousands and thousands of megawatts and you're short in Ohio. And so, the delays need to come to an end."
"Good. Just a brief one on your earlier balance sheet comments. Clearly, the metrics are looking a little better. Debt to cap numbers have started to turn around; even the pension funding numbers look really solid. Given all of that, does it make sense on the margin to reconsider capital deployment towards maybe looking at the dividend policy as opposed to purely looking at transmission CapEx; any sort of like marginal changes there to think about?",The real question is: what happens to the dividend? Is that...
"Great, thanks a lot. The rest of my questions were asked and answered.","Okay, thanks.  Operator  Thank you. We'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jeﬀeries."
"Hey, good morning. I guess this is a real softball question, but do you think Governor Kasich's entry into the race slows decisions down in Ohio? It looks like we've really being punting. I don't know what the end game is or where they're looking to punt to, but do you think this slows things down or speeds things up or has no impact?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   My bet would be no impact, because Governor Kasich obviously has conﬁdence in the Commission and certainly Andre Porter, as Chairman, has taken over there and my belief is that he is going to leave it to the Commission to decide what this Ohio policy looks like. So I don't see his running for oﬃce of the President to slow things down. But I guess the real question is will the PECO actually speed up? And that's something that they need to address."
"Do you think they're waiting for like – Brian had used a football metaphor: they keep punting. I mean, are they punting to a certain calendar date or a certain time, whether its PJM is all resolved or something? Is that their target, or it's not really sure?","Yeah, only they can answer that, and I think to have – it's one thing to have one delay, but to have delays of several cases occurring, that's really not a good message. And to set energy policy in this state, you've got to have the courage to step up and make decisions.     Anthony, we'd love to see them score a touchdown or a ﬁeld goal rather than punt again."
"Good morning. Nick, I just wanted to make sure I heard your original commentary correctly with regards to your thinking on the generation business. So this, as you say, with Ohio PPA decision have been punted, most likely now we are looking at that maybe in 2016. But if I am hearing you right, should we still expect your ﬁnal decision on the merchant business this year – in the remaining months of this year, or is that also going to be dependent on when this PPA rider stuﬀ now comes out?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","You know, I think, certainly, the capacity performance and the base residual auctions are a signiﬁcant piece of that discussion. We're going to have to see – I mean, we're going to have to see what the lay of land is, you know, after that's concluded to, obviously, visit with our board and determine what the next steps are, but, you know, that doesn't stop us from pushing ahead with the PPA proposals regardless of the outcome; but certainly I think Ohio can send a great message by approving those PPAs, but it remains to be seen whether we are going to actually wait, because this can't go on, you know, for a long time.  We're after certainty for our investors, and from a shareholder perspective we can't have this overhang because it really not only confuses us on how to invest in the unregulated generation or lack of investment, but it also – it's so convoluted that it's diﬃcult to understand exactly what it is you have in terms of valuation of that generation. And so, you know, the steps being taken, particularly with the Clean Power Plan and other things that are occurring, I think those units are going to survive the Clean Power Plan because they're absolutely needed. They're great units and they're two-thirds coal, one-third gas, and a lot of fuel switching occurs between coal and gas. So they're valuable units, but they just need to be reﬂected that way. And I just think it's something we've got to get a handle on.  Now, as far as timing is concerned, we want to make that decision because – as quickly as we possibly can. But we have to do what's right for the shareholders, and we have to do an analysis based upon what we can determine the best we can what the value of that generation on a forward basis is going to be. And so, if you get a great capacity performance number, then that may diminish the need for a PPA. But I still think a PPA is needed because it's an important part of the hedging for customers in Ohio and it's an important part of that generation being maintained in Ohio with the jobs, taxes and everything else I talked about.  So we're not going to – we have not and will not give up on the PPA approach with the Commission. They need to answer that question. It'd be great if they answered it relatively quickly so we could get on with the business at hand, but you know, certainly, the – those two items are still outstanding and we're hopeful that at least one of them will get resolved here very quickly so that we can start ﬁlling in the blanks."
"And from a logistics point of view, Nick, there would be no constraint for you to exit the merchant business while this PPA rider application was still outstanding?","We don't believe there is a constraint, because the real value of the PPA is, again, to maintain that generation in Ohio and make sure that economically they're still there, and – regardless of the outcome of the disposition of that business."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. And last question, is it fair to assume that – and, you know, previously you had looked at sale and spin-oﬀ as two trajectories. Is sale now looking like a more likely outcome than spin- oﬀ? Is that fair to say?","We don't know that, yet. I mean, we've obviously got to look at things like the tax eﬃciency and other parameters before you can really make a decision on sale versus spin or, for that matter, keep. But, certainly, sale and spin, which you mentioned, those are areas where we just have to look at the economics, and it depends on what, you know – I mean, you've got to be oﬀered a sale price that overcomes the tax eﬃciency of a spin, and there's other things involved with it from a business perspective as well. So, I would say both are still part of the decision process."
"Hey, not too bad, thanks. Good morning. A quick question, if you will. I wanted to get some clarity here around transmission spending. PJM's been evaluating a reduction in their load forecast, but from what I understand you all are investing below the RTEP level as in its basic transmission investments at a lower kV. How do you think about the impact of potential reduction in the PJM load forecast relative to your investment plans near term and long-term, especially in the context of having more proceeds from any prospective sale of the River Ops or Genco, et cetera?","I don't know if anybody knows what the load forecast is at this point, and certainly don't know the level of investment needed from a transmission perspective because we are in the process   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   of redeﬁning this electric grid. And we have retirements that have occurred. A lot of the transmission has been built because of the retirements, but also there continues to be optimization across the grid as a result. And there will be more optimization after the Clean Power Plan gets resolved. But the changes occurring within PJM now are more about generation and, certainly, reliability and less so about load. And so, I would – actually, I wouldn't put much context in terms of a forward-looking transmission plan. And we've seen over and over how transmission plans change with varying degrees and sometimes we get irritated by that because we plan transmission and – like path, and things happen. So, it's – but if you look at the underlying fundamentals of transmission, the grid's changing dramatically. The ﬂows on the grid are going to change dramatically. So when you look at the bulk power transmission system, you can be bullish about that. And then, the underlying, which you mentioned, the lower kV levels, the sub transmission and those levels, there is a massive amount of rehab work and follow up work to the bulk power transmission that needs to be done. So – and we happen to have the largest transmission system in the country, so that bodes well for the investment potential for AEP."
"If you could elaborate on that a little bit, just getting some sense of how hedged are you, presumably, to changes either way in the RTEP?","Yeah, we have a bunch of big buckets and a lot of those big buckets are not RTO dependent.     Our transmission spend and forecast is not dependent on an RTEP load forecast."
"Just a quick couple ones. First of all, with the transition auctions have you guys heard from PJM or do you guys have any idea when the new schedule might be or when we might get more information on that?","Yeah, we'll know soon. I think, certainly, PJM will have to speak about the ins and outs of that, but we suspect – I mean, it will be maybe a month – three weeks or a month delay, something like that, because it's not – I don't think it's a substantial thing. They still have to observe the same performance criteria when they bid in, so I think it shouldn't be a large delay."
"Yeah, famous last words. Anyway, going on, just another quick one for you. In terms of the potential asset sale or spin, would you guys be open to the idea of accepting another entity's currency, like a stock deal? I mean, I would assume you guys would prefer cash if you were to sell the Genco, but would you guys be open to the idea of maybe taking the equity of a whatever, one of the players out there that's been acquiring these things?","Paul, as this point as we're evaluating this, I think everything would be on the table. We wouldn't say no to that if we felt that was the highest value for our shareholders.     Yeah, I think we haven't closed oﬀ on any of these parameters that we keep talking about because, frankly, we don't have the full answers yet, right? So..."
"Right, I got you; makes sense. And then, just on the delays that have been happening in Ohio, et cetera, do you sense any change in tone or issues that have come up that – you know, just any ﬂavor as to sort of the environment there with respect to this, or is it sort of kind of regulatory – sort of just the regular regulatory stuﬀ that happens in a lot of sort of major proceedings that are not exactly run of the mill?","Yeah. I mean, obviously the PECO will have to speak for itself on that issue, but it is – I mean, it is a major issue. You can't get around that. So I'm sure, you know, there is a lot of deliberations occurring over in their camp and, you know, it's just part of the regulatory process. But many times I think it's important for policy makers to understand the business disruptions that occur relative to either waiting for decisions or not making decisions, let alone the wrong decisions, but we really do need some consistency and delivering on the orders and the rulings on a timely basis. I think it's particularly important to the industry and particularly important to the electric utilities in Ohio."
"Okay, but there – but you haven't noticed any signiﬁcant shift, I guess, or any change in what's going on there other than the sort of normal back and forth and what have you, or have you?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I don't think there's been a signiﬁcant shift or anything. I think there's a lot of dialogue going on. I know we had dialogue going on these issues in the Ohio Business Roundtable and the Columbus Partnership and, of course, at the Commission as well. And it is an important issue, but I haven't sensed a change. I think it's just a very deliberative approach."
"Hey, Nick and Brian, thanks for everything today. I think we touched a lot on PJM and PPA, so – but maybe if I could switch over to transmission back again, can you talk about what you guys are thinking, any update on potential alternative structures? I know last time you talked about the REIT structure doesn't make sense for you guys. Any updated thought process on that?  And then a second non-related question, can you talk a little bit about what you're – I know demand looked pretty good on a normalized basis. Any additional more insight maybe, you know, with respect to usage patterns, what you guys are seeing there, what sort of – aside from just the general economy improving that it is driving the growth or demand improvement there?","Yeah, I'll just let Brian cover the economy piece of it, but as far as transmission is concerned we haven't changed our approach to the transmission business. We're still heavily investing in it and we still want to make sure that we continue to do it in a positive way from a state perspective. So we haven't changed our approach from that perspective. Brian?     Yeah, I think the other thing..."
