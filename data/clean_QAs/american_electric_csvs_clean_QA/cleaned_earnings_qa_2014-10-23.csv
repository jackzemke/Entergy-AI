Question,Answer
"Hey. Can we just talk a little bit more about kind of where O&M stands? Obviously, you've been able to monetize the good ﬁrst quarter this year. But when you look at the plan and kind of the more lackluster weather this summer, how much O&M do you guys expect to pull forward from 2015 and 2016 into 2014, and how should we think about that aﬀecting kind of 2015 and 2016 inﬂation oﬀ the 2014 numbers?","Yeah. So our original plan still is our plan, to move the $60 million that we discussed earlier into 2014. So that was pretty much the extent of what we were capable of moving in from those years.     Dan, we've completed about $30 million of that so far year to date with most of that $30 million being in the third quarter, and we anticipate about another $30 million in the fourth quarter of this year."
"Okay. And then, on the load growth conversation, you obviously – the weather-normalized numbers, as you show them on the slides, look pretty good, but the ﬁrst quarter number still feels a little ﬂaky, shall we say. What do you guys expect for kind of normalized load growth at this point in time, and what do you see swinging that as far as industrial staying durable, I suppose?","Yeah. Brian?     Yeah. So, Dan, we anticipate being the end of the year at about 0.7% including Ormet and almost 2% if you exclude Ormet for the balance of the year. The thing that you'll notice in the quarterly results, and it's likely to be true in the next few years as well, is a preponderance of that growth is being felt in the industrial side. So when we traditionally think about load growth, we're thinking about it sort of more evenly spread over residential, commercial, and industrial, and recognizing we make more margin in the residential and commercial side than we do industrial, so while we're pleased in the growth that we're seeing, it's not in the part of the business that is higher margin for us, and we have that forecast going forward in 2015 and 2016 as well.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   You know, as a general rule we – I guess post-2008 we saw industrials come oﬀ, but the ﬁnancials still held in there because the residential and commercials were late coming oﬀ as a result. So as the industrials were consistently going oﬀ-line – I think it was like 17% reduction, post-2008, and then – but we were able to hold those ﬁnancials. So now the reverse is sort of happening where it's great that we're seeing the industrial increases that we're seeing on a consistent basis, but it's going to take time for the residential – and particularly the residential – to catch up, because they need sustainability of industrial and commercial load growth for people to actually start relocating and moving out of the house and for the 20-year-olds and that kind of thing. So that's what we're looking for. So it's good that we see the consistency, but obviously it's going to be a slow process."
"And I guess one last one, just on the Ohio generation conversation. Obviously you have this request for late spring next year, but what marker should we be watching from the outside as far as when you think decision points could come up on the interim as to whether you're able to get a PPA done and maybe the sensitivities to what you're willing to do or not do in negotiation process.","Yeah, so there's sort of three markers there, but I'm not sure how each marker plays into the decision process, because the ﬁrst marker's clearly important, and that is the current ESP ﬁling – ESP 3 ﬁling – that contains the PPA for the OVEC generation. If the commission rejects that, then that's probably a pretty clear indication that the PPA process is pretty much going nowhere. But if they approve that, then there's the potential for subsequent approvals relative to FirstEnergy's request and then ultimately to our request. So that ﬁrst milestone is critical.  And then as we move forward into next year, and I think all this is going to happen after the governor's election, we'll probably see before the end of the year our ESP 3 case hopefully will be resolved by the commission. And then subsequent to that, the other two, including the FirstEnergy request, but our request as well on the additional generation. So I think it's clearly important. It's important to the industrials, certain industrials, and it's also important from the stability of these resources that are located in Ohio.  Right now, Ohio is short capacity, and it's just amazing to me that Ohio would be moving in a policy direction that enables generation to be built out of state for import back into the state, particularly with the Utica Shale gas development. But this is where the policy decisions are made with the Ohio Commission, and we need to hear what the thought process is, and we're ready to go based upon whatever that outcome is."
"Hey, good morning, guys. Two quick questions. One related to Ohio. And I believe with the OVEC ﬁling, I thought the commission had to come up with a decision in I believe it was like 270 days, and I know – I think you've exceeded that. Have there been any ﬁlings on when a decision's coming out or maybe somebody saying it's past due?  And the second question is related to the FERC ROEs. Previously you guys had – in one of you chart books you showed how your ROEs was kind of in the middle of the range, and with this downward pressure we've seen in transmission ROEs, does that push you guys more on the higher end and there's a risk that there's going to be downward pressure on your FERC ROE?","Okay. So ﬁrst the Ohio issue. Yeah, they're beyond the 270 days, but usually we don't send past- due notices to the commissions. So it's one of those things where I think the commission is going to have to thoughtfully go through this process, and it's a major – I mean it's a major decision for them relative to the PPA approach. And I'm certainly hopeful that they're thoughtfully considering it and making sure that any order stands up to any type of legal type of challenge. We certainly believe it's legal, and in our ﬁlings we certainly presented a case to that eﬀect, and let's hope they do the right thing.  As far as the transmission ROEs, yeah, there is downward pressure on transmission ROEs, but they haven't aﬀected us. We certainly have our projects and our transco ROEs that are in place, so from an overall sense we're well within the bandwidth of reasonableness. So from our perspective we're still in great shape, and I think even in the future, FERC seems to be really careful about ensuring that we continue to encourage transmission investment, and I would expect those ROEs to still encourage that and be the preferable place for us to put our money."
"Just quickly a follow-up on Ohio. Do you think the delay – obviously you're not going to send a past-due notice – but do you think part of the delay may be that you were waiting for a decision for the OVEC plant, but then you ﬁled for the incremental plants? Is that causing some of the delay, you think, or it's just really – everyone seems really quiet in Ohio with a governors election; is it maybe related to that?","Yeah. I think it's probably the latter of what you said, because it is separate. It's a separate issue, but the commission has had our ESP ﬁling for a while now, but I think for – there's a lot of activity, obviously, around governors elections in the state, in any state, and this is a policy decision that needs to be made in a calm environment. And as we look forward to the policy   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   decisions here, it's important for certainly the aspect of maintaining generation, but also it raises the question of what does the future mean for Ohio in terms of the building of new capacity within the state?  And that probably – the PPA is somewhat of a Band-Aid approach to maintaining existing generation, but you still have further issues to deﬁne within Ohio, because clearly they were depending upon the PJM market construct to provide for capacity to be built, but that's not happening. So there'll be continued evolution of policymaking in Ohio relative to the energy picture."
"Good morning, guys. Nick, in your discussion of the unregulated generation business, you discussed that you're, as you've said before, involved in assessing what the optimum approach is to enhance shareholder value. So I'm just wondering if a) you were saying anything diﬀerent today with regards to timing when you talked about continuing to work in 2015? And b), how much the current proceedings at PJM regarding capacity performance and the DR issue and moving the demand curve – how much you want to see those completed or maybe the next auction completed before you go ahead and give us an idea of what you've decided to do with that segment?","Yeah. So clearly you're going to see some milestones here. Obviously the Ohio PPA is one, and then the auction and what happens relative to that certainly will be another. But all those are particular areas that's we're focusing on to enhance the value of our unregulated generation and provide the ability to continue for that business to be a bona ﬁde operation in the future, because clearly they need to be able to invest and maintain their facilities in the future. So it's sort of a no-regrets strategy around maintaining and enhancing the value of that business. That to me is separate from the decision of what the disposition of that business is in the future. We still maintain that we're a regulated utility, we have to be able to take volatility out of the equation, particularly the capacity market volatility, and it has to look quasi-regulated.  Now, I don't think the timeline of a decision process has changed at all, and we'll still be able to measure that business based upon the lack of volatility and the ability to invest in that business   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   in the future. And – but, clearly, we are looking for something that is either regulated, quasi- regulated, but at the end of the day, we will be a regulated utility."
"So – I mean, not to press you too hard on this, but is there a way to describe what the timetable could be as you see it now on when you would have enough information about the policy environment to be able to determine whether it was close enough to regulated that you'd want to retain it or make a decision whether to retain or to divest?","Yeah, so the question that you started out with was relative to some of the milestones, and those near-term milestones are going to tell you a whole lot. But as far as actually getting into the decision, we are about focusing on infrastructure, development, focusing on the development of the transmission, focusing on certainly infrastructure that provides for improvement in the customer experience. And to the extent this particular business enables us to use it as a springboard to other focus areas that I just talked about, that's a positive thing. So we will determine the future of that business based upon not only the value it produces from a shareholder perspective, but also what our other options are that we've described. So I don't think – nothing has changed relative to the process that we're going through, and obviously we're looking at the options relative to that business and will continue to do that. 2015, I think – and early 2015, particularly with the Ohio decision and the PJM capacity auction, will be particularly instructive, and I think it'll probably be a fascinating 2015."
No doubt. Okay. One other separate area. Can you give us a sense of how much – let me put it this way: How much would the growth rate in load have to decrease before it impacted your earnings growth rate target?,"Yeah, Brian?     Kit, when we put this out a year ago, in the years 2014 to 2016, overall load was in the negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% range. We're seeing ourselves now clearly above that in year to date, but the mix is very much diﬀerent from what we talked about. So that was the range that we used last year. It was the negative 0.5% to positive 0.5%, and we'll be providing an update to that more speciﬁcally at EEI in a couple weeks."
"So, you're referring to the diﬀerence in margin that you get from industrial versus residential?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Correct.
"Just – not to beat a dead horse here on the Ohio situation, but with respect to the independent market monitor there's been some back and forth in the FirstEnergy case, and I noticed that they've intervened in your case. How should we think about the signiﬁcance of that in terms of your case, or how you feel about that?","Yeah, I don't think it's completely unexpected. And I think that there are going to be challenges based upon the process that we're going through. But the issue remains that S.B. 221 allows for the Ohio commission to decide what resources are contained within a PPA approach. And it's very diﬀerent than the obligation that was placed on – by legislation in places like Maryland and New Jersey. So a very diﬀerent approach – and, matter of fact, I mean, you have multiple parties still participating with FRR. They can participate in the PJM market, but they still have regulated operating company requirements relative to generation resources. So it's diﬃcult to make that argument that a FERC-regulated PPA goes against a market construct. So certainly the independent monitor will have his opinion, and everyone else will have their opinions, but we believe we're doing the right thing."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. My other question has been answered. Thanks so much.,"Yep, thank you.  Operator  Next we go to Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.     Hey, Steve."
"Yeah, good morning. Hi guys. Just, Nick, in your prepared remarks you mentioned something about kind of hitting your growth rate but also kind of dealing with growing pains. Could you just talk a little more about the growing pains, the regulatory lag, and some of the things you mentioned there?","Yeah. So overall, I'm just trying to make sure that people understand that as we go through this process, we're moving – we're trying to smooth out a huge hole that we had in 2016 and still provide consistent, quality earnings and dividend growth for our investors through that period regardless of what happens. And typically when you do that, and questions like when you – well, the Mitchell deal for example. The Mitchell arrangement, the 17.5% that I talked about earlier, it'd have been great to get the whole thing transferred in and be able to recover all of that day one. But, for us, we felt like because we have ins and outs that are occurring throughout that entire cycle, we felt comfortable to go ahead and do that particular settlement even though the larger beneﬁts for us and ultimately for the consumer as well, will be when we are able to transfer that other 17.5% – at least the ﬁnancial side of that 17.5% – into a base rate. So it's those kinds of trade-oﬀs that we're making all the time.  And then as we do Lean eﬃciency gains, we're also having to measure those types of things compared to what's going on in relative earnings tests in the various jurisdictions and those types of things. So we have to be – it's sort of a – we're pulling multiple levers through this entire process, and some things will go positive; some things will go negative. But we're very comfortable with where we stand within the guidance range that we've given. And I think we're solidly within that guidance range going forward. So that's the point that I was making. I think there's – we just don't want to have a lot of irrational exuberance that says that we're adding all the positives and not considering the negatives. This is our job, and this is what we do, and – but we're very happy with where our guidance range is right now."
Can you maybe give us a little sense on context that – within your dividend policy? Is it at the high end of your earnings growth range? Is that – how should we just think about that for the overall dividend policy?,"Yeah, so Steve. So we had a 60% to 70% range that certainly we have espoused earlier for a couple of years now, and the board certainly is committed to that. And we felt like it was time to make a move that not only demonstrated our conﬁdence in the business and the formulation and the guidance that we've given through the period but also to make sure that we stayed with that 60% to 70%. And I think that it was important for us to make that move. And the context of it was centered around where we see the earnings in the future and where we see this business case developing. And the board felt conﬁdent about that approach."
"Okay. And then just lastly, just how are you feeling about reliability next summer with all the plant shutdowns in your eastern region? Obviously, a lot of those are your plants. Just how do you feel about reliability?","Yeah. So this is probably a sore subject for me because, as we look at the retirements that are occurring in 2015, if we do have a hard – a hot summer or, even worse, a cold winter in 2015, we're going to have serious issues. And I think that – I think it's going to be a challenge from a reliability perspective. So hopefully we'll have a milder summer and a milder winter, but I still believe there's two functions here. One is, will the system actually operate the way it was intended to operate, and I think it's going to be on the ragged edge of its ability to do that. And then secondly, ﬁnancially, what will it mean to customers, because there will be shortages, there will be prices that – and already the Northeast is concerned about deliverability of natural gas because, a lot like a pipeline capability, well, the same is true for the electric grid. And there will be areas where prices will be much higher than people anticipated.  So the more you take out of this grid, particularly on baseload generation that provides 24/7 support, the more volatile it becomes both operationally and ﬁnancially. Now, I can sit here and say as a company from a ﬁnancial perspective, as long as we operate with excellence, which is what we did during the last polar vortex, we'll be ﬁne ﬁnancially. But part of our role, too, is to think about our customers. And while I'm certainly sensitive to 2015 and concerned about 2015, we won't know until we get there.

"This may be a Brian question. Brian, you were talking about demand and how industrial demand is really what's driving the year-over-year growth and that the margins on industrial are, obviously, less than res or commercial. Can you quantify that for us? Like, you've given three- year guidance. Roughly on a EPS basis, what's the sensitivity to every 1% change in demand for each of the customer classes?","I don't have that for you, Michael. We'll be able to have that at the EEI conference. But I think a 0.5% overall evenly distributed was a $0.05 move EPS annually."
"Okay. And so, kind of, back of the envelope, if that 0.5% is being driven largely by industrial, you'd kind of think that it – that's assumes it's – the 0.5% is evenly distributed, but what you're seeing isn't necessarily that -",That's the point we're making.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Okay. One other question. Balance sheet. Balance sheet has gotten much healthier – congrats on that – over the last couple years. When you look forward, do you see a time in the next two to three years where you balance sheet kind of, heaven forbid, is even too healthy? And how do you deﬁne what your long-term goal is for the balance sheet?","Yeah. So, Michael, we've been getting some of those questions, and I think the idea is what do we do with that balance sheet capacity? And I think you've seen as we have increasingly shifted our spend to the wires side of the business, so you saw before we started 2014 something like 69% of the spend, 2014 to 2016, was going to wires pieces of our business. And increasingly more of that to the transmission side, where we have the lowered regulatory lag and the higher ROE.  So if you look for us to consume some of that balance sheet capacity that you talked about, I'd be inclined to think that you would see that trend continuing, as Lisa and her side of the business in transmission seems to have an insatiable appetite for capital that can return that 11.49% to 11.2% ROE range with very, very low lag. So that's part of the challenge that the management team is working on is how we do we grow the company in the ranges that we've talked about, how do we overcome some of the revenue gaps that Nick talked about associated with capacity, and in addition to growth how do we continue to reward our shareholders in the form of a dividend? And we need to make sure that we balance all of those shareholder interests equally, and that's what we're struggling with, and that's what will provide what I hope are positive updates for investors at the EEI conference.     I think the other thing – it's important question, too. We get it a lot from an M&A perspective and everything like that, and while obviously the patent answer to any M&A question is I can't talk about it, but we can talk about the way we think about investments and the use of our balance sheet, and actually we just look at it as uses and sources. And one source is our healthy balance sheet, to be able to invest more in our business. But probably the more important question is, what are you investing in? And we want to make absolutely sure that we're investing in those types of investments that will produce the quality returns, the continuity and consistency and the concurrent of recovery of investment that things like transmission provide. And that's our measure, that's our measuring stick, and that's a litmus test for how we invest. So we're well aware of where our balance sheet stands, but we're always looking at credible options to enhance shareholder value."
"I guess one last one. We've seen this in the wireline telecom business this year. There's been a little discussion in the power and utilities business as well. Everybody loves to ask the question about what are you going to do with the generation business, and I want to ask a little bit of that same question but really for the transmission business, a high-growth business, high-return business, in terms of do you think that's adequately reﬂected in the share price, or do you think   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   there are alternative corporate structures that may enable investors to kind of price that incorrectly? And how do you go about the process of looking at that?","I would say it this way, and Brian can certainly add onto this, but you look at REITs or yield cos and all those types of structures, and there's warts associated with each one of them, particularly in a business that's central to AEP and certainly one that we continue to invest in. So I think I'd rather see AEP emerge as trading more like a fully regulated and transmission oriented utility, and that to me is where we're at in the process at this point.     Michael, we've gotten those questions before, and instead of just saying, oh, we're not going to look at those things, we've looked very hard at them with our advisers and tax experts and the like and have come up with a concept of, from a REIT standpoint in particular, we took a really hard look at, a lot of what we've done in the transco formation is get those transcos approved at each of the utilities where we operate, and because the REIT would own the transmission assets, we would have to go about and get them certiﬁed at each of these states where we do business, because they'd be utility asset owners. And then to take advantage of the tax implications of the REIT, we would have to sell a portion of that REIT oﬀ. We'd have to spin it. Because we wouldn't get the tax advantages under a parent environment. And then we'd have to likely have to come up with some split by which we would share those tax beneﬁt. So the complexities are pretty immense, and we'd want to make sure that the beneﬁts are sustainable and that proposed tax law changes and the like wouldn't make all that hard work and complexity that we'd go to transitory and ﬂeeting.  So in the meantime, the REIT is something we've look very hard at and doesn't work for us, and then on a yield co, the size and scale of where we're at doesn't work now as well. So there's structures that we we'll continue to look at and look at them hard, but to date we've found that, as Nick said, keeping those businesses under an AEP umbrella are very beneﬁcial to our shareholders.     Michael, I think you can probably appreciate this, and some others on the call, that maybe we remain focused on answering this unregulated generation question. So that is something that we're focused on at this point, and as far as the timing of transmission, we can continue to invest in transmission, notwithstanding these other structural components, but the clear issue for us is to get on with this unregulated generation decision."
"So perhaps you won't answer this, Brian. But you talked about the growth rate, of 4% to 6%. You've obviously have been asked about that ad nauseam a bunch of diﬀerent ways. You're going to give us an update at EEI. But when you gave that, initially, you said it was based oﬀ a midpoint of $3.05 to $3.25 for 2013, which – then you gave a guidance range for 2014 of $3.20 to $3.40. You updated that to $3.35 to $3.55 after the ﬁrst quarter. Now you're at $3.40 to $3.50. 2013 seems to be quite a stale base year to be basing a growth rate oﬀ of. Should we assume that you're going to give us an update on the growth rate oﬀ of 2014 or, perhaps, 2015 on what you've earned as a base year, or how should we think about that?","So I agree with you, Greg. I think looking back to original guidance for 2013's getting pretty stale here towards the end of 2014. So we are going to update how we look going forward – what the growth rate looks like. I'm inclined to think we're not going to add another year of speciﬁc earnings guidance at the end. We'd gone 2014, 2015, 2016. I don't think we're going to show speciﬁc guidance 2017, 2018, but we are going to talk about the growth rate at EEI."
"So it sounds like the growth rate isn't going to change too much really, but the base year will be refreshed.","We just need to – I mean, I don't want to be here in 2015 talking about original guidance for 2013. So we need to get oﬀ that and start talking about more what we look like going forward, and we'll be able to do that in a credible way at EEI.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
