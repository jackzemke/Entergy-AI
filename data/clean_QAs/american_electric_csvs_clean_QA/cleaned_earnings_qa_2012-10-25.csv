Question,Answer
"Thank you, very much. I guess my ﬁrst question would be that you have made some really good progress on O&M reduction. Can you talk a little about where the O&M reduction so far has come from, and can you just generally talk about, based on what you have achieved already, what types of opportunity -- incremental opportunities do you think there are?","Paul, there has been a lot of activity associated with that obviously. We have been very careful as the years have gone by, and this year is no diﬀerent, where we look at operating type of synergies that exist, but also from an O&M operation standpoint there are things we view as -- typically we will -- we have alges [ph] move in and out, we have other things that occur as a result that changes the nature of the O&M spend.  But we make sure that those changes are sustainable going forward. It is not a matter of us not doing something and moving it into next year. We are really focused making sure we are able to do it in a sustainable fashion. What we really have done with the repositioning study is refocused that eﬀort to say that we want to focus on process changes that enable us to make O&M reductions in the future. The teams are focused on that and --  Just to give you examples, there are areas where there are reporting things where we have done internationally that over the years the reports continue to be done, they don't need to be done. Or they can be done in consolidated fashion, the same report being produced by several   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   business units for example. Those are synergies that we are looking at and process changes that can occur.  On the supply chain side, standardization is certainly a key for us. You would be surprised how many pairs of gloves -- 90 diﬀerent pairs of gloves we buy. So it is those kinds of things that we really focus on to try to make sure we are getting as much O&M reduction as we can, but doing it in a sustainable fashion.  Typically I think you are going to see on the percentage basis roughly a two-thirds process oriented reduction change. And then when you look at changes in spans of control in terms of organizational realignment, those types of things, and because the process review enables less resources to be performed in one area versus another, a third of that will be more resource reduction types of activity. So it is those kinds of tradeoﬀs that we are seeing.  But it is very focused on the process side of things ﬁrst, and then the resources fallout. The reason we do it that way is we want to wind up in a situation where if we are trying to expand and grow the Transmission business, we want resources to be put in the capital areas where transmission can be built, and also produce headroom from a rate perspective where more capital can be deployed. So that's why we are doing it, and I think it is coming along quite well."
"And then as a quick follow-up, in Arkansas I think you initially got a negative decision out of the commission, but they are giving you an opportunity to ﬁle additional testimony. When do you plan on ﬁling the additional testimony, and do you believe that you're going to be able to convince Arkansas that there is beneﬁt associated with the transaction for customers?","We expect to get something in early December on that. And I think they have given us an opportunity, obviously, because we have a very good relationship with the Arkansas commission, and certainly to give us an opportunity to supplement the record and do additional things to reinforce our position is a good thing."
"My question is on coal gas, burn and switching and the like [ph]. You mentioned you reached a 70% cap factor on the CCGTs in the East and not having much room for further switching. So I guess ﬁrstly, whether you'd expect to see some reversal of the dynamic in calendar 13, given current forwards [ph] and considering your contract position, which I guess is maybe less of a factor than it was this year?","Jonathan, actually we have seen switching going back the other direction. The capacity factors of the gas units are starting to drop. The coal capacity is picking back up. For us, you get into the gas price of $3 to $3.25 per MMbtu, and you going to start that switch to -- back to coal.  I think for other utilities it is higher, because our mines are located close to the plants, and their mainly -- coal comes in by the river, and we have pretty advantageous contracts. It certainly helps us keeping the switchover price lower.  So I think it is a very good proposition for us, because we are able to move back and forth in that perspective when we have the contractual ability to adjust from that perspective as well. And it really says something good about the ongoing nature of our unregulated business, because it will be particularly two-thirds our fully controlled coal units, and as well our gas units -- third gas will be able to take advantage of the economies as well."
"Great, thank you, Nick. Can I just put in [ph] a second? Timing-wise, do you have -- can you give us a sense of when on the forward monthly calendar you would stop seeing year-over-year increases in gas ﬁred comps? Is that before year-end, or is that sometime in the ﬁrst half of next year?","Well, I think certainly year over year from a gas standpoint, I think we will continue to see participation from a gas standpoint. Gas prices have gone up slightly through this time frame, but when you look at next year the strip is still pretty low, and you'll still see coal consumption, but I think you'll still see a considerable amount of gas consumption as well. And it also depends on whether the economy comes back the way it should to ﬁll in the valleys."
"So a quick follow on, Nick, your comments that the rising gas price now, it may have positive -- if heard you correctly, may have positive implications for the unregulated business? Are you talking speciﬁcally about looking at a dark spread kind of calculation there, where earnings and cash ﬂow improved more or less directly with gas price?","Yes, I think certainly the dark spread will be critical in that analysis, but I also think that because we do have advantageous coal pricing, and certainly the switchover price is lower, and we also have coal units that participate well in the market, that we will have a degree of ﬂexibility there, and certainly the ﬂexibility in the contracting to take advantage of price swings, whether they go one way or another.  So I think certainly from our perspective, we look at it, and our coal units are still in the money. Our gas units are clearly in the money, because we have newer gas ﬁred units that are hot in terms of eﬃciency. So -- and our coal eﬃciency is pretty good as well. So I think we are in a good spot there."
Very good. And can you tell us a little bit more about how things are looking at BlueStar and the retail business? I believe you said you're making money there or they are covering their costs or something to that eﬀect? Can you talk to us about what kind of margins you are seeing in the retail business?,"Well, I probably can't comment on the margins, but I can tell you that we are after margins rather than volume. But as far as the integration of BlueStar, the systems integration continues, and it is in a good place at this point. And certainly from the eﬀort placed in that business there is a consistent philosophy of BlueStar and our philosophy, which are one in the same today that we are participating in many markets. It's not -- I mean, certainly the Ohio market is critical for us, but we are participating in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and others, and that is one way in which we can hedge this generation in the future with quality contracts with customers across the board. Particularly in the areas that we understand, like PJM, MISO and so forth.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Like I said, they have 150,000 customers. I think that is like a 28%, 29% increase from last quarter. And they continue to make progress. But I'm really hesitant to talk about volume increases, because once again, I think we are focused on the margin piece."
"Good morning. This is Neil in for Michael here. On industrial demand, how would it have looked in the Third Quarter if we were to exclude Ormet from the calculation?","Brian, you have those numbers.     I do. It would obviously be slightly better. Industrial overall would drop to something like 2% negative for the Third Quarter rather than the 3.1% that it was."
"And on Ormet, I think regulators said they can defer the electricity payments to you? How should we think about the earnings impact in this deferral?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Certainly we work together with the Ohio commission on this. And when you have a customer in southeast Ohio that is 500 megawatts -- I guess, with the two pot lines oﬀ its 300 megawatts. But they employ a 1,000 customers and -- I mean, a 1,000 employees, so it is pretty important to the economy you keep them going. And certainly the Ohio commission stepped up with us to try to arrange a solution, a stop gap measure to keep them going. And the deferral mechanism the commission set up for approximately $20 million on the deferral, we -- and that is -- certainly for us it is no earnings impact, but we are still deferring that."
"Got it. Last question, could you provide some color on the timing and sizing of the securitizations in Ohio and West Virginia?","Neil, in West Virginia we are talking about $400 million, and in Ohio we are talking about $300 million. We anticipate getting those orders later this year, very early next year, and anticipate the securitizations for the gross amount of about $700 million in the First Quarter of next year."
"Talk about the impact of the accelerated depreciation on the merchant assets? I think you said book value is $284 million, and you’re depreciating them. They will be down to zero by 2015.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   What's going to happen there? I mean, are these lives going to be extended when you get an order?","No, I don't anticipate their lives will be extended. What we are going to do is -- Paul, we are going to go from a methodology where we used to look at those on a collective basis in the East generating pool, and now we will need to look at them on an individual basis. So certainly the lives won't be extended beyond 2015, because that's where we have to be to be compliant with MATS. There could be some type of impairment that might be associated with those assets, but in any event we are depreciating them at a pretty aggressive schedule right now and have been since late 2011 when the ﬁnal MATS rule came out.     And this only applies to the units we anticipate retiring in 2015. The others are ﬁne."
"Nick, going back to your opening remarks, when you talked about the goals, et cetera, for the Company, you again mentioned the EPS growth of 4% to 6% a year. I want to just clarify, you talked about the concern on the economy, et cetera, so is that 4% to 6% an aspirational goal, or should we see, given everything that is going on, that oﬀ the 2012 base next couple years you can generate 4% to 6% a year growth?","No, I think as we said in February, that growth rate just by the invested capital in the regulated business will support the 4% to 6% growth rate. So -- and that is things that we -- I think if you looked at capital allocation chart that we had, we used to have chart in there that had the spend on each area. Much of that is block and tackling and things that we have to do. So when you   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   look at the level of that capital spend and the earnings proﬁle associated with that, it gets you in the 4% to 6% range.  And then of course we are still working on the Transmission piece, and certainly very pleased with the progression of Transmission and its business case. So I think the issue for us is to deﬁne what the base start is when we give 2013 guidance, but we fully intend on the 4% and 6% rate to still be there. And of course the dividend policy to be commensurate with the earnings growth as well."
"Also on the Transmission piece of it, guys have laid out for us a couple of times I think in your slide deck a ramp from 12 to 15 in terms of the earnings contribution. Are those numbers still solid? Are those projects now in hand, and you are still conﬁdent that ramp is pretty much locked in?","Yes, we are only showing projects that we know are real. Those numbers are still real. We continue to grow the Transmission business. We continue to work to allocate more capital in the Transmission, because there’s a lot of projects out there, and when we refocus this eﬀort on the indigenous projects within AEP and the service territory and things that need to get done to beneﬁt reliability for our customers, there is a lot of work to get done. So we are happy with those numbers, and you can look at those as numbers we are going to deliver on."
Last question. I believe you said at the end of September customer switching in Ohio was 42%. Are the trends so far you are seeing in the switching pretty much consistent with your expectations and also consistent with what was baked into the ﬁnal ESP order?,"They are a little bit lower than we anticipated, but as this process moves forward, it is diﬃcult to tell how quickly it will move along, particularly when we go to auctions and other things. So it is one of those things where there is 42% there, and there is a queue associated with people switching as well.     About 8%.     About 8%. So it continues to grow.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   It is a pretty aggressive switching schedule. I think some of the things that happened with the timing of capacity orders and the like slowed the rate over the summer, but we have seen a pick up since there has been some clarity with the recent orders that the commission has brought."
"Hi. Just following up on that question, I think there was an 8-K ﬁled in July that talked about, if you included the queue, you would have seen 45% switching. So does that mean you guys are doing better with the net adds to end up at 42% at the end of September?","Well, 42% and an additional 8% or 9% the queue, you are at 50, 51%. So --"
"Okay. So the guys in the queue in July are -- haven't all been processed yet, I guess?","Well -- or there is more in the queue to be processed. I mean, it is diﬃcult to tell, but I'm sure we have processed some of them. Probably all of those in July have been processed, but we have new people in the queue."
Got it. Okay. And that -- so that 42% is a gross number?,"42% is gross of load, and there is the other 8% that is still waiting.     Yes."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Right. Have you mentioned what BlueStar is picking up?,"No, we have not, and we probably won't mention that either."
"Hi, if I remember correctly, you all mentioned you had seen a reduction in usage per residential customer this year on the order of 2%. I was wondering if you expected that to continue to decline and possibly accelerate over the next year as the incandescent light bulbs begin to be phased out.","I think the verdict is still out on that, because there is two issues there. One is eﬃciency obviously, which Brian talked about. And the other is what happens to the economy. And it is yet to be seen really what the true eﬀect is. I think you can still have growth when you have energy eﬃciency when you have an economy that supports the growth, but right now the denominator continues to decrease because have you both issues occurring.  And I fully agree with you, Hugh, energy eﬃciency is here to stay. And I think energy eﬃcient appliances and certainly bulb replacements, all of those types of things will have an eﬀect. But we don't know the eﬀect of the economy in the future, and really, the further electriﬁcation of the economy that still needs to be resolved."
"That's helpful. Can I trouble you all to comment on how the regulators at Appalachian Power and Kentucky Power have responded to date to your proposal to move over the Mitchell and Amos 3 plants, and how you see those regulatory proceedings playing out over time?","Yes, I think those conversations are going very well. Certainly there has been plenty of time based on what we have gone through the last year for there to be a complete understanding of what we are trying to do. The fact of the matter is, though, we are transferring over at net book, something that they are already paying for. And certainly their assets located within the service territory.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So when the states look at it, and typically in the past they have been focused on FRR. In other words, supplying their own needs for customers and securing a consistent supply for their -- power supply for their customers. I think these are fully controlled assets that clearly are in the money and produce value for customers in the long-term. So those discussions have been positive."
"Just a quick question. If you could just give maybe a little bit more color on the dividend. I know you have talked about the dividend policy focuses to be commensurate with earnings growth, and you've talked about 4% to 6% earnings growth. Any color on the payout ratio? I know you are running toward the higher end of 60%. With the increase in your earnings coming from the regulated, could we maybe potentially see that payout ratio go up, or if you could give a little color on the growth?","Yes, well, if you look at just the regulated portion and you look at pure regulated utilities, that ratio is higher than that, up in the 70% range. So -- but that being said, our Board certainly understands the importance to our shareholders of a dividend policy that makes sense. And we -- when we come out with the February guidance, certainly our Board will be -- as they usually do, look at considerations relative to the dividend as well. So I would not be too concerned about us tapping out at the 60%. That's a guidance that we put in place ourselves, but we will certainly evaluate our dividend appropriately.     Art, we would like to have a complete story around that in February when we talk to the investors. And I think Nick's comments about the Board being committed to rewarding shareholders with a strong dividend is something they have demonstrated over time, and we would like to discuss that in more detail in February.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Hi, I wanted to ask a bit more about the repositioning study and what that is going to encompass, whether it is reviewing your cost structure or your asset mix overall.","Yes, Rajeev, so the study is focused on several areas. Our generation side -- and very heartened by the evaluation there. Lean management practices, those types of things. Over 80% of the plant people are involved in the evaluation of how the plant moves forward, and there are some pretty interesting things they have come up with. So there are some structural changes in the way the plants operate, and really the use of contractors and things like that. So -- which that’s something that they are looking at.  From an IT perspective, it certainly is focused on that piece as well. The ﬁnance piece, they are looking at their reporting obligations and all of these types of things of where the eﬃciencies lie. Certainly an organizational review is going on as well. But I wouldn't say it is an asset change. Certainly it could be some capital deployed to make things more eﬃcient in some manner.  But most of it is process -- pure process oriented, and then looking at spans of control, looking at organizational structure alignment with the new reality of where we are taking the business. But the big issue is to make sure whatever changes we make are sustainable for the future and with our long-term strategy in mind. That really gets us to a point where we can start to think about, as I said earlier, once we go through the steps that we've lined out in our long-term plan, to get to a point where we can eﬀectively optimize our asset mix to improve ROE."
"Okay. And then just on the asset mix side in terms of the unregulated side of the business, it seems like you are still comfortable keeping the longer term. Or is that subject to change if commodity prices are weaker or capacity prices are weaker?","I think our -- as I as we said previously, we are going to continue to grow this competitive business, but we are a regulated utility. And if we can make it look [ph] with long-term contracts, FERC [ph]-based contracts, and long-term retail contracts, all of those types of things that make it appear to be quasi-regulated in some fashion, either FERC [ph] regulated or otherwise, then --   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   and it makes sense to our shareholders to keep, we'll keep it. But I would say that we are going to continue to grow the business as if we are going to be in that business, and then we will make the ultimate determination when the time comes."
