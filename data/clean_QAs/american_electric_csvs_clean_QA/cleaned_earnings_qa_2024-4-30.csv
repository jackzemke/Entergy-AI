Question,Answer
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I just wanted to peel in maybe a little bit more on the data center point that you laid out there. And just wondering, we see a lot of forecasts out there on the timeline of how quick some want to come to market, and we're trying to ﬁgure out how that matches against the system's ability to provide the power there in the connects. And just wondering, how you see those two aligning? What does that mean for AEP over time versus plan? And just, how do you think about, I guess, structuring rates in the right way so that other rate payers don't bear more of a burden?","Yeah. Those are all really good questions, Jeremy. And our team has done a tremendous amount of work thinking this through. I mean, ﬁrst of all, I like to say, here at AEP that we're really wired for growth. And we -- as you know, we've been making signiﬁcant transmission investments over the years, and that's going to allow us, I think, to accommodate this ﬁrst wave of growth we're seeing from data centers. And so, in our next ﬁve years, you will see that load coming on, and you'll see some of the capital spend -- the incremental capital spend to support it.  As we get out further in the decade, I think it's going to be a function of an additional transmission and perhaps even generation that'll need to get built to meet it all. But I'm -- this team's working really hard. We have a great economic development team, very supportive business community in States. And we've done a lot of groundwork to put ourselves in this position. And you're also seeing, Jeremy, data center load ramp up at the same time. So, that's a natural trend, too.  Now, to your latter question, this is one I've been keenly focused on. And the good news is, we believe that the load growth that will be coming on will be fair to all customers, and in fact, will help us keep our rates aﬀordable across all of our jurisdictions. We are developing new tariﬀs. Tariﬀs that require longer-term commitments. Tariﬀs that require the data centers to deliver on the load expectations that we're building for, obviously, credit quality, et cetera. And when you do the math, that load growth then beneﬁts all customers. And that's what I'm really excited about. Because that was really important to myself and the team that we do keep rates aﬀordable, and this growth will do just that."
"Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just to dive in a little bit more. As we think about data center load sensitivity, should we be thinking that more along the lines of commercial sensitivity or industrial sensitivity as provided in your guidance if we think about demand outstripping forecast?","Go ahead, Chuck.     Yeah. So, I would think of a Jeremy more like an industrial customer and that sensitivity there.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then just the last one if I could is, it relates to the external CEO search. Just wondering it or has anything changed with regards to, I guess, the characteristics that are in focus for a candidate? How is the pool building at this point? Just wondering, if there's any other color that you might be able to share on how the process is going?","Well, I can just tell you that the attributes and the qualities we're looking for remain unchanged from what I described on the ﬁrst quarter call. We are well under the -- underway now. We've got some really good candidates, impressive candidates. It takes time to sort it all out, and there's other obviously things that we need to look at. But the timetable that I outlined for you just a couple months ago was 6 months to 12 months, so truncate two months oﬀ of that, and it's 4 months to 10 months. And -- but that said, we'll take as much time as we need to get the right person in place, and I'm very conﬁdent that we'll do just that."
"Got it. And actually, if I could just sneak one last one in. Just wondering on overall corporate strategy. Could you talk more about where things stand for AEP decentralization eﬀorts? And looking to kind of more closely align P&L to the end decision maker at the local levels, just wondering how that's progressing?","Well, I think it's -- this is a focus of ours. And one of the -- and I'm going to turn it over to Peggy. She's developing -- has developed a detailed plan. But one of the things we want to do is put those local resources in our communities. And I know that's the right thing to do, just talking to stakeholders. It costs money to do that, which is one of the reasons why we did the voluntary severance so we can free up some of those resources going forward to make those critical investments in our communities.  Peggy, I don't know if you want to add anything.     Ben, I think you pretty much covered. We have worked with the team and looking at how we can get some more of those -- enhance the resources from a regulatory and legislative perspective. Having more boots on the ground. As I mentioned in my opening statements, there's a lot of change in our industry and having folks out there having these ongoing conversations is really important. So, we're working through that process and more to come on that topic."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. Thank you for that. I'll leave it there.,"All right. Thank you. Have a good day.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.     Hey, Steve."
"Hey. Good morning, Ben. Thanks. So, just in Ohio and Texas, your wires company, but in Indiana were these last two announcement. I think you've got generation two. And are you -- so, in some of these recent deals that announced the past week, are you supplying the generation as well? And is there going to be a generation need in Indiana related to those?","Well, we do have RFPs outstanding. Peggy, do you want to take that?     Yeah. We do have RFPs outstanding in I&M. But to answer your question, yes, in our Vertically Integrated, like Indiana, we will have to serve the generation component. And we are working with those large loads that are coming to us on what that would look like, and we are also focused on, as Ben mentioned earlier, redeﬁning and looking at our tariﬀs as well. So, that will be part of our strategy."
"Okay. And just to kind of clarify back to the initial question. So, the transmission grid is built up and has capacity to take on these customers near-term. But is there still -- even near-term, is there more capital needed or is it more this -- after this ﬁve years?","No, Steve, there will be more capital needed. But I don't think it will be those massive 765 lines that can take a long time to get built. We believe the team has done a lot of work on how we could accommodate that load within our footprint, working with PGM and others. And so, yeah, no, there will be more spend but it will be manageable and doable to the point."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. And then on the FFO to debt, you're in the target range now. Is there anything about that that's kind of -- are you in there for good do you think now? Is there any -- was there any timing reason? Or is it you're in that and expect to be in it throughout the year?","Steve, we're in the range. We expect to be in that range now. Our forecast that we review internally and with the agencies show us, being in that range. So that's the plan, and we plan to defend that."
"Hi. It's actually Jamieson Ward on for Shar. He's on the road and regrets that he's not able to join you today, but we have a couple questions for you here. The ﬁrst was just on the annual customer bill increase, the pace there. You reduced it to 3% increases per year through 2028, which is great to see. Does that already take into account the anticipated infrastructure investment needed to support any future data center growth? Or could we see that number be revised as well?","Well, I mean, the answer is, the incremental stuﬀ we're talking about and the incremental transmission investment, it's not included in that, but it's not going to be -- it's not going to drive that from 3% to 4%. If anything, it should level -- keep it level and perhaps even drop it a bit. Obviously, there's other things that go into that, other inﬂationary factors, supply chain pressures, et cetera. But as I mentioned, this -- we've done a lot of work making sure that the incremental investment that we would need to make over the forecast ﬁve-year timeframe is actually at a level that is accretive, if you will, to keeping customer rates aﬀordable. And that's why I'm very conﬁdent of moving forward with it."
"Got it. Terriﬁc. Thank you for that. And then expanding on Jeremy's earlier question, how are you approaching some of the more unique issues presented by data centers? For example, those who want to be behind the meter but still want to have an emergency tariﬀ with the utility   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   or data centers, which as you mentioned, want to socialize the cost of interconnection through all rate classes but which may not have a major economic impact. If we can just get a bit more detail there, that would be helpful.","I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second, but listen, it's got to be fair to all customers now, okay? I mean, this is a big deal. It's an exciting big deal, but growth needs to be as close to self- funded as possible. And that's what I think we'll get with these tariﬀs and some of the other analysis that we're looking at.     Yeah. So, what I would add to Ben's comment there is that, on our tariﬀs, we are looking at what minimum demands are. Most of the large loads are wanting to be connected to the system, but if they want some form of self-generation, we are asking so that we understand that and we can include that as part of our planning. So, we're trying to get all of that information on the front end so that we can appropriately serve customers and make sure that it's fair and balanced for all customers, and everyone's paying their fair share, as Ben has mentioned.     Yeah. I mean, the worst-case scenario, and this is what -- to Peggy's point, what we're preventing is, the load doesn't show up consistent with how we built the infrastructure. And when it does show up, it doesn't use, especially on a peak basis, the energy that we built for. So -- and -- but if you control that, which by the way, I think we also have to be very careful too that these large, large loads are don't are -- don't jeopardize grid reliability. And so, these tariﬀs address that, too. If you do all those things, then growth is good for all, and that's what we're pushing for."
"Thank you. That's very clear. And then, on the updated load growth forecast coming later this year, should we assume that at a high level that means EEI? Or are there particular IRPs or other proceedings that we should maybe watch out for, which could come say before EEI, that would be driving that?","I mean, I think the big update will come -- well, I understand EEI in the third quarter's earnings call right on the same. But it would either come on the third quarter or EEI unless -- there might be drips and drabs that get released before that. But that's what we're planning to do right now."
"Understood. Got you. Last question from us is just on asset sales. In the deck, you mentioned remaining committed to simplifying the business in the immediate term with a focus on continued execution of the sale processes. So, how should we think about the potential for any   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   additional sales announcements following the conclusion in the second quarter of the current process for the retail and distributed resources businesses? And that's it for me.","It would be on an opportunistic basis. We're going to look at -- we're always open to ideas. Chuck and I and the team have been around a while. We know that sometimes good ideas sound good on paper, but you can't execute on them. So, we do ﬁlter that through the regulatory screening process, as you can imagine.  And then, we like our assets, so obviously the price has to be right. But what you're not going to see from us is like strategic review too and pre-announced kind of things that we're looking at. If the opportunity arises and we can execute on it, then you'll hear about it. But in the meantime, our status quo plan, I think, is a pretty darn good plan. And to the extent that we issue equity to fund additional incremental CapEx, this is going to be smart CapEx, good growth for all. And we'll keep our balance sheet strong, which I think is so important as you enter, I think, an extended era of higher CapEx growth."
"Thanks for taking the questions today. Maybe just going back to the balance sheet. As you think about your ﬁnancing needs for the remainder of the year, can you just give us an update there? And if you expect to see any impacts relative to your initial plan with the moves that we've seen in rates year to date?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. Hi, Carly. The plan that we laid out laid out at EDI is still intact. Other than I think at EDI, we had the West Virginia securitization in the plan, and that has been replaced by a Kentucky securitization nearly of equal amounts. So, the plan is still intact, there's been no signiﬁcant changes and we're proceeding on that plan."
"Great. Thank you for that. And then just going back to the commercial load and data centers. As you think about that and the expectation to raise later this year, could you just talk a little bit about sort of what surprised the plan to the upside so materially thus far? Is it just sort of more success on the economic development front or more consumption from existing customers? Just any color on that would be helpful.","Yeah. Carly, it just mainly the ramp rates of the customers that have hooked up have come on more rapidly than we anticipated. And so, that's why you're seeing those big bumps in commercial load as we go through the quarters here."
"Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions today. I'll try to keep it to two. So, I guess, you talked about this need for growth equity. Can you just elaborate when you anticipate needing that and what part of this ﬁve-year plan would that be?  And then, I guess just -- you do have $700 million to $800 million, I think, a year in your ﬁnancing walk here of equity needs. Just why not do something sooner than later to kind of knock that out if the opportunity presents itself? I know you don't want to pre-announce and go into a strategic review round two like you said, but maybe you can kind of give us some additional thoughts on how you're thinking about that.","Well, I'll turn it over to my esteemed colleague here, Chuck. Yeah.     No, Nick it's a good question. I mean, look, as we said earlier, right, we're formulating, right, the changes to our plan and how ultimately, right, how ﬁnancing is going to aﬀect that. You are   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   right, we have $400 million in equity this year followed by $800 million in equal amounts in the following two years.  So, I think the point that we -- I tried to make earlier on FFO to debt, look, we're going to defend our BBB credit, right? We're going to maintain a long strong balance sheet. So, as we put out additional capital forecast, I think you could assume, right, that, that strong balance sheet is going to remain intact. So, just kind of wait for that update on CapEx and you should be able to ﬁgure that out pretty clearly."
"Okay. I appreciate that. And then, Chuck, I know that, whether a VIU is kind of a $0.10 drag versus normal, but you also had some of these tax items in there as well. Just on the tax item beneﬁts, is that normalizing from last year or is that one time in nature as we kind of think about year-over-year into '25?","Yeah. So, Jeremy, about half of that will normalize throughout the year, and the other half is a one-time, things that happen in '23 that won't happen again in '24, so it's a true increase."
"Hey, good morning, Ben. Great talking to you after a while now. Hey, let's just -- I wanted to go back on your commentary, Ben, on portfolio optimization, new ﬁnancing plan. Just to be clear, the ﬁnancing plan, the CapEx updates, the load board updates, is that sort of -- should we think of that as a separate process and the CEO search? I'm just thinking about the two, and are those two, independent processes that we should think about or are they somehow tied? I'm thinking about the cadence of your updates, your new plan, and then the parallel CEO search.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I mean, if I understand your question right, are we holding things back until the new CEO gets in place? Is that what you mean?"
"You did. Thank you very much. That's exactly what I wanted to ask you, and a very clear response. Thank you. And then, second question, Ben, again, like you mentioned, challenging the EPA proposed ruling. Maybe can you share a little bit more color there? Is it the carbon capture technology that you were referring to? And then you mentioned the accelerated plant retirements, was that directed towards coal? Just any color you can share there. Thank you.","Yeah. Well, it's a great question. And again, I harken back to Steve Fleischman's report that came out a couple months ago where he talked about our industry, which if you aggregate market cap is somewhere around $0.5 trillion, being responsible for this -- we want to onshore data centers, artiﬁcial intelligence, reshoring and manufacturing. And it's our industry that has to do it. We're going to build all the transmission we possibly can. That's not easy to get built either, but we are going to have to plug into something.  And as you know, in my former role, I'm a big advocate for renewable energy. I think it's great, particularly when it's economic. Now, some of that changes over time and regionally. But to think that we don't need dispatchable generation, I mean, it's -- we need it. And I'd love to see things like SMRs and other things develop, but they're not going to happen overnight. And meanwhile, we can't -- we have to be willing to move forward realistically.  And yeah, it's not just the carbon capture rules. I mean, there's -- we're looking at all the other rules, the CCR rules, the ELG rules, which -- by the way, we just spent a lot of money coming into compliance on that, and that was only a couple years ago. And now it's a completely diﬀerent   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   rule -- role, which would require diﬀerent technology. So, it's -- our industry has come so far in carbon reduction, and I think we're willing to do so much more, but it has to be with aﬀordability, reliability, and resiliency in mind. And I'm just -- I'm really passionate about that. And you never like to have to sue, but we're going to do what we have to do to defend our grid and our customers that use that grid every single day."
That's great. I appreciate you giving me time today. Thank you again.,Thank you.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open.     Good morning.
"Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Excuse me. Two quick ones here, please. First, to elaborate on the commentary on load growth, Ben, I think you mentioned an incremental 10 gigawatts to 15 gigawatts by the end of the decade. I assume that's across the entire portfolio. Can you talk a bit about the Vertically Integrated Utilities? You have about 20 gigawatts identiﬁed through the current IRPs. My question is, how soon might we see more ﬁlings to include the new expected load, which there's no doubt coming quickly?","Yeah. So, when I look at those incremental loads, I mean, Ohio, within the PJM footprint, Ohio is the biggest driver of it. Although, Indiana is deﬁnitely getting its share, and I suspect we will have to do incremental RFPs to capture that load. I can't give you the exact timing of when that would be.     We have -- so, Indiana -- well, we have an IRP that's coming up, that's going to be later in November. But -- so, that will be part of the process as we start to look at how we accommodate some of this load as we start to see it to come on as well. We'll be using those same types of process.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And just maybe outside of data centers, if you look down at SPP, that's a very constrained region, as it is right now. And they haven't seen a tremendous amount of data center growth to date, it doesn't mean they won't. But in the meantime, we've got to make sure we've got adequate load to serve the load that we do know we have.  In Ohio -- again, we don't have generation in Ohio. So, the incremental investment will be transmission. There's a lot of talk here in Ohio and the business community at the state level, do regulated utilities need to be back in the generation game? I don't know. I think -- honestly, I think that would take legislation, at least from our perspective, so that we'd be assured of good recovery and potentially any kind of stranded cost risk because we've seen that play out before. It doesn't mean we're not -- we wouldn't be open to it but it would probably require legislation. ERCOT, we don't own generation. But we would obviously need to be building a lot of transmission and ultimately needing something to plug into."
"Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And one quick one on the voluntary separation program. Would there be any kind of meaningful one-time cash outﬂow associated with that? And if so, how would you ﬁnance it?","Yeah. I think the -- so, it would go into eﬀect mid-year, July 1st. And so, the annual savings that we would see this year would just about oﬀset the severance cost. And then, of course, then on an annualized basis, '25 and beyond would beneﬁt from that.  And again, this is about --"
Thank you so much.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Ryan Levine with Citi. Your line is open.,Good morning.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Good morning. On rate design for data center load, what duration commitments and load ramps are you assuming or looking for to help protect residential customers? Any diﬀerences on rate design between jurisdictions to call out? Any color is appreciated.","Yeah. So, I'll take that. Thank you for the question. I mean, generally, we need to -- we're -- we would have to be building long-term assets, so we need some commitments that are longer in nature. So, I mean, you would think somewhere around the 10-plus, 15-plus year range but we're working through that process now."
"Thank you. And then in the prepared remarks, you're signaling higher load and potential new investments. In terms of funding that potential new investments in the back half or outside of plan, any -- how are you thinking about what tools are most advantageous to execute on that potential opportunity?","Well, as Ben mentioned, we would consider everything. Everything's on the table. But I think the underlying tenant is that, we will defend our BBB credits."
"Hey. Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the one-time gain associated with the PLR rulings that you got or the letters that you got. What's the ongoing impact of that? And could you just elaborate a little bit more on -- I did read the 10-Q and that section of it, but I just wanted to make sure I fully understood it.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Paul. So, that standalone rate-making for tax purposes has really been on our radar for some time now. It really kind of results from some of our aﬃliates today generate taxable income and others generate tax losses, which has really kind of created the issue for us. And really kind of compounding that is our signiﬁcant capital program over the last ﬁve years, as well as bonus depreciation has extended that dynamic. So, we were concerned that if we did not address that we may have a normalization issue. So, we asked the IRS for a private letter ruling.  Interestingly, some of our jurisdictions support the standalone approach, either in legislation or in their own rate-making, and other utilities also endorse and use the standalone approach as well. So, we received the PLRs in the ﬁrst quarter, and the PLR is really kind of boiled down four key facts. One is the standalone NOL must be included in a rate base. The second, which addressed the gain in our adjustment from GAAP to operating is that the NOL must be included in the calculation of excess ADIT. So, that would reduce the overall regulatory liability for excess ADIT, which, of course, was created due to tax reform.  And then, any adjustment to oﬀset the NOL would constitute a normalization violation. So, we took corrective action. We're glad that we did, to avoid a normalization violation. And our plan now is to work with regulators to make the appropriate adjustments to rates, so that we can include that going forward."
"Okay. So, that should be a positive going forward assuming the regulators agree.","Once we're able to go through our jurisdictions and get it into rates, yes."
"Okay. And then, just with respect to transmission, FERC has some stuﬀ coming out in a few weeks. And I was wondering if you had any idea about -- if you know what I'm talking about, it's the planning and what have you sort of long-awaited reforms. Do you guys have any sense as to what we might see there?  And then, sort of a related question on grid enhancement technologies, do you -- how do you see those playing with your large transmission system? Just any thoughts you have with respect   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   to that.","Yeah. As far as the planning, I am told from our experts, in-house experts, that we don't anticipate it having much of an impact on us. The grid enhancing technologies, I'm not quite sure about that one.     So, we do use grid enhancing technologies. And as it relates to the planning information at FERC, I mean, our team has been very involved in it. I mean, I think they're looking at longer planning horizons and things of that nature. So, our team's been at the table the whole time, working with FERC on those."
