Question,Answer
"Brian, a couple questions for you. First, I was modestly distracted when you mentioned that you've made -- you're making a reduction in expenses due to change in beneﬁt costs. That was a prospective savings of how much?",It's going to be a credit for us to cost of about $53 million.
"Okay, thank you. And then you said parent interest expense would be mostly tax deductible. Which means it's not completely tax deductible. Can you elaborate on why you chose that language?","Yeah, Greg. So the IRS hasn't written rules yet, but we think what's allowed for in the tax law is that parent company interest expense can be allocated to both our regulated properties and to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   our competitive businesses. In the regulated properties, they will be fully deductible, in our competitive properties, we'll have signiﬁcant EBITDA to be able to deduct that as well.  What would be left behind will be a very small portion, which will be allocable to the parent which doesn't have signiﬁcant EBITDA associated with it and that's the small portion that will not be, that we think will not be deductable."
Can you quantify for us at this time a range of dollars in terms of debt that you think will not qualify?,About $1 million tax eﬀective.
"Fair enough. Now you've disclosed it. Thank you. The -- did you, did you say that the major factor that drove industrial demand up in the fourth quarter was the these two co-gen facilities shutting down and taking demand from you and so that's why that you don't consider that an ongoing sort of trajectory of demand?","No, that was a small portion of it, we think the larger portion of it was really the broad growth across most of our -- most of our industrial sectors."
So why are you sort of reverting to a very low sort of expected demand growth forecast in 2018? Does that have a function of conservatism or are you fairly conﬁdent you're seeing things in the Q4 data that were not permanent?,"It's that small portion that was associated with the co-gens that's not permanent and again we don't want to, we don't want to overstate the industrial growth because of that portion and as we look forward and forecast the full year 2018, we look at what we think are expansions, we   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   look at what we think the growth rate is, and we think we've got that forecasted appropriately with the essentially ﬂat that we're estimating for industrial in 2018."
"Okay. My last question, and I'll cede the ﬂoor. It looks to me that the ALJ position in Oklahoma which looks incredibly conﬁscatory to me as well is sort of a -- as much as an $0.08 or $0.09 swing in the expected earnings versus what you asked for in the case, now that would be well within the range of guidance you gave for 2018.  So is it fair that even though there is a fairly large swing in outcomes there that that you -- you reiterate your guidance because you're still comfortable you can be in there, and then the second question is what's your recourse to Oklahoma if they in fact other than just pulling capital out of the state or selling the company then if indeed the ALJ decision is comes down as approved as rendered?","Greg, certainly our guidance that we've given, we're very comfortable with that guidance that we've given, so and one, and actually Oklahoma is one of our smaller jurisdictions. So, but that being said, we still expect a good outcome in Oklahoma and on your second point, I think when you go in one case, which was our previous case, and you're looking to repair the balance sheet and make sure that PSO is moving forward in a positive fashion from an investment standpoint, we pulled several $100 million of investment out of Oklahoma after that last rate case.  And in the present rate case, to have an ALJ recommendation, that's not helpful at all in terms of, in terms of continuing the recovery of PSO. If the Commission follow suit with that, that's just another really bad message about investment in Oklahoma.  We have other places to put our capital, we have plenty of places to put our capital, and so Oklahoma would wind up being sort of in the red area like Kentucky was, and so -- and that's something we take very seriously, because we want to make investment in Oklahoma, it's a well run utility as I said earlier when you look at the performance of PSO in relation to its customers and the rate-making and everything it doesn't deserve the ROE recommendation and it doesn't deserve the outcomes that we're getting in Oklahoma.  So we have to look at that and see what the broad view is now, there again, it is an ALJ recommendation and the Commission itself will be making the determination and we're certainly hopeful that those adjustment will be made and that's what we expect to happen.  So and you brought up the issues of what the responses could be obviously we could pull capital out of Oklahoma, we could look at strategic options for Oklahoma, but that's really -- let's don't get there yet because we're going to let the commission speak on this and I really believe that the commissions will be responsive. So let's just wait and see what that order looks like.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Good , thank you. And thanks for all the clarity that you've given this morning. One question on -- can you give us just some sort of sense of where you think the rate base ﬁrst ﬂow-out [ph] and once you get out to 2020 checks out versus the -- I think you had 13.1 as the forecast at EEI.",What we've previously shown you at EEI was a CAGR for that over the '18 to '20 period of about 8%. We anticipate it will be about 9%.
"And then -- so that I was going to I mean you have, you're now talking about mid-teens as your FFO to debt target. I think one of the slides for me was sort of mid to high teens, is it, can you give us a sort of hundreds of basis points so the net eﬀect of what you think is going to happen to that metric?","Yes, so Jonathan, remember, we were showing in the upper teens back then when people were saying to us hey you need to consume more of that balance sheet capacity and grow more than what you're showing and what we always said to people back then was, hey, we anticipate being a signiﬁcant tax payer around 2020 and that's going to consume some of that balance sheet and drop us from the high teens into the mid teens.  We are now anticipating bottoming out in the 14% FFO to debt range before we start climbing again.     And I will just add on to that. I think it's probably a testament to the sound ﬁnancial condition of what, what Brian and the team has been doing for this organization to be able to absorb the tax reform implications without issuing additional equity, I mean in essence what we're doing is trading FFO to debt and that ability to carry that against not having to issue equity. So it's a positive outcome for our shareholders."
"Absolutely. We just wanted to get behind that -- what's in those numbers. And then just, just ﬁnally, as we look at the -- try to compare the CapEx, when your take in the 500 million out of the 2020 number, it looks like you've got some moving parts in there, the corporate pieces are - - I was just curious what's behind that and some of the other moving parts in the CapEx forecast?","It's really going to be across the breadth of our businesses. The transmission will be a bit of that, environmental will be a piece of that, contracted renewables will be a small piece of that, it will marginally spread across our business, but our interest in terms of how we allocate capital, transmission is still a preferred place for us to put capital, distribution in the wire side is still a preferred place for us to put capital. And there'll be small portions associated with competitive renewables and some portion still associated with environmental at our generation.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So largely spread across our businesses, but our preference for this from where we put capital to work will remain the same."
"Okay, and then just ﬁnally, do you, is -- do you see this as pretty sad or is there a chance that the numbers shift around a bit depending on how your conversations with states go which you're obviously saying as sort of in-process.","Right. So clearly that portion about how we allocate the excess deferred income tax back to our customers is something that's in play and since it's in play across 11 jurisdictions, all of which may have diﬀerent interests, that's something that we will ﬁrm up over time.  We don't anticipate there to be a strategic change in our numbers that would have our capital and ﬁnancing plans change materially.     Unless of course we get Wind Catcher.     Well, Wind Catcher, of course, is a big change -- I was answering the question in regards to the tax reform, Wind Catcher is a big change and that would clearly require us to come back out to you and explain how we're going to ﬁnance that."
And is the assumption that Wind Catcher would displace other things or is it partially incremental or -- just can you remind us how we should think about that?,"Jonathan, it's a $4.5 billion project, so I mean that is a signiﬁcant change to what we've talked about in our capital and ﬁnancing plans. So, we'd need to come out to you and tell you a complete story about what Wind Catcher means, when we get approvals and when we decide to go forward with that project."
"Yeah. Hey, good morning. So, couple of questions. Just ﬁrst on the Wind Catcher, you had talked about kind of making decision by maybe March, April I think, is that still the rough timeline you think?","Yeah, I think the schedules are still moving toward April, we had like a 2-week delay in Texas, for the tax reform implications -- but the other jurisdictions are pretty well, pretty well stayed intact. So we'll still look at the same time frame and really we need to make sure that we get those kinds of responses, so that we can make decisions about certainly about the other commitments relative to the project and so --"
"Okay. And then just -- yeah, in terms of just your conviction level on, I mean it seems like the recommendations so far have generally not been that good in any of the states or maybe one of those, so I'm just -- but you did talk about maybe some settlement talks in certain states, maybe you could talk about which ones are able and why you'd be convicted you can still get this moving forward?","Yeah, so and many of these recommended rejections have been caveated [ph] with -- okay, well, if you do move forward we need these kinds of -- these kinds of protections in place and that really tends to be the center of the discussion and the center of the testimony, and the other thing is, these cases -- and you are -- you probably read the transcripts like I do, I get irritated with the transcripts at the time. Because, it's really arguments on the fringes and a lot more discussion needs to be had about the beneﬁts of the project and the beneﬁts of the hedge and that kind of thing.  But you argue on the fringes and lot of its risk adjustments associated with the project that allow for customer protections to be in place relative to the project beneﬁts and we're certainly encouraging that all intervenors proposed what they want to approve -- get approved -- there is obviously as we go through the discussions with the interveners, it's important for us to be able to have those discussions, wherever we can and certainly, we'll have in those discussions and certainly with Oklahoma and in Texas those discussions continue.  I can't really talk about the content of those discussions because obviously they are conﬁdential, but again we've made additional guarantees and rebuttal testimony, we put that out as a framework for those customer protection type of mechanisms and you might suspect, that's where the dialog is centered.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Okay. But Oklahoma is one of the states where you might have discussions as you said.,"Yeah. And that's really where the framework originated in the rebuttal testimony and -- and like I said it's in a critical part of the Wind Catcher timeline, when you're in this timeframe, with the testimony done and being able to have those kinds of discussions.  So, and as far as conﬁdence level is concerned, I'm still very happy with the way this project looks and even with tax reform because lot of times it gets hung up with what we call our ultra- low gas case and it's not really even a gas case, it was really made up, we took our low gas case and we stress tested the project at 50% of whatever those gas causes far or less than NYMEX is now.  And so -- that's why I say a lot of the arguments are on the fringes, talking about things that really haven't happened. So if we can just get the dialog to where it's a reasonable top of discussion, then we'll be in good shape. I testiﬁed in the case in Oklahoma in the 90s, there was a rail spur in the northeastern and the commission, the Oklahoma Commission approved that, but -- and we got capital recovery on the project, but it beneﬁted in terms of fuel costs .  This is no diﬀerent. As a matter of fact, we got more customer protection mechanisms in a rebuttal than we ever had anything like that, so when you -- when you look at what's going on in this case, we have stepped up to provide answers to the concerns that the intervenors have had and again caveated by -- they had certainly recommend rejection, but at the same time, they said, okay, let's work on these customer protection mechanisms, that's what we've done."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good, thank you very much. So maybe -- good. Let me follow up on Steve's question just a quick bit, because I want to understand a little bit around the compartmentalization of Wind Catcher and to the extent to which, that we should one piece or another follow ways as part of the approval process.  Can you ultimately move forward this under smaller context or perhaps just on in the Wind or the transmission piece? Just want to kind of frame the risk of the project moving forward, again, as you work through the settlement.  And obviously, I don't want necessarily prejudge anything with respect to the settlements either, I obviously heard what you just said.","I'm with you on that, let's don't prejudge it, but I would say that we're certainly expecting all of the states to give approval to it, you can't really resize this project, the beneﬁts of this project is its size, it's proximity, where it's located in Western Oklahoma with high capacity factor wind, and with the transmissions sized accordingly to serve that capacity, I think you're getting maximum beneﬁt in terms of the value proposition to customers.  So, and I'll have to say, we just have to look and see what outcomes we're expecting all states to approve it, if all states don't approve it, then we'll just have to look at the time because I think there may be other takers out there that might be interested, so we'll see.  So, but I really think that as we go forward, it will be pretty important for us to take a hard look at that project and understanding the beneﬁts of that project, we'll make a determination whether we'll move forward or not based upon the way the jurisdictions respond.  And that's really probably all we need to say at this point because, we want to make sure this project moves ahead. Now that being said, I will say that we are not going to move forward with a project that we don't feel like is beneﬁcial to not only to our customers, obviously, it's beneﬁcial to our customers, but our shareholders have to beneﬁt as well.  And we have a lot of places we can put our capital and we just need to make sure this is done. As I mentioned earlier in my opening, the allocation of capital is going to be extremely important for us, to focus in, and prioritize our investments to ensure we meet our ﬁnancial objectives and Wind Catcher is only a part of that, it's actually it's incremental to the entire plan that we have today.  And we're going to make sure it stands on its own merits. So, that being said, I'm still conﬁdent."
"Got it. Excellent, going back to a little bit more detail on the prior conversation around the impact of tax reform and slowing that back into the state regulatory commission processes. Can you give us a little bit of a sense on how you're thinking about that across the various states?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I mean is there a number of ways that you could presumably approach this in terms of both addressing perhaps unrecovered items, accelerating investment, returning beneﬁts to customer -- some of the beneﬁts to customers, etcetera. Do you -- maybe a little bit of a ﬂavor as you think about the various states?","Yes, it's an all-of-the-above type of thing, because state jurisdictions are going to look at it diﬀerently based upon their own individual situations. Kentucky already took advantage of part of it. We also have areas where we can accelerate depreciation or adjust plant balances or those types of things, so I think it's particularly important for us to be mindful of where each individual jurisdiction, where the touch points are, and be able to address that.  Now, I think that obviously lowering rates to customers is a critical component of this, but at the same time there are distinct opportunities that we've had discussions with commissions about previously that we could take advantage of and really have a real positive outcome for not only the customers but also in terms of ensuring that we're moving ahead in a positive way, whether that's capital investment to focus on the customer experience, whether it's certainly things we can do with plant balances to accelerate depreciation and so forth.  So all those are things to be discussed, and we'll have -- I really believe we'll have reasonable outcomes from a commission perspective, and we'll go forward."
"Good morning. So just on tax reform, wanted to dig into one other topic on it. We were looking at your EEI slides and the drop relative to that in your cash ﬂows from operations for '18 and '19 is about 700 million and 800 million, wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving that drop? Is it one of the bonus depreciation to makers, is it the revenue requirement coming down? Just wanted to understand what are the buckets that are driving it, and if there are any that can move as a result of all the negotiations that you're talking about right now.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Look the part that moves as a part of the negotiations is really the 1 billion or so of excess ADIT, and what we've shown in the slide in the deck on Page 36 is what we believe is a conservative allotment of that. I'm not going to go into what it is speciﬁcally, but we believe we've been conservative as to what that excess ADIT ﬂow-back will be.  Everything else, the numbers kind of work out the way they work out. Of course, we're going to be a lower taxpayer than what we thought, we're going to have PTCs and investment tax credits included in those numbers that will also impact making us much less of a taxpayer than we were, but in terms of risk, it's about $1 billion of excess ADIT, and as Nick was describing, it's -- there are going to be thoughtful negotiations going on across all of our jurisdictions as to what's the best way to have that -- have an impact for our customers."
"Got it, so from a rating agency perspective, the drop -- given you had a cushion, I guess, going in, in terms of your FFO to debt, there is not a requirement to do anything at the back end given your metrics are improving by the back end, and you already had cushion, is that the way to think about the FFO to debt going forward?","That's right. Praful, we were starting in a position of strength relative to our credit metrics against our ratings, and the reason we were in that position of strength was we anticipated being taxpayers in 2020 and we described that to rating agencies and investors. People understood that those metrics were going to deteriorate over time, but still stay within the metrics that are appropriate for our current ratings.  Now that we're not going to be a big taxpayer but our cash metrics are going to come in line with our ratings over time, and we don't think that will be an issue for the rating agencies and we don't think it will have an impact on our ratings."
"Got you, fair enough. And then ﬁnally just in terms of load growth, again at the EEI deck you had load growth of, I think for 2018, 0.7%, which is now down to 0.2% for 2018. I know you touched on this earlier as well with, I think, Greg's question, but just wanted to get any more color on what led to the drop in '18, anything we should be focused on, and is that '18 number more of a steady state, do you think?","Yes, so our numbers for '18 essentially stayed the same. The fourth quarter of '17 came in stronger than what we thought it was going to be, so the adjustment means less of an increase in '18 even though our numbers in '18 stayed about the same. Does that make sense?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      It's just a (Multiple Speakers) point of reference."
Yeah. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it.,"Thanks, Praful.  Operator  Next, we'll go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Your line is open.     Good morning, Christopher."
"Good morning, Brian and Nick. I wanted to see if you guys were prepared to clarify the 5% to 7% growth, my understanding is previously it was oﬀ a 3.65 base in 2017 and went through 2019. Is that the same way that we should think about it now?","I think we had given detail around that going out even a year farther than that, but we don't anticipate any change to that in even years beyond that. So we see a runway for that out as far as we can see in our forecast. We've given detail around that out through 2020."
"In 2020 at least, could we consider 5% to 7% to be an annual growth rate as opposed to a CAGR oﬀ of previous base.","It's an earnings growth rate, Christopher. So say it's oﬀ 3.65, as we go forward we don't see that changing as '16 came in more or less than what we had forecasted."
"Okay, fair enough. And then there is a lot of jurisdictions here to deal with as it relates to tax reform, and a couple of previous questions have touched on this already, but we have you guys   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   reiterating the 5 % to 7% long term rate, we also have a $700 million to $800 million decrease in your forecasted operating cash ﬂow versus EEI, as would be expected here.  Is it fair to characterize your assumptions as they relate to tax reform as conservative as they pertain both to the DTL revaluation as well as just the refund considerations to customers themselves?","Yes, so let me clarify that a little bit. We do assume that we are going to the lower tax rate from the 35% down to 21%, and that that will be a fairly direct pass-through to our customers in terms of rate since that 35% was baked into our rates and now 21% will be, so we view that as not being an earnings issue. Similarly with the excess ADIT issue -- it's a matter of how do we ﬂow that cash back to our customers and over what period of time.  In 1986, it ranged from two years, I think, to 20 years depending on jurisdiction, and I think we'll have an equally large spread of jurisdictions depending on each jurisdiction's particular interest, so both of those we have reﬂected in our numbers, but both of those tend not to be earnings issues, they tend to be, as you were pointing out, cash issues."
"Okay. And just on that front to hit the 5% to 7% growth rate, because cash will eventually impact earnings at some point, you don't need to hit any certain targets in certain jurisdictions to delay that refund or get some kind of reg asset taken oﬀ your balance sheet or anything. Do you feel that you could reach that level with the refunds happening essentially right away?","Well, again, we did not assume right away. We certainly don't assume day one, ﬂow backs and we don't think that would be a reasonable answer for jurisdictions to ask from us. We've built this ADIT balances up over the last 10 or so years and a ﬂow back period that is in that time range we think would be reasonable or a ﬂow back that would be associated with the life of an asset would be reasonable.  So it wouldn't make any sense for the regulatory commissions to ask for all the cash back immediately because then that would impact the credit metrics of each individual entity and historically it hasn't been dealt with that way, I mean back in the '80s when this occurred, it was amortized over time and we would only expect the same thing this time around."
"Okay, I didn't necessarily mean just with the deferred tax liability going back on that, just the lower tax rate itself.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, so we assume that ﬂows through to customers pretty directly.     And the other thing I just want to reiterate too is that through all this, if there is any question of the 5 to 7% growth rate being in jeopardy in some fashion, that's just not the case. We're looking at the 5% to 7% growth rate just like we looked at it before, and luckily -- well, not just luckily, but certainly we're in the enviable position to be able to adjust to tax reform and still conﬁdently talk about our 5% to 7% growth rate."
"Nick or Brian, on the Wind Catcher project, there had been some rumblings in the past that maybe a competing transmission line may complicate the overall project. Can you talk to that -- is that a concern?","Yeah. We don't see that. I mean, other projects will have to stand on their own merits, just like our project. Our project is unique in that it does originate in western Oklahoma high capacity wind, but we also terminate it at where the load is in our territory, and that's toward Tulsa.  So, I mean, I think the other projects have diﬀerent routings and diﬀerent assumptions associated with them and congestion associated with them, diﬀerent assumptions entirely. And so there may be opportunities to look at right-of-ways and some element of consistency, but other than that, though, there is really -- they're just diﬀerent.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   They're originating diﬀerent, the takers are diﬀerent, and so I would say there's plenty of wind in Oklahoma, there's plenty of opportunity for development, and there's plenty of ability to continue to move that process forward. The pie is big enough for more than our particular transaction, so more power to them, but more power to us as well."
"50%? Okay. And last question, Brian, just a clariﬁcation, so the 5% to 7% growth rate, you are still basing that oﬀ an implied 3.65 number for '17, and I heard you say it will go beyond 2020 as well. But again, should we assume that's kind of an annual growth, or we should again assume it's cumulative and could move around within years?","It's a growth rate. It will move around within years, but the growth rate is 5% to 7%."
"Good morning. Thanks for all the disclosure, it's been helpful. Most of my questions have been addressed. I guess just stepping back at a high level and thinking about your growth drivers and I do see a couple positives. I guess the rate base CAGR is going up, you've had some good results on the pension side as well, and I know you have to raise your debt ﬁnancing a bit, but that's certainly an accretive use of money in terms of where -- the rate base CAGR.  So I guess I see a few positives -- you know, Oklahoma is an unknown and certainly potentially concerning, but I respect your perspective on that. But are there other sort of at a very big picture drivers -- I guess there is often confusion between cash and GAAP and real earnings power here.  I just want to make sure I'm thinking about high level drivers correctly.","Stephen, you're thinking about it right. When we talk about 5% to 7% growth rate, we're basing that oﬀ an increase in net plant and then getting that reﬂected in rates, and even at EEI we talked about there being somewhat of a lag associated with the investment we've put into place and then having that reﬂected in rates.  That's least in our transmission business because of the formula-based annual true-ups that they have in the rate base. But really, that 5% to 7% growth rate is based on our continuing to put investment in the ground for the beneﬁt of our customers than getting that reﬂected in rates, and that has -- what we've been able to do even with what's happened with bonus depreciation, with the reduction in the ADIT and the reduction in cash ﬂows, we've still been able to keep that investment essentially unchanged.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We change at $500 million in the third year of our forecast, but by being able to keep that investment essentially the same, that allows us to stay in that growth range.     I think you have to look at the overall message of AEP has been consistent for years now, but it continues to even be augmented beyond that. This is a very, very solid, ﬁnancially sound utility that is doing smart things for our customers and working with our jurisdictions, but it's obviously accentuated by the largest transmission system in the country and the fact that we are making our own version of an adjustment in the ﬂeet itself, and that's why you have the Wind Catcher as you have other wind power projects, you're having other transitions occur from a resource standpoint.  And so the augmentation of that along with what's going on, on the distribution side -- you know, we talked about $500 million of additional incremental investments to be made in distribution on grid modernization that's not in the plan, these are all things that are changing as time goes on, and when you see the adoption of electric vehicles and all those things that are occurring, there is some important catalysts that we're seeing in the future that we plan on taking advantage of."
