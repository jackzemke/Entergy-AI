Question,Answer
"...especially if you just extrapolate them out on a compounding basis. And I've heard some concern from investors just around the ability to meet the 4% to 6% earnings growth aspiration if, in fact, the sales growth targets that you laid out when you laid that target out a year or so ago failed to materialize. You aspire to be a premium utility. The premium utilities don't blame changes in the outlook for not meeting their growth rate. So how do you aspire to sort of optimize your plan through time if industrial sales continue to be a drag on the plan?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah I think the last four years have shown us a couple of things. One is the inconsistency of load from quarter to quarter and obviously we've had to work through that. I think the other thing the last four years has shown us, we have to adjust to it. And you know when you think about the levers that we have around O&M but also we have emerging revenue sides as well. I mean the transmission continues to pick up. There's no question that we will have to continue to invest in the grid and in particular, transmission as well.  And then we also have other investments like solar and those kinds of relationships with customers that are improving earnings as well. So I think when you look at the 4% to 6%, we're still conﬁdent in the 4% to 6% and as we go through the year we'll certainly be able to ﬁne tune that in more detail. But I guess the overall message is we feel like we have the ability as we've done in the last four years to be able to compensate for any of these issues that occur.  And there's no question, any business has to adjust based upon what the sales forecast looks like but also they've got to look at the revenue side as well to ensure that we're doing everything we can do there to do its work as well. So, Greg, I know there's a lot of concern out there about load forecast going forward, if you trend it out and, of course, what we do with the unregulated generation. But at the end of the day, we're going to adjust to it. And I think we take very seriously, the consistency that we've built and maintained over the last four years and we don't intend on giving that up."
...you've got a lot of balance sheet capacity. How do you think about that store of value and how you might use it going forward?,"Yeah, we look at it as stored value. It gives us a lot of opportunity, but we have the ability to invest indigenously within our own footprint, and we also from a transmission standpoint and other revenue producers that we're working on to really deﬁne that, whether it's the energy company of the future or whatever you want to call it. But there's no doubt that we've built up a strong balance sheet with great credit metrics and obviously we intend on maintaining that. But at the same time there is the ability for us to look at various options for the use of that debt. And   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   it's actually a good place to be in, but also, in this day and age and how the economy is doing and what's going on there, it's a good place to be.     Greg, you know this management team and you know how we've used that balance sheet capacity in the past. It's been on prudent, regulated-type utility investments and I think you'd expect us to spend any of that balance sheet capacity in a similar vein going forward."
"Good morning, Nick. Just two questions. First question I guess on Ohio. You've had another utility in your state apply for a regulated plan. Looks like it's going to be a wires charge to grow to make more of a robust grid. Does AEP make a similar ﬁling given that staﬀ has recommended that?","Yeah. Ultimately, we can always do that. I think that's an option for us to do. But AEP is sort of in a diﬀerent place. We have some outstanding issues that we're working through with the Commission. The PIRR that we just got was one of those, but we also have the Supreme Court cases on capacity that have come back and on the RSR.  And so we're working through a list of outstanding issues, and each one of those is generally positive for AEP. So we're going to work through those and get them resolved and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do that. And at the end of the day, if that other company is successful then obviously we'll take a hard look at that. But we want to make sure that we're investing in this state and those areas that make sense, and we're doing well from a transmission and distribution perspective. We've got to get this generation thing settled once and for all.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"And then following up on Greg's question, you mentioned you guys have a strong balance sheet, highlighted all of that capacity you have, you're going through the changes at the Generation & Marketing segment right now. Southern's call yesterday highlighted the success at Southern Power of ﬁnding all of these renewable projects. Do we see the Generation & Marketing business for AEP in a year or two looking more like a Southern Power with a lot more renewables? Is that going to be the focus as we go forward, or is it just really managing the ﬂeet – or just winding it down and just being a wires company or a regulated company?","No, I think clearly, and we're probably a little more quiet about it because the major part of our business is around infrastructure, infrastructure development, on the transmission side, we have a huge transmission system so we have a lot of ability to invest. But you're always looking for sources of new revenue and we see it as another tool in the toolbox to be able to focus on enhancements of earnings, because obviously there's near-term beneﬁts of the production tax credits, and we're out there doing that.  We just did a universal scale or utility scale project in Utah that hasn't been announced yet. We can't say who but it's a 20 megawatt project. And then we also have several other small projects with municipalities and so forth in New York and other locations around the country. And we've been doing that and we know how to do that.  What we really are focused on though is ensuring that we do have a place to deploy our capital in the wisest fashion, and that can certainly augment our business but our main focus is to focus on the infrastructure and what it means. And it goes beyond solar. It goes to relationships with customers, and I sort of alluded to that in my opening discussion. You have much broader relationships with some of these customers that goes beyond solar. It goes to obviously renewables, but storage. We're very focused on storage aspects. We are an investor in Greensmith, for example, the integration of solar and wind but also in energy storage. And you see those applications coming together from a distribution standpoint and that's going to be a huge beneﬁt to us.  So, obviously, we're going to be in the solar business but we also want to be in the wind power business, really addressing tailored needs of customers, focused around that customer experience. And so, in an ancillary fashion it's coming to pass but we'll probably be getting larger at it, but we'll be good at it. We'll be focused on, ultimately those customer experience side of things."
"My last thing – just to make sure I understood correctly, it looks like you'll look at multiple opportunities maybe to bridge the gap on the genco and (33:16) marketing and one of those may be like a solar ITC bridge there? Is that correct, or that's not what you said?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. Essentially that's right, but at the same time we want the earnings driven by the utility business to drive that consistency. Well, if you're able to augment with long term purchase power arrangements, whether it's solar or whether it's anything else, then it's quasi-regulated that we can show consistency. And that's the ﬁrst thing we measure it on. So we're not out there doing solar just for solar's sake or solar with counterparties that we're not sure they're going to be there or not. We're being very selective about what solar projects and what counterparties we become involved with.  And I think – and certainly, Chuck Zebula who's running that business, I think you probably all know him. He's very structured in the way he addresses these things, just like he did with even a lot of this unregulated generation. We've performed extremely well in doing that business regardless of whether we should be in it or not. That's another question. But when we do it, it's very disciplined, it's very structured and it's very focused on what we're trying to achieve. So you're exactly right.  For us, if you look at the use of proceeds, if we have cash proceeds coming in from a transaction then obviously one of the issues that we talked about earlier was repurchase of stock. But, obviously, if you can invest in a long-term solar project and take PTCs upfront, that's also a great measure for investment as opposed to buying back stock. So there's a lot of things that are on the table that we're preparing as we work through the process of that disposition of cash, for example.  So I think to be the energy company of the future, you've got to be involved with all these facets of the business and understand the facets of the business. But you've got to be very disciplined in your approach and we just have a – I wouldn't say a diﬀerent view in terms of whether all these resources, that should be a balanced set of resources, we agree on that. I think the issue is we're very focused on the wires piece of it and how it interacts with the customer. And in the future, you're going to see a lot of these distributed solutions that are driven by the customer interaction at the distribution level, and we're going to be there to do it."
"Hi, good morning. Hey, so quick follow up if you will on the just process here. When you think of the amount of legislative eﬀort whether restructuring or what have you, when do you make a ﬁnal call here? You kind of talked about end of this quarter, early next kind of making a position on the sale. Is there a potential for you to stretch it into next year to try to get it done given the kind of limited window on legislation this year?","Yeah. Let me give you an idea of at least my perception of the timing here. We have the framework of legislation that we're addressing with stakeholders now. And that's whether its legislators, whether it's others that are important to the discussion process, other participants in the market, those kinds of things. We're going to focus on that between now and November.  And then November is when the Ohio legislation comes back into place. And keep in mind I'm talking about the ﬁrst tranche of assets. This is really regarding the second tranche which is what formerly was the PPA assets. So the ﬁrst tranche, that's moving along. It's already, the train's left the station and it's moving forward. The second tranche, I'm saying from the restructuring standpoint, we're going to go through and have the legislation, have discussions with stakeholders, get that process in place in November when Ohio, the legislature comes back into session. It will be a lame duck session so we'll have to make sure that we are focused on those legislators that will still be around and the future leaders of that organization. And then that way we can hit the ground running with legislation that's already been by-and-large bedded and discussed in the ﬁrst quarter by the ﬁrst of the year.  So in the ﬁrst quarter, you're starting with a new legislature. I think we're going to know pretty quickly whether people are open to the possibility of this kind of thing happening or not. And at that point in time, we have already started our secondary process that I talked about around the PPA assets, getting the data room ready, all that kind of stuﬀ. And we'll make a determination of where we think Ohio is going to go.  Ohio, many people didn't think the PPA would happen in Ohio and it did happen. And I still think there's going to be some form of restructuring in Ohio because there has to be. But the question becomes number one, are people receptive to it? Number two, is the timeframe appropriate for what we're trying to achieve, because the driver here will be that secondary process and we'll have to get some determination as to whether the openness and the collaboration with the State of Ohio would work to get something done during the pendency of all that.  So that's where we're at. So when we think about that, you're probably thinking this decisional process in the ﬁrst quarter of next year that we'll know whether Ohio, if there's a chance of moving forward with that thing or not. And so that'll tell us what we need to know."
"And I was just curious, even if you pursue the sale, do you pursue legislation next year to cutting open that door as well and to that end what kind of generation and how do you envision that today?","Yeah, I've made it very clear in the state that we're not going to invest in new generation in this state, period. Until something is resolved from a restructuring standpoint that enables us to invest and do it in a wise fashion. And the legislation includes the ability for AEP Ohio to not only transfer those assets that were under the PPA to AEP Ohio but also to be able to have a mechanism for investment in future generations and obviously the State of Ohio is very interested in getting natural gas going. There's a lot of discussion about there's three or four natural gas units getting built. Well that's woefully inadequate of what the Ohio load actually is. And so there is a capacity deﬁciency in Ohio and if Ohio wants to take advantage of additional natural gas build-out, the additional structural additions such as pipeline infrastructure, electric transmission infrastructure, the economic development follow-on to all that. There's no reason for Ohio to give that up. And so there has to be a mechanism to do that, and that's what we're after."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. Thank you.,"Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Exstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.     Morning, Michael."
"Hey, good morning. Hey, just to follow up with Julien's question. You had mentioned that this is not re-regulation, this is restructuring and I'm just curious about why the deemphasis of on re- regulation and what push back do you see if that term was used or proposed?","Yeah, because I think re-regulation has the connotation that everything is going to be slammed back into the wires company and there won't be any ability to shop and other participants can't participate in a market. So we are focused on reaching that balance of the ability for the utility to invest but also others to invest as well and customers to be able to choose. So that's really the distinction. It's – re-regulation just has a larger connotation to it and actually is a much heavier lift, to put the entire genie back in the bottle."
"Right. So I guess it is the spectrum of possible options, one where you would have everything put in one where you have only certain assets like the PPA assets. And then perhaps maybe on the other end of the spectrum might be only to allow the utilities only to invest in new assets. I don't know if that's also something that might happen, but.",Well. That's not our preference obviously and that's going to be determinative on the second tranche of generation for sure. Our intention is to make sure that we can transfer these assets back into the wires company and enable the ability for us to continue to invest in new generation in a credible fashion and it will take a legislative mechanism to do that. And we also obviously want to make sure that we accommodate other participants in the market in some fashion and that's part of the dialog. But those two things are what we're after.
How big do you see that getting in terms of contributing to the 4% to 6% growth rate versus let's say the transmission Holdco growth that you were forecasting for that segment?,"Yeah, so we plan on updating that at EEI in November, particularly as it relates to 2017 and beyond. We know it is for this year and it's been pretty good. Its $15 million to $20 million has been added for this year. So and those projects is a huge pipeline of projects and I think you probably heard others talk about there's a lot of solar projects out there but we're going to pick and choose the ones that match up to what our degree of risk is and we want to make sure that that business continues to grow, but we're going to be very disciplined in our approach. So we'll have more on that at EEI in November."
"Good morning. Just in terms of the tax audit, could you elaborate a little more what happened there and if it's going to maybe impact tax rates going forward?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, so it should not impact tax rates going forward at all. So it was a favorable federal tax adjustment related to a settlement of the federal tax audit issue where we had a tax valuation allowance recorded in 2011. And talk about how legacy of an issue this is, that was related to litigation that stemmed out of the Enron bankruptcy, so we're going back pretty far in history. These things take a long time to work their way through the IRS and ultimately, a congressional committee, and that's what happened on this. So it's great to get that resolved and behind us but don't expect anything like that to be a recurring item."
"Okay, great. And then on the reregulation or restructuring, just to make sure I understand. It sounds like you'll be in a – I wasn't clear as to whether or not November, the lame duck session was when things might be clearer to you or what that meant in terms of whether something actually might happen then or whether you're really looking at the ﬁrst quarter of 2017?","Yeah, so I'm thinking okay, so it really is more of a soaking period because what we want to do is in November we'll be talking to the other stakeholders and come to the legislature with what we believe is a balanced package that other participants in the market can latch onto as well. If we do that, then the discussions we've already had with the legislators, we're trying to get to every legislator we can that we know is going to still be around. And then that would be – November, we'll get an early indication of where things are going. But really, nothing – I don't expect anything can happen until the ﬁrst of the year when the new legislature comes in. But, obviously, we'll know who's coming in so we can have that soaking (47:26) period from November, December and then in earnest move that legislation forward.  I know that's aggressive, but I think what we'll be looking for is really the feedback that we get in terms of not only whether it can get done or not but in terms of timing, would be important considerations for us. So I don't see legislation actually getting done until the ﬁrst quarter or second quarter of next year but if we know it's coming and we know what's until then, then we can plan for it."
"Okay. And then when you mentioned stakeholders, are we talking about other merchant generators? And the reason for the question is, as you know, it seems that unless their generation is included or what have you that there's this sort of vehement, take-no-prisoners, kind of like no, no, no, no, no, on anything like restructuring or what have you because of the fear that they might not be competitive, if you follow me. Is their participation something critical here? Or how should we think about the stakeholder process you're mentioning?","I certainly think that they're part of the equation, and certainly we want to be able to accommodate as much as we can, the investments that have been made in the state of some of   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   these independent power producers. And keep in mind, they can still have PPAs because they're not aﬃliated, so there are opportunities for them to actually conﬁrm earnings in a period where obviously being an independent power producer is – not a good time to be in that business right now. So – I'm not going to go into who we've been having discussions with or anything like that but I would have to say that they are an important part of the puzzle here."
Can you just once again review kind of the priorities for the proceeds from the non-PPA assets?,"The proceeds for the non-PPA assets. Okay. So that process will go forward and the priority will be, we will look at as much ramping up as we can do relative to a transmission investment, and other types of investments to ﬁll – to make sure that the earnings come in as quickly as possible. Obviously solar could be a piece of that as well. And we're obviously looking at other measures that we can do to invest more quickly to address the level of cash that's coming in. And we'll obviously ﬁll in more of the detail of that in November as well.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Paul, we'd like to be able to come out and have an analyst day, when we do have something to announce on that strategic review that's underway. And we would have a detailed discussion of that at that time."
"Can we use kind of the Duke Ohio assets on a dollar per kilowatt basis, is that a reasonable proxy?","You know, Paul I don't want to tell you which ones – which assets to use. I think with your knowledge of the industry you can probably come up with something that would be reasonable for what those would be. Others have. Some have missed it terribly, but I think the smarter people like you in the industry can ﬁgure it out pretty readily.     I think as I mentioned earlier, we have a robust set of bidders, so I'd hate to give them any guidance at this point."
"Yeah, good morning. Just clarity on timing of the non-PPA outcome, is that...?","Yeah. So, from a non-PPA piece, we'll get ﬁnal bids in August. It'll probably take – it could be third quarter, early fourth quarter to have a completed deal that we would announce at that point in time. And then the process would occur relative to closing, and that could fall into 2017. But, obviously, the deal will be done and we'll get to closing. So, in all likelihood it will take – once a deal is done it could take around six months, maybe nine months to actually close."
"Okay. And then, also just you mentioned some of the weakness in your coal country subsidiary utilities. And are you planning to kind of have to get rate relief in those areas or given that they're depressed, like is there other ways that you might be able to ﬁnd solutions there? Doesn't seem like the politicians want to ﬁnd a way to invest in new things in these areas, so I'm just curious how you're thinking about that?","Paul, there are a couple of things going on in – I'm sorry, Steve, in Kentucky in particular, we just had some rate relief and we're looking at when it makes sense for us to go back in. But in Kentucky, in particular, the governor's oﬃce is looking at ways to try and attract new businesses and retain the businesses in those areas that are negatively impacted by what's happening with coal. And we, from an economic development perspective, are certainly working with the governor and the state legislators to try and see how we can be a productive part of that.     Yeah, so Steve, and keep in mind too, we've converted some of the coal to natural gas as well so the Big Sandy side is converted to natural gas. Clinch River has converted to natural gas. Those are operational now and you'll probably see more natural gas build out, but also on the renewable side, you'll continue to see expansion from that perspective. So and as Brian mentioned, we actually have been working our economic development, people had been working with the states to present these sites as brownﬁeld sites for manufacturing industrial. So we're working to try to reinforce those service territories as much as we possibly can."
"Okay, thanks.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yep.  Operator  Thank you.     I'd say, though, that there's a – I mean a lot of damage that's been done to coal country. There is no question about it. And whoever gets elected in this process really needs to focus one way or another on reinforcing a hugely depressed area, and each one of them has their own way. I mean Hillary Clinton wants to just, I guess, do several billion focused on rehabilitating from a jobs perspective and that kind of thing. That seems like a longer term issue. And of course, Donald Trump is on the other side, saying he's putting the miners back to work. And I don't know exactly how that works, but either way, I think both of them, they really ought to be focused on reinvigorating that part of the country, since it's been so devastated by what's happened recently.     Operator, we have time for one more call – one more question.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question then will come from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead."
"Nick, ﬁrst just to bring closure to the overall merchant portfolio, the exit here. So if I'm hearing you right, the non-PPA assets announced late Q3, early Q4 takes six to nine months to close from there. The PPA assets, will you have something to announce in Q1 or are you going to follow the legislative process and maybe that spills over into Q2? Not quite clear on when the ﬁnal closure happens on that portfolio.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah and I think you read that right. We're going to have to gauge the receptivity from the legislature that comes into play at that point in time and we'll have a lot of groundwork already done. So we'll have a good feeling, I think by ﬁrst quarter of where this is going to go. Now if – and keep in mind, that second tranche is continuing in parallel. So we're not slowing down on that. What we're saying is we're going to gauge that ﬁrst quarter and you may get an announcement from us if we're not sensing that it's going the right direction in Ohio then we'll say we've got the second tranche. It's moving along and we'll give an update to that. If we see that legislation can get done, then there'll be an expectation to get that legislation done as quickly as possible, but we'll continue running the tranche until we know for sure that legislation's going to happen. So I would say you're going to hear something from us ﬁrst quarter, perhaps at the beginning of second quarter but I believe ﬁrst quarter you'll hear from us some very signiﬁcant thoughts around that."
"Okay. And then second, given how low trends have played out through the ﬁrst half, are you still sticking to the +0.9% target for the year or should we be adjusting that?","Yeah, Ali. As we do an update being halfway through the year and looking at where we've been year-to-date, we'd anticipate being closer to ﬂat by year-end versus 2015."
"Okay. And last question, I mean when we look at the transmission growth proﬁle you've laid out for us, the Transco business through 2019, that's growing well above 4% to 6%. It's becoming a bigger piece of your overall earnings as well. So when you look at this company beyond the merchant, so just on a regulated basis and if your T&D, et cetera grows pretty much in line with everybody and the transmission grows the way it is, might we be looking at an overall portfolio that has a growth rate north of 4% to 6% just looking at those kind of numbers?","Yeah. So, Ali, we're going to provide a more fulsome update on longer-term growth rate when we would get together after the announcement of the conclusion of the strategic review of the assets. We'd like to have an analyst day when we go into all that, sort of reset growth rate if it's time to do that and take a look at use of proceeds if that's what we're facing at that time and give you a more fulsome view hopefully later in the Autumn this year.     So without answering, which we'll answer later in the year as Brian said. You have really brought up the kind of company this is going to be in the future, and that will be one driven by transmission/distribution focused on wires and the convolution of resources and energy services associated with that. So it's going to be a very, very good company going forward from a consistency basis but also from an investment standpoint. And what we're investing in I think it will position us very well for the next hundred years.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
