Question,Answer
"Good morning. Just ﬁrstly, obviously, you guys highlighted in the deck, quote unquote, the direction and strategy kind of remain on track. I guess how much latitude will Bill have to make kind of strategic changes if need be to create value, or is the plan kind of the plan and any kind of changes you expect will likely be more in the fringe given your and the Board's comfort level   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   with the trajectory, with obviously the latter kind of being a similar situation to one of your other Ohio peers in the state when they had an incoming CEO? Thanks.","Yes. I think that was a lot diﬀerent circumstance, Char, but Bill is very familiar with our strategy. We clearly had conversations with Bill about our strategy. So, I think it's -- I think we're on the right strategic direction. I do think Bill is going to come in and focus very much on execution. He's got a ton of experience, as we mentioned. And so, I mean, he'll take some time, assess where we are, and I'm sure he's going to make some changes, but I don't see signiﬁcant changes in the strategic direction. It's not like we gave him a plan, a to-do list, and you do all these things. He's going to be a dynamic leader. But the path we're on is, I think, we're all in agreement, it's the right path, and we need to execute on it."
"Okay. Perfect. And then last thing, obviously, we've talked about higher CapEx coming, driven by customer growth, data centres, et cetera. As we're kind of thinking about that incremental CapEx, potentially with a 3Q update and the funding source, the balance sheet doesn't have a material amount of capacity. You touched on this a little bit on your prepared, but maybe you can elaborate on how you're kind of thinking about incremental equity versus asset sales, and with asset sales, how you're thinking about distribution versus transmission. Thanks, guys.","Yes. I mean, clearly, we're going to have an update in the fall, either at or right before EEI, that incorporates what it means to CapEx to fund this load growth, both in generation and transmission, and of course, what it needs to make sure the balance sheet is strong in terms of equity and equity-like products, including portfolio optimization. Regarding portfolio optimization, you've heard me say it before, we're always open to it, but price has to be there and the ability to execute has to be there. And the regulated utility spaces, those are two hard things to put together at the same time, but we're open to it. Chuck, I don't know if you want to add anything to it.     Ben, the only thing I would add is, right, it's so important as we are a regulated utility and have signiﬁcant capital needs, not only today, but going forward, right, to maintain investment credit ratings. And we will defend that, right, in our plan."
"Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And by the way, just real big congrats on Bill. He's one of the best hires. Thanks, guys.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thanks. You did mention, Shar, asked the mix between distribution and transmission. So, it's going to -- there's obviously going to be a lot of transmission needed to be built as well as distribution.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open."
"Hey. I know you're not going to give us the full details here, but I was just wondering if there's any way you could help us think through size and shaping of this incremental CapEx, as you talked about, with the incremental wires needs here. It just seems like everything is materializing quicker than expected. And so, just wondering if you could comment, I guess, any shaping there that would be helpful.","Yes. Well, as I mentioned, with Shar's comment, I mean, you're deﬁnitely going to see a lot of increase in transmission spent that there's got to be something to plug into. So, we're going to have generation as well. And we recognize the need to make sure we have reliable distribution grid. So, I think if I had to rate it, it would be transmission increases, followed by generation, followed by distribution.     Jeremy, I would say you'll note, in our materials that we raised our CapEx this year already by $500 million, that largely is in T&D, right? It's for reliability spend, also customer hookups, and storm-related capital. So, the shape of it, right, is going to be as these customer additions come online, and again, as Ben mentioned, we'll be laying all that out in the fall."
"Got it. So, it sounds like there's an opportunity for more near-term as opposed to just later dated at this point, if I understand correctly.",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I think that that's true.
"Got it. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more on PSO's natural gas generation purchase there. To what extent do you see the need for incremental gas generation across Oklahoma, other service territories? Just wondering if you expect to see more of this.","So, I would say -- this is Peggy. And I would say with the increased reserve margins that we're seeing from the RTOs and the additional load that we're starting to see across our system, we are going to need some additional generation. And this was a very proactive approach that the team took, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, to go out and ﬁnd some aﬀordable assets that we can bring onto the system. And we plan to make that ﬁling at the commission later this fall.     Yes, Peggy mentioned proactive. It really, I think, was creative. It was outside of the RFP process and -- but it -- we have an RFP process to compare the pricing to and it's clearly very favourable. So, we're really excited about it. I think it'll be great for our customers."
"Hey. Good morning. Sorry, I've got several questions on data centre or data processing, as you called it. So, ﬁrst of all, just in the quarter, you had the very strong commercial sales growth, but then your normalized sales growth between the two subs, I think, was actually down $0.04, when you kind of look at both Vertical and T&D. Could you just talk to how we should think about that?","Yes. In T&D, Steve, normalized sales were up $0.02.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"-- just thinking, when I look at the whole picture, it's not kind of shift -- at least in that line item doesn't seem to be showing up as a beneﬁt.","Yes. So, let me comment on the negative $0.06 in Vertically Integrated. That's largely due to, in Vertically Integrated, we had a -- in the quarter, we had a 4.9% decrease over last Q2 in residential sales, and that's largely what drove that number. In our SWEPCo territory, we had -- in kind of mid to late May into early June, we had a number of repeated storm activity, tornadic activity that took large swaths of customers out for signiﬁcant amounts of times what drove that number down. We see -- we've seen that start to normalize back in June and July. So, I expect that to be -- to return to a more normal state."
"Okay. Thanks. And then on the 15 gigawatts of committed data centre sales to 2030, could you just maybe better deﬁne what committed means when you give that data point?","Yes. I mean, it basically means that we have letter of agreements and those letter of agreements, you'd start the clock running, if you will, for us to do work that pretty quickly go -- can go into the millions, which that customer who signed a letter of agreement is required to pay. So, that's how we deﬁne it. We've -- as we look forward, we look at a number of ﬁltering criteria, ownership of sites, et cetera, that we use. So, it's -- these are far from just inquiries. These are serious customers that want to get on the grid and are willing to ﬁnancially commit to do what it takes to get on the grid."
"Okay. And are those customers kind of committing to these new tariﬀs you ﬁled, or are we not at the point where they've made the agreement that those tariﬀs work for them when they've kind of done this?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, that will be going -- those tariﬀs, as you know, they haven't been approved yet, but they will need, to the extent -- depends where they are in the signing process as to whether or not they would be held to those tariﬀs or not. But going forward, customers, if approved, will all be required to step up to the tariﬀs."
"Okay. And then maybe just in terms of helping to frame the capital needs, just can you give us some rough sense of that 15 gigawatts, how much might be related to Vertically Integrated parts of AEP versus the transmission-only parts?","Yes, Steve. So, the way to think about it is think of it as a 50/50 split between Texas and PJM. 50% -- of course, Texas, right, is our wires company. And PJM, take that 50% and basically split it 50/50 between I&M, which is Vertically Integrated, and AEP Ohio, right, which is wires only."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. Okay. Thank you, guys.","Yes, we are seeing additional interest amongst other Vertically Integrated Utilities, but that interest is not as ﬁrm yet."
Yes. Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of AEP. Your line is open."
"I never got the call. I never got the call, but thanks for the time. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I was just curious as we kind of try to think about the magnitude of capital that the plan can handle here. I know that there's ﬁnancing considerations, but there's also kind of bill growth considerations. Just how high do you think your rate-based growth can get before you have to start thinking about customer bill impact, especially as some of this load should be able to supplement that? But just trying to see where this rate based CAGR could go at the end of the day. Thank you.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. I think the incremental CapEx will be driven to support new load growth, and that's why we're just so keenly focused on making sure we get the rules right. And our modelling suggests that it will be good for all customers. And that's -- I mean, that's what makes me so excited about this is, is that everybody can beneﬁt, load is good for all, and it's going to -- there's certainly pressures on the grid and the resiliency and things like that. But I think the load is going to be beneﬁcial to mitigate cost increases."
"Okay. Thanks. And then I guess since you've kind of taken over, you have kind of pulled some strings on this voluntary severance program, just where are there other opportunities in the plan to cut costs today or just things that maybe we're not thinking about that could be incremental to the positive?","Again, as I mentioned, you've got Bill Fehrman coming in. He's got a track record of innovation. The companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio were extremely well run. Bill is extremely well respected. So, I think he is going to bring a lot of great ideas. It's a lot of blocking and tackling and also taking advantage of innovation, smart technologies, et cetera, that'll get us there. But the team has done a really good job, if you look back, in keeping O&M in check. So, again, I think the biggest way we keep costs down on our customers is to bring this new load on and bring it on in ways and rules and tariﬀs that are fair to all."
"Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for the time. Just a couple of clariﬁcation questions, if I could. First, just on the 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, could you just clarify, is all of that related to data centres or is there anything else in there? And then is there anything you can provide on how to think about the cadence of that load materializing from a timing perspective?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. The 15 gigawatts refers to all data centres and we're not announcing the cadence of that at this time. But it's already, as you could see, it's already showing up in our numbers. So, we are hooking up folks and you'll see continued increases over the next several years."
Great. Thank you for that. And then just to follow-up just on the earned versus authorized ROE gap. I know you mentioned the earned ROE sort of ﬂat at that 8.9% on a trailing 12 month basis. Do you have that comparable weather normalized number similar to what you've provided in previous quarters?,"We're looking forward to be at 9.1% for this year. As I mentioned over the past 12 months, I mean, on a rolling average right now, we're at 8.9%, which is ﬂat to where we were last quarter, but continue to make progress on that front."
"Hi. Good morning. First, a quick governance question. Can you please talk about the outlook for the Board and speciﬁcally what roles will Ben and Bill each have? Who will be Chair of the Board, and will it be Executive or Non-Executive, and how large will the Board ultimately be?","Okay. Well, I will go back -- after my time as Advisor, I'll go back to being a Board Member and I will keep my independence. Bill obviously will be on the Board. He'll be a Non-Independent Director. Sara Tucker Martinez, or Sara Martinez Tucker, will be the Chair and she will remain   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Chair and she's Independent. Size of the Board, we are basically at full size. And so, that -- there won't be any change to the size of the Board. I don't know, did I get all those questions?"
"Yes, that's great. Thank you very much. And then just a quick question on the cash ﬂow slide, Page 22. The moving parts in '24 has led to slightly higher equity needs this year by about $100 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on that? And then looking to '25 and beyond, I see no changes. Would I be right to assume that's sort of just waiting for the update in three months? And just to clarify your comment on the equity-like tools, are you referring to the junior subordinates, or could there be something else in there, like equity units, perhaps?","So, Andrew, ﬁrst question, you also note in 2024, right, we had a $500 million increase in CapEx. And versus our plan for the year, right, we had additional asset sales, right, that were part of the original plan that ended up changing through the year. So, we, in our ﬁnancing, right, in our cash, right, we received less proceeds because of that change in plan. So, that -- those two things basically drove the opportunity, right, for the increase in equity and just being opportunistic in the market as well. You're right, going forward, we have not updated those cash ﬂows yet for our annual update, which we'll do at EEI."
"Okay. Then the equity-like, was that just referring to the junior subordinates, or was there more to it?","Yes, that refers to the notes that we issued in June. But we would look at various forms of equity alternatives and be holistic in our approach."
"Hey, team. Good morning. Good morning, Ben. Andrew actually asked my question on the ﬁnancing slide. Chuck, maybe a little sort of more color. There were kind of more negatives to positives in that cash ﬂow slide. I mean, the asset sale proceeds were lower, right, and the CapEx is higher. If assuming normal weather for the rest of the year, are you going to be below 14.6%, what you currently said, or should we kind of think about 14.6% as strong as going into the end of the year?","Yes, our plan is to be in the 14% to 15% range. I'll just note, right, that we're well above the 13 % downgrade threshold. So, yes, we plan to be in that range."
"Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. If I could quickly go back to the 15 gigawatts of data centre load, I guess could you provide some color on how much of that can be connected without any incremental investment in your system versus how much would they require incremental investments to facilitate that?","Right now, none of that can be connected at this point in time. But as we look at our LOA process, that's why we are looking at any initial upgrades that are needed as we prepare to plan the system to connect this load over that period of time."
"Got it, got it. Thank you. And then maybe a little bit more of an open-ended question. Your current outstanding RFPs don't have any gas in them. It's mostly renewables. And I'm just curious of how you think about the cadence of needing to add dispatchable generation there. And when it comes to gas, will you continue to have a bias towards acquiring existing assets, or will we see some new builds potentially?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","So, our RFPs are all-source RFPs, so we're evaluating all technologies that come in. And we do believe that dispatchable resources are needed to be added to the grid as well, and they will be part of the plan."
"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to dig into a little bit more on the sales growth trends. So, on the residential side, you commented that Texas looks strong, but that more broadly, the cumulative eﬀects of inﬂation have been weighing on it. So, any more color there? Are you expecting an improvement in the second half of the year?","Yes. So, Bill, in Texas, right, there is customer growth as well as increase in use, or as a result, increase in usage. In Vertically Integrated, year-to-date residential is down 1.3% and T&D is actually up 0.3%, largely due to Texas. So, we are seeing, I think, in Appalachian Power, in Kentucky Power, in SWEPCo in particular, and I mentioned some of the weather occurrences that we had in the SWEPCo area, weaker residential sales in those areas, in particular."
"Okay. I mean, I guess, as we think about the EPS activities here, right, because you've got the tremendous growth in the commercial side, right, tracking well above plan, but that's going to be lower margin volumes. And then maybe on the residential side, going back sort of four of the last ﬁve quarters, sort of as a negative, and that's obviously a bit of a higher margin, but smaller overall change. What -- how do we sort of reconcile that a little bit as we think about the EPS impact?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. I mean, clearly the residential sales are higher margin. But, again, I think it's, in particular, the eﬀects of inﬂation. So, if inﬂation comes in tame, tamer as we begin to -- as we've begun to see, if wage growth continues to close that gap, and as Ben mentioned, right, the opportunity to bring on large loads to spread ﬁxed costs, right, over a much larger denominator, right, should mitigate, right, some of those customer rate impacts as well. So, the combination of those things, right, should begin to slow that decline. But clearly, the eﬀects of inﬂation have hit home for a lot of customers."
"Going back -- thank you very much. Appreciate it. Maybe going back to some of the conversation on the layoﬀs and severance debt, I just want to understand the extent to which this process is ﬁnalized, right? You've given very speciﬁc jurisdictional level details. And given that, how are you thinking about rebuilding and devolving some decision-making power and some of the roles to the local OpCos?  Can you speak to perhaps what seems like perhaps a strategic shift in looking at local level decision-making? And really, what level or what quantity of the roles in terms of overall layoﬀs will actually be ultimately recreated, if you will, at the local level here? So, both the ﬁnancial   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   question in terms of what's the sort of ongoing net savings, and B, how do you think about this ﬁtting within the strategic question of devolvement?","Yes. I'm going to turn it over to Peggy in a second. But just as a recap, we did hit our targets that we laid out under that voluntary severance program. Those -- and we plan to hold as much of those gains as possible, probably have to do some hiring back, but try to keep that minimized. Remember, there was two-pronged approach for this.  One, we wanted to mitigate some of the inﬂationary pressures that we were seeing, higher interest rates, just overall increase in supply chain, et cetera, and take a portion of that, albeit a smaller portion, and start putting those -- some of those resource -- some of that money back into our local communities with more boots on the ground, if you will, more community leadership positions and that sort of thing. So, Peggy, do you want to --     Yes, Ben. So, yes, that's exactly, Julien, what we're looking to do. We are -- some of those positions were leadership positions that report to some of our presidents. We are making sure that we are getting those ﬁlled and we're adding additional resources in the regulatory and legislative space because we know that as dynamic as our industry is and as much change as is occurring, we want to make sure that we have that enhanced engagement at those levels. So, you'll see more of that."
"Excellent. All right. Looking forward to that. And then related, you talk about these staggering levels of the 15 gigawatts of ﬁrm commitments at this point. How do you think about that marrying up, especially in your wires businesses against an eﬀort to address generation needs? I know this has been an ongoing tension. But given what seems like yet an accelerating backdrop of generation needs, how do you think about your utilities, especially in the wires- only businesses, potentially reengaging in that narrative? And in what ways?","Well, I mean, I think that would take legislation clearly in Ohio. I guess it would take it in Texas, too, but I don't see that happening. I think it's probably a long shot in Ohio as well. So, we are going to have to rely on the market. But our Vertically Integrated Utilities are all going to need generation in diﬀerent timeframes. But I think Peggy mentioned, we've got -- we do have more with the changes in the reserve margin requirements, for example, in SPP, it creates a resource need. And we're developing our plans to ﬁll that, which will require increased CapEx, which I think is a good thing.  And we're really, again, excited about Green Country. The load is tremendous and it's primarily data centres. But of course, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention we've seen industrial load in Texas as well. And I think when we think about economic development, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to bring industry back on shore. And I'm right here in Columbus today,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   and Intel has just been an enormous success. And we're going to keep looking for opportunities for our communities. And again, all customers beneﬁt from that."
"Great. So, I asked this question some time ago about Chevron, and we now have a Supreme Court decision. And I'm just wondering how you guys see it potentially impacting either EPA or FERC regulation or anything else you might -- if you think it has any potential impact on AEP, I guess.","I think it's early, but yes, I think it could potentially be helpful as courts have more discretion not to have to rely on the agencies, which that was the whole point of that. And I just think it doesn't bind the courts as much as it probably did in the past. Now whether that -- how the courts interpret it, what the rulings are, we'll have to wait and see. But, Paul, I think in general, it's going to be helpful. And we are going to challenge a lot of these EPA rules, as you know, the CCR rule, the ELG rule, the 111 rules, I guess all of the rules that have come out we're going to challenge and for good reason."
"Okay. Great. And then just on FERC, do you see anything happening there maybe?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","I don't know. I think -- I know there's some thought that it would, but I think that really -- I'm not convinced it will. So, I think that remains to be seen."
Okay. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. Have a great one.,"All right. Paul. Thank you.  Operator  That concludes --     Thanks for joining us on today's call.
