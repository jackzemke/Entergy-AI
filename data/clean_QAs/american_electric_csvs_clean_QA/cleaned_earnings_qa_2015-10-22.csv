Question,Answer
"Hey, Nick, just on the – you know you guys made a great progress on the equalizer chart as far as improving the overall earned ROEs. How much more room if you thought about 2016, given the rate cases you see coming, where do you see the 2016 ROE headed and how much more improvement you need in ROE to be able to hit the 4% to 6% growth rate?","Yeah, I think it's going to continue to improve, Dan. We're probably on the order of 9.6% to 10% in that range for 2016, so it'll continue to improve overall. And then with Kentucky coming up, that's helpful, although Kentucky's pretty small in the overall comparison, but the others are doing quite well."
"Okay. And I guess preemptive on the Ohio generation side, but given the weakness of the power stocks and the IPP sector, is there a market of buyers still sitting out there who'd be willing to transact on your assets right now or are market conditions potentially going to slow down maybe the urgency of making a decision on those assets?","Yeah, I think there's still a set of buyers out there, it's just – it certainly goes to the question whether a spin option is, while it's still on the table, it's more diﬃcult because you have the paper involved with those companies, but for sale, there's still parties out there, and some of the recent transactions have shown that."
"I guess maybe just one last question. When you guys look at the load trends going on right now, how is the residential versus commercial trends having bearing on what you guys expect to see for load growth next year?","Yeah, so commercial continues to improve. As a matter of fact, that's probably the bright spot of the portfolio, and you have these cycles that change as we go along, and the residential, that's gone up and down the last few quarters and it really does drive this view that we need the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   economy to really start picking back up, particularly from the energy policy perspective. If we start exporting or if we continue a build-out of the economy that's focused on energy, then our economy will pick up as well. So we're getting some beneﬁts from auto manufacturing and that kind of thing, but primary metals on the world market, mining, those kinds of activities are certainly having an impact. So yeah, we've been in sort of a strange period for several quarters, and actually, years now, and we obviously need to get the economy moving again from an energy perspective."
"Okay, great, because you earned $3.43 in 2014, and this year, at the new midpoint, you're going to earn $3.73. Even if I weather normalize that, that's $3.65. So notwithstanding the deceleration in load growth trends that you're experiencing, one would presume you're doing very well relative to that aspiration, so I have to ask, does that aspiration build in the expectation that there'll be some dilution from the sale of the generation assets, which gets oﬀset over time as you redeploy that capital into the transmission business?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Go ahead.     Go ahead. Go ahead, Brian. I'll follow.     No, Greg, that assumes the business as usual case, that we continue to own the properties that we do today with the exception of river operations. And we'll do for you at EEI like we do the normal waterfall stair-step between 2015 and what we anticipate 2016 to be. In addition to weather, which if you look across all our businesses, is probably closer to $0.12, we've had things like inception gains, the generation and marketing, they're about $0.06. We've had the beneﬁt from the sale of some plants and reducing ARO obligations. That's another $0.06. So you can pretty easily do a stair-step that would take oﬀ that – of that $3.72 about $0.24 for things that we don't anticipate to be recurring parts of our business."
Okay. That was really – that was the gist of my question. I appreciate that.,"Yeah. Greg, I think you have to sort of look at it like in the previous quarters, we've been talking about working to try to get to a solution for 2016, and now we've moved to conﬁdent about 2016."
The second question is with regard to the timeline for getting an answer from Ohio on whether or not you'll be able to contract a portion of that ﬂeet and whether that is a gating factor for concluding an asset sale or whether there's a deadline at which you would move on an asset sale and not wait around for – sort of in an open-ended process.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. So it won't negate the discussion. I think really what matters here is, is we get through the process with Ohio by the end of the year, we have a result that says these particular units are going to be covered by a long-term PPA, then that says that we're sort of ambivalent, whether, assuming the PPA addresses our concerns as certainly being long term, we have lots of plan out there. And as well, some of the other provisions to ensure that we're able to make it quasi- regulated then we're somewhat ambivalent as to whether we hold those units or not. And I think it certainly bodes well for our ability to hold onto those units and still be a regulated utility. For the remaining assets that aren't covered by the PPA, there's still a process ongoing. And so we'll go through this.  And as I said earlier, our board has been and for the last two years as you know, we've been going through this with our board and the PPA because originally we thought it may be later for a decision. No-one knew because we didn't have the schedule. We're concerned by that and we weren't going to wait for and now there's a schedule in place, there's hearings that have occurred and we'll conclude here pretty soon. We'll have a result pretty soon and the PPA is very, very important to our standing in Ohio overall and whether we keep that portion of the generation or not, but it doesn't change the objectivity and the measured approach that we're using to go through this process to ensure that we're making the right decisions for our shareholders. And so because we get a PPA doesn't mean certainly that the process is oﬀ for any of those, the remaining generation that's not covered by that type of PPA. So we're looking at this very straightforward and we've been very consistent in our discussions.  I know last quarter, previous quarter, we were saying that we were, after the capacity auctions, the capacity performance supplemental auctions, that we would know and understand a lot more. We do. We were assuming that it was a never-ending approach associated with getting a PPA resolved and it appears that the Ohio Commission has taken this on seriously and are moving forward with determining what the solution would be. And so we're going to go through that process, fully understand it, and by ﬁrst quarter next year, our board will certainly know all the ins and outs of the issues that we're dealing with and then we'll move forward."
Hey. Good morning. I didn't know you guys were such Back to the Future fans.,"We all remember that. Some of us do anyway. I'm probably talking to some people that don't even remember it, so."
"If you wanted to wear a Star Trek outﬁt at EEI, Nick, I'm okay with it.","Well you know, I happened to think about that when I was talking about the BOLD line, boldly going where no man has gone before."
"Greg asked most of my questions, but just quickly, when do you think on the PPA process, if we don't reach a settlement or whatever, if we end up going a fully litigated track, when do you guys expect that to be ﬁnished?","So if it's fully litigated, we still expect to get an order by the end of the year and that's – now, fully litigated means obviously there'll still be I am sure, there'll be appeals and all that kind of stuﬀ, but we're actually focusing on the Commission order itself because that really tells us where the policy making decision in this state is moving toward. We certainly believe that'll occur before the end of the year."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Do you think such a big issue like this for Ohio with getting a PPA or entering into PPAs, do you think the appeals process would be lessened if you do get a fully-litigated order. I mean are the parties better oﬀ getting a litigated order just so that the appeals process is maybe less shorter or the record is stronger versus a settlement?","Yeah, certainly I think it depends on what the order looks like, but certainly – I mean the Commission certainly has taken a deliberative approach to this and we have certainly done a lot of analysis along with FE and others who participate in hearings about can a PPA be used, we feel really good about where we stand from a legal perspective going forward. I think the real issue is the Commission needs to come out with an order that comports with the discussions that occurred relative to the PPA so if there's deviation from that in some fashion, maybe could be opening yourself up to more substantial appeals, but we've given the recipe. The recipe is there, and certainly, it drives a positive solution for the customers, for Ohio and the Commission certainly has the track-record to be able to put that kind of thing in place that holds up."
"Hey. So my key question was around the generation business. And as we look at it from an EBITDA perspective year-to-date for the generation business, you've already achieved about $725 million of EBITDA relative to guidance midpoint of about $590 million for 2015. So just wanted to understand more long term like is this more speciﬁc things that have happened in 2015 that are driving 2015 EBITDA to be higher? But longer term, your guidance stays consistent?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Praful, a couple of things going on there. One is for the ﬁrst half of the year, we still had some considerable capacity revenues coming from Ohio. That dropped oﬀ in May and we'll be experiencing that negative impact through the balance of the year. So that's something that on an annualized basis, you need to factor that out of the business going forward. We also had two other pieces that contributed to the gen & marketing results this year that we don't think you can consider as regular ongoing items. One is we've had inception gains of about $0.06 per share. And the other is we've had reductions in liabilities that in a positive way ﬂow through O&M associated with the sales of two plants, one is Muskingum River and the other is a coal impalement (40:14) that we were able to sell. The combination of those two items is another $0.06. So there are some things that you need to factor out if you're going to annualize that business on a go forward-looking basis."
"I've got you. That's very helpful. And then ﬁnally, just a key question on Ohio. I heard your points around the ESP and the PPA. I guess I'm just trying to understand from a long-term perspective, I get the message that if it's long term, it's a diﬀerent answer or you're at least indiﬀerent between sale versus keeping it. What deﬁnes long term? Is it – is seven years long term enough? If you don't get the full 15, at what point do you say I actually do have a diﬀerence between keeping the business versus selling it?","Well certainly I don't want to get into that too much because – but long-term, to us I mean we have ﬁled for loss of plant. And I'll just say this, the term has to be substantial because we have to have a feeling that we can invest. And with the large capital investments that we make in generation, we need to know that we can do that and be secure from a future perspective. So when I look at our FERC wholesale contracts, we've had contracts that are 10 years, 15 years, we've had same customers for 75 years so when we talk about long-term it has to be substantial enough for us to make that kind of investment and so I'm not going to say an actual number at this point because we have lots of plants sitting out there and that's what we believe what it takes. We'll wait and see what it winds up being, but I can tell you this, it's three years, which is the length of the capacity deal in PJM, that was a three-year capacity market, that's not long enough. And that's a problem within PJM and the state has an opportunity to ﬁx that."
"I just wanted to follow up, I guess, on that question about the generation business and the asset retirement obligation, and I'm sorry, but I was cutting out a little bit. On slide 22, I noticed this that there's a $62 million beneﬁt, and just to make sure I understood that, a lot of that has to do with the asset retirement obligation going away because of some plant sales and for the most part you don't see that recurring. Is that correct?","Yeah, we had reserved asset retirement obligations that ended up being higher than what we were able to realize by selling the plant to a third party, so we were able to get the third party to take those obligations for less than what we had recorded on the books and that allowed us to ﬂow the diﬀerence between what we had recorded through O&M. And we have gone back now and checked for the remaining plants both from an engineering standpoint and from a market standpoint, those values that we've recorded the AROs at and we believe those values to be accurate as they are in the books today."
"Okay. And then just with respect to the AEP Dayton ATC liquidations which seem to be leveling oﬀ, how should we think about how they actually impacted year-to-date earnings in generation & marketing and how do you see the outlook for those in 2016?","We think those prices are going to continue to be under pressure, but I'll say this, Paul, and we've talked about this before; we do have, as we go into a year, signiﬁcant component of that generation is hedged. So for the third quarter of this year, we were at about 60% of the margins and megawatt hours were hedged going into that period. So we will have similar amounts hedged going forward in 2016, so for two things. One, we'll be able to take advantage of prices if they do recover and we do see them under pressure right now in 2016, but also if we were to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   have unit outages or increased load from our hedges, we wouldn't be subject to market pricing for that as well."
"Great. And then back to Ohio and the PPA situation, and I mean, take this with a grain of salt, if there was outcome if you thought in terms of settlement versus fully litigated, what would you say the odds are that it would be settled as opposed to fully litigated?","I wish I could answer that this point. There's a lot of context within discussions, and there's multiple aspects of this, not just the units, the generation that's within a PPA, but really what's the total answer for Ohio? And I even think about it from the Clean Power Plan perspective. The state of Ohio needs to have some framework for a foundation of a transition with base load generation that allows it to make plans associated with ultimate retirements of that generation and replacement with new resources that are put in place, and all incremental resources are either going to be natural gas, renewables, certainly eﬃciencies regarded the grid itself. Those are the kinds of investments that I think can really drive Ohio to a more balanced energy future that mitigates a lot of risk for consumers.  And so what we're talking about here is a foundation to be provided for a transition, and that's clearly important. I think it should be important to the governors, should be important to the policymakers in the state. And if you drive that kind of solution, you can wind up at a much better place than you would otherwise. And so I know I said a lot other than what the direct question you ask and what's the percentage chances, but I think I'm going to those kinds of things that should and will be discussed in the framework of supporting a PPA type arrangement."
"Okay. And I gathered from your previous comments that you feel pretty conﬁdent that we'll get decision one way or the other by the end of the year. I just want to make sure that as you know, sometimes regulators whatever there's an issue that's got some whatever lot of speculation et cetera associated with, there's delay. Do you follow what I'm saying? You don't get the feeling that that's – you feel pretty conﬁdent. Am I wrong? Tell me if I'm wrong that you feel that this is very likely to be settled one way or the other by the end of the year?","I think it will. There's – it certainly should be settled by the end of the year. And if it goes the settlement route, then you have to think about, okay, how do you argue about the settlement and that kind of stuﬀ and who's involved and all that kind of stuﬀ? If you litigate it, well the Commission needs to make a decision. I'm really focused on making sure we drive to a solution as quickly as possible. And this has been two years, by the way. The ﬁrst case that was ﬁled by AEP and then FirstEnergy followed up. I think both, or certainly Chuck can speak for himself, but both companies need to get on with the investment and decisions that need to be made relative to these assets. And I certainly believe there's recognition by the Commission that they do need to make this decision.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"So perhaps just to follow up a little bit of detail from the last question, and again I hate to hit you with a little bit too much. Is there a minimum tenor that deﬁnes getting a long-term solution for PPA? I know it's a transient question. But kind of how do you think about that?","The minimum tenor would be a long time. I just – we just want to make sure that everyone understands that if, regardless of the solution here, if there is a PPA, there's sort of two parts of the gate here. One is that the Commission approves a PPA. The second is what does the PPA look like? And AEP has been very out front and very focused and measured in our discussion about this to say that our expectation is a long-term PPA, one that goes past a three-year ESP cycle or has adjustment mechanisms or all that kind of stuﬀ. We want to make sure that we have a long-term PPA that we can depend on and that we can actually make the investments we need to make. So minimum is long-term."
"Got it. Very clear now. Secondly, just sort of a bigger picture question, when you think about CPP obviously we got that ﬁnalized recently. How are you thinking about coordination between the various states that you have operations in? T&D Utilities, fully integrated, when do you think you start to get clarity about what needs to happen in each of those states through the ﬁling process et cetera, and perhaps to add to that do you have, or do you need legislative approval in any state to kick oﬀ the CPP compliance?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","No, I think we want to make sure that the commissions are certainly involved with this. Now the states are going to take their own approach. They may litigate. I'm sure some states will litigate it, but that could be done in parallel. Our message is regardless of what you decide to do, you really need to work with us on developing a state implementation plan because that's the only way that, not only can a state have its own approach – but keep in mind, EPA did allow the states to say, okay come back with a plan and tell us what the reliability implications are. Because I believe that when the states look at their plans and they go through with the process that needs to occur and if there are reliability implications they're in a much better position to have a plan and the factual information to support that. And then who knows what administration changes and all that occurs along the way, but you're also in a much better position to negotiate relative to your own state implementation plan as opposed to a one-size-ﬁts-all federal plan that is very diﬃcult for one state to change.  So this is why we're sort of staying out of the arguments where the states and attorney generals and all that get involved from that perspective, from the litigation perspective. We want to make sure that the states continue to move forward. And for us, the states that do work with us on developing these plans will be in a much better position because every ﬁling we make relative to our resource plan, integrated resource plan, or other types of plans, we'll be able to comport with what the state really wants to see that may be based upon their own unique views of how they want to approach this. So we want to be part of that and be part of the discussion. We want to be able to drive that discussion because we have a lot of factual information that I think the states will beneﬁt from.  We've already started those discussions and will continue with that dialogue. For states that just refuse to do a plan, we'll continue to look at the clean energy economy of the future and the technology of the future and we'll continue to advance that within the resource plans that we have. So we just want to make sure we have answers to the questions of where a states' preferences are in terms of resources that they want to move forward with, and that we're there to do it. And so that's where we're at. I believe the states obviously have to make their own decisions relative to this, but we're working with the state EPAs and the state public utility commissions. As far as legislation is concerned, we believe each individual state is unique from that perspective, but we'll be working with the commissions and we'll be making our voice known in terms of where we think it should go in the future."
Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,"Good morning, Stephen.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"So most of my questions have been addressed, I just had two I wanted to discuss. Transmission's always been a good area of growth for you and you're in a pretty strong ﬁnancial position. I wondered if you could just comment on how bullish you are in terms of ﬁnding additional transmission growth opportunities, and to the extent that you do see more opportunities, could you talk at a high level at the types of transmission opportunities that you see out there?","Yeah, so we continue to have – like I said I think I said last quarter there's well over 2,000 projects that we're working on today, we have other projects out there that are waiting for capital and we constantly are reviewing the capital situation that occurs. If we wind up with bonus depreciation or other opportunities that we could advance capital and actually in anticipation of the sale of river ops, we started the transmission spin last quarter when we raised the transmission in anticipation of that so that we wouldn't have the delay in terms of the earnings power of transmission associated with that so we're constantly looking at ways to do that and you're going to hear more about that at EEI and we'll have more to say about, and I think Brian was talking about the capital plans for the future, we'll have more to say about that."
"Understood. And then just thinking about, you had mentioned utility-scale solar investments, when you look across your territories and you think about the ability to actually invest capital versus entrants at PPAs, could you talk at high level in terms of the regulatory landscape for the decision of preference between direct investment versus being an oﬀ-taker?","Yeah, we historically have been an oﬀ-taker of renewables. We have like over 2,000 megawatts of wind power. I'm a little tired of others taking credit for wind power when they wouldn't exist without the PPAs that exist from AEP, so we're going to be obviously much more outspoken about what we're doing relative to PPAs, but also from an investment perspective, we believe for utility-scale solar we should invest in that because it is a resource of the future and we have very good operations, maintenance, and project management expertise that we believe we have something to bring to the table in terms of eﬃciencies associated with that so when we talk to our regulatory jurisdictions, remember our regulatory jurisdictions are sort of on the cusp of dealing with these kinds of situations.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So for us, when we ﬁle a resource plan you're going to see some portion of natural gas, you're going to see utility-scale solar, and you're going to see other grid-type eﬃciency technologies to put in place whether it's energy storage, whether it's integrated Volt VAR control, information system deployment, advanced metering, those kinds of things will be key to our future. And that's something that we're very focused on, so we have transmission. Transmission is a great opportunity for us because it's a large-scale system that needs refurbishment. So is distribution. Distribution is a great opportunity for us, but even the build-out of distributed generation, particularly this type of utility-scale, we know where to place it on the system, it could be part of a resource plan that's ﬁled with commissions and we're in the best position to build and own that type of generation."
"Good morning. I had a question about the AEP Transmission Holdco. You've had a very good result year-to-date, earnings up $0.07 oﬀ of a 2015 base $0.30. But third quarter had uncharacteristically poor result with the sort of ﬂat earnings year-over-year. And I was   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   wondering if you could perhaps explain a little bit what happened, if there are any implications for the future?","So we had a onetime blip there, Hugh, related to O&M. At ETT, we had a cross-arm issue from some of the build out that we had to do there and we had to spend some dollars to address that physical issue. We don't anticipate that to be a recurring item and we believe it was a blip for the quarter and we'll be able to get back on track for the end of the year."
"Okay. And then if I could just quickly, following up on the prior question on the Clean Power Plan, is there a form of regulation or a structure of regulation that you're trying to push your states to consider? Or are you happy to work with states on their individual objectives even if those are materially diﬀerent structures or regulatory approaches?","Yeah. I think we're willing to work with the states on their own individual unique circumstances, and we'll be working in that vein. Now, what we are looking at is we'd rather see and this is sort of tentative for us because we're still looking at a mass-based approach because that's more amicable to trading within states. But we've got to have the state solutions before we really understand how important the trading aspects are going to be. But we believe we're better oﬀ with a mass-based approach."
Is it a view that your other CEOs share or is that subject to debate?,"Yeah. You'd have to talk to them. Their states may be in diﬀerent places. I know California obviously is in a diﬀerent place. And – but it will be unique to each individual region of the country I believe, and then really what kind of resources that you're transitioning from within the states as well."
And any comment on how you feel about where in that range things are looking?,We'll be updating that at EEI in a couple of weeks.
"And given that, I guess the decision of what to do with the Ohio generation is going to be a big driver of 2016. How will you handle that in guidance?","Yeah, that's why Brian said earlier that the forecast for 2016 and the guidance that we'll give in November will still include those generation resources, it's not an assumption that we're going to continue to own, and I want to be careful with that. What it does say is that's what we know today, and so we'll plan for 2016 with that assumption, and if something does happen ﬁrst quarter or whenever a transaction is actually completed, then we'll have to re-benchmark and adjust."
And you indicated you expect oil and gas to expand through 2016. Are there any particular regions where that's driving that expansion?,"Yeah, it's all shale related, Paul, so it's Texas in particular and then West Virginia and Ohio.     Yeah, keep in mind while the rig count's not going up, the electric load is and that's because there's a lot of consolidation that's occurring and eﬃciencies around compressor load that continues to get added so you have to sort of de-link what rig count's doing versus what the electric load itself is doing."
"I know we'll touch on 2016 at EEI, but just under a scenario where you retain the approximate 3 giga-watts under a PPA and you sell the remaining 5 gigs, does that scenario necessarily have to lend itself to dilution or do you have enough leverage to pull, i.e., or 2,000 plus transmission projects or even buy-backs to mitigate any type of a dilution opportunity?","Yeah, I think you're sort of answering the question and that is we have to understand certainly what the proceeds would be. If there is dilution, then there's all kinds of transactions that could be done to mitigate that but also from a share buy-back and that kind of thing you could make adjustments there as well, so but it's too diﬃcult to answer at this point. I mean, there's just so many moving parts in that analysis, but we will certainly go through that process."
"Got it. Excellent. And just one last question, obviously we've got staﬀ rec the route on (1:05:57) the PPAs. And sort of when you look at sort of what the recommendations are, obviously what's the most contentious item? Is it the tenor of the PPA? There were certainly some comments as far as the ROE. Is everything sort of up for negotiation?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. I guess probably the most contentious issue is the PPA itself. The staﬀ said well we object to a PPA but it can work under certain provisions. So if you get to the second door then it's probably tenor and those types of things that would be discussed. I mean just like with a long- term wholesale provider that we provide to you all the time, it's always price, tenor, and what the provisions are. So but I would say certainly on the former getting the PPA addressed and then secondly around tenor and then what's included."
"Great. Just on the PPAs, could you categorize the settlement talks that are going on?","Well I've said there was discussions going on. And so, we're obviously going through that process and talking about a lot of issues. And really, I can't say anything more at this time about that. But I can tell you that we're discussing with several parties."
"Great. Thank you. And then on the potential asset sales, the generation, I guess they're two buckets is kind of the way to look at it. They could become one bucket or be broken up into two buckets depending on the PPA. Is it possible that the bucket that is not involved in the PPA gets moved before the PPA gets resolved?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I would say not likely because we're looking for an overall answer to this. I mean obviously if the PPA is not put in place, then we have a larger amount of generation that we have to go through this process with. So they'll probably be answered at the same time."
"And if you were to get a PPA on the ﬁrst bucket, would it be possible that you would pursue a PPA for the second bucket?","Well that's an interesting question, but I think getting the PPA through and getting whatever units are included in a PPA I would say that the open units that aren't included in the PPA, we're not going to assume that they're going to be brought back in at some later time, and so besides we really don't have the time for that."
Got it. Okay. Thank you. See you soon.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Thank you, and that will be from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.     Good morning, Ali."
"Okay, and then also, Brian, as you mentioned earlier, your current 4% to 6% growth is based oﬀ the midpoint of the original 2014 guidance, so as we look forward, is that sort of the way to be thinking about it, that when you're looking at 4% to 6% we should use your original midpoint of your 2015 guidance as you move things forward? Or conceptually, how should we be thinking about what base to use for that 4% to 6% going forward?","We'll lay out a framework for that at EEI. I need to stop talking about 2014 original guidance, because that's getting pretty far back in the rearview mirror now. But we'll lay out that framework at EEI. It's – our long-term anticipated growth rate is 4% to 6% and we can normalize   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   everything and take you through that discussion in more detail at EEI with some charts that we're putting together."
"I got it. And last question, Nick, as you looked at the timeline on strategic issues on merchant, the Ohio PPA, obviously, things have moved as other events have gotten delayed. Are you now at a point where you say, look we think this will happen by year-end and so we'll get clarity by early next year, but if regulatory processes continue to get shifted further, is early next year sort of casting stone in your mind to ﬁnally resolve the strategic issue on merchant or would you still be ﬂexible depending on how the PPA staﬀ is moving?","This thing has gone on long enough, and I think that we have to get on with making a decision and really our board has been dealing with this for a year and a half, two years now as well. So it's very important that we get the answers that we need from the Commission so that we understand what Ohio's policy is going to be in the future. So my view is that ﬁrst quarter this coming year, we'll have an answer ready with the Commission that we know not so much whether it holds up in court or anything like that, or what the thinking this. And that's what's clearly important is the way we address this process and to not be thinking about it for a long period of time or not hearing what people are thinking about it externally from a policy perspective. That is very important to us. So my view is our patience has sort of run thin here and we need to get on with it."
"Just to clarify, so if the PPA rider discussion for whatever reason is continuing beyond Q1, you are not going to wait for that to continue beyond that. Is that fair?","I think that's fair. I think that's fair. Now, I can't say that on January 29 or January 30, we think we're going to get an order on February 1. That we're going to pull the plug on January 30. But we fully expect the Commission to get done by year-end and then we'll go about the process as quickly as we can to focus on what the future holds. And so I'm just saying that ﬁrst quarter we should be in a position where we move on."
