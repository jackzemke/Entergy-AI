Question,Answer
"So, when we're looking at the numbers, clearly as you explicitly stated, the switching numbers are tracking ahead of what you had told us your budget was for this year, but you're also 70% of the targeted gross margin for the year in your oﬀ-system sales business and we're not even in the Third Quarter yet. Is there some way in the future you could give us what the net impacts to margins is by carving out the beneﬁts that are accruing to the OS oﬀ-system sales margins as energy and capacity move from the retail bucket to the wholesale bucket?","We'll surely try to craft something like that, Greg, to give you guys at least some directional view. The oﬀsetting positive eﬀects as you already mentioned showing where we are with oﬀ-system sales with just 2 quarters moving into what as you know is usually the most productive quarter, we feel very, very comfortable about where we are. As you know, inside of the ESP, there are some rate design issues as they pertain to the commercial rate class, which is the high impact class at Columbus Southern, we expect will get resolved.  Going forward, some of the oﬀ-system beneﬁts will continue to be there and some of the on- system switching might slowdown a bit. We'll try to give you a better picture of that so you can get a feel for it, but rest assured we feel extremely comfortable with where we are.  We're capturing about 25% of our own market share in that sense through AP retail having success and the other areas both -- all 3 really FE, Dayton and Cincinnati, so switching in Ohio is interesting. I think we've reacted to it in a constructive way and the impact on it, although more than we had expected has been very tolerable."
"And the Casper rule, some of the other companies have reported yesterday, indicated they thought there was a chance that the implementation could be delayed by the courts. Are you presuming that happens or are you presuming that doesn't happen, and when you look at the amount of credits you've been allocated, are they suﬃcient to mitigate the potential increase in customer bills?  Or do you have enough credits to mitigate having to increase what you charge in the system agreement? So, when you look at the balance, your long and short position, how does that play   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   out in terms of where those credits get allocated and is that going to be a '12 impact or do you think perhaps it will be delayed?","Well, I like everybody else will continue to push for a delay because there's just no way in the world you can make a rule ﬁnal in November of 2011 and expect people to comply with it on January 2012. It's just as close to lunacy as you can get, but having said that we'll continue to plan to address those issues.  We continue to look at the options that are available to us. Your question on the credits is interesting. We're long in some jurisdictions, short in other jurisdictions. Some of the other controlled trading will allow us to address much of it, but maybe not all of it, and we're going about the process of trying to satisfy that shortage as we go. But as you know, in a regulated world those kinds of activities are recoverable from our customers and it's going to have some unfortunate dislocation.  And when you think about Casper and the timelines, we'll all be able to manage our way through it. If we end up spending a certain amount of money in the regulated footprint as you know that will turn into earnings as we go. The really devastating eﬀect though will be in those communities where plants are prematurely closed, jobs are lost, property tax bases are aﬀected.  And in many of those regions, Greg as you know, we're the only game in town, so when the power plants go, so go the communities and that is truly the unfortunate impact and no 1 on the coast cares about and I understand that whether it's East or West Coast, but we care a great deal about that in our footprint, we sure do."
"Final question, on the $900 million in pre-tax cash you'll hopefully be getting some time next year. Is there, do you know what the uses of that cash are going to look like at this point?","We do, Greg. We're going to obviously take some of that and re-securitize TCT by retiring some debt and there are going to be some requirements that we're going to have in Texas to retire that debt and reﬁnance that company but there will be a component of that that should be a signiﬁcant dividend up to the parent. And of course we'll use that for the other capital needs that we have and we sort of laid some of those out for you, the environmental needs that we have building the transmission business and others."
"First on the tax rate for the quarter, I'm sorry if I missed this but it did seem a little bit lower than I think normal. Could you tell us what happened there and if there's any change or opportunity for lowering your tax rate on a going forward basis?","I'm trying to end up looking like Jeﬀ Immelt, but I'll let Brian answer that question.     Thanks, Paul. Tax rate for the ongoing, the AEP utility segment was about 33.27% compared to the prior year and about 35.55% and it was lower as a result of lower pre-tax booked income and larger favorable ﬂow-through and permanent book-to-tax-diﬀerences.  We're always looking for opportunities to try and get that down as low as we possibly can and we're engaged in a number of tax planning activities to try and get that as low as possible. We're pleased that it's below what we had in guidance of a 35% range for the quarter and the year, but we're always planning and trying to ﬁnd ways to reduce that tax burden as much as we possibly can."
"But you're not going to change, we shouldn't change our outlook on the tax situation going forward, right?","I think it's always wise for you to assume a 35% rate, and if we come in lower than that that's a beneﬁt to our shareholders."
"Okay. With respect to customer switching, I guess Greg asked this question. You guys are now providing, I mean that's a gross margin that you guys had on that slide as opposed to the net margin. Could you just give us a little bit of ﬂavor as to what you think the net margin would be roughly speaking?","I'd rather give you some accurate data as best we can down the road. Paul again, I will tell you that it's considerably smaller than the gross margin impact."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. The Ohio situation. We've seen the interveners ﬁle their testimony and it was all over the map, I guess, diﬀerent industrials and diﬀerent positions and what have you and OCC and what have you.  Is there any possibility that we're going to be getting a settlement? I know that others have suggested that, like Duke, and I'm just wondering whether or not is this going to be a fully litigated case and that's just what we should expect?","Well I would hope not. As I mentioned in my opening comments there, we continue to have what we think to be constructive dialogue. As you know, and I mentioned this as well, people ﬁle testimony to lay out what they think is their most preferred position, frequently knowing that they will never get there. But nonetheless, they do, and each and every time people do that, it does have an eﬀect on settlement discussions. I have every reason to believe based on what we're hearing in the give and take discussions with folks that these cases lend themselves to settlement and we'll continue to work diligently toward that end."
"And then just ﬁnally on the staﬀ, you mentioned that it's coming out today and with the old ESP that came out, it didn't really say much. It sounds like you guys are expecting them to give a more deﬁned position as to where they are actually, what the sort of full ESP format should sort of be like. Is that what you guys are sort of sensing?","Not necessarily. What I tried to say in my comments was just if you see something there that looks Draconian, you can react to it as you'd like but again that won't be the end-game and the dialogue with the parties, staﬀ included, have been constructive.  I think we're better than Congress at debt ceilings and cost reductions, but some of the conversations every now and again get a little worrisome, so we'll see what we'll see. I don't think it will be a crystal clear path of here is what we think the Commission ought to do.  It will lay out some of their positions and various issues, some that may be more aggressive than we would like and others that may be more supportive than others would have thought the staﬀ would have been, so it's certainly hard to forecast. I assure you they aren't sharing with us any drafts of what it is they intend to ﬁle. We'll get it the same time you get it."
"Okay, great thanks and I'm glad to hear you guys are at a better position than Congress.","That doesn't take much, Paul.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Mike, I was wondering if you could just share thoughts on you laid out a big plan for the capital spending for environmental and the plans for retirement versus keeping. Could you share a little color on what was the regulatory response and the stake holder response to investment and closure decisions by states and whether you're going to see any changes or inducements maybe to change that plan?","Well, that's an interesting question, Dan, because the granularity that we've provided have allowed us to be on the point and catch any 1 of the number of arrows coming our way but I will tell you this.  We have not had a meeting with anyone in any of the states and/or in Washington, including the EPA, where there wasn't serious thanks for telling us exactly what your picture looks like. You can rest assured at the state level the governors and the House and Senate members as well as the local community folks are eager to see us change the plans.  I had an opportunity to speak to about 500 people at the Kentucky Chamber where the speaker of the House of the State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky who serves our Big Sandy area stood up and said, whatever you do don't shut Big Sandy down. Go about whatever it is you need to do, whether you are going to retroﬁt it, which would be their preference and/or convert it to gas and they will be with us as we go to the PSE in Kentucky to adjust the rates accordingly.  I think what we're seeing in our Eastern footprint for the most part are state leaders who are suggesting that they do not want to be at the whim of the market, nor do they want to be a net energy importer, because each of those 7 governors have already staked out the jobs and economic development are the plans for their success, so we see a great deal of encouragement.  I must tell you at meeting with the FERC, with the Department of Energy's Electricity Group, with the EPA, with the various NERC players and the RTOs, the NARUC folks. Everyone is saying thanks for the granularity and the honesty of your data, and we can see what you mean by there may be pockets of reliability impacts, and someone really needs to aggregate all that data so that you can see that going forward.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And as you know, the Energy Commerce Committee and the House of Representatives has suggested in the TRAIN Act that that's exactly what the government does, so this is far from over with. It really is, and again, we are not in any way, shape, or form, although I know form, I know many NGOs don't agree with us in this regard.  We're not trying to change the environment, nor aﬀect the environment in a negative way. We're trying to balance the environmental beneﬁt that will come from retroﬁtting and changing the generation ﬂeet here in the United States with the economy of the United States, which we think is every bit as important."
"And I guess just another question. If you look at the usage patterns in the quarter, it looked like residential kind of had a pretty nice pop relative to what trend had been coming out of the recession. Was there something unique to the quarter, was there some weather adjustment data that makes it a little squirrelly or are you actually seeing a real change in usage out of that customer class?","Well you heard us say this in the First Quarter was 1 of the few things that is in a constructive sense, their heating bills went down a lot because natural gas prices continued to dampen compared to what they saw a year ago. And the cost of transportation went down some, so I think that they probably were turning on some of the lights that they had turned oﬀ in the First Quarter."
How should we think about the tax rate on the securitization proceeds?,"We are going to be setting up a tax deferral associated with that. We're going to take, at the time that we recognize the transaction, we're going to take the $420 million plus the applicable interest and the debt only portion, and we'll record that as a regulatory asset with the related deferred tax expense of about 35%.  And then, of course, as the reg assets amortize the deferred assets will be amortized to match the current income tax expense, and the equity portion that we'll be realizing will be recognized   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   as the amortization happens as well. And we anticipate over the 14-year securitization period the equity carrying cost of between $20 million and $185 million to be recognized in current period earnings.     Paul I can't tell you how happy Brian is you asked that question."
"On the $0.04 to customer shopping in the quarter, is that net of what you might have picked up, or where does your retail margin as you go and competitively shop your power, where does the margin on that show up?","Well that is not a net number. That's the actual impact of those who have chosen other suppliers. As you might imagine the retail margin on sales from AEP retail are less than the margin you'd see had those customers stayed on the system. Brian, where exactly is--     In terms of the EEI line, on page 11 and 13, it's line 18, Generation of Marketing."
"Just some more questions on customer switching. What customer class I guess had the most switching? And my assumption is commercial, and I guess where would the loss of gross margin go if you saw all your Columbus Southern commercial customers switch?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","So, that is right. It is the commercial class of customers and primarily at Columbus and Southern Power Company and the place where you'd see that margin occurring in the Ohio companies, line 2 on pages 11 and 13.     And I think it's almost inconceivable to imagine that the entirety of the commercial load to Columbus Southern would move away from us and as I mentioned before as you know inside of ESP, a lot of that activity has to do with the arcane concept known as rate skewing. Our commercial customers typically pay more than the cost to serve them, and in the ﬁlings that we made inside the ESP, 1 of the things that actually is getting some pretty solid support is adjusting that rate skewing to better balance customer bills to customer costs. There are some self-correcting activities that will go forward in that sense."
"First of all, oﬀ-system sales, Second Quarter the levels, the new normals when we start thinking about the same quarter for next year or is it something slightly diﬀerent?","It's hard to say at this point, Michael, because of the impact of what Casper might have on that. I would obviously expect that people might have less volume to go in the shoulder periods and will be trying to optimize what they have available to go in the winter and southern months as load in pricing goes higher. So, it's really hard for us to tell what the new normal is going to be when we have the situation changing as much as it's going to under the Casper regime.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Got it. Second, O&M I know up for the quarter given the storm costs, what are you assuming in '11 guidance and in '12 guidance, meaning back second half of '11 and in your $3.25 for '12 in terms of O&M growth.","Second half of '11 we anticipate being very similar to the ﬁrst half being darn close to ﬂat consistent with what our guidance is and I'd anticipate that although we haven't come out with '12 we're going to be very conservative on O&M growth there as well.  Really the bulk of what we're trying to show in any growth at all in O&M is trying to have as much of that as possible picked up in trackers and as little of that as possible ﬂowing through as a net against revenue hitting the bottom line.     That's an important point, Michael that Brian makes. I think and it surely isn't missed by you or your colleagues. The fact of the matter is some of the increase in O&M has to do with the magnitude of the storms that we've experienced so far this year.  They don't hit that threshold that you go in for recovery in the normal course of business and in the various jurisdictions. And the other part of it is simply O&M authorities that have been granted to us by various commissions where you're recovering dollar-for-dollar for the increase in O&M.  As you know, we've been very aggressive to try to build more trackers and riders in our cases. Take Indiana as a perfect example, or I guess PSO may be a better example. They gave us a certain amount of money to underground activity so that the Tulsa region didn't see the same amount of interruptions on the system and every single dollar that they authorized to be spent was spent for that goal, as you'd expect us to do.  So net-net, the O&M discipline at American Electric Power continues to be strong. The headcount numbers continue to be right where we thought they would be so we keep a very, very close eye on that as we go forward. When you see those increases, I want to make sure and the question has given us the opportunity to put some granularity to it what's driving them."
"Got it. Last question, just in terms of rate ﬁlings, rate cases under way, I mean I think we're up-to- date on the ones that are under way now. But in terms of what you expect to ﬁle in the back end of 2011 for future rate increases either in 2012 or beyond?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, when we look at there probably aren't anymore that we would ﬁle yet this year in an impact of this year but there will be a few, and we'll give you some granularity on that, there will be some active cases as you might imagine.  As you know, the Virginia case will mature in '12 and the Michigan case will mature in '12 although it has the potential to settle in '11, so we'll see how it goes. We've got cases probably in Indiana as well and other jurisdictions. Net-net, we'll let you know what else we're looking at in the back of the year."
"As we look at your baseline historical emissions of the ﬂeet and say 2010, is that a reasonable proxy for where you are? Or, were you operating your existing controls as much as you could, could we get somewhere else on fuel switching. Should we think about as a static starting point or not?","No, that would probably be inappropriate. We will begin to operate the ﬂeet a bit diﬀerently. We're looking at some fuel selection diﬀerences. As you know, although not by tremendous amount, because we're getting more gassy, but American Electric Power, because of the size of our coal ﬂeet adding the gas facilities that we have will have some impact.  We've moved Dresden up in a much more aggressive construction cycle that will come to play in 2012, so it's probably inappropriate to use it as your base because the mix will change, the fuels will change and the footprint will go down some.  Having said that, and I know there's been some concern about how scrubbers are operating across the US ﬂeet, we're really operating at peak performance, 98% to 99% captures so we're quite satisﬁed. We're looking at Remedial action and changes to some of those scrubbers as we go and that's all working out quite well as well."
"So, in terms of how the scrubbers are performing 2010, you consider it to be a good base?","Oh, we do indeed.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
And then I know you've said you're studying the Casper rule and the impact. Is there any expectation that you'll update your compliance plan some time later this year as you work more on studying or what sort of time frame when you think about a change?,"I think what we did earlier on is pretty accurate. The only diﬀerence that we may see is that we're taking a real hard look at the dry sorbant approach to it rather than the major capital investments that we felt we might have to put on. But I think, I as you know, what we get on HAPs MAC is going to have probably a much larger eﬀect, so we don't want to get too granular about what we're going to do yet knowing that that's coming out in November."
"Mike, as you mentioned there's a lot of activity going on in Ohio. Could you also give us a quick update and remind us where you stand on the Remand proceedings that are going on there and also the distribution rate case?","Well they are all moving along at pace. The discussions that we're having on the ESP, of course, include the magnitude of all of the ﬁlings, so the merger docket, the Remand case as well as the overall distribution rate case, so they're all there.  They all have schedules established for the most part. The Commission staﬀ and the Commission, as well as the parties, are working through all of them as quickly as we can. I don't know, I don't want to leave you with the impression that there's some overall global settlement concept that may wrap them all up.  If that were doable we would be happy to do it, but there are uniquenesses to each of the cases and some of the interveners would rather see some of them processed to their conclusion while others of them may yield a better opportunity to settle."
"Okay, and separate question, as I recall when you had laid out your plan, your big environmental plan, had you assumed that there could be some delays in these proposals coming down the pike from the EPA, or was that based on what the existing proposals were laying out, can you just remind us of that?","It was based exactly as the proposals were and to the only update again as I mentioned, we're looking at diﬀerent technologies in response to the opportunity to address Casper, so we've not built any delay in there. What we've tried to do was show straightforward, veriﬁable view of the aﬀect of the draft rules as they stood at the time and the rules that we think will come out over time and the eﬀect that they'd have on our ﬂeet."
"Okay, and last question, Mike. In the past you folks have, in the recent past I should say, have been rumblings, musings from AEP. You're looking at your entire portfolio. There may be opportunities to monetize some of the assets, if it makes more sense, just give us an update on your current thinking there and could we expect something before the year is up?","No, I would think not. As we always do, we look at the assets and the opportunities that are in front of us. A couple of the jurisdictions continued to lag from what we would like to see them do but they're catching up in a hurry and we're encouraged by that. We're equally encouraged by the activities that we see from the FERC on their transmission ﬁnal rule 1,000.  I don't want to take too much time on this call. But I must say that Susan Tamasky who has headed that transmission group for us for the last handful of years was instrumental in pulling together the comments that American Electric Power made to the FERC and a number of those comments were very much evident in the ﬁnal rule as it was brought forth.  So, we're encouraged by what we see in transmission the opportunity to do that, Lisa Barden who has managed many of our negotiations with our joint venture partners with our transmission will take Susan's role. We'll miss Susan a great deal, but the whole notion of having her responsible for transmission during that period of time worked out exactly as we had hoped that it would. So we see a lot of investment opportunities with the assets that we have but we'll always look at monetizing anything if it seems better in the hands of another player.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay, and then secondly, in Ohio, I guess 1 potential outcome given that it seems like it's almost happened with Duke, is that they just don't get a plan done by the end of this year. What happens then and if you just kind of kept your current plan and had your fuel clause, et cetera? Is that really, how big a problem is that or not?","I don't think that would be a big issue at all if that's the way it ends up. I appreciate the point you make about Duke, because they've kind of gone from 1 footprint, 1 approach to another and then kind of morphed in with a hybrid of the 2. And that may be a bit troubling, but we have every reason to believe that we'll come to some resolution before the end of the year.  I think you know, I think everyone knows that the executive administration in the State of Ohio is in diﬀerent hands, very aggressive hands. Governor Kasik is a let's-get-it-done kind of person. I expect we'll see in order before the end of the year one way, shape or form. If that doesn't happen, we'll just continue on with where we are and that's not a bad news story for us at all."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   If after the 2012 election a political scenario plays out in which the climate bill was passed in say 2013 or '14, and you were able to get regulatory approval for CCS cost recovery, how long would it take to pick up from where you left oﬀ and complete the remaining 3 phases needed to realize commercial operation?","Quite honestly not that long of a period of time because again, as I mentioned we're taking it to the original engineering design. Now that would have to be brought up-to-date. Alstom and around the world, there's still a couple of projects going forward. As you know, Southern Company is working on some of the Amian technology down in Mississippi I believe. We all continue to look at that as a constructive undertaking. You've asked a very important question. Having spent a great deal of time in the international dialogue on these issues through a number of facilities that American Electric Power is involved with, it would appear to me that a carbon intensity plan is about as far as you're going to see China or India go.  And so, if we had legislation that really was driven toward carbon intensity in the United States going forward, that may cause some of the carbon capture and storage projects to go forward. We always thought we could get the ﬁnal design in about a year or less bid and construct in a year or more. So, it would stay on those kinds of timelines. What we thought originally was a 2014, '15 date if you had a piece of legislation by 2013 you may be looking more at 2017 or '18 timeline."
"I guess you mentioned, what would be the user proceeds? You said it would be all for debt reduction. Is that what I heard?",There will be some debt reduction at TCC and perhaps some re-balancing of the capital structure of that company but there will be a considerable dividend up to the parent.
And so what will the parent do with the dividend then?,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We have some signiﬁcant capital needs that we're going to be embarking on, as we've talked about our capital plan, and what we need to do in terms of environmental retroﬁts and the like. And we have some pretty signiﬁcant needs for that capital and our transmission business as well, in addition to our underlying utility businesses. So, we have plenty of uses to put that capital to work and have it earning for the shareholders of the Company.     And I think if it's really a concern over one-time equity issuances at the parent, I think that these kinds of activities surely lay those over."
"I understand but you have not baked that into your point estimate. Am I correct? I guess the beneﬁt of lower interest expense, that's the way I look at it. That's not really baked in into the $3.25. Is that a fair conclusion or no?","Yes, this was not Incorporated in our point estimate when we came out with it. We've since incorporated that in there and there have been a number of ins and outs and so I wouldn't just assume that there's some signiﬁcant upside associated with the capital infusion."
"You mentioned DS. Southern Company, obviously another big coal burner, has their doubts about whether DSI is really the silver bullet that a lot of people claim it is. What are your concerns around DSI?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Well I don't want to misrepresent, because the EPA laid that out as the ultimate silver bullet that would make life go on without anyone ever having to pass away. It isn't quite that good.  What we're saying, is that when we look at particularly some of our western plants, we may be able to use that technology there with a combination of some fuel blending in our western stations. And that will have an eﬀect of 1, maybe being able to do it more rapidly than we thought because they aren't as massive a construction project. And 2, not as expensive, because they aren't as massive a construction project. But we, like Southern Company, actually see these things very much the same.  We kind of lay on top of each other with understanding the impact and we don't think that it's a silver bullet but we do think it's a technology that may lend itself to use there. And our engineers are pretty far along the line with those conclusions.  In fairness, as you might expect, we and Southern Company do dialogue on these issues frequently. We will share with them what we think we see, but of course as you know, they don't have the same Lignite based ﬂeet that we do out West."
I would tend to trust your and Southern combustion engineers more than EPA.,"As would I. As would I. You probably pay more than we do, Paul."
