Question,Answer
"Listen, a couple of your neighbors in Ohio have made announcements that they're looking to exit their generation assets through a sales process. Can you just give us an update on what your thought process is for your ﬂeet and what bearing the First Quarter may or may not have had on making that decision?","Yes, I think our process is unchanged. We've said earlier that we're going to be focusing on producing value out of that piece of the business, to position that business the best we can, to try to take some of the volatility out of the business, and certainly to do what we can from a cost standpoint within that business. And Chuck and his team are deﬁnitely working on all of those activities.  The First Quarter doesn't change our opinion of our look at that business one way or another. And I think that as we go through the process, we still have yet to see those precursors that we talked about earlier. What happens to the capacity markets, certainly what happens to the energy markets, what we can do with the cost structure of that business, and then how do we take the volatility out of the business with, not only the capacity markets, but the hedging activities that are occurring in the background relative to that unregulated generation.  But we're still on the same time schedule, having the same discussions with our Board as we go through this process. And we'll continue that and make decisions later on in this year and the next year."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I guess, Nick, one of the ideas if you could ﬁnd people who would sign longer-term contracts you would be interested in staying in those assets. With the First Quarter volatility and kind of (inaudible) market conditions, are you having a change in tone in those conversations at this juncture?","Yes. It's sort of interesting. There is discussion about long-term purchase power arrangements that could occur relative to this generation. I think the polar vortex and the sense that there's -- certainly there's no -- when you look at the long-term markets, it's illiquid. There's not much out there going on.  And it sort of tends to keep those prices low in the future. But we know that the closer we get to this generation retiring, that's likely to change. And I ﬁrmly believe there is a renewed interest in what that generation looks like, and how it can preserve from a long-term PPA perspective, customers' expectations taking out that volatility and having some consistency.  Yes, we are getting some interest in that, yet to determine what that means. But if we see sustained energy prices that are higher than anticipated, and the capacity markets move up, I'm sure that degree of interest will intensify, as well. Again, our position has not changed relative to that. If we can make it look quasi-regulated, then it's a business that's worth taking a look at."
Great. Thank you. Just one last question. Can you give us an update on where coal inventories are at this point in time and the strategy around the country of full availability for the summer?,"Yes. So we're ﬁne on coal deliveries. We're at about 25 days on average on the system. We were 35 days going into the winter. And keep in mind our supplies are taken to the Mississippi and then we have the barge business to bring that coal to the plants. So we're in good shape there.  And most of our deliveries were over the Union Paciﬁc railroad and their performance has been reasonably well done, as well. I think as we move into summer, that's when inventory levels start to improve. But in anticipation of warmer weather over the summer. But we're in great shape.     Dan, we've heard of some people doing things like burning more gas to build up their coal inventories. We went into the winter fairly healthy and we haven't had to change our dispatch or commitment at all in response to our coal levels."
"Great. Thank you, guys.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Sure.  Operator  The next question is from the line of Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Brian."
"So $60 million to $70 million in bringing forward costs from 2015 and 2016 together? So, in other words, the expense levels in 2015 and 2016 prior to this announcement we should have thought about as being $60 million to $70 million higher over the two years?","Yes. It was forecasted to be spent for us in 2015 and 2016, and we've now taken those costs and activities out of 2015 and 2016 and are now reﬂecting them in 2014."
"And is that more of a front end loaded, as in more 2015 level of cost shifting, or is it more back end loaded as in 2016? And then also, could you give a little bit more of a business segment breakdown of that cost shifting?","It's evenly spread across both years, and it's across all of our business segments with a signiﬁcant component of it coming from generation and moving outages out of those years into 2014."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Excellent. Thank you, very much.","Thank you, Brian.  Operator  And the next question is from the line of Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Great. Thank you. I wanted to talk more about your high case growth plans in transmission. You're showing real good progress this year. Could you maybe talk at a high level as to, as you think about what needs to happen to be able to achieve that growth over the next couple of years in terms of whether that would be approvals or planning eﬀorts, resource, whatever it might be, just how we should think about the risk of execution, or what approvals, what milestones, you need to be able to hit to achieve that growth?","We've been very clear for probably two or three years now that -- I don't know if you can recall the slide that had the base transmission and then it had a green piece above it that was incremental transmission that were real projects that were ready to be done. But we had to ﬁnd the capital to do it. And what you see in this quarter is a refocus of $200 million on that incremental green portion.  So as far as risk, there's very little risk associated with those projects. They're already identiﬁed, ready to be done. And you can expect those returns relative to those investments to occur. And as we look forward to the business, I think we've been a proponent of Order 1000 and very focused on our joint ventures, as well, and our Transource entity, ETT and others.  And they have moved forward pretty well, as well. So we continue to look for ways to continue to improve the transmission earnings proﬁle, and that's a very distinct focus for us. But the only things we're reporting are real projects. And we sort of learned our lesson awhile back about the supposition of what may happen. We've gotten over that.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Stephen, the beauty of the chart that shows the incremental transmission spend that we can make going from the base case to the high case is that we can fund that serially as capital becomes available. So whether it's cash ﬂows from operations, if bonus depreciation should get approved later this year, we can serially fund that incremental growth capital on a year-by-year basis.  And as we've talked about earlier, cash ﬂows from operations enabled us to do it this year, and we'll just see how the end of this year and future years play out. But since we have that growth opportunity existing within our own business, that's an awful smart place for us to put incremental capital to work."
"That's great color. Thank you. And just a follow-up on transmission, when you look at the competitive side of the business, I was just curious if you could talk at a high level as to the competitive dynamics there? How competitive is it? How do you assess your capabilities versus others? How is that business playing out?","I think we are absolutely well positioned from a competitive standpoint. Obviously, that's why we've been a proponent of it. But when we look at the projects that we do, the project ﬂow, the project management structure, the engineering expertise that we have and the fact that we've got joint ventures around portions of the country, and just the scope of our transmission system drives the beneﬁts for our investors relative to transmission.  We're well positioned in terms of the breadth. And if you're plowing $1.7 billion a year in transmission projects, which that's what we're doing over the next three-year period each year, that's a pretty substantial critical mass around the growth of transmission. So we're not gold plating anything.  We're not trying to ﬁnd projects just to do projects. These are all needed projects in terms of refurbishment and reoptimization of the grid with retirements in generation and so forth. So a very clear path for the business case relative to transmission as far as AEP is concerned."
"So quick follow-up there on the generation business. I'd be curious, is there any palatability in Ohio as you're thinking about it to perhaps see some of those longer-term contracts against the remainder of the generation business in particular?","Yes, it's sort of an interesting thing. Ohio certainly needs to take notice in my opinion of what happened during the polar vortex. And I would have to say that there is discussions going on relative to how Ohio would deal with that in the future because it's a clear indication that we really do need to think about the portfolio for Ohio customers that has a long-term component and a short-term component to it, and customers are continued to allowed to switch.  But keep in mind, we separated our generation, and it is separated. So if we were to do purchase power arrangements and that kind of thing, it would have to be something that provides value to consumers on the long term, but also value to the Company as far as hedging that generation for the long term. And I think there is a distinct opportunity for those types of discussions.  It's a positive for us, it's a positive for Ohio, and it's certainly a positive for consumers in the long run, particularly industrial customers who looking to the polar vortex and where energy markets went, and there's a high degree of concern about that. So more work to be done there."
"Interesting. Is it about saving some of the more marginal coal assets kind of in a more normalized environment, or is this about just, again, security of supply? I suppose you could kind of cut it both ways?","I think it's cut both ways. When you look at jobs, taxes, certainly generation within Ohio, and the fact that Ohio really depended upon the capacity markets to provide long-term price signals, we know that's not going to happen, or at least not has happened thus far. So there is a degree of interest there that needs to occur relative to taking matters in their own hands from an Ohio perspective.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Interesting. And I would be curious, following up on all of the Utica discussion, are you seeing any nascent development on the gas project front? I would be curious just in terms of a new gas plant entry and also broadly where gas basis is headed in your neck of the woods up there?","Well, I think it's a challenge in Ohio because, certainly from a Utica standpoint, it's a great opportunity to use a resource that's indigenous within Ohio. But at the same time, you've got to have the fundamentals and the market and an improving economy to drive that investment. And right now you have at least some glimmer of hope on the economic recovery, but at the same time the market signals just aren't there. So we need to get that solidiﬁed before you see a natural gas-type development."
"Good morning. So I understand you're taking the opportunity to accelerate some expenses into the year given the phenomenal opportunities you had in the First Quarter and the earnings result. But then also looking at the updated earnings guidance range, are you assuming as a baseline that your annual sales forecast comes in as originally articulated, or are you assuming that you see the trend line as you saw it in the First Quarter?","We haven't changed the load forecast at this point in the guidance, even in the adjusted guidance range that we've now given. Because we're very clear that one quarter does not make a trend. And certainly from a polar vortex perspective, because there was a continued cold weather -- could that have skewed the weather normalization routines that we usually go through to adjust these numbers.  Whenever you get extreme heat or extreme cold for a long period of time, you would have to question that. So we're going to have to see some, during this coming quarter and the Third Quarter a consistency around that before we make those kinds of adjustments. And we're being deliberately conservative there.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Greg, we are forecasting -- we have factored into the forecast the higher wholesale prices for the balance of the year.     Yes. As far as energy prices, that's changed."
"And then you're saying that, when I look at page 8, that 4.4%, 1Q 2014 residential weather normal number, you're saying you're nervous that it might not be an accurate number and, therefore, you want to see how things trend in the second and Third Quarter?","Yes, I'm just saying we don't know to the degree at this point to really make that adjustment. But I think it's pretty clear, though, that directionally it's in the right direction. It is increasing. The question is the order of magnitude. And before we make that adjustment, we want to be very secure in what we're seeing.     Greg, for the ﬁrst time in some time, we saw in both the residential and commercial classes signiﬁcantly higher average normalized usage. And we're concerned that the normalization models don't behave as well at describing the weather eﬀects versus the normal eﬀects in extreme weather. So we would like to see another quarter before we start thinking about changing the balance of the year load forecast."
"Great. Thanks. Obviously, great start. Congratulations.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Thank you.     Thank you, Greg.  Operator  Next question is from the line of Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead."
"The sales growth forecast, the 10-year load forecast that you guys recently put out, indicates kind of, sort of lower growth over 10 years. I guess negative growth or just ﬂattish or what have you. And I was wondering if you could sort of comment on that and whether or not you think that might change with the legislation that's being proposed, and just sort of how we should think about that?  I guess this is all Ohio. I'm sorry. If you could just sort of discuss sort of a little bit about that and what you think is going on there?","Yes. So sort of a frame of reference that was used in that. If you looked at, sort of comparing apples and oranges because one includes Ormet. Obviously, the future anticipated it does not. So if you exclude Ormet, the energy is increasing."
"Okay. But the load forecast itself, when I look at it, seems like it's declining or just slightly ﬂat really over the years. It doesn't look like there's really much change, let's say, from 2016 to 2024?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, that's true. We've been anticipating for a period now that load forecasting would be relatively ﬂat. And we haven't changed that, because we haven't seen the longevity of the fundamentals. We've seen initial indication in the Fourth Quarter of last year. I think we've seen a broader indication this First Quarter. But I think we'll be more comfortable when we see another quarter or two and make that determination."
"Okay. Does any of this have to do with the legislation that's being -- that's currently in place or might change in Ohio, or could that have an impact that we should think about? And if so, can you give us a feeling for that.","No, overall, the energy eﬃciency was pretty negligible to begin with in the overall scheme of things. But as far as the legislation is concerned, it's not a signiﬁcant impact at all."
"Okay. And then just following up on Julien's question on sales -- I'm sorry -- contracting, it sounded to me like there might be some industrial interest in this. But also I wasn't clear whether or not there's any governmental interest in this. There was some comments on the part of the Governor in Ohio about sort of second thoughts, perhaps, on a deregulation and whether it was the best move.  I was wondered if you could just sort of elaborate a little bit if there is a thought like, hey, you mentioned fuel diversity and what have you. But perhaps the thought that something new should change from a state policy perspective to sort of ensure that there's fuel diversity and all of the things that nuclear and coal provide?","Yes. And certainly the Governor Kasich can speak for himself. But there certainly is recognition by -- and it's apparent by the Governor and, as well, others, including industrials -- that we really have to think about how to address this lack of market consistency, particularly as it relates to the PJM capacity market.  But we do have legislation in place. We do have competition that's there. Our generation is separated. So you really have to think about that in the context of how you make these adjustments.  And keep in mind, we in December, AEP ﬁled its ESP case with a PPA arrangement from a portion of our units that was in a partnership, our OVEC units, that allowed for recovery through a purchased power arrangement. And you could see some expansion of that PPA to accommodate other generation resources within the state. And that would be a way to address at least some portion of the overall requirements of Ohio customers that could be served with a long-term formula based-rate contract that could supply some of those needs.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And that's something that could done. And I think as people become more aware of where we stand relative to retirements of coal-ﬁred generation, where we stand in terms of, if we do have an economic recovery that's occurring at the same time, Ohio has to really think about not only the investment potential for new generation, but also the maintenance of existing generation. And that's what the key component of these discussions would entail."
"Do you think there would be any need for a change in regulatory or legislation, or would that entail any of that, or is this something that could be done under the current construct as you see it?","No. We see it as something that could be done under the current construct as evidenced by our PPA arrangement that we ﬁled in our ESP ﬁling late last year. We believe that could be done. And customers could continue to choose, although in all likelihood, the long-term PPAs would be a non-by-passable charge or something like that that would beneﬁt Ohio in total. But at the same time, allow customers to continue to shop and choose suppliers."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Quick question on the -- I think in the annual guidance you had laid out, I think, $175 million for rate relief as the target. Can I just conﬁrm, it's the $65 million that you had in the First Quarter, is that on an apples-apples basis, is $65 million of the $175 million in the bag? Is that the right way to think about it?","I think it's more than that.     It's on an annualized basis, the $175 million. So it's for the full year of 2014. So we're -- of the $175 million that we had previously identiﬁed, we're right on track to get all of that."
"Okay. Thanks, Brian. And one other thing. I was just curious as you look at the portfolio and how it performed in the First Quarter, you, obviously, had some of the sales commitments, and then access to sell spot. If you had kind of imagined a world where you hadn't had the plants that you're going to be shutting, would you still have been net long and would you have been kind of more in places short, and how is the portfolio kind of evolving to address that?","Well, it's two things. One is there clearly would have been less volume, right. There was a 52% capacity factor on the 1,800 megawatts. But it's what the whole country is facing. There would be less volume and likely higher prices. So we don't know what the net eﬀect of that would be. Would we have had more hours at $1,800 a megawatt hour?      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And keep in mind, too, that from a generation perspective, we no longer have the obligation to serve in Ohio. So it really is about an optimization business as opposed to ever increasing demands and having to serve them. So that really drives a whole diﬀerent business model relative to that. And then from the overall market context, as Brian said, certainly there's implications in shortage of capacity. And I think people are realizing that.     To answer your question directly, Jonathan, is we would still be net long."
"Just want to clarify that the $200 million transmission is not an acceleration, it's actually incremental that you found because you had this capital head room?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That's right. It's incremental.
And I didn't see any discussion of Ohio shopping. Is that a big impact or have we kind of lapped out at this point?,We're in the upper 60% right now in terms of switching and we anticipated that by the end of the year we would be at about 71% switched.
"Hi. First a clariﬁcation. The 25-day coal piles you have now, what would that be versus like a normal or a year ago?","Oh, it's -- last year I think we were still at the 30-, 35-day range.     Yes.     I think it was 35. We moved from 45 to 35. But it's not unusual. We've had -- we've had inventory levels in the past as low as 10 days. So it's not anything that we have to do any corrective action around."
"Okay. Second question is on -- I think you mentioned that the PJM uplift charges was a bit of a drag in the quarter. Were you able to pass those through at all, or do you have to kind of absorb those?",So the ones that identiﬁed -- that made up most of that $0.05 per share diﬀerence for the vertically integrated were in the jurisdictions where we couldn't pass them through. In some of our jurisdictions we are allowed to pass them through on trackers.     You couldn't pass them through in trackers. You have the opportunity to recover them.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   In future periods.     In future periods.
"Okay. And are you going to see equal recovery like FirstEnergy is on some of these, on your retail contracts? Can you do that?","Yes. So those are -- these are diﬀerent items that we're talking about. One was for the vertically integrated utilities. And then there's the issue of passing through to customers on our competitive retail side.  We've made a corporate decision that we're not going to pass those through associated with the First Quarter of this year. We had a misstep and some customers started to see those charges pass through. We've gone back and since corrected that. And for this quarter, we are not passing those incremental charges through to our competitive retail customers."
"Okay. One last question. We're going to get the EPA greenhouse gas rule soon for existing. I'm just, Nick, curious what you're expecting there and how you're thinking about potential implications?","Yes. If you hear what's being said, certainly Gina McCarthy has been public about, certainly they don't have any -- at least they're not focused on anything relative to reducing the reliability of the grid.  I think that's clearly within question now. And she has reinforced the point that they're not trying to take coal away. They are concerned about the reliability of the grid and won't do anything to impair that. So there's somewhat of an expectation that they may go outside the fence and focus on energy eﬃciency and those types of things with the states and give the states -- which   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   they said they would give the states a lot of opportunity to be able to come up with their mechanisms to adjust to the new targets.  So it's going to be -- in my opinion, it's going to wind up being a state process that we go through, and one that at least is supposed to provide a signiﬁcant amount of ﬂexibility in how we respond. And certainly with HAPs MACT went a lot further than anyone anticipated in terms of retirements of generation.  In fact, AEP is already 21% lower than 2005 levels and the president's targets were 17% by 2020. So the industry has already come a long way and in particular AEP has. So I think as long as they give that geographic and state ﬂexibility, we should have an opportunity to respond in a very credible fashion."
"And I want to compare it to the same slide from the First Quarter of 2013's earnings call. Because if I do that, except for Ohio Power in Texas, pretty much everything else is down year- over-year, rolling 12 months. How much of those decreases do you attribute to weather versus other factors?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. I don't see much of it in terms of weather. I think the ones that are down have investments that are occurring. Like there's the transfers that occurred to APCo and to Kentucky that takes awhile to stabilize after you make these because there's certain settlement deals that are done.  And then you come in for rate cases for recovery for Mitchell and Kentucky and so forth. And then, of course, Turk being just built and SWEPCo. And then for transmission they have the investment cycle that is going on there. So I think it's really more a reﬂection of the timing of the investment cycle.  And, certainly, we worked long and hard on putting writers in place to bring the revenue more concurrent. But on these large capital investments, we continue to work through the rate process. In Indiana, it has been very positive because certainly the I&M team has been very successful in putting legislation in place that essentially allows that recovery more quickly for things like the nuclear lifecycle management.  So I would not read that as we have a continued deterioration of ROEs. I would read it as more of where we're at in the investment cycle."
"Got it. Okay. And just, when you think about 2014 and 2015, what eﬀorts, kind of speciﬁc, whether it's speciﬁc jurisdiction or speciﬁc state, do you anticipate trying to get done that makes a structural change to reduced lag?","Hum.     Certainly, Kentucky. Getting the Mitchell assets reﬂected in Kentucky's base rate is a big component of that. And that's what a lot of the drag on Kentucky's ROE is, it's equity component has increased so much from the transfer of those Mitchell assets over there.     And APCo and West Virginia, and, certainly, that ROE has been low for a long period of time. And it's -- while Virginia has stabilized in a very good place, West Virginia, we still need to work on. That's why we're making the ﬁling this year. So those initiatives are being placed to do that. And then as far as SWEPCo is concerned, we continue to look for a home relative to the investment, the 88 megawatts of Turk station. And Arkansas should be looking at that at some point, hopefully, because they see the value of those assets. And then overall load growth and some reductions in some of the capacity of the PPA contracts that ﬂow to SWEPCo have ended.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So there's an opportunity for the use of that additional capacity and energy within the SWEPCo portfolio. And there's initiatives in regard to that, as well. So you can bet that any of these that appear low at this point, there's a whole litany of actions being taken in the background to bring those back up to acceptable levels."
