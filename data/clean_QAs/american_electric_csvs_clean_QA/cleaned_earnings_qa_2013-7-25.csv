Question,Answer
"I'm good. I hear your enthusiasm and optimism about the ongoing ability of the Company to improve ROE in states where you're underearning and control costs, but there's still a lot of skepticism about very signiﬁcant headwind from 2015 and 2017 coming from the most recent PJM capacity result as pertains to your ability to sustain 4% to 6% growth rate.  Will you just talk a little bit more about your planning horizon and what you think the tools are in your tool box to plow through that headwind?","Yes, Greg, we learned this early on in my tenure we had a $250 million problem with Ohio and now this time around we have 2.5 to three years to get this fully resolved from a sustainability fashion.  As I mentioned early from the O&M issues and the revenue enhancements that we have going on, it's crescendoing over time. The plant ideas were an example of that. Six to eight plants going through it this next year and the rest of the plants going through the following year.  And then we also have the buying measures, the diﬀerences in the way they operate the plant. Certainly the unregulated plants are now looking at -- they can look across the board at areas of fuel. Fuel as part of the business case for some of the things they do, which typically is hard to do in a regulated environment because of the diﬀerent capital versus fuel decisions. But also, Chuck is looking deeply at that team to ﬁgure out what the overhead costs look like.  We have to address that because it's in a competitive environment. These plants are focused on making sure they survive and they intend on doing that. So I think, and really, I guess the optimism is coming from the fact that our employees have already come together to ﬁnd objectives in terms of savings and revenue enhancements for the year that are in excess of the targets that we had in place. And that's conﬁrming this year but also it's setting the track record for the future years because we're only getting partial beneﬁts from some of these in 2013.  Some of these things are starting to kick in now and will kick in later in the year and we'll get the full year beneﬁts in 2014 and then with the additional ideas and things that we are doing, particularly lean wires, those types of activities will continue and we'll see those beneﬁts going in the future years.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So and I guess another issue with that is mid-2014 there will be another capacity auction for the future year, so that will give us insight in terms of how we deal with in that speciﬁc year of late 2016 and early 2017, which straddles two years, but as well, we have to decide how much of this is one time adjustments where we can move around outages and those types of things versus how much is actually sustaining into the future.  But it really goes to the question of the volatility of that business and what that means to our planning associated with that. We're not wasting any time, obviously. We are acting like we are going to have to have sustainable savings going forward that compensates for the crafty [ph] auction in late 2016, early 2017, but if it winds up being a capacity market moving up in the future then that could be a diﬀerent thing.  I think we certainly are in a position now, though, to where we are conﬁdent that we are changing a culture that focuses on our ability to address these types of issues. We have to and that's what we are paid to do. And that's something I think our employees are certainly energized around to achieve.  As I said earlier in the discussion, I had it probably, I was thinking originally, we may be able to exceed 6% if we had more transmission spending and those types of things. Well, the more transmission spending we have our eye on is going to fortify that 4% to 6% and it would be silly for us to sit here and say it hasn't had any impact because it has had an impact. I think it has had an impact on our ability to exceed the 6% as opposed to be that 4% to 6% range."
Good morning. I'm going to carry on with Greg's question. You gave a very thorough answer. Maybe  A little more simply when you look at the Ohio generation and the uncertainty that RPM's are created around economic viability and visibility to the business. How are you guys seeing that ﬁt within AEP and was RPM a point where you were pushed to make a more drastic decision than you were hoping?,"Yes, certainly if capacity prices had stayed in there at a reasonable level, it probably wouldn't have had everyone questioning the 4% to 6% or our ability to get the cost savings that we need to make sure we were sustainable in the future. I think it raises a lot of questions and we are addressing those questions.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   But it also puts us even more focused on how we adjust that particular business, and we talk about minimum load adjustments, for example. The Amos plant reduced its minimal load by over 1,000-megawatts. That's a big change and takes a lot of cost out of the way we operate in relation to the market.  Our people have a very, and I'm not going to say what it is, but certainly they have a very aggressive measure on what they are trying to achieve in terms of a clearing price for capacity that they operate under. But we have a lot of work to do, and I can say that business, if it remains as volatile as it is, if we don't get this capacity construct working where it should, where it respects the long-term investments made by steeling the ground investors in the territory, then that's not something we are very interested in.  It doesn't ﬁt what we believe our investors are looking for and we'll need to make adjustments.   Dan, I know you talked about this in the past. We were very aggressive on moving on Muskingum River 5 as we saw the results of this and recognized the capacity environment didn't lend itself to further investment in that unit.  And we're going to be very disciplined in terms of the capital that we put to work in that regard and right now not an area that's attracting a lot of capital from us, as compared lower volatility, higher growth areas like our transmission business.  We have been disciplined in the past and we're going to demonstrate that discipline as we work our way through this capacity pricing issue.     I don't know that the generation function itself can make up that diﬀerence. If you are thinking about what energy prices can be in the future, we don't want to bank on what energy prices will be in the future, we just assume they're going to be low.  We have to adjust accordingly, and it's not just a matter of looking at the unregulated generation business itself. It's also a matter of looking at the overhead that's charged that generation business. If there's less units running, if they're running in diﬀerent ways, and you're compartmentalizing the proﬁt /loss picture of each unit, then it drives a very diﬀerent supporting structure from Corporate that supports it. So there's a lot of work to be done and we'll be doing it."
"And one other question looking at the load trends, and obviously the bankruptcies [ph] kind of skew the industrial number, made it a little bit worse than it otherwise would be. Usage trends haven't been great. You've seen unemployment fall. You've seen economic growth in the region. What is the prognosis, do you think, for power demand growth for your territories going   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   forward and is there something bigger structural happening from usage that will really limit future demand growth?","I think we continue to see soft load because and it's probably two things, energy eﬃciency is part of it.  Also, it's an area where the economy through the entire country but certainly in our area as well, there's been a lasting impact of that at the ﬁrst of the year, economists were saying by the Third Quarter things would pick up.  We were always saying, and have been saying for several quarters now, since the Third Quarter of last year, the industrials were tenuous as best and that continues to be the case. I think there are some structural changes that are occurring. We'll continue to have energy eﬃciency in play.  The question is can the electriﬁcation of the economy outstrip the energy eﬃciency piece of the business that enables us to continue to grow. But you can't bank on that and that's why I say our business is going to be more about optimization and providing services to customers as well that provide additional beneﬁts beyond what you see just strictly in the low numbers.  But I also believe that, and, as Brian pointed out, the oil and gas activity in our footprint is prevalent with the (inaudible) shell and others, those are wet gas. We have a lot of dry gas top formations.  If we ever get to a point where the economy starts to pick up like the economists keep projecting at some point, we'll beneﬁt probably more than others because of that indigenous growth associated with the shale gas footprint and the production capability associated with it. And that's actually been our saving grace on the other primary metals industrial losses that have occurred. So I'd say certainly with a growing economy but also with the intensive focus on energy-related infrastructure, particularly in our service territory, that could be a beneﬁt. And I'm probably more optimistic. I guess I'm probably if its pessimism, is where is it going to happen.  We've all been waiting for an economic recovery and you hear a lot about housing construction. I see a lot of commercial and housing construction in our service territory and I also see the top of the, all the corn in the ﬁelds are still green so that's a good sign. But we really do need an emphasis placed on how to move this economy forward."
"Good morning. Two quick questions. One is that it seems everyone is focused on the 2016 and beyond. How could you help us forecast transmission earning? You guys have a great trajectory of transmission earnings, roughly $0.35 you are from projecting in 2015.  What is the best way to forecast it going forward? And the second question. You mentioned during your opening remarks with RPM, and it seems like it's all over the map. It's just kind of throwing numbers out of a hat. What does AEP think the reserve margin is? Actually steel in the ground versus when you're adding in all the demand response and everything else.","What steel you put in the ground that's important. We've already ﬁnished our build cycle related to generations. Operational, we bought natural gas, that's all done in our eastern footprint and so we're at a point where we can decide probably for the ﬁrst time in a long time where our capital is deployed.  Much of it was driven by environmental spend, it was driven by new generation spend. Now it's driven by block and tackle infrastructure spending that typically commissions don't have an issue with. As a matter of fact they support it.  And they should because we're at a stage where there's a rehabilitation of the grid that needs to occur. What we are trying to focus on is whether those no regrets types of activities and optimization of transmission is no regrets.  Infrastructure build related to distribution is no regret. Certainly, the investment we are making from an environmental standpoint we have about $4 billion to $5 billion left to spend associated with the particular plants that with we have. But we're doing it in a very diﬀerent way.  We're not going out and building and then asking for recovery of it. We are going in at the beginning and saying, okay, before we start construction on this thing in a big way we need to know are we going to be able to recover it and in the case of Kentucky we haven't. In the case of Arkansas, we have because there's diﬀerent set of circumstances and we're more than willing to do that.  In fact, we want to move more of our capital to those infrastructure areas. And that's the kind of steel in the ground that makes sense. With demand side resources, certainly I'm all for demand side resources but not to the point of really jeopardizing the reliability of the grid by depending on those kinds of resources for only a speciﬁc set of hours during the year as opposed to the things that we run into in the real world from an operational perspective.  I started out as an electric system dispatcher and my experience was in interconnected power system operations. And I can tell you what's going on now is wrong and it needs to be ﬁxed. But that said demand side resources certainly generation with ﬁrm transmission coming into the area is a beneﬁt and we should be mindful of that because we are optimizing resources and deﬁning a new set of resources that includes new technologies as well. So my view is we stay   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   with optionality around the resource side of things but focus on those enabling areas where we can accommodate those resources and provide better services to our customers.   Anthony, we hope to have more detail for you on the growth trajectory of transmission about the EEI conference time frame. We are working on that capital rotation now. And one thing we've never done is show you earnings we hope to get or think we might get or projects that may come together. We've really tried to show projects that are either approved or don't need further approval and that's why we're reluctant to go out too far in terms of transmission growth rate beyond areas where we've been through the planning process of the RTO's.     Anthony, I'll add on to that.  We are already looking at additional transmission projects that can be put in place and addressed more quickly because frankly that's part of the revenue stream and the additional earnings that would partially ﬁll the gap for this capacity issue that we had. So we have every motivation to continue with our transmission investment and every motivation to ﬁnd and release every bit of capital.  One thing that gets forgotten in all this, the performance management side of things also produces capital alleviation beneﬁts that can be redeployed to other areas including transmissions. Sp we're not just about O&M changes, we're about capital changes as well to accommodate that and fuel that future growth. So as Brian said at EEI we'll have more information on that."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   A quick one on just the quarterly sales and commercial. You mentioned, Brian, I think that you were strong still in Texas and Ohio but you didn't say very much about what had underpinned the big drop. Was it a couple of speciﬁc items or something more broad, can you give us more color and what suddenly turned so negative there?","And it was largely broader-based across the area. The place where we saw the increase was associated with shale gas plays and growth in employment and the other areas we just weren't seeing that growth in employment as much as we were and it was pretty much broad-based across the sector.  The one thing, Jonathan, that I'll say and we look at these monthly we look at, we discuss with you quarterly weather normalized sales. You really need to look at I think the trend over time to try and understand what's happening with load and can't take it quarter to quarter.  Up modestly in the First Quarter this year down greater than 2% in the Second Quarter. You need to kind of look at a trend line for the quarterlies for a sense of what you think is going on. With the exception of Texas and Ohio the decrease was pretty broadly based."
"Thank you. Secondly, on just to understand this interest comma item, so there was like $0.06 of beneﬁt relating to reversing previous negative related to the UK windfall tax. Is that correct?","So it's separated in two categories. One is the interest income component of it and the other is the tax component. Interest income we always reﬂect on ongoing earnings.  To the point where, speciﬁcally associated with this item, we had a negative in the Fourth Quarter of last year as we thought the case was going against us and then PPNL won their case at the US Supreme Court. And since we had previously adjusted for this in operating earnings, the interest income component reﬂecting the same treatment that we always had for interest income."
The negative was booked Q4 last year. This reverses that eﬀectively.,It doesn't entirely reverse it. We took a partial write-down of that in the Fourth Quarter of last year where we had previously accounted for the interest income and then we had the full reversal this year. But the full treatment of this issue has always been in ongoing earnings.
The whole conversation going on with the Commission around trying to reduce tariﬀ. How should we -- is there any kind of guidance exposure to that? Or how should we be thinking about that as we watch it play out.,"You know, so I wouldn't want to talk speciﬁcally about the discussions with the commission that we are having. There are issues as to whether or not Ormat stays in business or not altogether and those items are fairly small for us. If Ormat were to stop operations altogether, the pre-tax would be about $2.8 million per month. So for the balance of the year maybe $0.025 for all of 2014, maybe $0.045 per share."
"Good morning, guys. On the PGM outcome and implications, does it have any change besides Muskingum 5 to your co plans or shutdown plans or EPA spend. Are those under any kind of review because of that?","No, not at this point obviously. We've addressed Muskingum River 5. That was the one issue where we had an incremental investment that would have to be made and related to natural gas.  If the market didn't support making that investment then we retire it. The others plan to be retired anyway which we've already written those oﬀ in terms of an impairment.  So the others are fully controlled units that operate well in the market but we are certainly focused on that year and ensure that we are driving costs out and eﬃciencies that we can draw through the market and make sure they continue to operate. So we don't see anything else at this point.     Steve, we've been proactive in getting out in front of this, as Nick mentioned. We had those units we knew we were going to retire in 2015 and the Ohio components of them we wrote oﬀ late last year. And then we had bubble units and Muskingum River 5 is one where we thought we were going to be able to retroﬁt it and run it on gas through 2028. And the capacity results just made that not a prudent investment for us. So it went from being on the bubble to being a unit that makes sense for us not to operate after 2015.
