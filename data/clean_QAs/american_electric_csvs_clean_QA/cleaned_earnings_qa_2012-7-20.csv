Question,Answer
"Good morning. I have a question on customer switching. And I believe on the call you had said that about 34% of your Ohio customers have switched, and I want to know how that compares to the expectation you guys ﬁled in Ohio, and I believe that was Bill Allen's testimony. Are you in line with that or are -- is the switching ahead of what you guys are forecasting?","I think it is lower than expectations. However, after this last order we would expect switching to accelerate."
"Question number one is, O&M has been one of these great success stories for 2012 so far. Can you just maybe give a little more color on how much of the year-over-year savings is kind of durable and sustainable, versus kind of timing-related around maintenance schedules and that sort of thing with the ﬂeet, and what kind of inﬂation we should be kind of modeling oﬀ in this level?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes, Dan, we've had some pretty good savings. Actually our employees have responded quite credibly to the reductions from the Ohio-related activities, and we have adjusted.  Some of those -- the majority have been sustainable type of reductions, although some of them are not and -- such as the deferral of outages and those types of things. But that is the whole reason why we are having the repositioning study done, where we are going through and deﬁning sustainable cost reduction opportunities, either through process-related activities or organizational activities.  And we recognize that cost-cutting -- we can't continue a process of cost cutting and cost cutting. We have to have a view going forward of sustainable reductions that provide us a base where we can continue to progress as a Company. So that is what we're really focused on. Brian, you may have some additional detail.     No. You hit the nail on the head, Nick. When we had talked about guidance that has since been suspended for 2012, we talked about O&M in that $3.4 billion range. I would probably put it in the $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion range. And with what we're doing with McKenzie, we anticipate it being in a similar range for next year."
"So we should see ﬂat O&M next year. That is interesting. Nick, I guess with the gas plants running really well, gas prices, low coal prices, kind of running into some cash pressures, are you guys doing any work to reevaluate the environmental plan for EPA compliance? At $6 billion as far as -- I mean less plant investment and more new generation, or how is that dialogue going internally?","That continues to be a work in progress, Dan. It changes as we get new information, and changes as a result of discussions we have with the states and with the EPA. And of course we continue to work, as I've said, on the legislative side because EPRI has done an independent analysis showing that it costs one-third less if you wind up with a two-year extension, if you're able to optimize that.  But I think it is important for us to go through the process in concert with the states, and it really focuses on that operating company model where we're working with them to determine what the proper solution is. And you're right; we continue to search. And as you see some of the changes that have been made, such as with the big Sandy scrubber proposal being pulled at this point, we are reevaluating that. We have some activity in Oklahoma around coal-ﬁred generation as well that we've adjusted to.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   You will continue to see those kinds of adjustments, because what we're trying to get to is, number one, a portfolio that each of our operating jurisdictions support, and then secondly, a portfolio that provides some risk management around a balanced portfolio going forward. So, for us, it is a relatively high hurdle for us to be putting scrubbers on our facilities.  In many cases, it is already done. In some cases it continues to be an evaluation, even for units such as the 1300 megawatt units at Rockport. Paul Chodak over at I&M is working with the regulators to determine what the proper opportunities are for that, so that we can meet the emission reduction guidelines. And that is being discussed in all of our jurisdictions.  So, you bring up a great point and it is something that we're very focused on and we will continue to try to optimize. Matter of fact, when we ﬁrst started this process we were looking at $8 billion, and it has come down to just over $6 billion. And we expect it to continue to be reﬁned as we go forward in concert with the states."
"Good morning, guys. Just the fuel deferral reversal, I'm sorry I missed the exact number. What was -- Brian said it and I just missed it. Could you repeat it? (multiple speakers)","We didn't mention a number speciﬁcally. It was about $30 million. There was a clariﬁcation in an order that came out this year that meant that instead of having deferred $65 million, we only needed to defer the Ohio retail jurisdiction component of that. So that allowed us to reduce the Ohio deferral expense amount by $30 million."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then the depreciation for shorter generation line, could you give us a sense as to what is causing that and how much that was in the total $50 million increase for depreciation?","Yes, for year to date, Paul, it's about $32 million. And that is associated mostly with the Ohio assets that we know we will be retiring by 2015. So we had to increase the depreciation on those particular assets to that 2015 terminal date. And for year to date, that increase in depreciation is about $32 million."
"Okay, and then that will be going oﬀ, right? Is that how we should think about it on an annual basis?","You should think about those increased amounts through 2014 to get to that January 1, 2015 retirement date."
"Okay. And then the securitization that you mentioned, do you guys feel you can do that with the current legislation in place? I'm talking about the deferrals, excuse me, on the capacity charge. Do you think you can do that with the current legislation or current -- I'm sorry, current laws [ph] do you need new legislation to enable that?","Yes, I think we could be able to do that. Obviously there's diﬀerent views of what the law says, but there is ﬂexibility in that and we believe we can do that."
"Okay, and would that be something that you think you could do before sort of although the -- because I'm just assuming we're going to get the appeals in this, considering how contentious this stuﬀ has been. Do you think that that would -- in terms of securitization, the timing of the potential for securitization, how should we think about that? Do you think that we would have to -- obviously get through a hearing, but beyond a hearing do you think we would have to wait for an Ohio Supreme Court decision or -- do you follow me?","Most likely we would, but nevertheless we would start the ﬁnancing and so forth associated with that.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And Paul, I would like to distinguish that as the capacity deferral from the capacity case, and distinguish that from the Ohio reg assets, where were going to ﬁle later this month to be able to securitize a little bit over $300 million of Ohio reg assets and Ohio fuel from the 2009 through 2011 period, which is a little bit over $500 million. And we do believe that everything is in place to be able to securitize those amounts, particularly the reg assets and then the fuel pending a ﬁnal order in those cases.     Did you mention West Virginia?     Well, that's another jurisdiction altogether. In West Virginia we think we will be able to securitize about $400 million of deferred fuel in early 2013 as well."
"I noticed you didn't highlight retail rate increases as part of the -- as an individual driver. And then the slide that kind of was that you went backwards in the quarter versus last year, is that just timing? And how should we be thinking about rate increases as a driver of overall earnings for the year?","In the back part of the slides, Jonathan, you will see we netted together POLR and rate increases. So what you're seeing is the overall negative impact of having lost the POLR outcome. But that is oﬀsetting positive rate increases in other jurisdictions."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. On sales, I guess last quarter you had the weak Q1, particularly in residential, and you didn't adjust the annual forecast. And now the annual forecast is not on the slide; it is more a year-to-date number. How should we be thinking about your expectations versus the numbers you had for the year a quarter ago?","Jonathan, we're coming in lower than what we had forecast for the year. And that is largely being driven by the residential customer class. That is part of what we're striving to oﬀset with some of the cost reductions that we have talked about, and that lag in the residential customer classes is deﬁnitely impacting the overall retail sales on an annualized basis.  Yes, Jonathan. I think it remains to be seen what the reasons for that are, but typically when you have industrials come oﬀ and industrials come oﬀ afterwards, and then residentials either empty homes or people decide, well, I can't ﬁnd another job, so they leave. So it's that piece of it. So you have this recovery that is occurring, at least we call it that at this point, with an industrial being sustainable, commercial starting to pick up, residential hopefully would pick up as a result with the job creation that Brian had talked about previously.  But the other side of the coin could be from an eﬃciency standpoint. Customers are -- because of the economy or because of eﬃcient appliances and so forth, what does the future hold in terms of residential class? So it remains to be seen, but something we're watching very closely."
"What is a good number for the year when you aggregate industrial and residential, about ﬂat? Is that a good -- kind of what you're thinking?","No, I think closer to the -- up 0.5% to 0.75%."
"Can I -- one other for Nick, you mentioned having been up and visited the people at BlueStar.",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes.
"Can you give us a bit more of a sense of where they are in their business plan, where you are kind of targeting? Are there any wins they might have had, just to put ﬂavor of how you feel about operations there?","Yes, it's sort of interesting when I visited we're trying to keep this really a separate culture from the rest of the organization, because we really do want it focused on that competitive environment. And walking into the place, having a lot of young people in shorts and ﬂip-ﬂops, and -- but it is a diﬀerent environment. But it is one that is very focused.  It is clear that they are focused on and energized by what Ohio can provide for them, particularly from the unregulated generation side, to have this slug of generation being provided they hedge against and provide deals in the market. They are very focused and active on doing that.  And one of the things that struck me in the discussions with them is how much -- they didn't talk about let's go get as many kilowatt hours as we can. That wasn't part of the deal. It was let's go get these contracts, do it wisely, do it with the controls in place, but focus on margins.  And I think this organization, the back-oﬃce system integration continues to work very well. Matter of fact, I think all of our customers -- our existing AEP retail customers switch over to the BlueStar systems here in the next -- I think it is the next week or two, two weeks. So, it's happening very quickly and that integration process is going very well.  We have AEP retail employees together with BlueStar employees now. Matter of fact, we moved several AEP retail employees to Chicago to really focus on that eﬀort. And I see the mix of the two cultures going extremely well, because they are fueled by the prospect of just amazing growth potential. So that is my view of it.  I think it is going to be a very positive thing for us, particularly when we get the corporate separation out of the way and they can start actually planning on making deals based upon the availability of that generation, and long-term deals at that. While I was there they were signing up deals. Matter of fact, they told me several deals as I was leaving, that they were very proud of from a long-term perspective. So they are making considerable progress and I'm happy with that progress."
"Good morning. Looking at the coal gas switching numbers for your combined cycle, and just wondered if you could get some color on during the peak summertime for your combined cycles what general output level are you expecting. Are there any physical constraints or any other constraints we should be thinking about?","I think our capacity factors have been pretty high for the gas units, running in the -- I guess in the 70% -- 78% to 80% capacity factor during the July time we have had thus far, and generally around that 70% to 80% capacity factor, I think which is sort of amazing given what we are dealing with.  I think from a coal-ﬁred generation perspective it's dropped oﬀ considerably. As long as we are not having sub-$3.00 per MMBTU per OSS [ph], the capacity on the gas units are going to be continuing to be high. There is no capacity constraints that we have on the gas units at this point in time, and I think our numbers were slightly down last month because that is when we took some outages on some of the gas units.  But we are pleased with our gas capacity factors and our ability to respond, actually. Just as an additional add-on to that, we are continuing to be concerned about the reliability implications   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   of what the EPA is doing, because one thing we have not talked about is the capacity factors of those small older coal-ﬁred units that are depending -- dependent upon during the peak. As we had last year, these units are being called on and connected to the system 54% of the time and are running in the order of 30% capacity factor during these peak months. So, they are still needed and we're going to have to work through that process.  And even with those committed to provide the peak, and obviously they have minimal one-time obligations and minimum load obligations, we still achieved almost 80% capacity factor on the gas units. So that pretty well tells you we are really switching back and forth based upon what the peak requirements are, but utilizing the energy component through the natural gas as much as we can."
"That is very helpful, thank you. And this builds a little on what Dan had asked earlier, just because you think about environmental compliance but you also add on the pressure of low natural gas. You mentioned many of these units really are quite needed from a reliability point of view.  Is there a chance over time that some of these smaller units will be candidates for retirement over and above what we've looked at in the region already? Or are we kind of reaching the point where we are really going to need most of those coal plants to be around from a reliability point of view?","I think the surviving coal units you're going to need for reliability. The smaller coal-ﬁred units we are going to have to step through the process and determine physically on the system, do we need capacity at those particular areas. And in many cases, these units are running with reliability must-run status during these peak months.  So, we're going to have to solve that equation. And that could lend itself to more natural gas- ﬁred capacity or transmission solutions as a result. Either way, we will beneﬁt."
"As Ohio starts to build out its shale presence, is that your territory?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes it is. Yes; matter of fact, not just the Ohio shale. We have about every shale gas play there is, from Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas on up to the Marcellus Shale and the Utica Shale, so we're beneﬁting from that."
And you indicated a two-year extension on EPA compliance (multiple speakers) capital of 33%?,"What I had said was that if we had the two-year extension, then we have more of an ability to approach the technological side of things. And that's why I was pointing to the EPRI study, which is an independent organization, Electric Power Research Institute. They did a study and said that if you were to take an additional two years by utilizing technologies, you could actually save half of the units that are scoped for retirement for that period of time, and achieve the same emission reductions at one-third less cost.  So, instead of $300 billion cost in the country to address the EPA issues, it would cost around $200 billion, which that is a substantial cost savings, particularly when you are talking about the impact on the economy. And as we go through this process, we're going to have to determine with the EPA, and perhaps legislation would give you a lot more ﬂexibility and a lot more security around the solutions. And that is what we are trying to achieve."
"So it's a technology thing, it's not a debottlenecking of capital inputs?","No, we have a plan. We have a plan now for the capital plan associated with addressing the present EPA requirements. If we're -- the extension is really to focus on giving time for a liability standpoint and from a supply chain management standpoint to ensure that we're doing it in a cost-eﬀective manner and from a reliability standpoint."
"When you look at your retail business, what is the net/net of kind of losses versus gains?","Do we have those kinds of numbers, Brian?     Paul, we can have (inaudible) get that for you."
"Yes, hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. A couple of model-oriented questions and then one strategic one. On the model-oriented one, how should we be -- is the impact of POLR that you have seen in the ﬁrst and Second Quarter, do you expect a similar run rate for the second half of the year?","We do through portions of the Third Quarter, but then it was shut oﬀ during the Third Quarter. So, not a similar run rate for the balance of the year."
Okay. Other O&M -- do you expect to realize similar year-over-year O&M cuts in the second half of the year? Or were the O&M cuts you realized this year largely front-end loaded?,"I think we expect to have -- and this goes back to the discipline. We will continue to have those kinds of sustainable cuts through the rest of the year. But keep in mind, we sort of plan the year based upon what we think the year is going to turn out to be.  And then toward the end of the year, if we lined up with additional ability to move projects up -- because last year we moved projects from '12 into '11. We may move projects from '13 into '12 or vice versa. So it really changes based upon how we see the year going. So we expect that to continue. It's a continual process for us, and it shows that discipline around cost side, I think."
"Got it. And last question, when you think about Ohio and where it ﬁts into the broader kind of spectrum of AEP businesses, I mean you guys have over the last few years progressed a ton in terms of getting closer to or actually earning your authorized rates of return. Meaning, you are showing that you are a good team in terms of running and realizing returns out of regulated businesses.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   You've gone out and bought BlueStar. And you are now entering a new competitive business both on the retail and wholesale side. And I just want to kind of ask that question. Is that really core to AEP? I mean is what AEP really good at is running a regulated business, and that as you migrate towards more of a merchant model in Ohio and more competitive model, do you wonder about whether that is really non-core to what your strengths are, and that whether those businesses really ﬁt within the broader bubble of AEP?","That's a great question, Michael, because, yes, we are thinking about that in terms of the future and certainly our Board is, too. As we think through this process, and it goes back to the February 10th presentation that we did for everyone, it was really there to say that we are a regulated utility. That is what we do.  Now, we are doing the best we can obviously with -- we're going to have some unregulated generation. We still have one of the most outstanding wholesale trading operations there is in the country. We're going to put that together with a retail organization and make sure there is a competitive business is viable for the future.  Now, the decision will be made later as to whether that makes sense for us or not. But it will be based upon, as we said in the February 10th meeting, if we can make it look quasi-regulated where there is long-term contracts, there's hedging associated with activities and the market sees that we have a business that makes sense for us in the future, then we will continue with it. But I think it is important for us to rationalize that process over the next two to three years and fully understand what that business looks like.  The other issue, too, is we don't know what happens across the country or what happens in the next two to three years in various fundamentals, or whether states go to competition or elsewhere. So, it really winds up being a very credible option for us in the future. Hopefully it will be complementary. But again, we are very focused on providing regulatory earnings certainty for our investors, and that is something we're very focused on."
"Good morning, guys. I get Chuck's pronunciation too, right. (multiple speakers) A couple of follow-ups. So, looking towards the August 8th order, can you just remind me? Maybe I missed this, but do you expect to get details -- the commission to provide a detailed roadmap for recovery of the capacity deferrals at that time?","Yes, it should be, because one of the expectations out of the order is to deﬁne exactly what that deferral mechanism is. So we will wind up with that, and certainly as a result of that, we need to understand the cash position as well. And then we will step forward with the ﬁnancing and the activities associated with separation of the generation function from AEP Ohio, so we have to have that kind of detail."
"So in the August 8th order also, then, you expect -- is the separation agreement going to be part of that? And is it going to be clear, the ability to transfer the couple of large coal plants to the regulated entities?","Yes, we expect the corporate separation order to be done at the same time."
"Very good. And then -- so, one other separate area, then. On the switching outlook following the capacity order now, can -- maybe I missed this, but can you give us kind of an updated look forward on, now given where you are now and given what you know about the ability of competitors to charge at RPM rates, what is the outlook for switching for the rest of the year or even the next couple of years?","Yes, I think we should expect to see acceleration of switching as a result. And I would also believe that the certainty around the ESP order on February 8 will help in that regard. So, from a competitive standpoint and knowing what the process is, the market will more fully understand.  The other thing, too, is they will understand what our reaction is, because obviously we are looking for a decent outcome out of this thing. Otherwise we have other options that we need to consider, and that can produce lack of clarity for the market. So, it is pretty critical that we get this train back on the tracks in a positive fashion.     Josh, we have time for one more question.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  Raymond Leung, Goldman Sachs."
"Hey guys, Raymond Leung, nice try. A couple of questions. One, to follow one of Michael's question about the regulated and unregulated business, as you guys think about it, what's the sort of the right composition mix do you think you should have between regulated and unregulated as you sort of think about that business longer-term? And then I have a couple of other housekeeping questions.","At the end of the day, it's that percentage where I can get a regulated PE and still have a competitive business that looks regulated. So I think in our February 10 we had 86% regulated, 14% unregulated including the 4% of our River operations area.  So, as I said we are a regulated utility, so as -- in my opinion, for our shareholders not to experience the volatility in such a large manner associated with the competitive business, we would want a substantial part of our business -- enough where we continue to fall in the integrated regulated utility category."
"Okay. And in terms of BlueStar, what type of margins should we expect? Have you provided any type of range or how we should think about that business in terms of proﬁtability?","Brian?     We have not. We anticipate margins in the high single digits to mid-double digits, mid-teens."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then last thing, in terms of your ﬁnancing plans, I think you indicated about $1 billion for this year. Can you elaborate on that and maybe in the updated thoughts on how you're going to ﬁnd the nonregulated side of the business?","Sure. Let me start with the ﬁrst part of that. We have a maturity coming due at APCo here in the near term and we also have some needs for our transmission business, as well as wanting to take advantage of some of these low term interest rates to fund our business for the long term. So, a combination of those things are what -- are going to add up to that $1 billion need for the end of the year.  And then in terms of the deregulated competitive business, we have not talked about how we're going to fund ultimately the competitive Ohio generation, whether we're going to do it at the gen co level or the parent level. But we do believe we are going to have some interim ﬁnancing needs until we get to that long-term solution, and we will be looking to put those interim needs in place by the end of the year."
