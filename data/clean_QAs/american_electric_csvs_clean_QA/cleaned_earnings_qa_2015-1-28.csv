Question,Answer
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I know there's going to be lots of Ohio questions in a minute, so I want to hit a couple others ﬁrst. On the Transmission business, with the InfraREIT IPO out in the market, how are you guys thinking about the future of your Transmission business, given the size and the growth potential there and prospectively other cheaper forms of funding for the business?","We continue to look at our Transmission business as part and parcel to AEP. I mean, we obviously have a lot of scope and scale there, but really we continue to fund it on a continual basis, and it's important for us to be in a position to be able to grow that business. And really, to go to these other structures, there's complications from a state regulatory standpoint and a tax sharing standpoint, so at this point I think we're going to continue pursuing Transmission in the vein that we have been."
And one of the successes of Transmission this year was you guys kept ﬁnding more capital to put into that business. How are you thinking about investment as a baseline for 2015? And what do you think would cause that number to come up as the year progresses?,"Yeah. So during the year, we continually reallocate capital from other business units as part of the business that we're in, and that's one of the processes, the great processes we have in place with the capital allocation program and the continual process for reallocation of capital. It enables us to move more to the Transmission side and advance some of that green area that I keep talking about on the graph of additional Transmission spend that we have available. And if we get ahead in some fashion, you never know what the summer will look like, but we'll certainly look for continued ways to improve and put that capital to work in the Transmission area."
"You guys did a nice job detailing all the earned ROE expectations for the utilities by utility. In aggregate, it is 9.6% earned ROE, should we assume it's kind of a normalized earned ROE for you guys? You're always going to be between cases in diﬀerent jurisdictions, so not everybody's going to be optimized at the same time. Have we seen the improvement in ROEs that we should expect to see after this year?","Yeah. I think, as you can see, the stack that we have for regulatory is relatively small compared to previous years. As we continue to invest in the regulated businesses, you're going to continue to see sort of a 10-ish%, around 10% type of ROE. So we expect, as we continue to make progress, we've invested heavily in Transmission, and some of that Transmission is also included in the operating companies and you also have additional Distribution spending going on. So we'll continue to make advancements and cases will become probably much more frequent and less in terms of what the ask is, so that we can take advantage of riders and things like that to get more concurrent recovery.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So as we progress in that regard, you'll see things like – and I&M is a perfect example where not only legislative, but from a regulatory standpoint, we've been able to get pretty substantial capital expense with a timely response in terms of recovery. We have that there, Transmission, certainly we're doing well from Ohio perspective, from a Transmission & Distribution perspective. So those are the kinds of things we'll continue to advance in the other jurisdictions as well."
"Hey. Good morning. Nick, no oﬀense taken to missing the All-Star Game this weekend, but – or the reference to the All-Star Game, I'm not sure if you were there. But the question I have is, I guess, related to you mentioned earlier about the strategic review of the generating assets and then also maybe obtaining an Ohio PPA. I mean, how would the company approach it if basically the ground for the Ohio PPA was that AEP had to retain all the generating assets in Ohio?","Yeah. So, I mean, obviously, we don't want to talk too much about that because you don't know where things are going to go in this case. But it's our position that it's sort of a no-regret strategy for Ohio given that there really shouldn't be a requirement that we continue to own the asset, because what this is really about is reinforcing the value of those resources that they continue to run in Ohio. Now, obviously, it's a good thing to have PPAs that support contracts and to support generating units, and that would be a positive aspect that says, okay, there's continued consistency in terms of recovery around the cost related to these assets. And that would be a good thing. So we're going to just have to have those kinds of discussions. But obviously, as we pursue it, we want to see that we have the ability to do whatever we decide to do from a business standpoint, but make sure that those assets are standing there for Ohio customers. So we'll just have to see where that goes."
"Just on the O&M shift, I apologize if I missed this, from 2015, 2016 to 2014, how much of that is quantiﬁable? And I apologize if you – I mean, I was listening, I just don't know if I missed it, how much of that was put in 2014 that's going to be coming out in 2015 and 2016?",Yes. About $60 million was moved forward from 2015 and 2016 into 2014.
"Okay. Great. And then with respect to the AEP merchant operation, I guess, I mean, obviously there are a lot of moving pieces, and I can appreciate that, but I'm just wondering what are the chances that you guys would retain this business? And how should we think about this?","Obviously, we're going to have to go through the evaluation process to determine exactly what we do, but our going in position is we are a regulated utility. And the two things we were trying to get out of this process was to make sure we took the volatility out of that, out of the unregulated business, and we're able to make long-term investments. Now that's a relatively high hurdle, but nevertheless, we have to go through the process of understanding the capacity market reform, what happens to PPAs to solidify those assets, what happens to energy markets   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   when the other coal units around 5,700 megawatts of coal-ﬁred generation gets retired here in May.  And then you have sort of two other things going on, and that is these supplemental auctions that are occurring. And if FERC approves the capacity performance model and have these other auctions, those may be considerable value propositions that we're going to have to know and understand. So I said the ﬁrst shoe is going to drop around the ESP III ﬁling and it will be up to the commission when they actually render an order on the follow up to that, which is a larger piece of the assets, and that's around 2,700 megawatts. So it's going to be dependent upon the timing and our understanding of the value proposition associated with that business. And I think you said it correct earlier, there's a lot of moving parts here, but they're parts that are starting to come together in 2015."
"Hi. Just a question on slide 7. You've explained how some of the 2015, 2016 O&M expenses were brought forward, but there's another factor here that I wonder if you could shed some light on. The biggest contributors to higher earnings this year were I think the – well, among the biggest contributors were the OSS $0.16 and the AGR $0.11. You also got a nice added beneﬁt from the AEP River Operations. And some signiﬁcant portion of that on the OSS and AGR obviously reﬂected Q1 weather and market conditions. I imagine the AEP River Operations reﬂected to some extent very benign growing conditions and record corn harvest. My question is, how should I think about 2014, away from the impact that weather had on generation and shipping volumes at AEP River?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah. So I think one thing is load obviously was increased during that period of time, and there was an enabling factor here where with load was obviously with the unregulated generation was able to do relative to margins. We were able to take advantage of that and certainly oﬀ-load some of the 2015 and 2016 impacts. But, I would say, the year, when you look at the foundational issues that we have from the regulatory recovery to what the service territory looks like it's doing in terms of load increases and the make-up of that load is probably very – I mean, it will be very good for us from a foundational perspective going forward.  I think you all look at 2014 as a very successful year in that we took advantage of the upside that existed because of frankly, the polar vortex and how we performed with our units and also being able to get some of the regulatory actions in place. So I'd say 2014 was a – if you took out, if you adjusted out what we made in oﬀ-system sales relative to the polar vortex, then we probably would not have taken some of the steps that we took and still would've managed the year in a very positive way."
Okay. So basically you're suggesting I think that we should be looking at 2014 as reﬂective underlying earnings power given the front-loading of the O&M oﬀsetting the Q1?,"That's right. And I think 2014 turned out to be a major positional year for us because we took advantage of some of the things that occurred during the year, and that's really, as I said earlier, and that's the true story of not only 2014, but the last quarter. We took advantage of the upside that occurred during the year, but we didn't do it just by doing additional things. We did it by my managing the future in terms of the earnings power of the company as well. So that's really the story of the year."
"And a related question on eight then. I assume nonetheless that the – correct me if I'm wrong here, the relatively low growth that you're anticipating in residential normalized sales and commercial normalized sales despite accelerating GDP growth and improving employment and consumer conﬁdence and all those good things, still reﬂects some element of the ﬁrst quarter strength that you feel is probably not going to be repeated even on this normalized basis. In other words, you're working oﬀ of a very high base and that's going to be harder to replicate equivalent levels of growth in the coming year.","Hugh, I think that the last comment you made kind of hits the nail on the head. Because our growth was so strong in 2014, we don't think it will be as strong as we go into 2015, and that's why you see the numbers for the estimates reﬂected on slide 8 that you do.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"The conservatism on the load forecast and the calculation of the adjusted earnings is much appreciated. Just one last thing, have you guys disclosed any expectations regarding the pace of O&M growth oﬀ of the 2014 base?","Yeah. We think, Hugh, it'll be ﬂat to slightly positive. When you look at the Utilities segment, net of earnings oﬀset at about $3.1 billion in O&M, we anticipate that to be perhaps closer to about $3 billion in 2015; so we do expect some uptick in O&M. And that's as a result of some of the things that we talked about, pulling some of those expenses and work associated with those expenses forward into 2014 from 2015 and 2016.     The fascinating part about all of that is that we continue to absorb additional increases in O&M for labor costs, certainly for cyber security, physical security, all of those things that are occurring in addition. So it's more than just keeping it ﬂat. It's really absorbing substantial changes."
"Firstly, I wanted to ask on the comment you made about residential sales being primarily up on usage rather than customer count in the West. Are you seeing some kind of a softening in the eﬃciency angle? Can you just give us a little bit more color on your conﬁdence in the source of that growth and the likely trajectory?","Yeah. Jonathan, this is Brian. In some of the parts, particularly the T&D Utilities where we're seeing a lot of that shale industrial growth, is where we've seen a lot of the average customer usage growth go up. And in places that aren't impacted by that, we've actually seen a decline in average customer usage. So, as utilities, we look for industrial to lead commercial and residential growth; that's very much been the case in the places where we see the shale developments. I guess looking forward in terms of energy eﬃciency, I think a lot of the energy eﬃciency to date in the states where we have energy eﬃciency initiatives have been focused more on the residential class, and we anticipate as some of that low-hanging fruit gets taken, some of that will start shifting to the commercial class, and we'll start to see some impacts there as well. But that's sort of the color I'd give you on where we're seeing the load growth and why.     And Brian alluded to this earlier, and that is the shift that's occurring, if we see oil and gas impacts relative to shale gas activity, well, you still have gasoline and basic energy prices that are reducing, so that would have an eﬀect of improving the residential and commercial side as well, because there's parts of the economy obviously that beneﬁt from more disposable income. So it'd be interesting to see, as the year goes on, how this develops. We're just now at the beginning of being awash in shale gas and that kind of thing, but with gasoline prices lower, it may enable people to start purchasing more homes and those types of things that move the economy."
Great. Thanks. So you've obviously trimmed your 2015 sales outlook by 30 basis points. Is that – and you've sort of talked about other parts of the economy oﬀsetting shale. Can you – how much of the kind of shale slowdown assumed to be versus what you were expecting? Can you make that kind of estimate?,"Jonathan, yeah, when you look at – when you say we've trimmed it by 30 basis points, it's really adjusting the base that we're operating oﬀ of. So it's the higher base in 2014 that really accounted for the reduction in 2015 on a year-over-year basis. Does that make sense?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Same thing happened, great. And could I just ask one other thing on the EEI slides, I think you said you were – you thought you had 80% of generation gross margin locked in some form of contract or hedging. Is there an update to that number? And, I guess, it might be that the hedges would be a bigger percentage of a smaller number. So, maybe adjusting for any change in the overall outlook?","Yeah, Jonathan, we don't want to give, obviously, a speciﬁc number, but when you think about what we try and have hedged, we try and be in that 60% to 70% hedged range. And I think that would be a fair assumption looking forward as well.     Jonathan, you know Chuck Zebula? He sort of worries about competitive information, so..."
"Okay. So, you're not saying that's changed, though, are you, Brian, when you say 60% to 70%?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)",No. I'm not. There's no change. When we talk about the range that we like to be hedged in – and it's – you also need to think about whether it's volume or margins.
It goes back to Hugh's question about MEMCO. Was 2014 a very good year or was 2013 a poor year?,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Well, it's a combination of both. But 2014 was a good year primarily. We're starting to see earnings capability from the tanker barges. We also had a good grain season that continues, but our entry into the tanker barge business has been successful.     But I think Nick's initial statement hit the nail on the head. 2013 was not a good year, and 2014 was a good year."
"And then on Transmission, I think you ﬁnished the year $0.02 ahead of plan. Should we assume that 2015, that carries and you can ﬁnish $0.02 ahead of 2015's plan?",We're thinking that the Transmission side will improve 2014's results by about $0.07 per share.
That kind of puts you on top of where your EEI slide deck of $0.38?,"That's about right.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah, that's right."
"Just making sure I understand on the merchant thinking on your part, as you said, a number of data points coming up. But if I hear them and the timing of all of those looks like by middle of this year you should be in a position to strategically decide your next step. Is that a fair way to think about it?","I think as it now stands you're going to have a lot of that information by mid-year. Now it remains to be seen what the commission does, particularly the Public Utility Commission of Ohio relative to the second increment, the 2,700 megawatts of generation. Will that occur before May or after May I don't know at this point. And then what FERC does with the supplemental auctions. If you have supplemental auctions, particularly that add tremendous value proposition from the existing auction periods like the 2016 and 2017 auction, there could be a supplemental auction associated with that and others as well. Then we're going to have to fully understand what that means.  I'm sure if there is a transaction, any transaction party would want to understand that too. So, as a general thought process, we're thinking a lot of the information will come into play in 2015. We're hopeful that a lot of it comes into play in mid-2015. But we'll have to see where that goes.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Yeah. And conceptually and in the past as you've thought about potentially exiting the business. You looked at two parts, actual sale monetization, raising cash, reinvesting that and then a spin- oﬀ where you save some of the tax leakage. As you've gotten more data, you've gone down the part, any clarity or preferences between those parts?","No, not yet. I mean, there are some big components sitting out there that we have to fully understand. And obviously it'd be great to take proceeds and reinvest in the business and particularly in Transmission but each one of those options you mentioned has its pros and cons, and we need to make sure we have all these major factual items to make a sound decision."
"But generally you do believe there is capital still out there? You know, we've had these big PJM related transactions that have happened recently. There's still capital availability out there that is willing to spend more money in that region?","Yeah, I do. I think there is. And obviously some of the latest information on market power concerns and those kinds of things will – it really depends on who the other parties are. So that's another issue that we'll have to fully understand."
"Okay. And in the past, when you guys have talked about your merchant sensitivities and exposures, you've related it to power prices and a dollar change equates to certain earnings per share. But is there sensitivity on the fuel side as well? In other words, oil prices obviously have come down, so have coal prices, so should we think more along the dark spread side of the equation or is the sensitivity all still on the power side on the merchant part?","Yeah. I think obviously capacity prices has a big part of the value proposition for those assets. And as far as the energy market's concerned, I mean, you'd have to look at the energy market and say, okay, what's the margin expectation from that part of that business. So margins are a   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   little bit depressed in this market but not too depressed. And really, and like I said earlier, it really depends upon someone else's view of what the forward curve looks like.  So there'll obviously be discussions about long-term forward curve and what it looks like for energy prices, but the real deﬁnition around this will be provided in the capacity side."
"Hey, Nick. Hey, Brian. When I look at the equalizer slide, the slide you show on earned ROEs across the various segments, can you just walk us through – I know you've got the Kentucky rate case outstanding and that'll have a big impact. But can you walk us through a little bit about what you think will improve things so much at both I&M and SWEPCO? I mean, the SWEPCO $15 million increase is a relatively small number in the size and scale of SWEPCO. Just kind of how do you get such a big uplift when you look at pro forma versus earned in 2014?","Yeah. Let me give you some quick insight into I&M. So obviously, they have some plants that are going to retire next year. So what we did in 2014 was look forward at what some of the severance and additional retirement obligations were going to be. And because we could quantify those and have some real clarity into what those would look like, we were able to take those charges in 2014 and won't be realizing those in 2015. So 2014's results were weighed down by our estimating and calculating those results and taking them in 2014. And obviously not having similar results in 2015 in I&M will help us to improve those results there.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then for SWEPCO it's going to be – we're going to have to deﬁne an Arkansas solution here because we got the formula-based rate changes in Louisiana really taking account the Valley District that was acquired there. And then in Texas, we do have full recovery for Turk, but also the Transmission, TCOS ﬁlings and so forth have been positive. So those two jurisdictions are working very well. Arkansas is a work in progress because we're not only – we're now investing in scrubber applications, environmental expense at Welsh and Flint Creek Power Plants, and that's somewhat of a drag. But we've got to get through in some kind of ability to get through either Turk or some rate case support for Arkansas.  Now, Arkansas' returns other than if you exclude Turk are generally okay. But whether it takes into account the risk associated with Turk is another issue and we've got to ﬁnd a mechanism to get more value for that previous Arkansas portion of Turk, the 88 megawatts."
