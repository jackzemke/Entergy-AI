Question,Answer
"I only have one question in 27 parts on tax reform. The $2.2 billion cash coming in, you gave us $1.1 billion paying down CP, $0.5 billion for another tranche of debt, and $200 million for another tranche, so that does leave some excess cash. Should we assume that that gets consumed in the normal course of business for capital and dividends?","It does, Greg. We also anticipate being a taxpayer by dint of the transaction, so we anticipate quarterly tax payments as well. And those will begin in the ﬁrst quarter."
"Okay. And just to be clear on your comments you made on tax, out of the gate, if reform were to take the form that you use as your base case there, there would initially be a headwind associated with the return of rate base capital, but you think that you could, as most companies did in 2016 when bonus depreciation was extended, ﬁnd enough customer friendly projects to invest in to oﬀset that? I just want to be clear that that's what you're saying.","We do, Greg, and we believe that would be for our capital spend a fairly modest percentage increase."
"Perfect. Thank you, guys. Thanks a lot.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Thanks, Greg.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead."
"Brian, can you just quantify what were the drivers for the lower than expected tax in the fourth quarter? And what's kind of the eﬀective tax rate we should assume 2017 and beyond?","Perfect, Ali. So we said overall that the tax impact for the year was $0.17 when you include Corporate and Other in that as well. When you are not breaking it out by segment that impact comes down to about $0.13. And let me break out for you what the composition of that is. Resolution of prior period audits was about $0.02 per share. There was a Texas policy change that allowed for a lower taxable income that included a deduction for T&D expense that added about $0.04, some tax planning that we did that allowed some prior period charitable deductions to come through added about $0.03, and then there were other currently accrued adjustments that mostly included tax to book diﬀerences accounted for on a ﬂow-through basis that were about $0.04. So that's the composition of the $0.13 diﬀerence, and the rate that we assume going forward is 35%."
"Okay. And second question, in terms of – Nick, you had mentioned you're working with the Ohio legislature. Can you give a sense of what – roughly what it is that you would like to see change and what the mechanics would be? Would that be a new bill that they would introduce or how would this work technically?","Yeah. And I mentioned AEP is sort of moving forward with a clean slate, so we really are focused on the ability to invest in new generation. And that's a sort of a broad context, but certainly we want to be able to put renewables in place, perhaps natural gas, other forms of resources,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   distributed energy resources. Those are key areas for us in terms of the buildout of the – what we believe is the smart grid of the future and all the interoperability issues associated with it.  So without provisions, that may be shrinking up the needs provisions of the existing legislation, for example, to allow us a more prescriptive path to the commission for recovery of those expenses. So once we – we would ﬁle something for new resource of some kind and it would go through the commission proceedings and we would be. And certainly, we'd like the legislation to be prescriptive in terms of how the commission deals with that, so that it would be very clear so we're not winding up back at the Ohio Supreme Court all the time.  So that's really what we're after. And some questions always come up about obligation to serve and that kind of thing, but really we're starting with a clean slate and we want to be able to one- oﬀ ﬁle these things as opposed to have some obligation to serve that looks like a re-regulation. So there's still a lot of discussions about that, but AEP certainly is focused on that provision because we're doing very well from the regulatory structure in Ohio relative to transmission distribution and the interface associated with that. So we want to be able to augment that growth potential here in Ohio as well."
"Yeah. And last question, Brian, I just wanted to clarify a point you'd made, the fact that the merchant asset sales will happen sooner than March 31 that you'd assumed. Did I hear that you guys felt you could oﬀset that earlier than expected sale with other eﬀorts or that you're just pointing out that maybe that 9, 10 number may be lower, keeps you in the range, but we should consider that in our numbers? Just want to be clear what you were saying.","It's the latter, Ali. The $0.09 that we had expected given the March 31 sale will be less. We're going to need to try to ﬁnd a way to oﬀset that, but we're still in the range."
"Just a quick question on sales, Brian. I think, you said you were feeling more optimistic about 2017. But when I look at the analyst day, what you were forecasting then and what you're forecasting now, it seems to be a little lower. And then 2016 also came in a little lower. So could you just reconcile your comment about feeling better? Is that relative to the past or relative to coming out of analyst day?","Relative to the past. So the slide that I took us through on the regional economies shows that through 2016 a lot of our service areas were in recession, but towards the end of 2016, they started to come out and started to show some growth. As we saw oil and natural gas prices start to improve, we started to see improvement in the industrial regions that have exposure to oil and gas. If prices stay the same or continue to improve, we expect that trend to continue into 2017. Most of our growth in 2017 is forecasted to come from the industrial sector."
Right. So would you say your forecast you feel more conservative – your forecast more conservative relative to what you're actually seeing now or similar?,"No. It's – we think our forecast reﬂects what we're seeing right now, which is some improvement in industrial, particularly oil and gas.     We're actually seeing a lot of oil and gas projects that aren't just being talked about. They're already in the pipeline and being – and under construction of some kind. So that tells us a lot about what will actually true-up in that stream of new projects that are occurring, because when we started going down in 2016 we had all these projects, and at the end of 2015 that we thought were coming in 2016, but they weren't materializing. Or at least there was a propensity to slow them down because obviously prices were coming down.  But now we're seeing a diﬀerent direction. So if you look at those underlying fundamentals relative to the automobile industry, relative to oil and gas activity starting to pick up and actually conﬁrm projects that are under construction, I think it makes you somewhat optimistic. But at the same time, we're being very careful about this economy, like we have been for several quarters now, in terms of we really need to see a trend develop."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. Thank you, guys. And if I could, just following up on the Ohio legislation, Nick, can you give us, I mean, a little more sense of when in the year you would anticipate this coming together and is there – do you already have a draft bill? Do you know who might sponsor it, or are we sort of still at the more exploratory stage?","Yes, we're still in discussions with the other parties that would be involved with this thing, and obviously all the utilities and others. And really we have to get it nailed down on the provisions, all the provisions that would go into the bill. And some parties are looking for diﬀerent thing than others, so we have to manage through that process a little bit. But the legislature obviously is being kept up to speed on what's going on and we're having regular meetings with leaders in the legislature. So nothing is going to happen that's really unknown at this point.  I think really a major focus right now is not to burden the legislation with provisions that may slow it down because if you start talking about re-regulation or obligation to serve, or all those kinds of things, it just brings in more issues associated with how, okay, do you actually restructure this market? But if it's surgical in terms of its approach and actually there may be other surgical provisions that other companies want, let's put those together and move forward very quickly through the legislature. So I'm still thinking probably second quarter we'll have something that we can have someone sponsor."
"So Q2, a bill, material, and then we start to see the shape of it?","Yes. Again, there's already drafts of legislation that are circulating around and we just need to make sure all the parties are comfortable with that. And so it is a work in progress with the new legislature as well here in Ohio. And from AEP's perspective, like I said, it's additive to our ability to invest in this state. We already have some measure of renewables that are in place, we're – went out for bid for those and that kind of thing, but this is really centered on ensuring that we're able to address really what Ohio wants to do regarding its energy future and our part in it. And so that's where it stands right now."
So maybe to just follow up on the last question just if you permit me? You mentioned burdensome provision. Can you elaborate just a little bit what would you not want to see as part of this that might get it dragged down vis-à-vis timing or ultimately palatability? And I've got a few others.,"Yes. I think from AEP's perspective and obviously you'll have to ask the others, but from AEP's perspective to try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity in the future. I mean, we sort of lived through that and done that. And obviously if you try to have AEP Ohio responsible for capacity and having to go out for – because obviously we're in the process of selling our generation. So you could wind up in a situation where we have long-term large PPAs and that would be a balance sheet issue for AEP Ohio.  So you think about that obligation and of course the obligation to serve and it becomes pretty onerous in terms – not only in terms of how we deal with the ﬁnancial picture of AEP Ohio going forward, but also in terms of you're trying to restructure a market and everyone, if you try – if we put that – invested it back in with the utilities then you would basically have to go through a whole lot of discussions with multiple parties of what does that mean and how do you deal with that completely diﬀerent structure, short of re-regulation? And so if it's more surgical in its approach in terms of new facilities or that kind of thing, then I think it's a lot easier."
"Right. And if I may follow up on the Ohio site, obviously, you've got a settlement here. You obviously posted pretty healthy ROEs. Can you just give us a little bit more of a summary in terms of what that settlement means vis-à-vis your prospective earnings? And maybe just give us a little bit of sense of how you expect the cadence of your earnings at that subsidiary to proceed, given where you stand today?","Yes. I think from AEP Ohio's perspective, it certainly clears out all the overhang associated with all these cases. So it really puts us in a great position. I mean, obviously, the capacity of the Supreme Court – the Ohio Supreme Court had remanded back the issues on the capacity and the RSR payment, and it gets all that squared away. And then, of course, some other historical fuel cases are resolved too that had been hanging out for years, and then as well as too excessive earnings there. So it really provides a clean slate going forward.  So I fully expect AEP Ohio to continue to be a very good investment from a wires perspective. Transmission and distribution that we're trying to do, and I think the commission is somewhat responsive to this, and that is with the Smart Cities challenge in Columbus, we're working on interoperability with the grid, going back to transportation. And we want to be able to do that throughout our territories, but certainly Ohio and Columbus, Ohio, is central to that theme going forward.  And I really believe we'll have a supportive commission in that regard. So I think that really bodes well for the investment potential in AEP Ohio, but also the beneﬁts for customers. And the commission should be very happy with that."
"Looking at, I think it's slide nine, kind of your economic forecast, you issued guidance November 1 before the election, before OPEC had cut production. Is there a tailwind now that you have the midpoint of your guidance here? I mean, obviously, you've got one oﬀset on the timing of the sale of the generation, but it looks like the world has improved since you gave guidance.","Yes. So it has, right? As you look at the trend of what's happened with GDPs there, they seem to be coming from contraction into growth, and we've reﬂected that in the update for our numbers. You'll see on slide eight our numbers are slightly diﬀerent than what they were on page 24 of our release at the analyst day but what that really reﬂects is the passage of another quarter, new data being updated, and us looking at the dead reckoning forecast that we have for our service areas for 2017.     The other thing you have to look at is sort of I know business is getting repetitive quarter after quarter, but these quarters are a snapshot in time that we don't see intuitively obvious long- term trends that we can really hang our hat on in terms of how the year goes. So I would say if we continue to see bolstering activity in the second quarter, and then there – we'll continue looking at what that means in terms of load forecast. And then keep in mind, too, it's the mixture of load, too. Whether if it's industrial load that's picking up, well, the margins on industrial load are much less than others. So you have to really look at this thing in the context of overall trends moving forward throughout the economy. And we'll just have to take that quarter by quarter and make a determination."
"And then just next on your pension discussion, I missed it. You said there would be an expense of $15 million in 2017. What was that expense and what was it in 2016?","It's the after-tax expense for both pension and OPEB. So it's after-tax O&M, pension, and OPEB, about $15 million, and it was roughly the same in 2016."
"And then just a question from my tech analyst, now that you've got Ohio pretty much cleaned up, when do you think you can start the AMI spend?","Grid smart.     Oh, yes, the grid smart, we were set for hearing. I think it was yesterday. They delayed it until next week. So we should get a decision then and be oﬀ and running."
"Just wanted to – a quick question on Ohio restructuring. In your discussion with the other utilities in the state, do have a sense that you all are on the same page? Are there still key issues that have to be resolved to make sure that you all are arm in arm as you think about legislation?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I think I'd say generally we recognize we need to be arm in arm, but there's still outstanding issues that we need to resolve. And – but that I really believe that the participants are motivated to move this process forward because they understand the importance of the restructuring eﬀort here in Ohio. So I'd say the parties are motivated, but still there's issues that we have to resolve speciﬁcally related to if it's a surgical legislation."
"Understood. And then tax reform, I think we're all trying to get our arms around the implications, and the slide you laid out was very helpful. When we think about you – laid out your breakeven tax rate at 22%. Maybe just a dumb mechanical question, but if I – there's some discussion that maybe the corporate tax rate goes down to 25% and not 20% or 15%. If it were at 25% instead of the 20%, could you just talk through some mechanically earnings power and other impacts from that kind of an outcome?","Yes. So if it's 25% rather than 22% or less, it means that from a net income standpoint the takeaways that we would have from interest deductibility would not outweigh the reduction in the tax rate that we're talking about. Does that make sense?"
"Hi. First I thank you for setting a high bar on tax reform disclosures. We'll see if others could get close to this. Thanks. Couple of questions, on the former PPA assets, could you give us an update on resolving the future of those?","Yes. On the former PPA assets, as I mentioned, we're talking to the other parties. And really it focuses on what the swap potential is, and of course looking at units that may – I mean, you look at them and say, well, we should go ahead and retire them. And then if there is consolidation of interest, then is there a strategic process that needs to continue in some variation associated with those?  And I would say those conversations are going very well. Timing of those conversations I still suspect we'll be completing something by – certainly in 2017. So obviously it's pretty complicated given that there's multiple owners. But also there's multiple issues to be dealt with in terms of how you move forward from whatever the result may be of part of the discussions with the parties themselves. So but I would say those conversations are going very good."
And is there any updates on either of those or is that just going to be a long process?,"Yes. On the 205 ﬁling, I think, we have – it's a March timeframe for, I guess, for the forecast to act and then for the 206 ﬁling that's still sitting out there. And it may be a couple years. But   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   obviously that process will continue, if they decide to set it for hearing or whatever. But we haven't heard anything else on there."
...I'm curious just how you're feeling about being able to get to the $1 billion of renewables that you're targeting?,"Yes. I think Chuck still has his billion dollar number out there. I think he is probably over a third of the way, but we're going to be very selective and as I said earlier. And we have our return thresholds that we expect, and we have not changed those return thresholds. He continues to be involved with projects, and if he can't make it to a billion, well, he'll give it back to us and we'll put it somewhere else including transmission in other places. So I think we're going to continue with the same degree of discipline that we have today regardless of what would happen to tax provisions or anything else.  And so it's not – this is not where AEP is trying to form some major business. It really is focused on an augmentation that's disciplined and has a return expectation associated with it that actually contributes to what we're trying to achieve. So that process hasn't changed at all, and Chuck continues to be involved with projects, both solar and wind, and we will continue with that."
"So most of my questions have been answered, but I've just got sort of a really basic one, and that is that we've seen tax reform proposals before. Obviously this seems like it's got more momentum to it. And it doesn't – it looks like you guys have – your disclosure is pretty clear and – but the impact doesn't look necessarily huge. But it's pretty disruptive in many ways, generally speaking, to diﬀerent players. And I just was wondering when you're looking at this and when you're talking to your people, what do you think the chances are? I mean, I know it's a tough – I mean, I'm not holding you to it or anything, but what are the chances that we actually see something this dramatic being enacted?  It just seems rather – I don't know. We've seen it before and things don't usually happen like this. What do you – when looking at this landscape now, if you had to guess 50-50, what would you say is the chances of this actually – these proposals substantially getting enacted?","I would say, you know, I don't know that we've had a Trump administration before, too. I mean, the pace at which he's moving already, and I think a lot of these things have been sort of pinned up for years. And while, on its face you will say, well, it's pretty daunting to get tax reform done in these multiple things that we are talking about, particularly when you take away interest expense deductibility and issues like that, that's going to be – it's going to be tough.  I'm not saying that it can't get done because I think there's probably enough movement out there of a lot of companies who want to see that tax rate come down. And I think the importance of American industry going forward to be competitive internationally, I think that process will move forward. Then it becomes an issue of, okay, how do you pay for it? And that's where interest expense deductibility and all that kind of stuﬀ comes in.  As far as the industry is concerned, I still think right now the Trump administration is dealing with ACA. They – the tax reform could come after that. Although, infrastructure seems to be a key issue as well. So it remains to be seen. I think it'll probably be later in the year before we really see things that we can really latch onto to fully understand where this thing is going. And so we'll continue to look at our tax situation in consideration of that, but it is something we'll watch very closely.  And if it is a broad tax reform package, well, we've probably dealt with in our analysis here some of the extremes that would occur. If you take 100% expensing and interest expense deductions away, that's pretty considerable. So I think that's probably as much of a stress test as you're going to get. As far as the industry is concerned, and AEP's position, we would – we think that our industry is the most heavily capitalized – well, it is the most heavily capitalized industry   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   by far of anyone in the U.S. And when you talk about interest expense deductibility and deductions and how they impact ultimately customers, you really have to think twice about that.  So I really believe there ought to be a utility exception because we typically pass our rates through to customers and the beneﬁts inure to manufacturing and other endeavors that we have for the economy. So whether that can get done or not is another question, but certainly we really have to look at those provisions and how it applies to our capital-intensive industry. And we'll obviously be active in Washington associated with that side as well."
"Just I guess on Ohio restructuring, AEP has already taken, I guess, the pain of getting rid of oil generation of the utility in the state, maybe, or have not, and AEP is looking more forward- looking with future generation needs, potentially in this restructuring bill. Do you think we could see in Ohio back to what we had, as we move to market, where the state gets split and the restructuring is diﬀerently in the northern part of the state than in the southern part of the state?","I really don't see that. I think you hit upon a point though that diﬀerent companies may be looking for diﬀerent provisions based upon where they stand today. And somehow we've got to make sure that an industry restructuring package is transparent enough and people will understand it well enough to accommodate some of these varied interests. And that's really – that's part of the challenge. And so we will just have to see how things work out from that perspective, but yes."
"Unfortunately, at the expense of my Rangers, but yes.","All right. Thank you.     Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call.
