Question,Answer
"Yeah, talk about it, bring those dragons. Let me ask you real quickly, if I can. Let's just start with the weather real quickly. You talk about not exactly adding back that $0.13 year-over-year. How would you think about it? Obviously, you didn't change the '17 numbers much, just to hit that directly out of the gate here?","Yeah. so when we look at the $0.13, we're looking at this year like, it is an anomaly. We're not doing things stupid from reducing an O&M perspective, you know, we're doing the tree trimming, we're doing all the things we need to do. But there is one-time things that we can do, whether it's travel, whether it's, you know, all those types of things that employees can do to reduce cost and then the eﬃciencies that we've seen from all the previous year's activities continue to inure to the beneﬁt of O&M as well.  So, there are some opportunities for us to really respond to the weather-related activity, but keep in mind, we are very careful. We didn't want to move a bunch of stuﬀ from '17 into '18   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   because there's things we need to do in '17 and we want to keep the plan secure for '18. So, we really looked at it in that fashion.  When you look at the weather and if it's weather-adjusted $0.13, not all of it. So I think you do have some opportunity next year. I think it just makes us more conﬁdent about the midpoint for next year as soon we get any kind of normal weather. It would be great if we had a good winter before we had a bad summer or a good summer after we had a bad winter, but we had neither. And so, all the planets aligned negatively this year, but to come out of it the way that we have, I think, really does show the ability to change our O&M proﬁle to respond to it.  I don't know, Brian, if you have -- you want to add to that?     No, we've kept O&M, it's not been tracked ﬂat especially for the last seven years and it's been lean activity, procurement activity continuous, improvement activity and we are advancing that activity and when we have the weather gap that we had this year, this management team knows what levers to pull to ﬁll in that gap and we're not going to result the gimmicks like factoring weather out. We know we're responsible for responding to what the weather is and trying to come in within our guidance range and that's exactly what this team has done.     You know, today it's a diﬀerent company than when we had two or three years ago with the unregulated generation. Today, I think it's much more transparent and the levers that you have to pull are still there in some regards, but weather will be more of an impact on the Company than in previous years because -- then you have the market conditions that you could look at and sometimes it save you, sometimes it went against you, but that's all part of the process of making sure that we're consistent as we can be regardless of the situation."
"Excellent, thanks for the detail. A quick follow-up on cleanup item here. We've seen some headlines in Oklaunion here, can you comment just on -- I presume that's fairly negligible in terms of earnings contributions to the extent which you were to transact on that and presumably if you were, that would be all of it, that would not be any kind of speciﬁc portion of it. And then perhaps, in tandem with that, any thoughts here on Conesville given that the transfer has been completed for a little bit here?","Yeah, obviously we're still looking at the unregulated generation from a strategic sense and Oklaunion has been a drag particularly on the unregulated side in the ERCOT portion of Texas. And just like any other base load generation, I don't think it gets the value it deserves for what it provides to the market. But that being said, yes, any kind of result that we get out of Oklaunion, I wouldn't expect too much of a ﬁnancial change as a result.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And then as far as Conesville is concerned, we continue to look at that, we consolidate some interest in some of the units, but we continue to look at our options from that perspective as well. And really, I didn't talk about those upfront in any of the areas, but just know that we continue to work with Buckeye, Cardinal and then of course seeing what the disposition of those units can be in relation to all the other opportunities that we have, but there is no doubt we continue our process of that strategic review."
"Got it. And just to clarify what this all meshes together for your 2019 if you think about, if you will, for a few years that guidance, call it non-core utility earnings. The composition that is largely renewable by that point in time or just how would you think about that given where you are in the plan on both the deployment of capital on the new generation assets as well as obviously getting with the legacy stuﬀ?","Yeah, absolutely. Brian, you want to --     Yeah, so hedges that we have associated with our competitive generation capacity revenues decline over time and earnings from the renewable portion increases over time. Overall, we don't expect that business to be changing much from about the dime contribution of earnings that it has in the near term.     If you look at '18, '19, '20, you're seeing minimization of the contributions of the old legacy units, but we're maximizing the contribution of the renewables eﬀorts particularly and chuck the blues [ph] area, the contracted renewables, but also very much so the regulated renewables. And as I mentioned earlier, we have an RFP out in AEP Ohio for solar and then of course Wind Catcher. You're going to see other projects like that, that are going to be drivers for those future years and we're very much looking forward to it."
"Hi, good morning guys. I had just a question about the Transmission segment, obviously you didn't provide for the quarter much breakdown of the penny of growth, but it seems to be little slower than you have generally been seeing on investment growth, so I was curious. Did you take any additional reserve against 206 or anything like that this quarter or just what's behind that penny?","Yeah. So we did take reserve against the 206 for the quarter. For the year, contributing to that $0.14 improvement is the -- what we're able to do in the FERC 205 as we're able to look at forward-looking O&M test years rather than truing up past years and that contributed to the growth, but we're pretty much on track with where we expected to be for the Transmission Holdco segment     So, you're going to see an anomaly with the credit of the 205, that's really some of what you're seeing into the true-up associated with it."
"But you have now reserved to the level that you think is a reasonable outcome for the 206 beyond the reserve you took earlier in the year, I guess?","That's right.     We are, Jon, and we think that issue is going to play out over a fairly long period of time with what's going on with the New England transmission owner's case and its regime [ph] back to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   FERC. We think we'll be in a long period of having to reserve before that issue gets resolved."
And what drove the decision to up the reserve right now?,I don't think it's been an increase in the reserve. I think we've been steady about where it's been and have held at that level.     I think there are positive things to come out of the new FERC make-up and we're just going to hold steady until it gets resolved.
"Okay. But I thought you said you did increase the reserve and that's why you didn't have growth this quarter, but now it sounds like maybe you didn't.","We did not increase the reserve. It's been steady, it's been constant.     No, we didn't increase, but the true-up hits in July. That's what happened."
"Okay. And then just one another, on Wind Catcher, we noticed earlier this week that Xcel proposed some sort of diﬀerent terms to how they might look to get recovery in Texas. And I don't know if you have any comment on that as a base or a framework or if you think that could end up being a template for how things might play for you.","No, I don't see it that way because these projects are pretty unique and the way you look at them, and our has a 350 mile, 765 generation interconnection associated with it, but it is also massively larger. So, you can look at the risk being taken and the economics of the projects themselves. They stand on their own merit. So, we ﬁled our plan. I know that Xcel had to change theirs a little bit, but that's sort of their business and our projects are our business. So we'll continue with all four jurisdictions in the same manner in which we ﬁled and we'll see where it goes."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. I think that's it, thank you guys.",Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) We'll now go to the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
"Hi, same here. So, just following up on Wind Catcher. I wanted to understand, of the 2.5 billion that you highlighted for the ﬁrst 10 years, how important is that PTC and do you see any risk to that PTC ﬂowing through to the project itself ?","PTC is really important, and that's why the brevity in which we're asking for approvals of this project are instrumental. I mean, the numbers stand for themselves, the numbers are just, like I said earlier, slam dunk. But when you look at the 2.5 billion PTC, that's a huge part of the economics associated with making sure our customers can beneﬁt from that. So -- and timing is critical."
"Got you. So, when do we get color on like the likelihood of the timing and what kind of risk does it bring to be approvals?","Yeah. So, obviously we ﬁled and I'm really -- actually happy that the procedural schedules have been set up pretty consistent and constructive of getting a solution in place. All four jurisdictions have procedural schedules that match up to sort of our April timeframe that we're looking at so that we can really take a hard look at what their risks are, what the rewards will be, what the results of the Commissions orders will be, that will give us some real insight in terms of this project, but like I said before, I'm pleased with the progress that's been made."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Fair enough.,"Praful, you may not have gotten to it yet, but slide 32 of our presentation, we kind of lay out the timeline in each of the jurisdictions and when we expect hearings to begin and you can anticipate orders shortly after those hearings take place."
"Got you. And then in terms of the pending rate cases, obviously you have a pretty busy regulatory schedule. Just wanted to understand, your ROEs for all these rate cases are in the 10% and 10.5% range. Is there any risk given current interest rate environment on those ROEs or do you see those ROEs -- authorized [ph] ROEs to be pretty stable?","I think we're pretty consistent, as we talked earlier about 2018 being in that approximately 10% range and of course it is going to result from negotiations or from the outcomes of these cases. And so, as we look at it, the aggregation of those cases will be in that approximate 10% range, that's what you should look for.  And of course we ﬁle -- and you know the normal course of rate cases, I mean, you ﬁle based upon what we really believe the ROE should be and then of course you have to deal with other parties and deal with the -- and the Commission itself make the decision what the ultimate ROE is. And like I said earlier, we expect our aggregated to be around that 10% range."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just want to better understand how interrelated the wind plant and the gen-tie for Wind Catcher are where, you know, hypothetically is, the capital associated with the wind side were reduced a little bit, is the need still there for the 765 kilovolt gen-tie?","Yeah. They go hand in hand. Obviously, you'd be building a huge wind farm nowhere if you don't have the generation interconnection there. And so -- and with 2,000 megawatts of wind capacity at that location, that drives of pretty large substantial generation interconnection. So -- and even if you -- in this case, you won't reduce the size of it, but the size of the wind farm is really the big driver on the capacity side associated with the size of the generation interconnect. So they go hand in hand, one doesn't occur without the other. And that's why it's all being viewed as a single project and that's why we're working really hard to lock in the arrangements associated with construction on both sides so that we can eliminate as much risk as possible."
"Okay, thank you. That's it.  Operator  And we have exhausted all questions in queue at this time, please continue.","Okay, well, thank you everyone for joining us on today's call.
