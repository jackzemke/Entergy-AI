Question,Answer
"So the couple of quick questions here. First on the incremental 8.6 gigs of renewable opportunity that you just added to plan. It's very sizable. So can you maybe touch a little bit on how we should think about these new opportunities in light of the 5% to 7% growth that you guide? What sort of ﬁnancing avenues are you kind of looking at, the approval paths and what are you assuming in terms of own versus PPA?","Yes. I think we have the last part -- last of your question ﬁrst. I think we have a pretty compelling argument now for owners of these facilities given even past the winter storm activity that we learn operationally, certainly what we learn from really the provisions of the agreements that we put in place relative to the approvals really stands better in terms of our ability to manage the project, manage congestion, manage other factors that really provide beneﬁts to our customers. So, we're going to make a strong position that we should own those assets. And actually when you think about the strength of the utilities, it is going to be important for the states to really focus on how do we keep our utilities strong and PPAs don't do it from a capital structure perspective. We need to make sure that ownership and the ﬂexibility of operations is key in that regard.  And regarding the other 8600 megawatts, yes, it is a sizable number but obviously when you look at the evaluation of the retirements, when you look at the needs of the operating companies and also north-centrals certainly showed you can deploy capital and reduce the overall bills to consumers. So, when you think about the retirements of coal-ﬁre generation, the imposition of additional transmission having the beneﬁts of the fuel cost aspects of it are tremendously important. So when you look at the analysis, having some level of carbon pricing in there certainly increases the focus on the ability for renewables to come into play. And that's certainly what we've been focusing on.  So as you look at the ﬁnancial ability of it, the ﬁnancial ability pretty much work like we did for north-central. Although it is large number, so we'll have to be very aware of what our balance sheet strength looks like during the process, the timing of when the diﬀerent tranches of these renewables come into play, the cash position that supported with these projects coming online and being able to improve, as Julie mentioned, this FFO debt thing where it is today is really a 2021 issue. In 2022, FFO debt comes back up and certainly with the ability to put these projects in place, it will help in terms of our ability to continue to fund these projects. So it'll probably, we certainly would like for it all the be incremental but in reality when you go through this process, it'll probably be around capital allocation and prioritization associated with that within the existing plan but also incremental so it'd be a combination of both.  Yet to be seen. Obviously if we load continues to grow, if the position relative to the regulatory framework getting concurrent recovery, making sure that we get oﬀ the tax -- ADIT issues. That's all going to be helpful in terms of our ability to ﬁnance. So it's still a work in progress."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. And then maybe just transitioning to corporate strategy and as optimization obviously the strategic review for Kentucky started. So Brian's been obviously very busy here. Can you maybe just elaborate on the stage we are in with that process, how better as you merge or data rooms open? And assuming this would backﬁll most of your windcatcher equity need so assuming we aren't looking at a duke style, Indiana GIC transaction, but the entire opco. So we should obviously consider leakage here, any NOLs as well that could be applicable in this case?","You're always ahead in terms of questions. So, yes, and I really can't answer any of those at this point because we are in a process. And certainly, as soon as we have information on it -- I think the real issue here is that we have made a deliberate decision to really start our portfolio management approach and evaluating jurisdictions because we are fully regulated. We can look at these areas and determine what the best ﬁt is in terms of future capital needs and what our focus is and in terms of moving to a clean energy economy. So for us to come out and say that we are in a strategic process relative to Kentucky is an important statement in that regard. That's probably as far as we can go right now."
"Let me ask you something a little bit more of a theoretical question. Would you consider asset rotations above your current equity needs let's say from North Central to fund the incremental CapEx renewables or T&D? I mean you're within your credit metric guidance, but does it make sense for you to further improve your balance sheet and simplify your story even further? I mean, do you kind of like looking at the stock valuation and does it make maybe more sense to -- do you think there's incremental value from a multiple standpoint to even have a stronger balance sheet and operating even less states here and I'm thinking maybe Texas?","Well, certainly, like I said, this is at the beginning of this process, but multiple expansion is clearly on our minds and making sure that you can -- you're investing in the right things, at the right places, at the right time is going to be incredibly important. And you saw that with North Central of timing, the recovery with the actual investments with the turnkey approach that we took. And it's all about the timing of it. It's all about the decisions made to ensure that we are doing proper capital allocation and rotation to manage this process forward. So -- and like I said earlier that's going to be a continuing part of our business."
Terriﬁc. Thank you guys. I'll jump in the queue. Appreciate it.,"Yes.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Next we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Julien."
"If I can, let's start with a higher level question here, right? So you're proposing a lot speciﬁcally in PSO. How do you think about the events that have transpired in Texas and Yuri impacting that? And speciﬁcally around some intermittent renewable resources like solar in Oklahoma, right? We just haven't seen a lot of that historically. So this has a little bit of new territory for that geography more than the economics all around. Can you talk to that? Have you kind of vetted some of the proposals here and the approval process?","Yes. So obviously, we're right out of the gate in terms of the announcement of what's included in each jurisdiction. So we'll have discussions with the commissions. And that's part of the integrated resource planning processes. And keep in mind too, when we do this evaluation during the RFP, I mean, during the process, it's always solving for whatever the least cost is in terms of what those resources are. So it shows up as wind and then solar typically is showing up as more wind early on than solar starts to pick up, but that's pretty fungible as you go forward. I mean these plans will change as we go forward based upon where technologies go, certainly where the opportunities exist. Now, Oklahoma may want more wind and less solar, but that won't matter, it would be a part of the total renewables piece that's included there.  The other part of it too is we will be very mindful of how much renewables are placed into service in relation to 24/7 supply and there's some natural gas that's built into this plan as well that then enables more renewables to be put in place. But the real focus going forward during this transitional period will be for units that provide 24/7 to be more of a reliability component, certainly more of a sort of an insurance backstop or for weather events or other events that may occur that impact the grid security and will either be very mindful of how those studies actually go.  And I'll tell you in our climate report, we saw for 2050 with a $15 carbon price and then more aggressive $30 carbon price, the 2035 case didn't solve because of the timing of getting resources in place and system related issues. So, you have to really think about how that's done. And we've looked at these plans and we certainly believe that with a level of 24/7 supply we still   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   have out there and the additional opportunity associated with just the diversity of some of these projects. It's going to be a particular value to our customers going forward.  And I guess I'll just remind you that North Central had it been operational during this time of the Texas and Oklahoma outages with the Yuri would have saved customers $227 million. So you think about the savings associated with that. And the other thing too, the previous question someone was -- asking, when the utilities do it they focus on the long-term and North Central already had the weather packages already in place, where you don't ﬁnd that in a large part of the market. So we think the long-term when we go about after these investments and that's why ownership is clearly important."
"Excellent. And just to clarify this a little bit further. I know that the equity numbers aren't moving around too much or at all frankly relative to CapEx. But how much capital could be shifted given the latest update here. It was three year versus the ﬁve-year outlook here? Just want to understand out of the total 10-year view that you guys are providing today, how much could be in that three and ﬁve-year windows you think about just the speciﬁc timing of each of these dockets that will come up for renewable resources?","Well, yes, as I mentioned, 10,000 of megawatts of the 16,000 -- over 16,000 is in the '21 to '25 time frame. So it's going to be near term. So when you think about these projects they take couple of years to put in place. You'll be looking more at that 2023 to 2025 for most of it. But some of it was already -- is already in play. There's already RFPs going out for supplies of some of these renewables as we speak. Julie, anything you want to add to that?"
Morning. Congrats on a great update and a big movement in renewable. So happy to see that. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about as you grow out renewables whether there might be some additional transmission distribution requirements or storage or just other things that would sort of be additive as well. It's obvious just a huge amount of megawatts. Just curious of the other impacts.,"Yes. There will be. And many of these projects, obviously we will have to look at the placement of these projects in terms of level of congestion, but also the level of transmission investment that's required. But, keep in mind too, with what the Biden administration is doing relative to the movement to clean energy, which obviously is a big part of his plan, large-scale transmission will also be incredibly important.  So I see, with what's going on today and the nexus of all these things coming together, our transmission which you've always said is -- as far as I can see for a decade well is probably even higher. We don't know what that number is at this point. And I think we got to get through the process and fully understand that, but when you do the net beneﬁts associated with fuel and the capital cost of the renewables projects and transmission, it's still a beneﬁt to consumers, so we'll go through that process, but you're right to be bullish about transmission in relation to these investments but also everyone else's investments because we are the largest transmission provider in the country and most of this has to come through us."
"That's really helpful. And then I wanted to drill into Texas for just a moment. There are some bills as you know that are ﬂoating around that would permit securitization of costs and those look to be I guess to me quite helpful from a ﬁnancing point of view. Just curious how you're thinking about that impact? How might that impact your thoughts on ﬁnancing? I appreciate the points you raised earlier that essentially the credit metrics are sort of artiﬁcially low at the moment because of this storm, but some of these bills be especially helpful to you?","Well, certainly the archived portion of Texas we are essentially a large company there. So a T&D. So -- and we have based on our calls to provisions in place for recovery of that. We -- the only real exposure we've got from a wire standpoint is any I guess some of the reps they could potentially go bankrupt. But that's where it's going to be important to understand where that goes and also as far as securitization is concerned we've used securitization in the past in Texas   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   and you're seeing it developer or what's classiﬁed on cost really is Yuri related investments, we'd be ﬁne with that. Julie if you want to comment?     Yeah. That'd be great. Great question, Stephen. So we're keeping an eye on what's going on in Oklahoma. There's an opportunity potentially to engage in some securitization activity there. We would love to get cash in the door. So if that's something that's workable, we will absolutely take the cash. And my understanding is the way that is being at least initially discussed and potentially structured would be such -- in such a way that does not ﬁt on our balance sheet, which makes it even better. So, yes, we'll take that cash and we go down the balance sheet, we like that very much. So we're deﬁnitely poised and ready and waiting."
"That's great. Maybe one last quick one. Just as we just as we think about this growth in renewables, any changes in terms of your thoughts on coal retirement dates?","Well, obviously, the move we made on the second rockport unit solidiﬁed at least to 2028 and it could occur earlier depending on what the conditions are and what the evaluations are all with the commission and the replacements of capacity. And so we are -- and actually, we're looking for provisions like that even in legislation that's occurring. Because you're seeing all kinds of incentives develop for extension of PTCs, ITC's, direct pay we like, so direct pay not only for renewables projects, but also for transmission if you have an ITC, but I think also we'd like to see incentives for the underappreciated plant balances of coal units to further accelerate the ability to retire and obviate the impact to our customers.  But the current the current plan doesn't assume any of these advancements. So and this happens all the time where we have plans that are out there that are public, but a lot of things get worked on and will continue to work on these objectives. Because our objective is to move as quickly as possible to de-risk these investments and particularly with new environmental rules with CCR and other things we're making decisions about these plants and you've seen the last two quarters we've announced earlier retirements of coal and lignite plant operations. So, I would fully expect to see that process to continue."
I am doing well. I have a couple questions on the Kentucky power announcement. So just I think Nick you said that you're doing a strategic review with a target for your end. So is that a target to basically have a sale done and proceeds by year-end or have a kind of like a sale or other plan announced by year end?,"Steve, so I didn't say year-end, I said we would get the evaluation done in 2021 that could be earlier in the year, could be later in the year. Obviously, we need to get farther down the road in terms of this process. I can tell you that the process is established. Its ongoing. And we're going to move as quickly as possible. So -- and we've always talked about the timing of the resolution of anything related to whether it was Kentucky or anything else in relation to the needs around North Central. So -- and we still believe that timing ﬁts."
"Okay. And just -- is there kind of -- this may seem silly but just is there reason this wasn't like part of your slide deck or release or it was just stated on the call. It is -- is it just something just happened, the Board just decide something?","No, I think it was out of respect of our employees because obviously you can't say something like this from an SEC perspective without some thoughts around that but also there's the human aspects of it too and employee aspects -- now in fact our employees just found out about it   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   when I said it. I have a webcast after this with all employees to talk about, this to just to alleviate their concerns through the process. But this is the way it occurs, multiple things you have to think about when you're making these kinds of announcements."
Understood. And then just in terms of -- that's helpful. So in terms of thinking about your (inaudible) this would still be potentially directed at replacing the equity needs that you have currently for North Central as a potential replacement for some of that.,"Yes, I'll let Julie talk about that.     Steve, yes, thank you for the question. Absolutely to the extent that we get dollars in the door that will be a wonderful place to put that to work in terms of being able to sidestep some of the equity need. And we'll see if we can make that happen. Absolutely.     We have the AGM (indubitable) that we've accessed but obviously it would change the nature of that."
"One challenge was Kentucky power has a lot of coal plants and exposure I guess. So to speak, do you feel like there's still despite that decent interest to be able to monetize that at reasonable price.","Yes, and obviously diﬀerent parties look at it in diﬀerent ways. And that's what we're going to ﬁnd out through the strategic processes is what the evaluation Kentucky's ownership of Mitchell in terms of valuation and its impact on overall price would be at.  It still has value. It still has years to operate and certainly if you look at the plan that we presented you still have a potential renewables opportunity there particularly with the potential retirement of Mitchell at some point. So anyone who is looking at this would say it's not in terms of just the valuation of Mitchell, it's evaluation of what you do with it during the transition. So there's a lot there to look at it from that perspective."
And my last question just on this topic and my last question is just the overall portfolio optimization kind of that you've been doing. Is this a conclusion of that or is this something   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   where we could get more?,"No. It's going to be an ongoing part of our process, so it's just the beginning."
"Hey, good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my question. Just I have to -- I think we've covered the rest. Just on storm cost Julie, you're currently deferring those, right? The $1.2 billion on the balance sheet. Can you just remind us (inaudible) Thank you. Can you remind us what is factored into your 2021 guidance? I'm just thinking about how the sort of the decisions here and the next few months impact your 2021 numbers?","Yep. Absolutely. You are exactly right. We're deferring those storm costs particularly as it relates to the fuel and purchase power cost because that's the biggest chunk of the dollars that we had exposure to as it relates to storm and Yuri in particular. And as it relates to what's embedded in our guidance I will tell you we actually updated our cash ﬂow forecast that's included in the slide deck that you have today to incorporate the impact of this particular circumstance as well as the fact that we did have some ice storms and more -- I characterize more normal storm related activities that occurred in the Eastern portion of our jurisdictions here during the ﬁrst quarter. So all of that is factored into those new cash ﬂow forecast details, which you'll see impacting the cash ﬂow from operations line in the slide included in the deck today.  As you know, we did take on some additional debt to be able to accommodate the fuel and purchase power spike that was not anticipated and so that is now being absorbed into our 2021 operations. And therefore into our earnings interestingly, if you look at page number eight of the slide deck that we have out there today, on the corporate and other segment, you'll actually   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   see that interest expense was a beneﬁt to us this time despite the fact that we have taken on a little additional debt in that capacity because it took a $500 million Term Loan on at the parent company interest rates have in terms of interest costs I should say was much lower in this particular quarter verses last year. We do still have lower debt outstanding from a short-term perspective versus last year. So all of those factors interestingly help to have this impact be one of beneﬁt to us in this particular period. So steady as goes, no change in forecast, still feeling really good about where we are. Hopefully that helps you a little bit."
"It does. In nutshell it's captured in your EPS guidance, interest costs and the cash ﬂow metrics, already reﬂect the sort of the some of the treatment you might be as in terms of recovery for these costs.",You got it. We did that by design because we wanted to make sure we had a fair amount of integrity in that forecast with particularly when you look at the cash ﬂow metrics and give a shout-out to our ﬁxed income front because I know that's extremely important.
"Understood. Thanks. Just one last one for me. Nick, you mentioned the winning per quarter. Just what to look for their terms of next steps? Is there going to be a rulemaking procedure and just next steps, what should we be looking for there?","Yes. There it is open for an - right now. So -- and obviously our comments will be very direct and very focused. I'm sure there'll be others in the industry with that as well. But it just seems like a direct polar opposite to where the administration is trying to go with movement to a clean energy economy. And really it is directly opposite to years of precedence of encouraging the development of transmission. So, I'm certainly hopeful as we get through the dialogue of what this all means.  And actually with RTO participation, when we originally joined RTO years ago, we were making a lot of money oﬀ of through and out rates of transmission. We traded that in for generation beneﬁts because we were selling lot of generation. We're not selling generation. So to any real extent and certainly when you look at the value proposition of an RTO, it is centered on the ability to across a larger jurisdiction, but from an AEP perspective you got the cost of the RTO and certainly customers need to be able to beneﬁt from that. So if you disrupt that cost beneﬁt opportunity you will have people making diﬀerent decisions about RTO participation.  So I think it's just sort of a policy move in the wrong direction. But I certainly am hopeful that the commission comes together on that."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Understood. Is there a timeline as to when the comment period ends and when they might make a ﬁnal determination yet?,"I don't know that there is right now, they got the post them over in the Federal Register ﬁrst. So we're thinking probably a summer, summer time frame for the April."
"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you squeezing me in and let me call here. First just to follow up on the transmission. Are you able to ride an EPS sensitivity or potential impact if that RTO incentive adder were to be eliminated?","Yes. We had in our queue actually. The number for our evaluation if we lost the entire 50 basis points, it would amount to $55 million to $70 million pretax. So and that's the evaluation now. Who knows what they're going to do. Because you went in the meeting thinking they may actually go up on the RTO incentive but it remains to be seen what they decide to do. But that's the impact."
Well that was the next thing I was going to ask is do you see any potential of an increase or do you think that's highly improbable at this point?,American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I think certainly with what transpired we're just trying to make sure it stays the same. But if it increases there's a lot of reasons for it to increase because RTO participation and the adder is associated with transmission like I said the expenses of an RTO continue to go up and up. So I think there deﬁnitely needs to be an incentive there.
"Okay, great. Then just one last follow-up question on the renewables. You talked a bit about the cost savings from coal plant retirements, and I know it's early and the cost will be continuously changing hopefully downward. But from what you see today, do you expect this update to the generation stack to lower customer bills in most cases all else equal? And you mentioned something about a potential carbon policy. Does your analysis assumes some sort of federal clean energy standard and how would it look from aﬀordability perspective without that?","We have always had a carbon value in our analysis from a resource planning perspective. And that's I think it's 15 dollars a tonne, is what we've used. In our reports, our climate report, we used two cases of $15 case and a $30 case that was more aggressive and certainly that brought more -- that case brought more renewables and more quickly, but that's not reﬂected in the plan that we've shown here. So yes, it's certainly something that we're -- we will continue to look at, evaluate with the commissions. Yes, go ahead.     Just to throw additional ﬁner point on that as well, if carbon pricing is excluded from the equation, the renewable opportunity could get here cut by about 2 gigawatts. So it's not that signiﬁcant, but want to throw that out there.     Yes. We're looking at this thing as $15 to $20 billion investment opportunities. So, it would be not much of an impact if you took out the carbon pricing. But you can't plan for anything without putting in a carbon pricing these days."
Okay. Great. And the aﬀordability question assuming the carbon is in the ballpark of what you're talking about. How would that --,"Yes. And we've demonstrated that with North Central. I mean you can put these projects in place. And keep in mind we're thinking about the resiliency and reliability of the grid too. So there's limitations and we have to go through that process, but the ones we have in this plan we can do. And certainly, when you look at the beneﬁts of north-central for example, it was $3 billion of beneﬁt to the customers. And so when you have those kinds of economics in play, if you're able to run your 24/7 generation as more of a reliability and as an insurance policy   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   essentially and layer in as much renewables you can put in transmission to make sure the system system continues to operate the way it should, then it could be a pretty powerful combination to beneﬁt customers in the future."
"Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just wanted to touch base on Rockport if I could in kind of the decision tree that led to this in, just want to see what other kind of options you were evaluating. Just a bit more color would be helpful there. Thanks.","Yes. So obviously we were looking at Future requirements instead of environmental requirements on the units. And if we kept them operating longer than 2028 that would be a challenge from economic perspective. We didn't want to start making those kinds of investments not knowing how long the unit would actually be operational. So that was a consideration.  The other as I mentioned was the litigation to clear all that out to make sure we took ownership and we took control. And then of course the value of the bridge that exists that gives us the ﬂexibility to make decisions with the Indiana commission to focus on what is the right path for that transition. So it gives us a lot of optionality, a lot of ﬂexibility and the control. And by the way, I mean, there's two units there. So one we own, one we leased and it just made more sense for us to own both of them and make the decision of the plant as a whole and be able to adjust accordingly. So, it worked out well overall from that perspective and like I said gives us a lot of optionality and ﬂexibility and actually it's a pretty -- at a price that I think it was $115 million. So it's an opportunity for us to really pay for that degree of optionality that has considerable value."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks.,"Yep, sure. Thanks.     e have time for one more question.  Operator  Great. Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.     Michael, you snuck in there."
"I snuck in at the end. Better late than never. Thank you for taking my question, team. Hey, Nick, you mentioned Kentucky today. You also outlined the renewable growth platform and plans for the regulated businesses. And obviously, you need -- lots of renewable companies pure plays trading at pretty good multiples even after the recent share price weakness. Just curious how do you think about the renewable portfolio at the G&M segment? And whether that piece of the business is truly core to AEP or whether the real growth is obviously in the regulated subsidiaries and maybe the non reg contracted renewable business could potentially be a source of funds for the parent to fund regulated growth?","Yes. So that's been a continual part of our business. Chunk gets allocated Capital -- the AEP energy gets allocated capital. And he's perfectly willing to throw it back over the fence, because we make evaluations based upon his threshold which is commensurate with the regulated part and also just his business is important because it keeps us in a part of like, for example, we're doing a lot of projects inhere Ohio directly with customers and enables it us to -- with customers in corporations actually, and it enables us to be in that business, but at the same time we're able to manage the capital such that he can throw it back over the fence if we see a better opportunity on the regulated side. So we have that work in very well where we can make those trade-oﬀs on the continual basis. So, yes, it can be a source. It can be a source of capital to do some of these things and again that lens itself to the portfolio management approach to ensure that to ensure that we're putting the money in the right place at the right time.  So I -- and like I said, he's doing an incredible job with that and that organization. And the fact is they they're doing they're still doing the renewable part of it, but they're also doing speciﬁc relationships with customers with microgrids and those types of applications. So the value proposition of that business is so important to us seeing the leading edge of what we need to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   be doing and making cases in our regulated business to ensure that we continue to grow from those perspectives as well. So all it's working ﬁne. But yes, the answer is yes. We can utilize that as a source."
