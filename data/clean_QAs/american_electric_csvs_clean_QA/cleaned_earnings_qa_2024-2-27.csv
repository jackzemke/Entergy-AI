Question,Answer
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning. So obviously, the slides are leaning on the successes of AEP. You've reiterated your earnings guidance, balance sheet targets, growth rate, CapEx numbers. I guess, outside of some management shuﬄing, what do you see as broken? I guess, what's the goal of the review? What's on the table? What's oﬀ the table?","Well, this is Ben, and I can tell you that I don't think I would use the word broken. I think there's areas where we can do better. I think -- and I think we showed you in the script many of the accomplishments we made, but we also recognize that we can do better on getting constructive regulatory outcomes.  So, strategically, our priorities remain the same. We have completed, as we mentioned, a review of Transource. We want to keep that asset. We think it's a great asset. And I think given the various changes that FERC is looking at, I think it gives us a lot of optionality. We'll continue to be very disciplined portfolio managers. I said it on my scripted remarks, but always willing to transact where price and the ability to execute intersect, and that's our key point.  And ﬁnally, though, if you step back, I think one of the ways you add value in this industry long- term is by placing CapEx at 1x book, investing in CapEx at 1x book and getting constructive recovery of that. And again, we've done pretty good on that, but we can do better. So we're going to look at the people, the process, and the planning that goes into that, those constructive outcomes. And we're going to do it through the lens of what's important to our local leaders and stakeholders.  Extremely important that we keenly listen to what they want and what they need at a local level. And I think you can translate that then to a much better chance for success. And then you get into that virtuous circle where invested capital not only is good for customers and the community, but good for shareholders as well. So that's the plan going forward."
"And do you believe -- so Ben, did this -- do you believe there's some jurisdictions that AEP currently operates where you may not be able to hit those sort of targets as you're thinking about people, process, et cetera?","Well, I think there's areas where we have improvement, but I will turn it over to Peggy and/or Chuck to elaborate on that.     I think as it relates from a regulatory perspective, I do think what we're going to do is continue to build on the constructive legislative and regulatory outcomes that we have had. We're going to further strengthen our regulatory relationships and we're really going to be keenly focused on execution. I think that some of the disappointments that we had in 2023, we're going to learn from them and we're going to go back out and focus on execution from that standpoint.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just as -- Ben, as you and the Board are sort of thinking about where AEP stands today, I guess, what are you looking for in the next CEO? Are you kind of looking for a prior CEO, a President of an APCo, someone with a ﬁnance background, regulatory background, internal, external? I guess, can you just maybe specify exactly what you're looking for in the next successor?","Well, it's deﬁnitely an external search. I'll start with that. And I don't want to narrow it down to any speciﬁc background, but ideally -- and by the way, I think we're going to get a very robust list of candidates. The AEP is a great company with great assets, and I think it's going to be an attractive destination for many, many talented people.  So, I think it's going to be great to pick from that talent. Ideally, you get a somebody that is a seasoned executive in the utility industry is well-known in the investor community. I think that's extremely important, has great leadership qualities. We've got a lot of talent at AEP and we want to develop that talent. And ultimately, it'd be ideal if they have multi-jurisdictional experience and the ability to achieve regulatory success. Those are -- that's a big wish list, but again, I think we're going to get a lot of great candidates."
"Got it. Terriﬁc. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it to someone else, and good luck on Phase 2. Appreciate it.","Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.     Hey, Jeremy.  Operator  Jeremy, your line might be on mute."
"I just want to kind of continue along these lines if I could. And I was wondering if you're able to comment, I guess, on the recent agreement AEP announced with Icahn Capital and kind of how that ties into the change at the top here given the relatively short tenure. And just wondering, if there's anything else we should be expecting, I guess, along these lines looking forward with Icahn's recent announcement.","Yes. I really just will probably just rehash what we've said in press release and in our scripted remarks. I mean, the Icahn -- additional Board members came after discussions with the Icahn team and the AEP team. We actually welcome their perspective. They share the opinion, as we do, that AEP shares are undervalued, and we want to work together to unleash shareholder value.  Regarding Julie's departure, I mean, I really can't go into any more details than what we've already said. It was a full Board decision after discussions with Julie, and we decided that the best path forward is to transition to a new CEO. We're going to continue to work hard to deliver shareholder value. I think the Icahn Board members will give us a fresh perspective as we pursue those goals."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And just as we think about the strategic path going forward at this juncture, are all options on the table or any options oﬀ the table? Just want to kind of see the parameters of what we could expect going forward.","Well, we really like the assets we have, okay. We've completed the strategic reviews, but I mean, the price -- we're going to continue to look for opportunities to do the right thing for our shareholders. But I think we're in an enviable position that the assets we have can also achieve our strategic goals.  And Chuck mentioned where we are with FFO to debt and those targets. So I think we're in a pretty good position, quite honestly. So again, as I said before, not to be redundant, but I guess, it will be. We'll be good portfolio managers and we'll continue to be open to transactions if the price is right and the ability to execute is viable. But in the meantime, we're going to do the blocking and tackling that in the long-term get you the results that you're going to want to see."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Wonderful. Very helpful. Thank you for that.,You're welcome.  Operator  Your next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead.
"Thanks for the prepared remarks and taking my questions. Good morning. So I guess, you acknowledged in your remarks there has been some twists and turns and some regulatory volatility in '23. You had some headwinds that you highlighted from the FERC order on taxes, the Oklahoma rate order, among a few other items. But just the 6% to 7% has been pretty resilient and unchanged this entire time. So, can you just maybe help us all understand just what's kind of allowing AEP to absorb these issues and where the oﬀsets have been kind of in the ﬁve-year plan that allows you to continue to reaﬃrm?","Well, I mean, I'll kick it over to Chuck in a minute, but the $43 billion on a ﬁve-year capital plan underpins the 6% to 7%. In the years where we might have unfavorable weather or other things like that, that's the resiliency of this AEP management team that I talked about.  And it's not just one year, it's a -- look back, I mentioned 14 years of getting what we said we were going to do. Yes, sometimes you get regulatory bumps in the road and other things that might happen. But if you look back historically and if you look forward, we produce. I mean, we are in 11 jurisdictions, we're going to ﬁle rate cases. But if you look at history, we generally do pretty well. And when we have a bump in the road, we ﬁgure out how to absorb it and what we need to do better going forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that.     Yes. No, Ben, as you said, as underpinned by the $43 billion ﬁve-year capital plan, I'd also point to what Ben made an observation as a Board member and in his opening remarks about our   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   O&M. There's a chart in our deck that you can refer to, right?  We've doubled the rate base of this company, while basically keeping O&M ﬂat over that entire 10-year period. I think that's a remarkable accomplishment, and that's our plan going forward as we continue to grow this company and basically repurpose and reallocate O&M.  I also talked in my remarks about the load opportunities. I tend to kind of take a measured approach to this, but we really are optimistic about the opportunities that we're seeing there. As I said, the commercial load growth is just amazing, and we're seeing some good opportunities in economic development activities in industrials as well.  And then lastly, of course, underpinning that plan is improved returns, right? We are not earning where we need to earn, and we need to have the regulatory execution and prudency review to make sure, right, that we are hitting the mark there. So I think all in all, that kind of underpins the plan going forward."
"Got it. And deﬁnitely appreciate the comments on diversiﬁcation and the size of the overall plan as well as the O&M. Thank you for that. And then I guess, just sticking with this 6% to 7% CAGR, is there any kind of shaping to that over the ﬁve-year plan? Is there anywhere that you kind of see yourself in that range right now? And then as we kind of think about a new CEO coming in, hopefully in the back half of this year, is it your expectation that they would come in to embrace that plan or would they have more say in where they're taking the company? Thank you.","Yes. So I'll take the ﬁrst question. Our ﬁve-year plan is really based oﬀ the midpoint of the current year's guidance. And our plan is to grow basically on that midpoint between the 6% to 7% range with no real kind of ups and downs identiﬁed through there.  I'll let Ben answer the second --     I mean, I think, ﬁrst of all, we'll take our time and we'll ﬁnd the absolute best successor, permanent successor that we can. I think as part of that process, we obviously will have the strategic discussions. I mean, I think the Board is very comfortable with our strategy and our strategic priorities. I suspect that the ultimate permanent successor CEO will also be comfortable with those strategies and perhaps can ﬁgure out a better way to execute on them. That would be the goal, but we're not looking at a complete redismantling of our strategic priorities."
Thanks a lot for answering the questions today. I appreciate it.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),You're welcome.     Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. A bit of a shift on the asset sale program, I guess, in terms of the decision to retain the transmission JV. So, could you just talk a little bit about the rationale there? And how we should think about your view on transmission as part of the portfolio or potentially as an area of sort of value monetization going forward?","Well, I mean -- and I'll let Chuck -- this is Ben. I'll let Chuck augment what I'm going to say, which is pretty much what I said before. Transmission is a great asset and we are obviously the largest transmission provider in the United States and we like that position. We will be open to things that make sense that would do even better for shareholders. But we don't feel compelled. We have to do anything. So I think that puts us in a better position as we move forward.  Chuck, I don't know if you want to add to that, but --     Yes. I think we're also referring maybe to Pioneer and Prairie Wind and our decision to keep those assets, the reality is, right, these contributed earnings to AEP, their attractive returns, and overall, it was really insigniﬁcant, right, to our overall ﬁnancing plan if we were planning on selling those assets.  So, it really goes back to the root of Ben, what Ben said, is we reviewed the opportunities before us in competitive transmission and then looked at other transmission assets that we have. We're embracing it. It's time for us, as the leader in transmission to continue, right, to lead that space and that's what we plan to do."
"That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then Chuck, probably for you, just a little bit of a shift in tone around the FFO to debt metrics as well for '24. Can you just talk about what we should   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   expect relative to that 14% to 15% range for 2024 on FFO to debt? And what the moving pieces are that you're kind of watching that could move you outside of that range?","Yes. So, I -- thank you for that question. And our message has changed a bit there on the timing. But what I would tell you is really kind of timing is not what is most important. It's really the trend that we're on, and then it's hitting the mark of 14%, and it's the sustainability on staying in that range as we go through the ﬁve-year plan.  So let me comment on a couple things, right? We said we would be above 13% by year-end and we were. And we didn't make any excuses for the soft weather that happened in 2023. Note also that 13% is the downgrade threshold at Moody's. And second, right, the trend is very positive, right? This quarter, we're going to have another roll-oﬀ of cash collateral in Q1. I think the number is around $390 million that will come out of the 12-month average and also, we are working on our -- on down our deferred fuel balances.  And then lastly, right, we clearly show our models and review those with the agencies. Those models indicate that we will be in the range this year and be in the range over the longer-term. That's what's most important, right, hitting the mark, trending in that positive direction, and staying in the range. So again, the timing, which month or which quarter, is not important. It's the three things that I mentioned earlier."
"Given the focus on people and processes, how long do you view the company's review of its regulatory strategy to take? And in that context, how is the new review diﬀerent from how AEP has reviewed its regulatory strategy historically?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Well, I'm going to turn it over to Peggy, who's the point on that, but this isn't like this is something we're just initiating. This is something that I've heard discussed that as a Board member at the Board level. It's something I'm going to get very much involved in with Peggy.  We've got a good team, but we're going to have to -- we'll make sure that we do what we need to do to get better outcomes in the future. And I mean, there's a lot of blocking and tackling that really behind the scenes stuﬀ that goes into the actual processing, executing, and planning of a rate case and it's -- it gets really down in the weeds pretty quickly, but those things add up.  So, Peggy, I'll turn it over to you.     Yes. I would just add in looking forward to working with Ben and talking through the regulatory strategy, we've had positive regulatory outcomes in 2023. And we shared some of those earlier, there was some disappointments that we highlighted, but I would bring forth the legislative work that we have done and that's going to help to address lag.  We've done work that's going to help to remove some of the lag in Virginia with our biennial rate review for Virginia, where it was three years before. We're going to also look at improving on. We said with Kentucky, that it was going to be a two-step process. And we very much view that we had a constructive outcome in the order that we received earlier in January with the securitization. So we're going to continue to build upon that. I agree, we do have a talented team, and we're just going to keep moving forward. And I look forward again, as I said, to working with Ben on ways we can continue to improve there."
"Great. And then unrelated, where do you see the biggest opportunities to beneﬁt from the data center built out in your service territory? And given your balance sheet constraints, do you have any reservations or concerns around that opportunity?","The biggest opportunities so far have been in Ohio and Texas and in our forecasts for our ﬁve- year plan we have included, the capital needed to serve those customers. If there is incremental growth beyond that, it would be an opportunity that we have to evaluate and ﬁgure out how we would smartly ﬁnance it."
"Just hopefully, two easy ones, one for you, Ben, one for Chuck. Just Ben, I don't know what kind of insight you can provide, but just if I think about the 1% position that Icahn had taken, and it seems that there's been some major changes in the Board, I didn't think that would be a big position that yet. I think two voting seats and then a non-advisory seat. Just thoughts on what change in the Board that may be to expand the Board.","Well, I mean, you're right, there's like -- I think there's 5.3 million shares that something like that Icahn holds. And we had discussions with Icahn and we settled on the two incremental Board seats and the advisory position. I think back to Julie, I'll just repeat what I said. This was a full Board decision after discussions with Julie and the Board, and we determined it was best for AEP to transition to a new CEO. So, you can read what you want into that, but I think I'm just going to just keep it as it is. It's a full Board decision, and you need the full Board to make a decision to remove a CEO."
"Great. And then Chuck, two quick ones. It looks like the equity timing had moved. I understand your questions to Carly earlier on. You are targeting 14% to 15%, but above the 13% threshold, but I think the equity maybe slid oﬀ of the near-term. And then lastly, on earned returns, what type of improvement could we expect each year? And I'll leave it there.","Okay. Thanks, Anthony. Our equity needs haven't changed since EEI. You maybe referring to maybe an older forecast we had, some months back. But what you're seeing in our deck today is consistent, right, with what we've shown at EEI.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I'll let Peggy go ahead and mark -- talk about the returns.     Yes. As it relates to for 2024, our ROE, we're projecting a 9.1% is what we're -- for our regulated segments. And we're going to continue to work on closing the gap. A lot of what I've already said earlier, just kind of building oﬀ of some of those legislative successes that we were able to have, reducing some of the lag from that perspective."
"Hi. Just a quick one for me. I guess, like when you think about your jurisdictions, right, and the ones where you've got constructive outcomes regulatorily and the ones where you've got non- constructive outcomes. And how should we think about you allocating this increase in capital across these jurisdictions? Like, is there a strategy there to proactively reduce capital allocations to jurisdictions where your earned ROE just don't make a hurdle for what's attractive?","I'm going to turn it over to Peggy and Chuck in a minute, Sophie, but I mean, we're always going to look to put capital where we can get the best returns. There's baseline capital that you need to do to make sure that you never compromise resiliency, reliability or safety. So we -- but apart from that, I think it gets back to what I said. It's listening to what those local jurisdictions really want and need, and that can also shape your capital needs, because quite frankly, it can shape your regulatory outcomes.  So, I turn it over to the team if they have anything to add to that.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Yes. I do want to echo -- I would just say -- yes, I echo Ben's comments there on, there's a certain amount of capital we need to continue to be resilient and meet the reliability needs of our customers, and as well as from a safety perspective. Those where we have really constructive outcomes. Clearly, we know in I&M, we have the forward-looking test years. We're able to continue to have that capital that's allocated there to meet what those needs are, and we just continue to look at what our outcomes are by jurisdiction."
"Okay. And then maybe as going back to data centers, right? Do you see more attractive opportunities around incremental generation to support those customers or the T&D investment?","Yes. In Ohio and Texas, right, we're -- those are deregulated states. In our Indiana, Michigan territory, clearly there would be opportunities for generation there to serve those customers."
"Thank you very much. I guess, ﬁrst question would be on the '24 guidance. Does that continue to include contribution from the retail and the distributed resources as was sort of outlined at EEI?","Yes. Our EEI guidance, right, we kind of changed the waterfall based on the actual, right? But what's in or out hasn't changed, Paul. As Ben mentioned we're in the process that we plan to conclude here in the next several months on the retail and distributed businesses.  He also mentioned that we're closing on NMRD today, which there'll be a beneﬁt from that sale coming through. But no, everything is underpinned. Remember too, when you look at the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   waterfall, we took the Generation & Marketing segment down to what we call much more normal contributions. I'm not concerned about the ability to take the proceeds, use them as appropriate and to get that accretion as we go forward, but no, it's still the same plan, if you will, as we put out at EEI."
And then Chuck mentioned that the FERC decision is expected to have a $0.03 negative impact on '24. Is that going to be treated as operating EPS or is that going to be excluded as non- recurring?,"No, it's operating."
"And then I guess, the last question I have is currently there's a proceeding in Kentucky where, I guess, there's recommendations for potential disallowance of fuel and purchase power costs. I think there's also a fuel review that could take place or may be taking place in Louisiana. Can you give us, I guess, an update on what your expectations are and what's happening in those proceedings?","Yes. In Kentucky, we do have a two-year fuel review that has been underway and we're awaiting the outcome as it relates to that. We had a hearing earlier this month actually. And then from -- excuse me, what was your other question? Was it related to SWEPCO?"
"Yes. I think as part of the settlement on the renewables, there was, I guess, the ability of staﬀ to do a review of the fuel there.","Yes. That was part -- excuse me, sorry, go ahead, ﬁnish your question."
"And last question for me. In terms of the 9.1% that you're targeting for this year, I think what type of an improvement do you see as being necessary in order to hit the 6% to 8%? I think in the past, you've talked about needing to improve the earned ROE as part of hitting your targeted growth rate.","Yes. So, over our ﬁve-year plan, we look to be typically to be in a 9.5% rate. So what we're looking to do is increase by 10 basis points each year, and we think that that's achievable. And we continue to work through our regulatory outcomes to be able to close that gap."
So just it doesn't sound to me like there really is much of a change in strategy with the new chapter and the managerial change that you're looking at. Am I thinking about this correctly?,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. I think so. The strategy is great. We just have to execute and that's what we're keenly focused on, Paul."
"Okay. I just want to make sure I'm hearing. And then the second thing that I guess -- and I think this was asked before, but is there any timing that we should be thinking about in terms of when a new CEO would be in place?","Well, let me just say I'm committed to stay as long as it takes, so no shortcuts. But I can't see it being shorter than six months, and hopefully it doesn't take more than a year. But again, it's going to -- the process will take the time it needs to take to get the absolute right candidate in place."
"Okay. And then ﬁnally, when we're talking about regulatory desires and goals, having watched the various jurisdictions, there are a number of jurisdictions that I get the sense, and this isn't going to surprise you, Ben, but they want lower prices. And I'm just wondering, is there any sort of new or innovative way you're looking at the regulatory approach in terms of addressing maybe those concerns, increasing investment, but addressing those two concerns, other than obviously the general concern that I'm sure you guys have. But do you follow what I'm saying in terms of making investments and perhaps not seeing the resistance that, I think if you look at a number of the AEP jurisdictions that there just is to new investment leading to higher rates? Do you follow what I'm saying?","Yes. I mean, I think -- I mean, I'm going to turn it over to the team, Paul, but the amount of load growth that we see in our jurisdictions. I mean, that's a great opportunity, economic development that we can be a big part of, either helping to drive it or certainly providing the infrastructure to allow it. Those are great opportunities. And that's -- everybody wants that in all jurisdictions. But again, we're going to very carefully listen to what our jurisdictions want and need and respond accordingly.  Peggy or Chuck?     Yes. And I'll just brieﬂy add to that. In 2023, we landed 92 new customer load additions totaling about 5 gigs and adding additional jobs to our service territory. So I think that, that's certainly one area and aspect of how we're going to help with aﬀordability as well.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. And Paul, clearly, the data center load that we're experiencing is going to create an opportunity, right, to spread ﬁxed costs, right, along a bigger base and improve the headroom opportunity there as well."
"Okay. Great, and I appreciate it, and good to see you back then hopeful as well.","Thank you. Thank you, Paul. Appreciate that.     Thank you for joining us on today's call.
