Question,Answer
"So Bob, just maybe starting with oﬀshore wind and the performance guarantee. I know it's -- obviously, it's a tough position to be in here. It's a lot of risk you're going to be taking on, and that could be kind of long-term in nature. I know you guys talked about paths to resolve. But what if you don't resolve, right? So one, we know it's a lot of growth for you, but could you decide to walk away from this project as order, can this to be a no go? And two, I know you laid out some thoughts in the script on next steps. Is there a bid-ask here that would make some sort of a standard palatable? Could you negotiate this, or any performance guarantees are a no-go?","Yeah, Shar. First of all, I'm shocked that you didn't ask about Millstone, that breaks through..."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Wait. That was my follow-up question, Bob.","Alright. Fair enough. Good. I'm glad you're remaining consistent. Let me address the questions that you asked. It's premature to be talking about that Shar. We just got this order Friday afternoon. As we said in our prepared remarks, there is very little detail in that order. And as it is drafted, as we look at it, it is inconsistent with the utility risk proﬁle expected by our investors. But it's a great project and it has a lot of stakeholder support. There are options for us to seek reconsideration and options for us to work with stakeholders so that we can get that clarity that we need for this to meet our expectations of what utility investors are looking for. So we're conﬁdent that we're going to be able to get that clarity as we work with stakeholders, but we're just 72 hours after the order. So there is not a lot more beyond that that I can tell you this morning."
"But any -- I guess, any sense on just the timing and when we can get some more clarity or resolution on this?","Yeah. That will depend obviously on stakeholders and on the Commission. So we will work through that. I would hope and over the coming weeks is the kind of timeline that we would be looking for, for something like this."
"Okay, got it. And then just maybe just switching gears quickly to Washington. Obviously, the IRA passed the Senate. Seems to be a lot of puts and takes for utilities. And then how are you I guess, thinking about the potential impacts of the 15% AMT on cash ﬂows and rate base growth weighted against maybe the enlargement and extension of some of those tax credits? And just remind us on the AMT recovery methods in the states and should we assume some lag? Thanks.","Shar, good morning. It's Jim. Let me recap the -- our view on the act, the Inﬂation Reduction Act. Still a moving target, of course. Really good that it passed the Senate. We'll see what other amendments pop up if any as it goes to the House this week. But here's where we are on broad strokes. So really high-level, pretty good. Really positive from a decarbonization incentive perspective, Really positive from utility customer cost perspective. So good.  When it comes to all of the impacts to Dominion's ﬁnancial plan, you touched on a little bit of it. The devil is in the details. It's going to take a long time before all the treasury regs are worked out. I mean it's not even a law yet. But right now, based on what we know, we don't really see a major impact to our plan. Now, customer beneﬁcial incentive is good and that could have some knock-on eﬀects that are positive, but we don't see it as being an impact. And let me talk about a little bit, the parts.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   ITC and PTC, the extension increases, again all good. Good for us, good in the sense that it's direct like customer by bill beneﬁt. We assume that we're going to continue to do what we've already been doing, recognizing as beneﬁts in the customer bill over time and diﬀerent for diﬀerent assets. So nuclear PTC, big topic of discussion of course. We view that as positive as well for us, for the nuclear industry, for customers. I think there, it's going to take some real time before the regulations are worked out, to determine how exactly nuclear units within a vertically-regulated utility like most of ours, how they're treated when it comes to earned revenue per megawatt hour. Because there is a phase-out, right? $43 a megawatt hour. Above that, you are not eligible.  But we'll see. We have the low-cost units, should be eligible. How that's calculated for a vertically regulated utility, no detail yet.  If we qualify under that cap, it's a beneﬁt to our customers in Virginia and South Carolina, no question. Millstone, obviously not regulated, hedged, PPA. But as a reminder, under that existing 10-year PPA, all tax attributes, new tax attributes like this, for 100% of the plant output, they ﬂow through to the PPA oﬀ-takers and their customers. So again, customer-friendly element even for Millstone and long term, good for the industry, good for the future of most in whatever happens after that 10-year PPA.  For oﬀshore wind, again sticking with PTC. On the surface, we expect kind of the same thing when we talked about in the BBB era. That if there is a full rate PTC, which the Senate version includes the full rate PTC, that could lower the LCOE for our oﬀshore wind project by up to $7. So pretty good there too. So all that, the PTCs, ITCs, the extension, the increase, we think it's good in a customer-friendly way and that can have, as I mentioned, knock-on eﬀect.  The AMT, of course, the other part, in my might sense for the AMT is it's going to impact companies, even in even in our industry, in really diﬀerent ways depending on whether you're a cash taxpayer right now or not, and whether you generate credits or not, ITC/PTC. So in our case, we're already a federal cash taxpayer and have been for some years. So our rate though -- our federal cash tax rate is shielded by our inventory of tax credit, because we generate a lot of tax rate credit.  So, as you know, Shar, the way that works is, 21% top federal rate is shielded by tax credit, but the maximum you can sheild is 75% of your cash tax liability. So that means for us, our current federal cash tax rate is 5.25%. So 25% of the federal -- 21% -- 25% times 21%. So the IRA, this bill, totally diﬀerent approach. 15% minimum on adjusted GAAP pre-tax income and those adjustments, again, devil's in details but you take out pension plans, you take out NDTs, you add in the -- I mean this is a change where we can in and accelerated tax depreciation from the tax books into the -- this calculation of GAAP, adjusted GAAP. But the tax credits that shield remains. So you can still shield up to 75% of your cash tax liability with credits. So in this case, it would be not the 5.25% of your tax -- pre-taxable income but it would be 3.75% of adjusted GAAP, so 25% of the 15%. So a lot of math there.  But you can probably guess from that that taking a view on a go-forward basis, like, what is this going to look like? What's the diﬀerence between 5.25% of taxable income compared to 3.25% of adjusted GAAP? How does this change over time? It's complicated. But our view, based on   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   what we know is probably kind of in the same general area since we are already a cash taxpayer. So that drives us to the conclusion that, look, devil is in the detail. We're not seeing a material impact. So details to come, we'll see where it lands this week in the House. We would guess that the dust will settle in the next couple of weeks and we're going to be in a position to talk about the detailed impacts on a more granular basis by the time we're sitting down with you and others at EEI."
"Perfect. Thank you guys for the color. Bob, I'll jump back in the queue to ask my standard Millstone question. Thanks, guys.","All right. Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan."
"Maybe I'll pick up with the Millstone a little bit here. And there were some reports that Massachusetts might have interest in nuclear power, and just wondering any thoughts that you could share there. And I guess does things change with the PTC for Millstone? Just any thoughts on this as it relates to regular -- regulated and non-regulated nuclear in Massachusetts' potential interest in Millstone?","Well, as we've been saying for a while, Jeremy, we think Millstone is critical to the New England region achieving its zero carbon goals. And our view on that has only grown -- our conﬁdence on that has only grown in recent months. The Connecticut General Assembly passed a law allowing for additional nuclear as long as it's at the site of an existing nuclear plant, obviously, that would be Millstone. So we think there is an increasing recognition of the value of Millstone, and we're happy to work with stakeholders throughout the region on ensuring that Millstone is there to help them meet their clean energy goals. But beyond that sort of speciﬁc to their recent development in Massachusetts, not a lot to oﬀer. We just think it's a great long-term asset, incredibly valuable to the region.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And just as it relates to the issues around the data centers with regards to congestion there, could you provide any more color on what the accelerated T&D investments? What might look there? And could you provide us perspective on potential dollar amounts here and what size of the plan this represents? Just trying to see if there's any more detail possible that you could provide on the side.","Hey, Jeremy, it's Jim. Full detail to come in our full roll forward in our ﬁve-year plan and you will see changes there and acceleration of transmission spend. One data point that's was out there. Last week, there was a ﬁling with PJM for one required transmission investment, one of several to come, to make sure we're meeting demand there, and that was $500 million to $600 million. But that's not the total, more will be deﬁned in our planning and we'll discuss that on our fourth quarter call when we do our full roll forward of our capital plan, including all the transmission spend in Virginia."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.  Operator  The next question comes from Ross Fowler from UBS.,"Hey Ross, good morning. Can you hear us? Yeah. We are not hearing you. Ross, go on. Alright. Well, try again. Operator, shall we go to the next in the queue?"
"It's too hot. It's apparently too hot outside for my headphones to work. So there we go. So it's just a couple of questions. So Jim, you talked about how there is this up to $7 a megawatt hour savings in terms of the PTCs should the House pass this as written against that $80 to $90 per megawatt hour cost for oﬀshore wind or LCOE. That would also lower the cost cap at 125[ph], because it's a 1.4 times multiple. I just want to make sure that I'm clear on that.","Yeah, Ross. Actually that -- it does not aﬀect the cost cap. The multiple and the statuted is oﬀ of a CT what -- the LCOE have a CT from EIA report of 2019, I think, was. So that change while incredibly valuable to our customers does not change the cost-cap ﬁgure."
"Got you. So it gives you more headroom to that cap. All right. And then in the original settlement for oﬀshore wind, it certainly wasn't a performance guarantee, but there was this concept of a lower capacity factor of about 37%, and then you'd report to the Commission if it was ever lower than that on a three-year rolling average. And then the Commission would determine whether that was a deﬁciency related to basically unreasonable actions by you versus sort of weather and everything else. So it seems like there is space between that and what was very unclearly written in the order as a reconsideration here to make sure we're not necessarily punishing you for the weather and things you can't control. Is that fair? Is that kind of where you see it and where we could be headed here?","Yeah. I mean you've accurately -- you accurately described the performance provision and the stipulation. And yeah, so there is space in between and as we mentioned, we intend to work with stakeholders. Obviously, just got the order less than 72 hours ago, but that space in between I think is precisely where we would be looking to try to ﬁnd common ground."
"(Multiple Speakers) next quarter here. Hey, hey. Thank you, guys. If I can just following up a little bit from Jeremy here, the timing of that CapEx related to PJM if I can. Can you elaborate a little bit on it, as well as maybe how this might tie into some of the Q[ph] reform that we're seeing with PJM. Obviously, that impacts more from the renewable side. But yeah, again, obviously load interconnect matters as well here as it goes. Can you talk a little bit about that from a PJM perspective? Obviously, you've submitted these things to PJM.  And then if I can throw in, the second question is the same, it's all related. You identiﬁed a series of numbers here related to load sensitivity to data centers. And if I get it right, you're talking about 12% number, and broadly speaking, it kind of backs into about a 2% and change total load growth from the data center side going into next year. And if you look at the sensitivity is just perhaps $0.02 to $0.03 on earnings. Just want to make sure. You've tried to call it out very speciﬁcally, I want to make sure we're looking at that map correctly here on the year-on-year as well.","Good morning, Julien. This is Diane Leopold. I'll at least start and then maybe hand it oﬀ to Jim on some of the latter parts of your question. So related to timing on the data centers. So these were all transmission projects that we had planned long-term anyway. We've seen some of these constraints, we were already designing it. So accelerating it is really moving the capital in our plan up roughly two years. So to have the ﬁrst set of projects in by 2026, the latter part of 2025. So that transmission spend that was may be more focused on 2025, 2026, and 2027 would move into capital that would be 2023, 2024, and 2025. And likewise, the next set of projects and that's what's going to be ﬁled in the next -- in the coming weeks. The next tranche of relieving the transmission constraint also moving up in time, but instead of being online by 2026 is 2028. So you can just kind of move that on out.     Hey, Julien, on your sales question. Let me give you a couple of comments there. So look, ﬁrst, you need to diﬀerentiate between demand and sale. Some of Bob's comments and we set out is on demand, increases of demand for data centers and -- in this potentially aﬀected area. So we don't get paid on demand, of course. Typically not fully utilized, it's a long time for data centers to ramp up, et cetera. But we get paid on sales.  And for this customer class, like other high usage customers, there is a lower margin. So what drops to the bottom line isn't necessarily the same as a sales number. It's still helpful, meaning the increased sales helps oﬀset increases to the typical customer bill across the system, but it is a lower margin based on its high usage.  So impacts to the bottom line from these issues just described could be a little bit years out after this ramp period of plateauing, slower growth slightly in data center sales, oﬀset by what Diane just mentioned, increases in the needed transmission spend, which is, of course, not   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   lower margin, it's formula rate in rider. So it's hard to take a -- in summary, a straight line from changes in demand down to the bottom line for EPS sensitivities."
"Yeah understood. That's why I asked. Excellent. And then just to clarify the last comment. You did a bunch of math, super quick. With respect to the ability, some of the changes over the weekend here on the tax adjustments that you can do for the adjusted GAAP. Just clarify, you can deduct items against AMT with respect to bonus depreciation here as you described. I think you said that, I just want to make it crystal clear, this morning.","Okay. Not bonus depreciation, but the tax depreciation makers. The -- whatever is in your tax books including for utility spend translates over as an adjustment in this GAAP, adjusted GAAP pre-tax income calculation for AMT purposes."
Okay. So when you...   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"From the last round of tax reform, that's correct."
"Okay, thanks. And just, Bob, quickly following up on the sort of the performance guarantee provision. I understand there's a lot of moving pieces. How does this impact the sort of the schedule of the project and your planned activities in the second half of the year and next year?","We wouldn't expect it to have any eﬀect on the schedule. We are -- again, we'll work quickly, as quickly as we can with stakeholders. But this, as you know, is a guarantee that aﬀects the -- applies to the operation, not the construction of the facility. So it won't have an eﬀect on the schedule."
