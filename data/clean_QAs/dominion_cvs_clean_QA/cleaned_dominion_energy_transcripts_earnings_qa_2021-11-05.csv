Question,Answer
"Good morning. So Bob and Jim, you have got this settlement which as you mentioned in the prepared, remarks does derisk even the second triennial review. I guess, I just want to touch a little bit on the level of conﬁdence in your plan now. How does that sort of tie into the 6.5% EPS growth target that's been out there? And can we see some changes around the capital program as a result of the settlement, maybe when you report year-end results?","Yes. Thanks, Shahriar. When we set that 6.5% rate in July of last year, July of 2020, we were conﬁdent then. We were asked some of that and we said that there's no obviously one input we were asked a lot about this triennial at the time. There's no one input to setting a growth rate like that, it's a variety of inputs. And one of the things that we mentioned that the time was we assumed that we're going to have constructive regulatory outcomes and we've had those.  We had won in South Carolina and in North Carolina and in this Virginia triennial. All of that is supportive of that 6.5% growth rate. So, we were conﬁdent at the time we announced it, we remain conﬁdent. We think we've executed well on regulatory outcomes and this most recent triennial settlement is a good example of that.  Now as the capital will update capital on the fourth quarter call as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So, the bottom line is what we remain as conﬁdent and 6.5% as we did when we announced it.

"Got it. And then, just lastly, on Coastal wind. It's a huge data dump. So appreciate that incremental color you provided. The $87 LCOE capital costs are higher. So obviously, you're seeing some cost pressures despite being below the projections and still within the range, right? Living the initial cost, correct me, if I'm wrong, was $8 billion. Can you touch on sort of the customer bill impact here, as costs are higher just isolating this project and it seems that the input cost pressures are kind of widespread. So, how do you sort of think about mitigating factors assuming these costs headwinds have some persistency?","Yeah. So, the cost you are right. The capital cost number is that we estimated earlier now that we've done all of the competitive bidding processes, and moved from conceptual to ﬁrm contracts has gone up some. But as we mentioned the production expectation that capacity factor out of this has also gone up as we've got more data, which means that the customer bill impact is the same.  As we said, be an $80 to $90 per megawatt-hour range, and we're squarely within that $87. So you can't focus just on the capital input here on a project like this. You also have to focus on how much electricity is generating, since it's going to be generating more than we had previously assumed. That's what lands that customer impact, right where we've been talking about in the $80 to $90 range."
"Okay, great. Terriﬁc. I think that sort of touches in a few days.",Thanks Charles.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from David Peters with Wolfe Research.
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   First question I have is just on the recent election outcomes in Virginia, obviously, a lot of focus there nationally and given that I have a republican governor and I think the general assembly ﬂip too. Wondering if you could maybe just provide some perspective on what do you think may or may not change going forward particularly with respect to energy policy in the state?","Yes. Thanks, David. In the last -- if you look back over the last 15 years or so in Virginia, I think the party in power in the governor's mansion is changed twice. In the Virginia House of delegates, it's changed twice. In the state Senate, it's changed several times. The Senate wasn't up for election this time, it was the governor and house of delegates.  What's remained consistent throughout that period is that our company has maintained constructive relationships with members of both parties, and we don't see any reason that would change. And the reason is that what has remained also consistent over that period and even before is that bipartisan commitment to economic growth, and jobs, and the economy in Virginia.  And if you look at what governor-elect Youngkin to ran on, not surprisingly given his extensive business background. He ran on a platform of increasing jobs and economic growth, and we obviously, support that we're going to do everything we can to help him achieve the objectives of growing Virginia's economy. We do that by providing reliable electricity, by keeping energy prices aﬀordable prices aﬀordable, we've done that over the years. That was our reliability and aﬀordability were recognized by the SEC staﬀ and the recent triennial review. So we have a track record there.  So what I would expect is that Virginia will continue that bipartisan commitment to jobs and economic development. As witnessed in the announcement, we've talked about in our prepared remarks, the Siemens-Gamesa oﬀshore wind blade ﬁnishing factory that was the result of bipartisan work. Both parties deserve credit for that kind of job creation in Virginia. We would expect that that's going to continue going forward."
"Great. Second question is switching gears a little bit, just kind of what's being proposed in Washington to this potential reconciliation bill. Wondering, Jim, maybe if you could comment on how meaningful something like a direct tile option would be for potentially loosening or lessening future equity needs given the mini renewable projects that you guys have here kind of on the come?","Yeah, David, it's a good question. A lot of commentary on that topic so far this earning season. I've been listening to some of that. And I agree with certainly one thing that's come up a lot, that it's super hard to speculate on moving target pending and draft legislation to hasn't landed yet. It's funny a couple quarters ago on this call, we were all speculating as the impacts of the straight up corporate rate increase -- corporate tax rate increase. So, how things have changed.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   But, if you thought, hard to say, exactly what's going to be in the ﬁnal version. But it does seem to us that something is going to pass. So, we'll see here next month or two. We imagine it will include the clean energy tax incentives, and the direct pay feature you're talking about. So that kind of thing an extension of the tax credits and the refundable basis, it's pretty clear that's going to be valuable and will beneﬁt probably those our customers and shareholders.  We expect incentives are going to reduce the cost of renewables to our customers could accelerate everything we're doing in our clean energy transition, and probably provide some pretty nice cash ﬂow features to fund additional capital investment. So it's all seems pretty good, details to come.  Now in the same package, is the minimum tax. So, not too disturbing for us, we're already a cash taxpayer not everybody is. But that's going to be based on GAAP earnings. It doesn't start till '23 is that current proposal. So, it's still early. How exactly that's going to work. There's a lot of detail to come. But even that part, we expect as part of this overall package, we think is all pretty manageable within our existing ﬁnancial proﬁle and potential trajectory. So, we'll give more clarity over time maybe next quarter, we can be talking about facts instead of speculation. But it all looks like it's manageable as a package."
Good morning. Nice sort of updates overall. I want to follow-up on Charles' oﬀshore wind question is -- how should we think about the earning potential and also credit consideration from the $2 billion increase in the estimated cost?,"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes. Paul, let me talk to that. So as we mentioned a couple times, we're going to provide a pretty comprehensive update on our fourth quarter call on all those details. The -- we're going to do a one-year roll forward of our capital plan and we'll go through everything that's related to that in detail like we did last year or early this year.  So the increase in the capital cost is one part of the LCOE. The increase in the capital costs and oﬀshore wind. So a couple of things. Keep in mind that spread over six years, so we do on year roll forward, it's going to include that 2026 year previous, version with your '25. So, that'll be included.  But keep in mind, there are some other gives and takes a lot of moving parts and plans. For example, we announced our IRP in September, that we were undertaking a postponement for further evaluation of a couple things, like some CTE's in Virginia and pumped storage project. So that's not in the current version of the near term plan. So, a lot of gives and takes, some puts and takes. We're going to go through all that on fourth quarter call. But for the avoidance of doubt, we expect all those updates are going to be supportive of EPS and dividend growth guidance. But you need to look at it holistically and not just based on the impact of the oﬀshore wind project alone."
"Okay. Great, that's clear. Important update. And then I know you commented on Questar pipe in prepared remarks, but you could elaborate a little bit on the conﬁdence in the transaction closing given some uncertainty you mentioned, and conﬁrming the counterparty could not proactively pay the termination fee to exit. Thank you.","Yeah, sure. And let me answer that a little bit higher level, just for everyone's beneﬁt, if they're not following maybe as closely. So we mentioned on last call, very robust participation if often we ran we feel very good about the announcement we made in October to sell that asset to Southwest Gas Holdings. All cash transactions almost $2 billion and it is on track. We expect that to close this quarter subject only to HSR clearance.  So yeah, there's a lot of back and forth, right in the press, we get that but we don't see any in fact, in our transaction. Our agreement is intentionally on both sides, it's airtight. Southwest gas has fully committed ﬁnancing. It's not dependent on completing equity issuance or anything like that. There are no conditions other than HSR and there's no kind of provision where they could be terminated early. So, we feel really good about that, pretty straightforward so we look forward to closing later this quarter."
"Just want to follow-up with the oﬀshore wind a little bit more here, if I could. Just want to see how do you see customer bill impacts through the completion of these initial oﬀshore wind days. And just thinking, what would be the bill impact under the 80 LCOE scenario? I think you might have touched on there with tax credit.","Yes. Obviously, that would improve the customer bill impact associated with the project as you correctly identiﬁed. If there's a tax beneﬁt gets passed on to customers we're still sorting through that. But again, based on the inputs that we've deﬁned here, we're just staying right in that $80 to $90 range. So, we get the lower end better for customers. And obviously, we'll have to see how that plays out."
Got it. Thanks for that. And then just understanding there's a cost focus with the oﬀshore win here. Could you outline how the economic beneﬁts in supplier agreements you outlined have evolved since this project was ﬁrst announced?,"Yeah, I think that they've evolved to be pretty consistent with what we expected when the project was ﬁrst announced. So, we had a pretty good idea of what will be involved in terms of construction and construction onshore for the electric transmission. There may be some additional beneﬁts probably with onshore electrical, because that's going to be given what we had to do to route this and to make sure we're connecting to the 500 kv that's part of -- what's driving the overall capital cost being greater.  So bigger investment there, more job creation there. But I think the bottom line is this is going to be good for the Hampton Roads economy, good for the Virginia economy. And I think that Siemens-Gamesa announcement is really important. Because it starts the process here in Virginia, a state that is very well positioned given its location on the East Coast, given its port and the access to the port unobstructed by bridges and the deepwater port to be a real hub of   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   oﬀshore wind economic activity. We certainly support that, we supported that and working with Siemens-Gamesa to put that blade factory here, so the more the better."
"Got it. Maybe just one last quick one, if I could. Could you speak a bit more to the RNG and hydrogen pilots how they progressed over the past quarter?","Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. This is Diane Leopold. I'll take that one. So RNG our program I think is far beyond a pilot now and we're up and running. We have one project that's already in service. So, obviously, starting very small, but we have ﬁve projects that are under construction now to avoid should be entering service in the next couple of months, and four more that are expected to be under construction by year-end. This is a cross growth both our swine and our dairy projects. All projects are going well on time on budget. And we're expecting to keep up that rough phase next year.  So that's on the RNG side. On hydrogen, that certainly is at the pilot phase. Our UT pilot, which was at a training facility in Salt Lake City is just about complete. And the test focused on residential and use appliances, leaked survey equipment, nitrous oxide emissions, the results of those tests conﬁrm that 5% hydrogen blend would not adversely aﬀect the distribution system.  All appliances operated safely, there weren't a lot of changes too, in the system when the hydrogen was added. So we're still doing a few additional tests. We did increase hydrogen blend up to 10% and still did not see any signiﬁcant impacts from that testing. But we want to keep doing some more testing on ﬁnal results that -- with that.  So, on next steps, we've been looking at several isolated regions on a system to do a live test and started the initial design phase. We're meeting with the regulators on our test results and on our plan to test. And will be meeting with them over the coming months. So that we can launch an expanded pilot probably in early 2023. And then ﬁnally, as Bob mentioned on North Carolina, we're going to start a similar initial project in North Carolina subject to commission approval of our settlement."
Got it. That's very helpful on the hydrogen projects side. Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to seeing the team at EI.,"Jeremy, thanks a lot. See you out there. See you down there.
