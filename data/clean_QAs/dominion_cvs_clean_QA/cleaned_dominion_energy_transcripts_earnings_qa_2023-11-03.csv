Question,Answer
"Just a little bit to unpack here, I guess, Bob, can you just maybe drill down a bit further on 14 and 15 Slides and kind of the messaging around breaking ahead? You're clearly trying to tell investors to not put a growth rate on 290 to get to '25, seems to be that you're pointing to more tailwinds than risks.  Can you just maybe elaborate a bit more on the drivers, like some of the balance sheet moving pieces as it relates to the hedge portfolio, transferability, and even potential free cash ﬂow growth at Millstone, right? And a follow-up, should we assume the pending growth rate guide will be oﬀ that much higher base in '25? Thanks.","Shar, I'll take that one. So on the second question, again, we view '25 as the foundational year for our post-review earnings growth. So, when we do our investor meeting, we'll provide our forecast for 2025 and a growth rate oﬀ of that 2025 number, a multi-year growth rate oﬀ of that 2025 number.  And with regard to Slides 14 and 15, look, we felt it was important, given the uncertainty that's been created as a result of the review, to try and be clear about what we think is an accurate assessment of what 2023 earnings are, not because it's going to be the foundational year, but because it's important that investors feel conﬁdent about our ability to deliver good results.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And the language we've provided on Slide 15 is simply an indication that, given a host of very important input variables, which are not public at this time, we would simply caution against taking a simpliﬁed approach of applying a growth rate to the $2.90."
"Got it. Okay. Okay, well, we'll wait for more details there. And Steven, the deck is so detailed around oﬀshore wind sale process, and it's clearly implying that nothing else is for sale like SCANA, which is good.  There is sort of a big concern for investors, so I have to ask, and I apologize for asking, but would Dominion be willing to accept a portion of their partner's construction in the sale, or will the risk sharing have to be basically 100% symmetric in order for the sale process to proceed? So basically asking, how comfortable would you be absorbing your partner's downside cost risk, especially as we're thinking about balancing that risk for rate payers and shareholders? Thanks.","Yeah, sure. Let's take a step back for a moment in this process. When we announced the top-to- bottom business review last call, we didn't even have legislative authorization to take an equity partner in oﬀshore wind.  Now we do, thanks to our proposal and our work with the legislature earlier this year. We didn't have an EIS, a record of decision, for the project. Now we do on the schedule that we expected. We hadn't started manufacturing equipment.  Now our ﬁrst shipment of monopiles has arrived on time. When we started, we had about 75% of project costs ﬁxed. Now we're at 92%. So I could go on with how well the project is going. So we feel very good about what we've done so far. We've got multiple parties who are engaged with us. And our objective is a true equity partner with pro rata sharing of project costs. That's what we're after."
"Okay. Thank you, just answered my question, Bob. That's very helpful. Thank you guys. We'll see you in a couple of weeks. Thanks.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  And our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays."
"Good morning. I just wanted to ask, I know there's a lot of scenarios on the sell down out there, but even up to like a 50% sell down on the oﬀshore wind, would you still kind of expect common equity needs to fund growth going forward? You're just calling out some items here, contracted energy cash ﬂow, tax credit transferability. Could you just help us kind of think about what the pro forma entity ﬁnancing needs were if you were to sell down? Thank you.","Yeah, we're not giving that guidance, Nick. The language we continue to use is that we're very speciﬁc on what we're attempting to achieve for credit, and we're also very speciﬁc on what we're attempting to achieve with regard to evaluating eﬃcient sources of capital, seeking to minimize any amount of external ﬁnancing need. When we have our investor meeting, we will provide a full outlook on what our ﬁnancing plan is. And so, we're just not in a position to give that guidance because the review is not complete yet."
"Understood, understood. And then Steve, I think in your remarks, you said the capital budget will be signiﬁcantly higher than any in your history. And I went back to your slides. I think you had like a $37 billion capital plan before you announced this strategic review. So should we take your comments to say that you should be higher than that number? Or is that even net of LDC sales and the oﬀshore wind sell down? How should we think about that?","Yes, Nick, let me provide a little guidance on that. So from 2018 through 2022, our company had a capital budget on average of about $6 billion per year. When we last provided our long- term growth guidance, which was the fourth quarter of 2021, net of gas distribution, so taking gas distribution capital out.  And you can go back and look at our Q4 2021 earnings deck for this. We averaged in '23, '24, and '25 at the time about $9 billion of capital investment each year over '23, '24, '25. We haven't at this time given any update to that, but we've talked a lot about some of the drivers that would potentially increase those numbers.  Another anecdotal piece of information is that year-to-date through 2023, our CapEx has been $7.2 billion. A year ago through 9:30, it was $5.2 billion. And for the full year 2022, it was $7.6   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   billion. So you can see even in the results year-to-date how signiﬁcantly increased our capital budget is.  And I want to be clear about what's driving that. What's driving that is demand growth, policy directives, and reliability investments, many of which are already underway under rider programs at DEV, as well as growth at our South Carolina utility. So more to come on that, Nick, but we have a very strong demand growth driving on a very robust amount of capital investment in our regulated businesses."
"Yeah. Hey, good morning. Thanks. So ﬁrst, just to repeat Shar's question a little bit on the oﬀshore wind sale, and Bob, I think you said your objective is to ﬁnd a partner that will have pro rata risk sharing. Do you get the sense that the people looking at it are willing to do that?","Yes, Steve, we're going to look at the total picture on any deal. So I'm not going to tell you what any speciﬁc pieces of it may be, while we sit here today. We're going to judge any deal against the commitments and priorities that we set out at the beginning of the process.  Does it help improve our credit metrics? Does it solidify our credit proﬁle? Does it enhance shareholder value? Does it reduce the company's concentration in this one project? Is it consistent with our goal of reliable performance? Those are the things we're going to look at. And again, our objective is to get a true equity partner with pro rata sharing of project costs. I can't tell you today what the speciﬁc pieces of any deal may be, because it's not done yet. That's what we're after."
"Okay. And just another question on the oﬀshore wind, the 92% ﬁxed cost, that's great, and you've made a lot of progress. I think one of the things, if you look at issues with big projects over time is the suppliers end up having issues and can't meet the obligation they came to, either ﬁnancially or they're just delayed or whatever. So could you just talk to that issue, since that's often been an issue with big projects that have been problems, suppliers end up not coming through?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   We communicate regularly with them, with our suppliers, and if you look at the deck that we posted on the website on oﬀshore wind, we walk through each one of them and the status of the contracts with each of them, and you can see they're all performing, and they're all performing on time.  Now I know that Siemens in particular is one that's been in the news recently and there are turban provider, I communicate regularly with the CEO of Siemens Gamesa, renewable energy and I most recently heard from him after that news on some of the challenges that they're facing, mostly with their onshore business, and sort of project potential that they have, that they need to be able to post guarantees on those, so they got a lot of growth opportunities, but that's causing them some challenges that have been in the news.  He assured me they're committed to their contractual obligations and he said nothing will change the close and successful partnership we have from their side. So, we're very focused on this. We communicate regularly with all of those providers, and as we outlined earlier and as you can see in the deck, those projects are going very well. They're all performing. They're all on time."
"Okay. One last quick one for Steve, just a simple one. The slide that talked about the 290 for '23 and don't just use the normal utility growth rate to '25, and you go through those factors, it looks like pretty much almost all of them are positive factors. So, my interpretation of that is it should be better than that. I just want to make sure that that's correct?","Well, we're not giving guidance, so I'll start with that. I think we provided this list to try and be comprehensive and holistic, so that we're not suspected of trying to cherry-pick or give half guidance. We talked a lot internally in advance of this call about staying true to what we've done thus far, which has been disciplined about not providing partial guidance until the review is complete.  And this is in the spirit of that. Now, I would just say on individual items, some of these are certainly tailwinds. Higher rates, of course, I probably wouldn't describe that as a tailwind, but we talk about the in-the-money portfolio of rates. So I don't want to get into a box, given that we're not giving guidance on any of these particular items, except for we felt it was important to highlight, the various inputs that we have not disclosed that we think will be important to analyzing accurately what our 2025 earnings will be."
"Appreciate the commentary you just laid out there, with regards to how you're talking about the review, but just wanted to go to the dividend, if I could, and just wanted to see if the dividend policy remains intact, even if for some reason you keep all of wind. Is there any scenario where keeping the dividend at these levels just wouldn't make sense?","We're committed to the dividend, Jeremy. As we said, we're 100% committed to the dividend. Trying to talk about scenarios that people could imagine I don't think is terribly productive. We've been committed to the dividend since the beginning. We haven't wavered in that. We're not wavering on it today."
Got it. That's very helpful. I'm going to leave it there. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  And we have our next question from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the color thus far. Maybe just one quick one on the business review. I guess can you just help us frame the risk around the timeline here? Are there any factors in particular that you're watching that could potentially push that beyond the late '23 to early 2024 timeline that you've lined out?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   No. We, I think, laid it out pretty clearly. We're in the last stage here on evaluating an oﬀshore wind equity partner. But, no, there's nothing else out there."
"Great, thanks for that. And then, appreciate the disclosure on the interest rate exposure. Just on the $8 billion in the interest rate derivatives that you highlighted, is there anything you can provide in terms of the tenor on those contracts, just as we think about the moving pieces on ﬁnancing costs in the coming years relative to that, I think it was the sub-3% average coupon that you highlighted?","Yes, so we've got derivatives at both VEPCO as well as at the holding company, and more at the holding company than at VEPCO. VEPCO is, because we use hedge accounting, we're a little more restricted on when we utilize those hedges, so those are '24-'25 style hedges at DEI.  We're able to use any time in advance of a future settlement date, so we've got some ﬂexibility in timing of use of that, anywhere between now and 2028, based on the current notional. So, we've got some ﬂexibility there, and as part of the Investor Day, we'll of course provide some incremental disclosure around how we intend to utilize that portfolio."
