Question,Answer
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got it. And then, obviously, potentially higher corporate tax rates with the new administration or maybe a new administration, have you guys done sort of any preliminary work assuming like, let's say, an increase to 28% tax rates, for instance, on the whole co or the opco and potential impacts to maybe your ongoing equity needs? I mean, obviously, you're obviously a consolidated taxpayer. And then just any sense on what the potential bill impact could be as we think about the higher corporate tax rate, maybe a question for Jim.","Yeah, Shar. Let me address that. Obviously, as Tom mentioned, we're all watching developments and it's pretty hypothetical at this stage, the election and any follow-on tax reform result. But yeah, we're watching and we're doing some math. Really it's pretty early. It's too early to tell. So, if it happens, tax reform, we -- ﬁrst of all, we expect that will be addressed across our utility properties in every state in diﬀerent ways, like it did last time. Some of it just through rider true- ups, like in Virginia and some of our larger LDCs, some of it through regulatory proceedings on that topic, but we are a cash taxpayer currently. It's heavily shielded from -- based on our tax credit positions that we currently pay on a cash basis, 5% or so, cash taxes. So, if the rate went from 21% to 28% as it's proposed, that cash tax rate will go from around 5% to around 7%. So, not a quantum leap.  So, there would be, we assume, some credit metric help there for the forecast period. We don't know enough yet to understand the quantum of that help, so it's a positive. Now, is it enough to impact equity ﬁnancing plan, which is part of your question, we're not there yet to say that. I would say that in light of our spending program, our investment capital program, our equity ﬁnancing plan is already pretty modest, and all of it's anticipated to our existing program. So, we're not quite there. We think the tax reform, if it happens, will be a positive, but we don't have the exact math yet to see how positive it would be. On the customer bill, the other part of your question, also hypothetical, doing some rough math. The devil is in the details, but we are seeing -- there are some diﬀerences state-to-state, but it probably would be kind of in the range of a 1% to 2% kind of customer bill increase and we prefer that not happen, but it's in that kind of modest range."
"Got it. Got it. So, very manageable. And -- very clear cut quarter guys. That's all the questions I had. Thanks.",Thanks a lot.     Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Yeah. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up, I guess, on the ﬁrst question regarding the oﬀshore wind, and it seems like in New England the -- there is this -- they agreed to this one-by- one mile conﬁguration and that everyone for the most part agrees with that, except for the ﬁshing community. So, could you maybe just give color on kind of, is that the conﬁguration you're planning to use and do you have any of the same opposition of the kind of ﬁshing community that you've had up in New England?","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Fishing issues are diﬀerent oﬀ our Coast than in New England. So, on turbine spacing, we're going to work with the Coast Guard and other stakeholders, shipping lanes in addition to ﬁshing shipping lanes are going to be diﬀerent for us than they might be in other projects and particularly ones that are several projects that may be strong together, whereas ours does not have that at the moment. So, we'll make sure we work with Coast Guard, other interested parties, but we're conﬁdent that we can get spacing that makes sense for our project and is going to work for regulators and other interested parties."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Maybe continuing with oﬀshore wind, if that's okay here and just thinking about the construction side a bit, can you talk about what you've learned with the trial project so far and how that might help with your future development, such as navigating the supply chain?","Yeah, Jeremy. That's a great question. And I think you hit on one of the things that we've learned a great deal about is the supply chain and the importance of the supply chain. We've selected our preferred turbine vendor already and we have a very good understanding I think in ways that maybe we didn't before of how to sequence this project, so you need to make sure that when step 2 is ready to go, that step 1 has been completed, it's -- that's much more crucial maybe on this kind of project than even on some others. Things have to be done sequentially. So, we've learned a great deal about that and we've learned a great deal about the other parties in the industry, it's not an enormous industry. And so, we've had an opportunity to get a lot to know a lot of folks that way. Those kind of relationships are going to be really valuable to us as we move forward with construction of this project. So -- and then ﬁnally, back to the permitting side, we've certainly learned about working with them. So, all of those things together I think have helped us out as we move forward with the bigger project."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And maybe just pivoting to South Carolina here. And as you -- just any thoughts you have as how the ﬁrst rate case in South Carolina could progress, your ﬁrst one after acquiring Scana here? And could you just give a sense for how you think the relationships have developed there over time?","Yeah. We have worked very hard and succeeded in meeting the commitments that we made when we announced this transaction. And I think that credibility is important for us and then we ﬁled a case that was very much down the fairway, solid, well supported case, and we're moving through the process the way you would expect. So, I think the credibility that we seek to establish that we're going to continue to maintain will help us out, and also thinking very carefully about what we were looking for when we ﬁled that case will pay oﬀ, I believe."
"Hey. Do you think a -- if Biden is elected President, do you think there would be a possibility that the two-year timeframe that BOEM could be shortened or accelerated in some way? And if that happens, would that accelerate the construction process at all or is that just on its own timeline no matter what?","Well, obviously, with all the caveats about, we don't know who is going to be the next president."
"Got you. And is there anything that investors should be aware about as you prepare your ﬁrst triannual review ﬁling, I think you said last time that you were going to be ﬁling it next year, in the midyear?","Yeah. So, we've talked about this, we're going to ﬁle in March, expect an order in November. It will review the period 2017 to 2020 and we'll know -- we'll have an order at the end of the year, next year, pretty straightforward."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. Is -- do you see growing data center demand in Virginia as -- I don't know, as that says potentially helping with the ﬁling at this point or is that something that can help oﬀset any other increase in costs, anything else [ph]?","Yeah. I mean, the strength of our customer base is always helpful, and we're not seeing a lot up in data center demand, it's continuing."
