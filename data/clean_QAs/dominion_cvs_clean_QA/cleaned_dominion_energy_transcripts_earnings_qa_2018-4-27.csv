Question,Answer
"So just on the updated dividend language. It's good to see that you've maintained your support for '19. The 2020 growth rate is somewhat of a wide band. Obviously, the book end just stipulated by whether the MLP markets remain broken or not. So what sort of drives the dividend within the band, and more importantly, even at the bottom end at 6%, it's about 100 million in cash ﬂow savings. So why even have this sort of change in language in the outer years, especially since you should be able to maintain it beyond '19?","Sure. This is Mark. We can maintain it beyond '19, but we have to be conﬁdent that the MLP market is going to be open to us long-term. And right now, as we said in our prepared remarks that we're not quite sure where that's going to be. So we wanted to put a range out in 2020 that would be kind of with and without the MLP market. If we cannot access the MLP market for those cash ﬂows, then it will drift into the lower end of that range. If we can it will be back at the high end of that range.  Now, why do we keep it at 10% for '18 and '19, because we have plenty of cash ﬂow in the current assets that are in our MLP without any further drops to support an elevated dividend for the next two years. After that, as you say, it's about $100 million, it's not a big number to us, but we would be cautious that that payout ratio. We wouldn't want to get higher if we can't access MLP equity on a long-term basis.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay. Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, you clearly highlight the FERC ruling has no material impact in your earnings. But you have sort of an updated plan that includes keeping Cove Point at the D [ph] level leverage at Cove Point, which should be more back-levering opportunities than a DM. If some equity issuances, some asset sales, so there is something like, sort of pushes and takes here. And you clearly -- you do have some very strong or incremental growth opportunities like Atlantic Coast Pipeline 2 or 3 renewables. So you sort of think about your long-term earnings CAGR, are you comfortable continuing sort of guide at your midpoint even beyond '18. And what would actually drive you to the bottom end of this given, which seems to somewhat of a good runway.","Sure. I think we are comfortable guiding to the midpoint. We always put range out, but we always -- as we get the question to say, we always target to midpoint. I think what could drive us to the bottom end, we're weather sensitive company and that could well take us to the lower end or the upper end depending where we are. But you raised a good point, which we haven't heard from investors yet. And that is, we were going to utilize and may still utilize the MLP structure to optimize cash ﬂows back to the parent. But if the market is not open and we do not do that, all of Cove Points EBITDA that would have been in the MLP by the end of decade will be at the parent, that's an incremental $350 million. So again, we have a lot of levers that we're going to evaluate, we feel very comfortable with the middle, and we'll work toward beating that as we look like we're able to do this year as well."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Great quarter. I agree, really good performance. What do you think a reasonable time-frame of expectations is for getting to a point, where you are -- you feel like you can come to a conclusion on whether you've achieved the right total cumulative outcomes in the asset sales. Are we looking at a process that takes six months a year? When do you think we should be expecting us -- when should we be expecting you to come back to us with proceeds and next steps?","I think Greg by the end of the year, we'll have a real clear view on that. We may have a few things that we can clear up before that, but I would target fourth quarter for us to get some clarity around that. If you look at the bar chart, it's really not that big a number that we're targeting in asset sales. In terms of what's left to be done in the alternative ﬁnancing plan, the majority of it is get at the asset echo point and we expect to put that asset between $2.5 billion and $3 billion this year, probably toward the high-end of that, that would keep it strongly investment grade range. And that only leaves us a 1 billion to maybe 1.5 billion on asset sales. So we think it's a very reasonable conservative number, and we have a number of assets we're evaluating and the one we speciﬁcally have mentioned is Blue Racer.  Now, we'll say, although we are screening a number of assets. If we don't believe we can get fair value in a market, we're not going to sell the assets. But based on what we've heard so far, there'll be a lot of interest in the type of assets we have out there."
"Great. So, when I look at that bar chart, it's actually very helpful. Thank you. There's two things that you have to achieve to meet your credit targets. One is, there's certain percentage of holdco debt as a percentage of parent debt, which you clearly and quickly achieved through the Cove Point debt transaction and that's very elegant and simple. But then you're saying that to get to your FFO to debt metric, you need just an incremental 1.5 billion of asset sale proceeds, so 1.5 billion of equity that you did through the forward sale plus the 500 you did at the beginning of the year, plus the CapEx cuts you announced at the beginning of the year, plus the 1.5 for asset sales. That total of ﬁnancing activity you're saying gets you to an FFO to debt metric that achieves your credit goal from that perspective is that -- I know there was a lot, but is that fair?","Yeah. I think the only caveat I'll put on that is -- I wouldn't hang on 1.5, I'll give you a range of a 1 billion to 1.5 billion. But yes, we want to -- we need to execute that over a period of time. It doesn't have to be done this year, but we need to execute it certainly in the period to meet our credit targets."
"And then I know, I'm jumping the gun here, and time is deﬁnitively on your side in terms of trying to be deliberate in the way you think about DM. But if the MLP market would not recover, was there a consolidation transaction that you could contemplate here, because by my math at   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   least with DM at this valuation that would not necessarily be a bad outcome for both shareholders.","Greg, this is Tom. We're going to just see how this plays itself out. There is a variety of options with DM, you've mentioned one that would be an option and others are pursuing that. But we're in no rush. We think what FERC did was unreasonable outcome. There's been a lot of pushback on them over that. We'll just see how it plays itself out. We have plenty of cash available at DM to meet our distribution goals at least for the -- for now. And so, we'll see. We're going to give it time to play out, but -- and then we'll consider options as we go along."
"Yeah, hi. Good morning. The kind of assets sale timing or Cove Point by year end, is that actually getting outcomes of asset sales, so we'll know the money is coming in or is that kind of what the plan is by then?","I think depending on what assets we decide to move ahead with Steve, you will probably have some outcomes and you may have some that might spillover into early 2019."
"Okay. And then, what would it take to get the credit agencies to stabilize the rating or go oﬀ negative outlook I guess? Do you need to complete that stuﬀ or any sense of that?","Yeah. I don't really want to speak for the agencies, but I will say, yes Steve, you -- we've been very transparent with the agencies, we met with them a number of times along the process. They know exactly what our plan is. And I think in our opinion, and again, you have your own and others would. But as we've look at other companies that have been impacted by tax reform on credit to the extent we have. We believe we have one of the most aggressive plans out here   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   to address the shortfall on credit due to taxes. In my opinion, what the agencies are looking at is execution on plans that have been announced and to work into the range that they put out there on various metrics. So, well -- Moody's, S&P, Fitch, they all have their own comments, I'm sure on that. But again, I think if you look at what we've done, what we've announced, it's probably the most aggressive plan in terms of not only of speed but in amount, whether it be equity or asset sales or CapEx reduction of any company out there."
"Okay. And then one other clariﬁcation on that 6% to 8% growth rate. Is there now like a base case that you're using and you are kind of taking these diﬀerent scenarios of asset sales, keep DM, not DM and you're saying that, in all those scenarios, you're in the 6% to 8%. Does that makes sense, the question?","Yes. And we have run multiple scenarios on it. We have assumptions on asset sales in terms of valuation. And as far as we want to put out this alternative plan bar chart to kind of give everybody the range that we're expecting in the area. We have built ourselves a lot of ﬂexibility on the MLP by quickly addressing the ﬁnancing needs to replace to $7 billion to $8 billion. But we do have an alternative plan that includes the MLP, it also gets us in the same range down the road. So again, I think we have a lot of options, but we're not going to wait for the MLP market to open up. We're going to address that immediately and that's why we want to come out with the alternative plan and with a fair amount of detail around it."
"Good morning. Just wanted to turn to the DM strategy a bit more here. And with regards to kind of increasing the distribution until coverage going to hit 1.0. Can we kind of read into that, that any eventual impact in the FERC, you would think would not be very material in pressure coverage at that point or is the matter of there's drop downs that you could oﬀset any holes to that point? Just trying to see, what we should be thinking about here?","Well, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're going to go ahead and recommend to the Board, of course, its the Board's decision to go ahead and continue distribution increases at the 5% quarterly level. As long as we have coverages above one times. We do not anticipate right now dropping anything else into DM in 2018 with the current market conditions. And I think it will take FERC a bit of time to evaluate all the requests and rehearing. And I don't want to put   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   time-frame on that. But that's -- we have made decision to move ahead on alternate ﬁnancing for this year. And so I think the earliest we might see a recovering MLP market and the DM share price, where we would like to be open to drop something in at a fair valuation would probably be next year.  I would say that it's not just a reversal or clariﬁcation of the FERC opinion. But DM's market price is going to have to reach a level that makes sense for the parent to go ahead and drop with the lower cost of capital, which has been the design of DM from day one. And so our approach on this is to be patient, to pay the distribution as long as we can, and hope that this market opens back up as some clarity comes out of FERC."
"That's helpful, thanks. And then just one last one if I could. I was curious as far as -- it's a very diﬃcult question. But if there's just no resolution from FERC, if things don't change. I guess how long until you feel like you want to take aﬀect some new strategy at DM? Any thoughts you can provide us as far as the timeline there?",Not at this time. We're just going to see what happens here for the next few months at least. I'm not going put a timeframe on it.
"Thank you. Okay, so continuing on DM. So just sort of I understand. So if you add that to Cove Point, the project that, how would it impact a potential ability of you to drop this asset into DM. I mean, is it simply that cash ﬂows of the distributable cash ﬂow from this on this asset it would drop, because you added that there would be amortizing. If this the only issue that that would be limiting your ability to drop it into the MLP assuming that the MLP market recovers?","Well, Angie, I'll give you a quick answer on that, and that is, it won't limit our ability to drop DM. But Jim Chapman is here today, and let me have him go ahead and expand on the ﬁnancing   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   around Cove and how we would go ahead and drop that.     Hey, Angie, good morning, it's Jim. To try to -- to clarify a little bit. I think from a traditional through project for net ﬁnance perspective, there's just very signiﬁcant debt capacity of Cove. And if we had a need for the kind of capacity, we could end up with a structure of ﬁnancing structure that might have limitations like you seem to be suggesting in its terms. But our need right now is much more modest as Mark mentioned 2.5 billion to 3 billion at Cove for the near term. And with that kind of debt quantum, we expect a great deal of ﬂexibility in the terms of that ﬁnancing. When it comes to things like pre-payability or transferability or amortization or not. So we just don't see the current ﬁnancing plan being a constraint in any way on potential future drops into DM, lots of ﬂexibility in our plan."
"Okay. And my other question is, if you are so convinced that the EBITDA or cash ﬂow detriments to the pipeline that DM currently holds is not going to be material following via the FERC actions into future. Why not just swap these assets? Why not just take these assets into the -- and give DM a portion of either Cove Point or some other assets that doesn't have this issue. And (inaudible) you would face a reduction in the rates only to your level of taxation versus zero.","Angie, that's a good question. I guess what we want to really get clariﬁed not only for D and DM is by FERC, what was the intent of their policy change. It seems to be fairly broad brushed. And there is some incentive, if they don't change that you could have a gross up of 21% as a C corp [ph] versus other assets that will be a pure MLP and that's something we obviously looked at. But our whole approach is going to be, there's been a lot interest and request to FERC to ahead and provide clarity, we like to do that. We think that'll springboard to market. If they do that and our support of the MLP structure long term, and we're going to be patient and wait for that."
"Okay. And my last question, the 6% to 8% CAGR, what is the starting point and is the Connecticut's uplift included in the midpoint of that range?","The starting point of that is the middle of the range of 2017 through 2020. Millstone, I think as I've said, maybe a year or so ago, where when we put that out there. That we use to market curve, when we put the new range out at Millstone that did have some growth in it between '17 and '20. But currently, it does not include any auction impacts or beneﬁts that we might accrue in the Millstone auction."
"Good morning. How long do you think the CAFD [ph] at DM will remain above the one-time -- one times measure metric. And as you grow at 5% per quarter. Is that going to be go -- are you saying that it will grow through 2020 and, at that point then, you need to make the decision?","No. Michael, this is Mark. No, it's not going through 2020. It could certainly go through several quarters with current performance. We are evaluating how to extend it longer through changes in maintenance CapEx , timing, et cetera. But it's a much shorter window than that, that we will be able to support 5%. But I think it's a window that gives FERC a reasonable time to address the request in front of them, and takes us through, as I say at least several quarters maybe longer."
Got you. And then also -- I think you mentioned that the equity could be more of a range right between 1 billion and 1.5 billion. Is that driven primarily by the asset sale proceeds that you might get or is there some other factors?,"Okay, that's not an equity comment. I'm sorry if I said it, I misspoke. Our equity is done besides DRIP. What that reference was to cash value from asset sales between 1 and 1.5 that we would bring back and reduce debt with. At some time throughout this year and into next year potentially."
"Good morning. So I guess a question on DM. Again, going with the same theme, but just trying to understand from a ﬂexibility perspective. It looks like you're paying up a little bit to keep the ﬂexibility around DM and waiting for the market to recover. So for example, obviously from project ﬁnancing to keep the ﬂexibility around some of the options that Jim brought up, would cost a little bit in terms of the project ﬁnancing cost. So ﬁrstly, wanted to understand what are the diﬀerent elements that would cost D right now to kind of keep the ﬂexibility around DM. And if it is going to cost this much, is it worth keeping that ﬂexibility or like an earlier question brought up, why not just buyback DM sooner?","Well, Praful, this is Mark. I mean, we see great value in the ﬁnancing ﬂexibility of the MLP bringing cash back to the parent, always have. And I think shareholders of Dominion Energy starting to appreciate that over the years. So it's worth something to us to keep that moving. We also owe it to unitholders at Dominion Midstream to stay with this structure as long as we can. If there is a reasonable chance that the market will rebound and that we can place equity at a reasonable level here and at a reasonable DM price.  Now the cost of D in terms of ﬁnancing is going to be very minimal we believe, because the cash ﬂows are the same. We may well get better ﬁnancing by putting its asset within the C corp initially before you were to let it travel. So we don't see that cost as being material at all, and it just allows us incremental ﬂexibility to wait on DM until we see what's going to happen there."
Got you. Fair enough. Just switching quickly to SCANA. How do you see it playing out from here. Do you see concessions needed? You've kind of held this strong line of we don't think concessions are needed and this is kind of our oﬀer. Do you see any change to that or do you see any room for ﬂexibility around that at all?,"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   No. There's no ﬂexibility. We've made our oﬀer and they can -- it's going through the political process now and that will -- political, they adjourn next Friday, excuse me, two Friday's from now, they're ﬁnished there for the year, the political sphere that it's been so far, but it's also going through the regulatory sphere. Lot's of questions going back and forth with typical regulatory process. We have a hearing scheduled November. We'll have a result by December. So that's what we're going to proceed that way, we've made our oﬀer."
"Got you. That's pretty clear. Okay, and then ﬁnally just on Millstone. It sounds like progress is pretty constructive in terms of the reports at least around Millstone. Any path forward you see I guess, what's the timing to kind of get all that done and get ﬁnancial beneﬁts from Millstone?","Praful, Paul Koonce is here. He will answer that for you.     Yeah, good morning. Thanks for the question. The schedule that has been laid out by DEEP and PURA is that the RFPs will be issued in May. They will accept bids through September and concurrent with that, if you determine that you are an at-risk resources, then you can -- then as Tom mentioned in his comments, you can pursue that designation, which we planned to do, which means that, you can also include into your bid non-price factors like zero carbon, fuel diversity, grid reliability. They have a report, DEEP and PURA, they have a report Leviton [ph] produced that showed what it would cost consumers if Millstone were to retire. So I think there is some recognition of the value of Millstone. So really that is all supposed to play out between now and September with bids been approved by year-end."
"Congratulations on Cove Point. But just actually following up on the last question on the Connecticut process. Could you remind us just on the at-risk designation, what that process looks like in terms of information to be submitted and the criteria used to get that designation?","Sure. They have determined that it will be a conﬁdential proceeding that made up of state agencies and Dominion. We have -- and have agreed to provide validated cost information. So it will really be between the applicants, in that case us, and the state agencies DEEP and PURA. They have invited the consumer advocate to also participate in their proceeding. But it will be a conﬁdential proceeding, and it will be their determination whether they conclude the asset is at-risk. And once they conclude that, then the other non-price factors will be taken into account."
"That's helpful. And then just shifting to Virginia, just given legislation and just given the needs in the state. I'm curious just if you wouldn't mind giving me your thoughts in terms of the potential for further capital expenditures in the State additional plans, just as we think about growth in your core state of Virginia?","Well, we've announced plans last fall about moving from our large projects to more programmatic programs. And I think the legislation that was enacted by the General Assembly this session supports that program. So I don't -- there's no real changes to that program. There - - I think we said $3.5 billion a year on average in growth capital in Virginia through the next or at least a decade. We don't see any changes to that. We think the legislation is supportive of it."
"Understood. So in other words, just familiar with the plan that you had laid out, there is not a incremental capital over and above, whether it be for generation or any other sort of types of resource that could be additive in the near to medium-term over and about the plan as you've already laid out?","It's possible, but we have more planning to go along as we see."
Okay. Very good. That's all I had. Thank you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your ﬁnal question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Could I ask just on the dividend comments about Dominion and the range on the growth rate. Do you have a speciﬁc payout ratio in mind, you would want to be added in the longer term and sort of with and without DM capital raising scenarios?","Hey, Jonathan. As we've laid DM before, we were in the mid '80s or so with DM as we went forward and we were pretty comfortable with that. I think over the next couple years '18, '19, we will be in the low to mid '80s. We're comfortable with that, with cash ﬂows coming out of the DM. I don't think we want to get much higher than that, and over time, we will probably bring that down to a more reasonable utility like level. If we don't access the MLP market. We have said before that this dividend rate was premised on -- we would not burden our regulated entity with anything more than a 75% payout ratio and anything incremental to that would have to come from non-regulated assets or the MLP, and we still have that view. But again, I think the math would tell you on the next couple of years that, that payout will be in the low to mid '80s. And depending what happens with MLP long-term, we'll start to bring that down."
"Great, thank you. And then just secondly, on the last call, you talked about the $1billion that was coming out of sort of non-growth CapEx in '18 and '19. Have you made progress on identifying speciﬁcally what that's going to be in the bag now and can you give us some insight into and what types of things that are there?","We're pretty much done identifying it, and we've already started to execute a portion of that for 2018. It looks like it maybe somewhat 50-50, maybe 40-60 between '18 and '19 as we've looked at it. It will come out of maintenance capital, it will come out of a reprioritization of capital and   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   reduction in areas that don't provide near-term earnings support for us. It will come out of what we call general capital which are building funds, things like that. So it's across the board. It's something I think we're pretty comfortable with. Our facilities are in good shape and our service reliability is in very good shape. So, I think we can have a short-term pause in some of this maintenance capital and be ﬁne for two years."
