Question,Answer
"Just ﬁrst oﬀ on the funding for Questar, can you give a little more breakdown of how you guys expect the diﬀerences between corporate debt, Dominion equity, the converts and DM equity to be broken down?","Yeah, Dan. This is Mark. Let me go ahead and outline it further. We didn't have a slide on it but I think that's important question. We appreciate you asking it. This is how we view this currently, again, market conditions could change, but we expect to issue about $1.5 billion of incremental DRI debt to support the transaction. We also anticipate issuing about $0.5 billion of Dominion equity. We'll do that either through a dribble or a block trade sometime between now and when we anticipate a closing on the transaction. And then the remainder of the takeout will be a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion, which has been a very popular ﬁnancing vehicle for us with investors, and a drop into DM to support the 2017 EBITDA growth and distribution growth from a portion of the pipeline.  We have a bridge facility for all the ﬁnancing. As part of that bridge facility, we have a term loan commitment that extends well beyond closing that gives us signiﬁcant ﬂexibility for the MLP and when we might drop that. Right now, we said in script that we have no plans and no need to have a drop into DM in 2016. And the equity that we would use from the pipeline drop in 2017 is consistent with what we've said would be the EBITDA drop all the way back to February for the distribution growth to go 22% in 2017. So again, $1.5 billion or so DRI debt, a $0.5 billion DRI equity, and then the remainder a combination of mandatory convertibles at Dominion and MLP drop proceeds."
"Got it. And I guess, if you think about the size, if it was an even split on the residual value for the non-DRI equity and debt, that $1 billion-plus of DM equity is pretty signiﬁcant. How do you guys think about funding for that and the visibility of that raise given the relative size of DM today?","Well, again, I would not jump to the assumption, this is an even split. We'll have to see what the market opportunities are for both those instruments out there as we get closer. But I will tell you, Dan, that the DM currency that we IPO'ed last – a year ago October, I guess, is we had out there for about a year-and-a-half. We're actually buying a few shares back, as we disclosed earlier. There's little liquidity in the stock, and our large holders have told us they really want to see more liquidity. We are very conﬁdent that when we decide to come to market to support the 2017 drop that we can either do that in a private placement based on what we've been told by our holders, or in overnight transaction. So we're quite conﬁdent we can place (26:58) to drop, and as we get closer, we'll determine what size of mandatory convertible versus what size of MLP drop proceeds will be needed to fund the transaction. Keep in mind, again though, we have a term loan commitment well beyond closing that gives us tremendous ﬂexibility on when we would make a DM drop in 2017.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay. Just one last question. If we actually look at the full-year results for 2015 and we look at the guidance for 2016, when I compare midpoint of 2015 to midpoint of 2016 guidance range, it looks like more like a 3% year-on-year earnings growth. Can you just maybe dissect a little bit of why that number, the midpoint number is lower on a growth rate basis midpoint-to-midpoint for 2016 than maybe would have anticipated before?","Dan, we're still targeting a 5% growth rate year-over-year. We're not as quite as ﬁne-tuned as you are and others on midpoint-to-midpoint. What we try to do is give a range out there that guides to somewhere in the middle of the range. We use $0.05 increments, as you know. So as we look at $3.80 to $3.90 range, we think that's right in the 5% increase weather-normalized year-over-year, and as we get through the year, we will see if we can reﬁne that range for you."
"So I just want to be clear that when you said, you thought that this transaction was supportive of your EPS growth aspirations, and would get you towards the high-end of your growth aspiration by 2018, were referring to the 5% to 6% growth target through 2017 accelerating to 7% to 9% thereafter that you gave at Analyst Day in February. Is that right?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes, that is right, Greg. We haven't given any speciﬁc number for 2018 in terms of percent growth. So right now I think the best data point is the 7% to 9%. And as we said in our prepared remarks, that with this acquisition and the Cove Point full year contribution, we would expect to be at the top of that range or potentially exceed it."
"All right. Great. And in the underlying sort of pro forma expectations for Questar, I know you just discussed the ﬁnancing assumptions. Should we assume that you're basing your business – your base business case for Questar is based on their most recent public disclosures if you go back to their November analyst deck there, they have like $1.2 billion and the utility rate base growing 6% to 8% a year. They expect to earn their authorized return. They gave some details around the expected growth in infrastructure and returns on the FERC regulated transmission administering assets and a lot of detail around Wexpro. If we want to build our own forecast and merge it with yours, is that a fair place to start, or are there any signiﬁcant changes or synergies that you're baking into those assumptions?","I think on the distribution side we're very comfortable with that at 8%-plus growth. The pipeline, although it may – as you build your model, our view on the pipeline is, that is an asset that is signiﬁcantly undervalued. And as Tom reviewed the slides today, the opportunities mid-term and long-term on a business due to the increased gas needs in the west to deal with carbon rules and renewable mandates, we think that number will grow more signiﬁcantly over time.  And on the Wexpro gas supply side, we are taking a view on that business that we are only going to invest in capital that has been regulatory approved in the state. We view that as a gas reserve business similar to what many other companies are trying to get in their rate base, which they've had for 35 years. So we see that business as they've outlined it is (31:15) over the next several years unless markets were to change, and the growth in the distribution pipeline business picking up.   All right. Greg, I would just add a thought about the pipelines that Mark mentioned with respect to coal. We spend a lot of time, as you know, at Dominion analyzing the Clean Power Plan, its impacts across the country, how important gas infrastructure is going to be, the compliance with Clean Power Plan. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is the key component of that in Virginia, North Carolina for now. And there is – Wyoming and Utah both are almost 80% coal-ﬁred generation, provide electricity for their citizens. So I think there's a lot to look at in that region over the next decade."
"Got you. Switching back to the core, talking about the core business and the earnings guidance for 2016, there is a fairly large contribution I think coming from the success you've had building out your utility scale solar business. I mean, do you have visibility into 2017 on the solar business, or should we be expecting that that contribution is signiﬁcantly smaller but more than compensated for by the accretion from core business investments plus the Questar deal?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Greg, it's going to be considerably smaller than 2016. When we announced this deal we said it's a quarter of our 2017 growth rate, and because of that it will allow us to not rely as much on ITCs in 2017. For planning purposes, and this will be ﬁne tuned, throughout the rest of this year into next year, but I would expect something in the $0.10 to $0.15 range in ITCs for 2017 which is a dramatic increase from 2016."
"Thank you. On that same question, what were 2015 actual ITCs, and then what's your projected 2016 ITCs in your forecast?","Steve, 2015 earnings per share basis were about $0.24, and for 2016 they're going to be between $0.30 and $0.35."
"Okay. And stepping back, Tom, you have generally kind of not wanted to talk about utility M&A so to speak, you focus very much on DM. Now, that you are doing a transaction that's more utility-ish, maybe you could give us a little bit more of your strategic thinking on utility M&A, why are you even doing it at all given you've got very good utility to begin with? And also just, should we view this as more kind of like an opportunistic thing or something that you plan to kind of continue to want to pursue strategically?","Well, Steve, thanks for the question. I guess, I don't view it as being a utility-ish combination. What we've said since our investor conference in February that we will be actively looking for assets to add to our MLP. And we have been doing that, as you know, we added portion of the Iroquois pipeline to our portfolio. We added the Carolina Gas Transmission system. We were particularly attracted to Questar's assets, largely because of the pipeline. We're perfectly happy with the LDC, which is one of the fastest growing LDCs in the country. Utah has often been   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   ranked as the number one state in which to do business, and Questar Gas is a fast-growing LDC. And it has very similar attributes to East Ohio Gas. But it was the MLP-eligible assets that particularly caught our attention. And after we took a hard look at the region's Clean Power Plan goals, or targets, that the EPA has imposed.  So this was a pipeline that's going to have a lot of growth opportunities and a very well-run, active-in-the-community, safety-conscious workforce at the LDC. So we're not looking all over the place trying to buy anything. We're looking for, as we said from the beginning, MLP-eligible assets. This takes care of – we don't need anything – we have with this – 2016 is already taken care of. This takes care of 2017, part of 2018. Blue Racer, if it's dropped, will be in the 2020s sometime. So Dominion Midstream Partners has now available to it a long, long runway of contracted long-term gas infrastructure assets with zero commodity risk in them. So I think it's a tremendous acquisition, also for the purpose of Dominion Midstream Partners, or unitholders. So all in all, I wouldn't necessarily view it as, like, we decided we were going to get interested in utility M&As. In fact, it's the same things that we have said since February."
"Okay. And even with all the distress in midstream, it's still, there's still more to ﬁnd in owning – doing this more through someone that's got a mix of utility midstream and not buying into direct midstream companies or assets?","We found this when we think this is an outstanding acquisition for both, or combination for both Dominion and Dominion Midstream Partners. A lot of – as you know, there's a lot of distress, as you put it, in the midstream areas. This is a company that's distressed. It's very well run, and what we like particularly about it is the nature of the assets, long-term contracted."
"Okay. And then the rating agencies – basically given your ﬁnancing plan, have you gotten kind of conﬁrmation of your ratings based on this, no changes?","I think that you should expect the agencies – well, ﬁrst of all, Steve, we met with agencies well ahead of the announcement to walk them through the plans and the metrics that this combination produce. And I expect both of them to come out very shortly with an opinion. I don't want to get out in front of them on that but we had very good discussions with them, and they clearly understand where we're going and the value of this transaction for us."
"Just a couple of questions from the DM side. I was wondering, would it be fair to think about this transaction as far as extending the runway of drops as opposed to trying to increase the load of drops in the near term, and how does it impact the equity funding plans for DM? It seems like there's still no equity in 2016, and your 2017 plans largely haven't been changed. Is that a fair way to think about things, because investors are concerned about capital market access and all of that, so just trying to help, just trying to think through these diﬀerent topics.","Sure. Thanks for that question. I think the way you look at it is exactly right. We do not have any equity needs for DM to support our distribution growth rate in 2016. And the Questar pipeline asset essentially will just replace a Blue Racer drop that we had already anticipated in 2017. And we will keep Blue Racer in reserve, so to speak, until 2020 or beyond. So it really doesn't change the DM plan in terms of equity needs going forward, and in the near term we are out of the market. And as I mentioned earlier, the structure of our bridge ﬁnancing with the term loan at the close gives us a lot of ﬂexibility to enter a midstream market at the most opportune time to support that distribution growth in 2017."
"Great. That's really helpful. And just wondering, as far as this transaction is concerned, it's geographically a bit diﬀerent than where DM's other assets are. Can you help us think through the gives and takes of geographical diversiﬁcation versus attractiveness of the assets, or any thoughts there would be helpful.","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Sure. We said actually, people have asked us, we said all along that we were going to be looking for MLP-eligible assets. People would ask very logical questions. Does it need to be in your – are you looking for things that are geographically proximate? The answer was yes, but that it's preferred, but not required. That is the answer we've given since we started talking about this a year ago.  What's particularly interesting about Questar, in addition to the culture of the company, which very closely matches our own, is the hub concept. Dominion, our transmission system is the hub of the Mid-Atlantic. Almost every – well, every pipeline that comes into the Northeast hits our system somewhere. We move gas from the west, from the south, from Canada. All of it had mixes through our system, and then is redeployed to the east through our system and other systems.  Questar Pipeline provides that same service for the Northwest United States, and a large chunk of California. Almost a third of the gas of Western states goes through this pipeline system. So we're familiar with hubs. We see tremendous value in the hub system. And we think there's a lot of opportunity for growth through what will become, we hope soon, Dominion-Questar."
"That's really helpful. And then just one last one if I could, as far as Southern Trails, if you're able to touch on what that opportunity could mean for you?",I think we're going to have to leave Southern Trails to our colleagues at Questar.
"... or good afternoon. I guess on the bonus D&A question which aﬀected your tax credits in 4Q, is that a reversible item that will come back in 2016, or is that opportunity of $0.03 now gone?","It's gone for the foreseeable future, Brian. That was mainly around some manufacturing deductions. There were few other items, but they were mainly around manufacturing. And so until we become a taxpayer again, that is lost. And we don't expect to be a taxpayer for some time with the cash beneﬁt I referenced earlier from bonus depreciation."
"Got it. Secondly, can you also comment, what is the size of the term loan that you referenced with regards to that bridge ﬁnancing for Questar?","Brian, we're not going to disclose that right now. But I will tell you it's sizable and it gives us a lot of ﬂexibility on equity drops, more than enough to cover whatever we might be planning."
"Okay, great. And then last one for me, to what extent is the high-end comment for growth EPS in 2018 and accretive activity in 2017, to what extent is that dependent on DM capital market to access? So stated another way, could you still hit the mid-point of your prior 2017 and 2018 growth targets, if you didn't have, in a worst case scenario, Dominion Midstream capital market to access?","I think for 2017 and 2018 it's not contingent much at all on those capital markets. I think we're comfortable that with the other drivers that we have we can meet the targets that we have out there. And again, the main drivers, as you know, is the Cove Point coming online, on time, and on schedule, and on budget, and then the closing of this transaction. So I think we feel in good shape no matter if DM markets are open or not."
"Hi, guys. On the Questar deal, as you've talked about, you clearly didn't need to do it. So what I'm trying to understand is the premium that you've paid for the deal, let's say close to $1 billion, what are the changes relative to Questar's standalone plan, or in terms of synergies, what are the synergies that you're going to extract relative to the standalone plan that helps support a bridge to the $1 billion of premium?","The transaction is – the premium, I think, particularly, we'll leave it up to you all to compare it to other transactions that have happened in the last year or so. I think it has compared very favorably with those. This transaction though is not – accretion does not come from synergies. It comes from the ability to use Dominion Midstream Partners' equity instruments, along with Dominion's equity instruments. I think that's important for the analyst community to understand and shareholders, that it's the availability of those tools, and the growth that we see and that we can help enhance at Questar over the next few years. So there is a lot of opportunities there that we think, when in combination, we can be additive."
"Well, I'm trying to project out earnings growth into 2017 and beyond.",Yeah. The 2017 number is oﬀ of the 2016 range that we provided. And it's consistent with what we've said previously in the 5% to 6% range.
"Understood. Okay. Great. And then just more mechanics around ﬁnancing of the acquisition from the Dominion Midstream, and missed – sorry if this is obvious or been discussed in some way that I just missed. But when you think about this, it's a large amount of assets eligible for Dominion Midstream and it's a signiﬁcant amount of capital. Should I be thinking about that as   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   a usage of – a ﬁnancing of Dominion Midstream prior to or at closing of the overall transaction, or would this be more over time those assets would go down to Dominion Midstream?","Yeah, that's a good question. If we weren't clear on it, I really – I'm glad you asked that. All we're focused on in terms of MLP qualifying assets out of Questar is the pipeline. We have targeted the pipeline to be dropped over two years, which just replaces existing Dominion assets that were targeted to be dropped, speciﬁcally Blue Racer. The gas supply Wexpro-eligible EBITDA, we do not plan on dropping into DM any time soon. It will be held in reserve at D. And again, with the pipeline asset at Questar, that will get us through 2017 and with a small contribution of Cove Point and the rest of the pipeline, it will get us through 2018. And then Cove Point and the EBITDA available from that asset that's left will get us through 2019 and into 2020. And then we have ACP and Blue Racer to grow on next as we move into the next decade."
That's great. That's very clear. That's all I had. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Hi, everyone. Can you just maybe just touch on real quick the Wexpro agreement? Any risks that you see there? And then there's some opportunities to grow under Wexpro too. Are those sort of under review now?","Well, the Wexpro agreement, as you know, there's been a form of Wexpro agreement with Utah, Wyoming and Idaho Commissions for 35 years. And they just very recently did a settlement of Wexpro II, as you know, it's got a diﬀerent structure to it. It has a lower ROE in it, although you can, depending upon what's going on in the markets, you can return to that ROE.  Frankly, we're going to watch and see what happens with Wexpro. The core here for us is making sure we provide good service, reliable service to the folks in Utah, Idaho and Wyoming that are part of this system, that Wexpro has provided tremendous beneﬁts to those customers over many years.  We don't see any risk, to answer your question, around the regulatory treatment of Wexpro. And the gas production business, the gas supply business, that's how we view it, we're not   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   going to be going oﬀ into the E&P business. We'll maintain – it's our view the Wexpro business needs to be maintained for the beneﬁt of the customers of Questar."
"Thank you. So when I look out to 2017, what has changed, because you're saying that you can maintain your earnings growth projections in 2017, even though that transaction is accretive. So what the oﬀset in your original business plan?","Well, there are a number of moving parts, Angie. One is, that the Blue Racer contribution is lower than what we had previously talked about. Second, that we knew in 2016 that we had a fairly large solar ITC number. And we haven't really determined what we were going to do with 2017 because the tax credit was going to go right away. So that – we're looking at other drivers to help that. Third is that, because of the capacity performance assumption if we have at the end of 2016 versus 2017, the number is better for us in 2016 than it is 2017 in the original assumption. And then there is a few other items that drove us on the downside there. But it wasn't anything – one single thing that was really large. It was just a lot of assumptions that we made for the February meeting that market conditions have challenged that. And so this oﬀer a good opportunity to kind of make sure we could stay on track."
Okay. And the Blue Racer's contributions are lower even though you're delaying the dropdown into DM. So...,"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yeah, Blue Racer's contributions were lower really just based on -we had slowed Blue Racer down and limited the capital investments in that. The biggest driver was that we were going to have ﬁve processing plants online in 2015. We only have four right now. And we have the other one on hold until market conditions improve for 2016. We had expected a full year's contribution from that extra processing plant. We're still very bullish on Blue Racer over time. It will have very good year-over-year growth, but not as good growth as we show in the February Analyst Meeting."
"Just very quickly, I know that synergies aren't, if I understand correctly, what's driving the merger. But I would think at least on the corporate side, or at least the pipeline operations or stuﬀ (54:24) that there'd be some. Do you guys have any numbers that you want to share with us in terms of what potential synergies there might be?","There will be synergies of course, Paul, you're quite right. But my point was, that's not what drives the transaction. It doesn't drive the accretion of the transaction. And we don't have anything to disclose on that today."
"Okay. That's ﬁne. And then in terms of purchase accounting, I would assume because these are regulated assets there probably isn't much in the way of write ups or anything at the actual assets or contracts or anything. Am I wrong about that? Are there any signiﬁcant write-ups that might impact EPS going forward?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","No, you're exactly right. These are all regulated assets. So we don't expect any purchase accounting impacts at all."
"Okay. And then just two quick ones. On the farm-outs, are you guys still comfortable with the projection of $450 million to $500 million that you guys had before on the farm-out projection?","Yeah, we're...   Yeah, yeah, go ahead.     Excuse me, we're very comfortable with that, Paul. I mean, and when we talked about that range, our only challenge to that range was when would it exactly happen? And some have happened quicker in 2015 in some areas that we write to and some are slower. Some folks have signed up and now they want to restructure to get more ﬂexibility. So we said that was over ﬁve years, very comfortable with that. And we do have an assumption in for 2016 which we think is very manageable. So overall, we like it. I just can't tell you exactly year-on-year how it's going to fold. But it's going to be over the ﬁve-year period in the range that we discussed."
"Okay. Fine. And then coal ash, are we ﬁnished with that, do you think, in terms of the impairments we've seen associated with that?","We have our best estimate out there currently. It's an evolving ﬁeld. I think we have the permits necessary that we need now to deal with a number of these ash ponds (56:27) with authorities. So I think that the best estimate we have at this point, could be tweaked, possibly, I don't think it will change a lot."
