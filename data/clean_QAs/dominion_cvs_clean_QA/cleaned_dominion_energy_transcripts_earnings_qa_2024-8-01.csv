Question,Answer
"Starting oﬀ on the oﬀshore progress, there's deﬁnitely some strong progress there on the pile driving season. It looks like you've been able to hit that two monopiles per day target. Could we see you exceed the top end of the 70 to 100 target range for the year? And maybe any remaining hurdles that we should think about?","Hi. Good morning. This is Diane Leopold. Yes, we are excited that we've been able to hit the two, and the second vessel that we have will keep us in production mode for longer into this season. We're kind of right in peak season right now. As the weather starts to change a little bit, we may not be able to keep hitting two quite as often. So we feel really conﬁdent in the 70 to 100.  And just also keep in mind that during this season, we want to put in at least enough pin piles to be able to set one of the oﬀshore substations. So we have to take that into account. So overall, I would say the team, both our own internal team and the DEME team is doing a fantastic job and that 70 to 100 is a great range. We're very conﬁdent in it."
Okay. Thanks for that. And you touched on this on the resource adequacy side. We obviously saw the Dominion Zone breakout signiﬁcantly earlier this week. Can you speak to how your capacity plans are evolving as it relates to the forthcoming IRP? And maybe are you looking for more Chesterﬁeld-style gas projects at this point?,"Yes. Constantine, when we think about our plans going forward, we gave our ﬁve-year capital plan at the Investor Day in March, and we'll update that annually. That's our expectation. And then we'll ﬁle our IRP in the fall. We update that annually as well, and that takes a longer-term view.  But when we think about demand growth, we saw a big jump, as the slide demonstrates, with PJM, between their '22 and '23 forecast, a little more modest, much more modest increase from '23 to '24. So as we describe in the prepared remarks, sure, there may be some opportunities towards the back end of the plan to increase CapEx, and lots of data points indicating that we need generation, which we've been saying for some time, both renewable and dispatchable in our service territory here in Virginia.  So we'll update the capital plan next year. We'll have an updated IRP based upon the PJM forecast, which was not hugely diﬀerent than last year's, and we'll remain very focused on making sure that we're able to meet demand for our customers. This is a really exciting time, has been in Virginia. We're very excited to help keep the state number one for business going   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   forward, and that'll require investment in distribution, transmission, and generation as outlined in the plans we've put forward."
"Hey. So I just wanted to follow-up on the auction comments, just because I know you went through those pretty quickly. So your short generation for next year, that's a $0.04 impact. What does that look like as you get into '26? Like, do you have additional generation coming online? I'm just kind of trying to think that if things continue to be really kind of tight here for '26, '27, does that $0.04 continue? And can you just kind of expand on, like, the mechanism and what diﬀers the VIU, vertically integrated model, versus T&Ds and why you have this kind of dynamic going on? Thank you.","Yes. Nick, I'll take it. So as I mentioned, we've got a natural hedge, which is the generation we own is bidding into the capacity market and receiving the elevated price, or will receive the elevated price you saw clear. So that revenue credits to customers. Simultaneously, we have an obligation as a load-serving entity to also go out and procure enough capacity to satisfy our load, and that we'll be paying that high price as well. So naturally, we have this hedge of eﬀectively receiving revenue at the same time as we're outlaying expense.  The reason we have a small hurt in the second half of '25 related to this is because we do have a short position between the organic generation that we own and bid into the market versus the load. And we typically satisfy that through imports from PJM, and that's not news. And that short position is anywhere between 2,000 megawatts and 3,000 megawatts.  Going forward, the reason it's leakage, so to speak, is because we're in between rate cases. And we weren't able to, because of the timing of this auction in particular, we weren't able to include the expected cost in the cost of service that we ﬁled as part of the last biennial, and we can't change rates until the end of 2025. So for six months or I guess, seven months, starts in June.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   For seven months, we'll bear the cost eﬀectively of that leakage, but then it will go into rates, and rates will be eﬀective.  Capacity is part of base rates. It's a prudently incurred cost. It's recoverable from customers, and that's why we shared some comments on the potential impact on customers. So this is a very, very temporary. It's driven partly by the fact that we were not in a position to increase rates as part of the most recent biennial settlement. It has to do with the timing of this particular auction. And going forward, we fully expect to be able to recover 100% of this leakage in our rates from customers.  So that's why it's temporary, and that's why we kind of said, we wanted to be transparent with folks to say, hey, here's the math, here's how it works, here's what it is, but also point to that being temporary. Bigger picture, as was alluded to in the last question, this is a consistent signal of what we've been saying of the need for incremental regulated investment will help elongate our growth rate over a longer period of time as we put more and more capital to work on our system.  So that's why we've got this natural hedge. That's what's diﬀerent between the vertically integrated. And to the extent that the short position persists, which it will for some period of time, we'll have oﬀshore wind come in, we'll have the Chesterﬁeld CTs come in. So -- but demand is growing. So, as that persists, we'll think about ways to become eﬀectively self- suﬃcient as we have been in the past, as we catch up on demand. But from a ﬁnancial impact, it truly is just a temporary item."
"Okay. That's super helpful. I really appreciate it. Thanks for that color. On the Charybdis ship, you're 90% complete or 89% complete. Costs are up $90 million. Can you just quickly speak to what's driving that? And why this is really should be the last revision there? Thank you.","Sure. Good morning. Diane again. So, as Bob talked about, these modiﬁcations, it really wasn't any change to the base ship. Those costs did not increase. But these types of modiﬁcations just aren't unusual -- are not unusual. We had to order this ship long before the ﬁnal turbine design was complete for our project. So, based on the ﬁnal loadings, there's some additional deck stiﬀening and hull reinforcement for the towers and to support the cantilevered blade racks.  So, that's really what's driving it. It's not any kind of scope change in the ship. It's just some of these normal modiﬁcations. So, we're doing a lot of those. That work is already starting. And a lot of it will happen, while we're completing kind of the internals of the ship, ﬁnishing the piping, the electrical work, the crane loading, we'll go for sea trials and then we'll bring it back and ﬁnish the last of that work to make sure that we can get the sea fasteners on to support our speciﬁc towers, blades, and vessels.      Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And Nick, I'd just add that, of that increase, about $55 million of its pure CapEx. The rest of it is associated ﬁnancing costs. And the way we ﬁnance this vessel is through a lease arrangement with a consortium of banks. And we're working with them and they've been great partners along this way. And we don't expect there to be any other increases. I'll say that. We're very conﬁdent in that. And by working with this consortium, we've been able to ameliorate the potential cost increase from a ﬁnancing cost perspective. So, we view this as being less than $0.01 in terms, I think it's about $0.005 in terms of 2025 costs as a result of this increase. So, it's not a big ﬁnancial thing, but again, wanted to be transparent."
Really helpful. Thanks for all the answers. Have a good day.,"Thanks, Nick.  Operator  And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan."
"Just wanted to pivot conversation, if I could, towards Millstone and possibility for data center co-location there, if you could just provide any incremental thoughts on the outlook there and I guess, maybe navigating stakeholder sensitivity.","Sure. As we've discussed before, Jeremy, Millstone is just a great asset for us. For New England, it provides 90% plus of Connecticut's carbon-free electricity. And as you know, 55% of its output is under a ﬁxed-price contract through late 2029. The remaining output signiﬁcantly de-risked by our hedging program.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So, we're actively working with multiple parties to ﬁnd the best value for Millstone beyond that current PPA. We're certainly open to some longer type of PPA. There's been, over the last year, some legislative activity up in New England aimed at authorizing future further procurements. We'll have to see where all of that lands.  We're certainly open to the idea of a co-located data center. We continue to explore that option. We do clearly realize any co-location option is going to have to make sense for us, our potential counterparty, and stakeholders in Connecticut. So, not any new news there. We continue to look for options for Millstone, but it remains a tremendous asset for us."
"Got it. Makes sense. And just wanted to dive in a little bit more, if you couldn't kind of touch on other angles here. But as far as the ISA protest in front of FERC, where we might hear some news tomorrow, just wondering any thoughts on the subject that you might be willing to share.","We're not a party to that proceeding, Jeremy. So, my thoughts would not be appropriately educated. So, we'll let FERC and others decide that."
Fair enough. And I think you mentioned that net capacity expenses were previously only about 1% of customer bills. And just any thoughts on the range of what that could look like now after this auction?,"It's still going to be very small, Jeremy. And we try not to think about customer bill impacts as an -- driven by isolated drivers. We try and think about all the diﬀerent parts and pieces that go into that. So, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've seen the elimination of the RGGI Rider. That was $3 or $4 a month. So, when we come back to the Commission in March with a holistic approach, we're very, very focused on making sure customer bills are a high priority for us in making the best possible oﬀer to our customers. So, can't give you any speciﬁc information about this, but it's not going to be a big number."
