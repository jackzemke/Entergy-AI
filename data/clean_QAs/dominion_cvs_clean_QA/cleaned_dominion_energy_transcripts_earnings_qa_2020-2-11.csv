Question,Answer
So thanks for the additional disclosures on the ACP slides. With the AFUDC rate versus returns once gas is ﬂowing. Can you just elaborate if you're expecting any sort of step down there in your assumptions? I guess what returns are you kind of assuming in your $0.20 per share to $0.25 per share contribution once the pipes and service post these contract negotiations and curious if these negotiations built in any potential further cost increases?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"Shar, good morning. It's Jim. Thanks for that. Yes, there have been, as we said in our prepared remarks, quite a substantial discussions with the anchor customers, the anchor shippers. And those discussions don't really revolve around ROE. It resolves around a rate. So what the guidance we've given is for the ﬁrst full year of operation at that rate and that will of course imply an ROE, which folks can do the math on, but it's reﬂective of the expected rate for the anchor shippers.  Now when you do calculate that ROE that's implied by that math, you'll get to a number that is reﬂective of the ﬁrst full year of operation only meaning over time as that project expands through laterals or compression or whatever that's not reﬂected in that year one ROE, but that will all ﬂow from the input, which is agreed upon customer rate and cost."
"Got it. And then is there a point in time, Jim, that you can sort of update us on laterals and compression. Is there and then where sort of your intentions are there at that point?","No. What we can say is that we are optimistic that there will be expansions over time. Sorry this is Diane Leopold, but we're right now focused on getting the base project in."
"Hey, Tom, you've covered a lot and you've made a ton of progress. So congratulations. I don't recall if you mentioned whether you think there'll be any substantial legislative activity in Virginia this year and if so what we should be monitoring?","Thanks, Greg. We mentioned two things in particular. The legislation that would allow for upto 1500 diesel school buses to be converted to electric between now and 2025. There are bills in both the house and senate. They are working their way through. Today is what we call crossover day in Virginia where each of the houses has to ﬁnish work on its own bills.  So the house has to ﬁnish work on all house bills and then everything goes over to the senate and they can no longer work on house bills after tonight. And the same is true for the senate. So there are bills on the electric school buses in both houses. And there are bills related to providing even further regulatory clarity around our 2.6 gigawatt oﬀshore wind farm.  Other than that, Greg, there has been a large amount of legislative activity, some bills are no longer viable, others are and we just monitoring all those working on them, until they work their way through the legislative process, it's really, it's premature to comment on them."
"Great. And what would be -- what's your expected, let me reword this, what would be the outcome that you would -- that you would expect coming from the legislation with regard to oﬀshore wind if it does pass and what type of regulatory framework would that entail?","Well, again, Greg, just the bills are there pending and I think they speak for themselves. They have language in them that increased regulatory clarity."
"Okay, thank you. I'll go take a read. I appreciate it. Take care.","Thank you.     Thanks, Greg.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse."
"Good morning. What impact does the FERC MOPR have on Virginia, the oﬀshore wind projects and what is your, I guess, your decision process at MEPCO versus an FRR tariﬀs?","Hey, Michael. It's Jim. Let me start there. We -- as I mentioned look we don't expect that MOPR has proposed will have really any ﬁnancial impact on Dominion. As you know our capacity and load and Virginia -- Dominion Energy Virginia is pretty well balanced.  So no near-term impact and if we foresaw that some change with MOPR and PJM rules would mean that we would not be potentially receiving capacity payments on new build generation. We could very easily in the interest of our customers in Virginia just elect that FRR option which we think is pretty straightforward.  It's already exist for another utility in the Virginia regulatory framework. So we just don't see FRR -- the MOPR in general being an impact to our business one way or the other."
"One other question. The $8 billion for ACP is a little higher, I guess, you're at the high end of the range now. What are some of the factors that are pushing that up towards the high end of the range? Is it the Buckingham issue or something else?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Hi. This is Diane Leopold again. So we've run a lot of scenarios incorporating where we are with permitting issues and based on the timing of that construction scenarios certainly including Buckingham Compressor Station options. And all of those have been taken into account in the customer negotiations that are factoring into revised rates, but really that's what it took us to the $8 billion, which is in line or just above the high end of that judicial option range."
