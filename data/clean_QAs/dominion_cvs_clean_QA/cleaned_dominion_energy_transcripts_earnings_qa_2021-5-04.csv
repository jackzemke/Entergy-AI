Question,Answer
"Just a couple of quick questions here. First, we've seen others revised estimates on --. Any update on how kind of -- impacted your customers and fuel cost? Are you still okay there? And how are you sort of thinking about maybe resiliency spend for renewables based on maybe some of what you've observed as a result of --? Any incremental spend associated with that we could be that we should be thinking about there?","Shar, it's Bob. I'll let Jim take the ﬁrst part of that question, and then I'll answer the second.      Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Yeah. Good morning. Shar."
"Got it. And then just two very super quick ones on South Carolina. First obviously, Santee NextEra pulled their oﬀer the Senate passed the bill that's more focused on internal restructuring. Do you -- does Dominion have any stance remaining here including maybe an MSA opportunity, or is that sort of behind us?","Yeah. Our position on that is that it hasn't changed. It's the same we've oﬀered, we've worked cooperatively with Santee. We continue to work cooperatively with Santee, and we look forward to other opportunities to work cooperatively with Santee Cooper.  So no change there, Shar. We want to do what is best for South Carolina."
"Perfect. And just the GRC. I appreciate the comments that you made. But is there any sort of sense of timing, maybe just some of the pushes and takes is there kind of a point of no return, we should be thinking about as we think about maybe a breakdown of settlement talks? Just maybe a little bit more visibility, and that concludes. Thank you.","Yes. The pause was for six months from January. So it comes to an end on the July 12, I believe. And so the case would resume on July 12. So a little more than two months from now. But as we said in our prepared remarks everyone appears to be approaching this now looking for a constructive outcome and that's what we're focused on."
"Terriﬁc. Thank you, guys. And I echo your comments around Tom. He is going to be greatly missed, and he was a true gentlemen. So, I appreciate your comments. Thanks, guys.","Thank you, Shar.     Thank you, Shar.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan."
"So just want to start with the caveat granted, we're very early innings here and things will change, but are there any thoughts you could share on how the current version of the Biden infrastructure plan might impact the -- such as the tax credit front? Could this potentially impact wider spread deployment of storage in Virginia?","Yeah -- your preface to the question was, exactly right, it is indeed early days. So we don't know what's going to come out in the ﬁnal analysis. So I think the best way to think about it is, we're just very well positioned. We think the approach to decarbonize as quickly as we can reliably and aﬀordably makes all the sense in the world. We're very well positioned to do that.  This is not something that's new for us, and we see to the extent we see opportunities with the Biden plan. We'll take advantage of them, but at this point we don't exactly know. We just know the atmosphere is really good. We think it's smart for customers. We're excited about it."
"Got it. That makes sense. And then also, I guess under the new administration, you can touch on this a bit, but maybe you could just comment a bit more on your interaction BOEM here in how you kind of feel about things progressing moving forward through the process now versus before?","Sure. We've had the opportunity to be involved in a couple of diﬀerent industry conversations with BOEM leadership and other leadership and the administration. I think it's very clear that they see the advantages to oﬀshore wind development and I think the best evidence when it comes to us is, as we mentioned earlier that schedule for the notice of intent and for the record of decision line up exactly with what we talked about on our fourth quarter call.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So we have a very good sense that the professionals at BOEM as they always have are going to move forward eﬃciently. The leadership and the administration clearly thinks the oﬀshore wind is good economically, and to meet carbon goals.  And we're looking forward to sort of taking advantage of the experience that we have with the only wind farm operating in federal waters oﬀ the coast of United States today, as we expand that to something much bigger."
"Got it. And just one last one if I could. And I think you've touched on this a bit, but just wondering what you're learning from initial hydrogen eﬀorts here? How does this inform that relative opportunity between hydrogen and RNG for your gas distribution system going into the future?","Hi, good morning. This is Diane Leopold. So just as a reminder on our hydrogen pilot we're in our very early stages as in days, our gas distribution business is implementing some blending programs that a training facility starting in Utah. And we just commissioned it and it's started testing just a couple of weeks ago.  So we're really moving forward with that. We're looking to expand that, if it's successful to a small customer use application and then follow the pilots and our other service territories. In fact we requested a similar piloted at a training facility as part of our North Carolina rate case. So we're starting small, very important on hydrogen blending.  So we see a combination of moving forward with continued pilots and testings of hydrogen blending throughout our LDC system including putting it into the LDC production and even methanation in the future as well as an increased percentage of RNG into the system, which is really one for one oﬀset with methane.  So increased RNG increased hydrogen blending possibly towards methanation as we move to continue to decarbonize the LDC system."
Got it. That makes sense. Thank you. Tom will be missed. Thank you very much.,Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"(Multiple Speakers) You bet. While we heard from Diane there just you have been kind of early investor in RNG projects, and I think -- I just be curious kind of where that stands? And do you see a lot more coming over the next few years?","Hi, good morning, Steve. Diane again. So yes, we have been an early investor. We announced our intention to spend about $650 million on two main partnerships. We've been focusing on the agricultural RNG, so the hog farms with Smithﬁeld and the dairy farms with Vanguard renewables. We have one project that's in service as of the second half of last year. We have three projects under construction now, and expect to have about ﬁve more under construction later this year.  So we're really ramping up on actually bringing forward the projects. On the demand side, we really see a signiﬁcant strong demand right now from a variety of customers. You could see the people like the reﬁners that have LCFS obligations to make, and we see more states looking to implement LCFS standards. We see utilities, both on the power generation side and direct customer use side and then we see a lot of colleges and universities and other corporations that are kind of carbon conscious buyers that are looking to oﬀset their fossil usage.  So we really see a lot of demand, starting to pick up for multi-year contract terms at attractive prices. So long term, we're still looking at these projects as critical supply sources for our LDCs as an important tool for customers to achieve net zero. And so starting to access through our GreenTherm tariﬀ that we already have in Utah now and we have requested in North Carolina, we'll continue to do so, but we're really continuing to see strong demand and/or projects are ramping up.     Hi, Steve, it's Bob. I will mention that I had the opportunity last week to actually visit our operating site in Utah. It's quite something with the scale of the farming operation. It's also interesting that it happens to be not too far from one of our solar farms as well as there is a wind farm there too. So it's come a center of renewable energy and we just think that in the scope of what we're doing in our decarbonization investment. There are a lot of opportunities as Diane described, and RNG that will serve us well for the long term."
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. And then just one quick question. Just sales trends in Virginia South Carolina? Any quick thoughts there?,"Hey, Steve. Good morning, it's Jim. The sales trends are occurring kind of like we expected. I'll share a few stats. In Virginia, year-to-date still pretty resilient like we saw most of most of last year. So year to-date up a little over 2%. Residential is still strong up almost 4%. C&I also up almost 5%. So pretty good. Keep in mind that one underlying trend, we mentioned this a lot is the continuation of data center growth. That number is up like 25%, or it's small, but growing is a third of our commercial segment is data centers. We expect to connect another 20, or so data centers and our service charge rate this year. We conducted 19 last year. So that trend is very supportive of overall sales and continues to be strong."
"Hey, excellent. Perhaps if I can give pivot oﬀ that last question on sales. Perhaps, can we talk about the Next Clean Energy ﬁling later this year? We expected more of the same in terms of on resources versus PPAs. But also, how are you thinking about that ﬁling against sales trends and also against some of these other headlines from independent IPPs just looking at accelerating their procurement eﬀorts in and around your service territory maybe via, shall we say corporate procurements of various ﬂavors and sorts? If you can speak to sort of the overall backdrop, do you mind?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yeah. Thanks, Julien. So, I think the answer should it look similar to the ﬁling that we just got approved the answer to that is no in that this next ﬁling will be larger in scale, and I think you particularly asked the split between PPA and utility-owned and that will be diﬀerent. Going forward, that's what the Clean Economy Act is it's quite speciﬁc on this point that for the new solar build 65% is to be utility owned and 35% is to be third party, or PPA and sort of the total amount of that is on the order of a 1000 megawatts a year for the next 15.  So that's what you should be thinking about really long term for us is we will match the VCEA proportions and the magnitude going forward. The sort of second part of your question were, our focus, our growth is in regulated renewables to the extent that we and if I'm understanding correctly to the extent we have customers, important customers who were looking for contracted approaches, we expect to do some of that, but our focus on growing our solar portfolio is on the regulated side."
"Fair enough. And then with respect to South Carolina here. I know that you're coming up on the July time frame, at least we're broadly approaching and we got some updates here in the interim, but still conﬁdent that perhaps by that point in time, we can reach some sort of resolution, if you will? Is that fair as far as it goes?","Julian, I used to be a lawyer and as a profession, we seem to be procrastinators. So I wouldn't read too much into the fact that there is two months left. You can get a lot of work done in two months. And as we said in the script everyone is approaching this constructively. So yeah, we think we can get it done."
"Got it. And if I can squeeze in one last one. Just LNG, and I know you guys have obviously still then or chunkier but you've seen some pretty elevated valuations here in the space of late. Any comments, reactions just wanted to throw that in there quickly?","Hi, Julien. Its Jim. Yeah we -- I'll repeat what I think what we've said many times before. We very much like our new look and our asset mix. The dynamics you're speaking to, we're not blind to that, that some day that could be an opportunity to raise capital and replace what we have in our plan for modest continued equity issuance, but no current focus on that topic.  We're following but that we're focusing on executing our plan with our current asset mix."
Excellent. All right. All the best. And I echo your sentiments with respect to Tom.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"Thanks. Julien.  Operator  Well, thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with ISI."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for taking my question. Just quick clariﬁcation, Jim on 2021 guidance what are we assuming in terms of the timing on the South Carolina rate case? If you could just clarify that, please.","Yeah Durgesh, good morning. So on the South Carolina rate case, we've been again here consistently saying a couple of things. One is that given the size of that business in relation to Dominion of course that's just the electric part of DESE, we're talking about base rates on the electric side. Any reasonable outcome is not -- is going to be within our guidance range. Within, so no material impact. And then as far as the impact of a delay we've seen some folks suggesting that a delay a year, would be kind of in the 5% range so take half of that for six months, you're talking about a couple of pennies. That's probably in the ballpark, but still not material and within our guidance."
"Okay, perfect. And just a quick one on the nuclear plant extensions. Does that change, or give you an opportunity to deploy more CapEx? Or is kind of is this is in line with your thinking when you sort of develop the CapEx plan four, ﬁve years out?",It's in line with our thinking when we developed the CapEx plan.      Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   It was $1.3 billion of spend related to the nuclear relicensing in our ﬁve year plan that we went through on the fourth quarter.
"Understood. Thanks guys. And it's really a loss losing Tom. So my best for Tom, and his family.",Thanks for your thoughts.     Thank you. Durgesh.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"On the Triennial ﬁling, the revenue deﬁciency that you guys have identiﬁed. Is that mostly related to rate base service, or is it a new investment, or is it more operationally related?","So I think you're asking about the 22 test year and our measurement versus a 10.8% ROE. And the answer is just with the way that the law works we project forward sort of known and notables for the year '22, and we calculate what the return is. And in this case that return is slightly below the 10.8% that we believe is the appropriate authorized ROE.  So I don't know that I can identify any one speciﬁc thing, there's a number of sort of components that go into that, but it's -- you do that analysis compare it against what we believe is an appropriate ROE and that's how we end up with that slight revenue deﬁciency, and the regulatory speak."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got you. So combination of everything. Diane on RNG just one other question on that subject. Do you anticipate a time when blending RNG, and maybe even hydrogen II into the system would enable a utility and your utilities speciﬁcally to say that they are greenhouse gas neutral or greenhouse gas zero, or even negative?  And when do you think that will happen? And how many years do you think in the future would you have to wait for that?","Well, absolutely. In fact it was part of our thinking when we committed to net zero by 2050 across both our gas and electric businesses was blending renewable natural gas and hydrogen into the system as part of a component of that. So, it's certainly already worked into the plans I believe of numerous utilities in their net zero plans especially RNG and the agricultural RNG which is why we're trying to attract so much of it into our LDC systems, and working with regulators and investing in it to get it in the networks is because it's so much more carbon negative than a lot of other forms.  So instead of just being carbon-neutral you just get a lot of bang for the buck out of smaller quantities of it to help meet those net zero goals."
"Gotcha. One last question on the solar business. Are you seeing any impacts from -- as a result of supply -- global supply demand tightness in that segment and mostly shipping is like shipping logistics issues, chip shortages. We're hearing in the solar industry that the supply is tight and prices are up. Just wondering if that's aﬀecting you at all?","Yeah, Michael it's Jim. We're seeing the same, not in a material way and the shipping and logistics issue, we're not seeing as much as just some upward price pressure on poly, on glass, on steel, but it's something we're watching. But it's not for our business is not a material issue, but certainly there is upward pressure on cost right now."
