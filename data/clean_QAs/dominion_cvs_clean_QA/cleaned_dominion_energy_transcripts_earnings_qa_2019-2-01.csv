Question,Answer
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Hey, Jim.","Good question. So the way we think about that is that, what's on the table right now, as you know, within this 10-year contract for the ﬁrst three years is basically roughly equivalent to market pricing. So no need for us to have a contract for that. So we're hopeful that there will be a contract for that period that value these other attributes we've talked about for Millstone. So if that comes into place, the contribution from such a contract for the relevant period would be an adder to our guidance -- earnings guidance. Doesn't necessarily mean it would change our growth rate, but it would be an adder to the existing guidance. So that's what we mean by there that's excluded. It will be a potential for an adder for the time period in which a federal contract comes into play."
"Okay. Is it palatable for you as currently proposed, or is there -- or is sort of a shutdown still something that's in the -- a potential given the way it's (technical diﬃculty).","Shar, we have a new administration in place. We have been working very constructively with them. So I'm not going to -- we're not here to do any sabre rattling today. Our position hasn't changed. We have to have a clear ﬁnancial path for Millstone. That proposal from Governor Malloy, his outgoing proposal does not meet that standard."
"Got it. Okay, good. And then, Tom, let me just ask you -- and you touched on it very -- you touched on it in your prepared remarks around the economics of sort of the pipe Atlantic Coast, especially with the sort of second delaying cost increase. Can you just be a little bit more speciﬁc on how the conversations are going? But more importantly, what's sort of the impact of this sort of legislation? I think it's bill number 17, 18 that's advancing through the General Assembly. Do you -- is there a viability for this thing and so just what are your thoughts there?","Well, so that's -- I think that's two diﬀerent questions in that. So as I understand, the ﬁrst one is about -- are you talking about conversation with customers?"
"Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thanks. So just to follow up on the ACP contracts, Tom, you mentioned the $1.79 dekatherm last ﬁve year. Just could you give us a sense of where the contract pricing or the ACP is now versus that?","No, Steve, we can't. That's all through conﬁdential agreements with the customers, but I can tell you that this is signiﬁcantly lower than $1.79."
Yeah. Okay. And then what is pricing now like -- more like now as opposed to the last ﬁve years? Is it in that ballpark too?,"Yeah. I mean, the last few days when it was cold, it wasn't just cold on the East Coast, obviously, as it was on the Midwest. But I believe it was somewhere $5, $6 versus the Henry Hub. It certainly has value there, but that ﬁve-year average actually is summer and winter time. It is averaged through the entire year, not just the price spikes of the winter."
Okay.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"So, it continues to show value and increase that you see in these cold times."
"Okay, and then just in terms of going back to -- there was a question -- I just want to clarify the comments on the convert. So that -- your intention is to issue a new convert when that one is done or just remarket that debt?","Yeah, good question. We are required, based on the terms of existing units, remarket a debt. That doesn't represent an increase in debt, it's just remarketing, which will be this year. But this is our last outstanding mandatory convertible securities. So the equity converts into common equity. The equity is done in August and we view that as an attractive security to us and we think there's demand for it in the capital markets, our perception. So, we do plan to replace it. It will be exactly the same as the securities we've issued in the past. It could be slightly diﬀerent. But some form of that hybrid capital mandatory convertible otherwise we plan to use to replace the $1.4 billion that eﬀectively goes away in the middle of this year in August."
"And then one last question, just back to ACP. So I think there has been some concern that it's often hard to get an en banc hearing, but obviously, this is obviously a pretty important case. So just maybe you could give some color on why it might be diﬀerent this time in your ability to get that hearing in this case?","Well, Steve, this is Tom. You're quite right. En banc proceedings are -- they don't happen every day of the week, they don't happen every month. This case, I don't know if you've had a chance to read the brief that was ﬁled on behalf of ACP last week. But I think it sets the story out pretty well. There's 50 pipelines that go underneath the Appalachian Trail today, or it's about 50 that are now all in question. We have signiﬁcant support from a variety of folks. I think you'll see 10 or more friends of the court ﬁle brief, a brief or briefs sometime late next week. The Department of Justice will weigh in before February 11 on the importance of this. But that's -- we'll see what happens. There's other avenues, as I mentioned, that you can always appeal to the Supreme Court obviously, and there's legislative eﬀorts underway and there are other potential administrative avenues we're looking at, that we haven't been able to pursue very thoroughly because of the government shutdown. So the en banc is important milestone, but it's not by any stretch the only avenue to make sure we ﬁnish this pipe, in which we are highly conﬁdent.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Rose-Lynn Armstrong with UBS. Ms. Armstrong, if your line is muted, you'll need to unmute to ask your question.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
Hello. You talked about discussing long-term dividend growth...,"Yeah, I'm sorry. Is that -- I'm sorry, was that a question? I'm sorry, I didn't hear the whole thing.  Operator  I'm sorry, it looks like she accidentally disconnected her line.     Okay.  Operator  We'll go to our next questioner Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI."
"Good morning, guys. So, thanks for the updated -- the guidance range. I know that you had given sort of an interim guidance update in early January, and the illustrative guidance range at the time for 2020 was for $4.35 to $4.47. Now if I do take the current guidance for '19 and I just extrapolate 5% growth around, should I be extrapolating 5% growth from the low and the high end to come up with what you guys believe your current 2020 implied guidance range should be to get the low end and the high end? I just want to be clear on that.","Yeah. Greg, it's actually Jim. We're not really talking about a guidance range for 2020 yet. We've given this indicative 5%. So we think about it more in terms of midpoint. So midpoint 2019 to '20, that's where our minds are right now. We'll get more granular with the guidance range as we go through time."
"Okay. I just wanted to make sure that I was translating that 2020 statement properly, so thank you. Appreciate it. In terms of other questions, I think most of mine have been answered. So I'll give you back the time. Thank you.","Thanks, Greg.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)      Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan."
"Good morning, guys. Tom, you mentioned the alternative plan for ACP and the slightly higher cost estimate and longer time frame for that. Could you just expand upon the exact permit scenario that would underpin that plan?","It all has -- we have all of our permits. So let's -- we didn't mention in the script, for example, we did get our last real permit, signiﬁcant permit which is the air permit for the Buckingham compressor station. So what now is in front of us is core challenges on variety of pieces, which has no challenge for what's between Buckingham County and Lumberton North Carolina. It has to do with these issues in the mountains and the national parks, et cetera. So all those diﬀerent time frames and the diﬀerent amounts are based on diﬀerent scenarios on when we ﬁnish the court challenges."
"So there's not one particular path there. So the alternative is now, if you fail at the en banc, then you do that.","Correct. There are other -- there are multiple paths there. And I know people are focused understandably and justiﬁably on the en banc. But that's not the only path here. There are -- there is -- potentially if we don't get the en banc or we lose the en banc, there's the -- you have the judicial path to Supreme Court. There is legislative path that we're working on quite vigorously, and there are, as I mentioned, administrative paths that we have identiﬁed, but haven't been able to fully pursue because of the government shutdown. But the primary focus right now for us is our en banc proceeding. We think that decision is erroneous and upends almost 50 years of agency precedent."
"Okay. And then just following up on the strategy here with ACP, the biological opinion is, I guess technically what's caused the temporary stop in construction right now. But I'm wondering, given the gravity of the Forest Service opinion and the en banc process, were you to not to succeed on the Forest Service side, call it, in the second quarter or mid-year, does it make sense to continue construction at that time or hold oﬀ on construction until you get more   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   clarity there? I think last time I checked, you had drawn around $1 billion of the project level debt. So far you've spent a good amount, but you're not maybe fully committed at this point in terms of spending in my opinion.","Well, I'll let Jim give you the numbers on what has been spent. I just -- there are so many variables in that question. I just I think it's hard for us to really to answer it. We'd have to see -- I think we're going to win on the biological opinion issue quite -- I have high conﬁdence in that. This is the second time around they followed the dictates of the court and what the court was interested in and reissued it. So it would have to see -- we assume it's going to get aﬃrmed and if it's not, we will have to see what the court says, and then we'll have to make a decision around that. But we think all of that is taken into account in these diﬀerent time frames given here, because we can proceed from Buckingham which is sort of almost middle of the pipeline, all the way down to Lumberton business, and up in to Hampton Roads.     Hey, Chris. Let me just add. You mentioned correctly that back in October when we published our third quarter Q, we noted that the amount of capital drawn on that project level construction facility was little over $1 billion, $1.15 billion, I think it was $1 billion on a 100% basis. And so that number as of 12/31 is about $1.4 billion, not drastically diﬀerent. That's on a 100% on basis, so that would imply total spend. That's of course -- 50% of that cash capital is represented in draws on the project level facility. So, double it to get 100% basis of the total amount spent, which would be about -- approaching $2.8 billion as of 12/31. And those numbers will be mostly in the K.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Rose-Lynn Armstrong with UBS.     Here you are."
"I did, I apologize. So, getting to this -- to the indication earlier that you would discuss long-term dividend growth at the Analyst Meeting, can you just give us a little preview of that today? I believe previous comments regarding 2020 were that the policy was predicated on the MLP   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   market and, now of course with the roll-up, how are you thinking about dividend policy going forward?","Thanks, Rose-Lynn. So let me just refresh everybody on the background here. So we announced the expected dividend policy, of course, they're all subject, as you all know, each quarter, to Board approval. But we said in 2017 that looking forward, we had a very robust MLP market. We had Cove Point expectations coming online, et cetera. Because of the unique nature of the take or pay contracts at Cove Point, very signiﬁcant cash ﬂows ﬂowing out of that, the recapture of the capital cost that we would see drops into the MLP, that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in '18, '19 and '20.  And then when we got to '21, we'd have to see what the landscape looks like at that time. After the FERC ruling in March of last year that destroyed the viability of the MLP market, over time we said, not too long after that day, I remember the exact date Rose, and we said something along the lines that we're going to keep 10% in '18, we expect to keep 10% in '19, and depending upon what people are going to ask FERC to reconsider, we didn't know what exactly was going to happen that it could go from 6% to 10% depending upon what happened with MLPs. I think we have since said that the expectation -- obviously, the MLP market is no longer there, so you start already at the bottom of that.  But we recognized that it's not going to be 10% in '20, highly unlikely, and that over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate -- not going to be a cut in our dividend, that's not even in contemplation. The notion is we will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year. So, starting in 2020 some -- and I will talk more about that in March, but there'll be some eﬀort to bring them more in line with our peer group. I don't know if that answers your question. But I hope it does."
"Okay. And you think -- what's your -- I guess if we look at it from a payout ratio perspective, can you talk about where you'd hope to see the payout ratio over time?","Hey, Rose-Lynn, it's Jim. We will talk about that at the end of March, but we'll be setting the dividend growth rate to reach a target payout ratio that's more in line with peers, as Tom said."
"Okay. And then just on ACP, when you guys are talking about customers, are you -- does that include the anchor kind of utility customers, your aﬃliate customers and does whatever you are all going to negotiate with them need to be approved by the state regulatory bodies? I'm just curious on that.","The discussions are with -- sorry, this is Diane Leopold. The discussions are with all of the customers and every customer has something diﬀerent with respect to what they will need to ﬁnalize the deal. But we are in active discussions with all the customers now."
And then -- so the question of is it subject to SCC approval outside of normal?,You're talking about -- when you say SCC you're referring to in Virginia?
