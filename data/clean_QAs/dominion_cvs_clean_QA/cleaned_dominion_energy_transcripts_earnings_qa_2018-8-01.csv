Question,Answer
"Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I know this order just came out, but just the decision by FERC or proposed decision by FERC yesterday on the Enable MRT case and how they interpreted the kind of C-Corp/MLP tax relationship. Any thoughts on how that might impact from your standpoint?","We're taking a look at the order. Obviously, Steve, as you said, it came out last night. But I'll let Mark comment further on our whole issue around MLP.     Steve, as we've talked about in the past, there's two main issues around the sector today. The ﬁrst and the largest issue has to do with, is the MLP sector open to equity at all. And based on my knowledge, over the past eight months, there's only been one transaction done. It was done at a very signiﬁcant discount for a very small amount of equity. We're a drop-down story and so that market is not open to us and this mechanism doesn't work for us at DM.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   The second issue is the one that you referenced and that is the FERC ability to gross up for assets that are held within MLPs. Our structure is a little bit diﬀerent than Enable, but it is of a concern to us and it's something we will be watching closely. But I have to say, of the two issues, market access is the bigger one for us. We've been watching it closely for several months, and we'll be talking to both Dominion Energy board and the Dominion Midstream board over the next several months on what the current state of the MLP market is in terms of equity for their consideration."
Okay. And just is there any timeline on this kind of review with DM? Is it the next three to six months? Is it a year?,"Oh, no, it's going to be certainly no longer than the three to six months. And I would say it's probably going to be more on the short side of that."
"Okay. And then one other question, just on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, so this Fourth Circuit Court seems to be a problem, at least on Mountain Valley. I know you're addressing the Army Corps permit. But then last week, we had the permit from the Forest Service and BLM, and I don't know if you have an issue potentially with those two. Could you just talk a little bit more about how you're managing things other than just the water crossings and conviction that you can hit the timeline?","So, Steve, I'll give a preliminary answer and I will turn it over to Diane Leopold. Speaking about the Fourth Circuit, I just saw headlines. I haven't read the decision. It actually came out this morning that Fourth Circuit upheld the MVP 401 permits from Virginia just this morning."
Thank you. So my ﬁrst question is you guys mentioned that there was a larger-than-expected tax beneﬁt. So is it just related to this quarter or will it have annual implications?,"Hey, Angie, this is Mark. We operate in multiple jurisdictions. And as we put out guidance at the beginning of the year, we've put our best foot forward on what we thought how diﬀerent people would handle things. Obviously, it's going to be better than what we thought this year. On the ﬁrst quarter call, I think we expected $0.10 to $0.15 annual beneﬁt from tax reform. It's   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   certainly going to be probably in the $0.15 to $0.20 range, at least, and a large portion of that will continue mainly driven by our contracted or unregulated assets."
"Okay. That's okay. Thank you. On the term loan on the project debt for Cove Point, is this – I mean, the fact that it's a three-year loan, I mean, is it surprisingly short or it's just my perception?","I think ultimately we would want to have a longer loan for Cove, but the legal structure around Cove Point involved Midstream right now. And to make sure that it's a very clean document, we elected to go short on this and got all of our banking partners comfortable. So they're going to take this loan for the three-year period. It's important to note that we can prepay this loan at any time with no penalty. So we'll see what the long-term ﬁnancing should be around Cove. I suspect it will be much longer than three years."
"Okay. And my last question, the renewable growth in Virginia. Just remind me, was this included – so both solar and oﬀshore wins? Were those included in your updated growth plan that you launched last year?","Angie, this is Paul Koonce. The Grid Transformation & Security Act found that 5,000 megawatts was in the public interest of renewables, onshore and oﬀshore. So, last week, we announced our intent to have 3,000 megawatts, either in operation or in development by 2022. Some of that will be in the form of PPA, some of that will be self-developed, and we are in the process of updating those capital schedules now. Mark and team will be communicating that later this fall.     Angie, let me add, the incremental spend that wouldn't be disclosed already would be mainly in the 2020 to 2022 timeframe. We announced previously that we're going to have CapEx reductions of about $1 billion from previous plans. We're committed to that. But there will be incremental capital added 2020 to 2022. We'll give that update as we usually do in the fall timeframe."
"Hey. So perhaps just a quick clarifying question, following up on Steve's earlier one on the ACP. Can you just give us a little bit of a sense for potential critical milestones when it comes to just timeline itself? Obviously, there's certain windows for construction et cetera, just to give us a little bit more sense of your added comfort here on the timeline, so sort of sidestepping the speciﬁc issues of which obviously you've addressed already with Steve earlier, but just – is there a critical date by which you need to get clarity?","There's nothing pending that we'll – nothing we're working on, nor anything pending that gives us any concern about the timeline."
"Excellent. Thank you for the clarity there. But, separately, going back to some of the other commentary about ﬁnancing, can you elaborate a little bit on your thoughts on asset sales at this point just vis-à-vis you've obviously got a number of diﬀerent things potentially contemplated? Just curious, Blue Racer, power plants, et cetera, I mean, is there a preference, a pecking order, if you will, on assets to potentially sell down to reach your targets and again the timeline there, it would seem at least per the media that things are already underway?","Julien, it's Mark. We don't really have a preference. We're going to take the best value that we oﬀered if we think it's fair value on the assets that we talk about previously. Obviously, from some of the prepared remarks you can see we're pretty far down the road on some of this since we're going to – we believe anyway we'll announce results prior to the next quarter's call.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   There's been a lot of interest in both Blue Racer and in the fossil assets, and we're talking to a number of diﬀerent parties seriously about those. So we think we'll have closure on FPs (29:35). They probably won't be closed by the end of the third quarter, but we'll certainly have clarity and have signed documents to go ahead and move toward a closing process in the near term after that. We're quite optimistic on it. The asset is a whole of lot value, and I think the counterparties we're talking to, at least in the early stages, agree with that."
"Okay. And to clarify there, just to be extra clear, could you potentially sell all of the assets, or are you singularly solving for a proceeds number?","We don't have to sell all those assets to meet the credit targets and debt reduction that we've committed to, but we could sell all those assets if the value met the thresholds that we were looking for."
"Just to follow up, I think I understood that last point on Julien's question on the non-core assets. But I guess in general, are you encouraged by the level of interest and indications that you've been receiving so far?","Very encouraged. Again, we...   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay, great. And then just on Atlantic Coast Pipeline, I think you gave a lot of great color. I just wanted to make sure I understood the Fish and Wildlife process in the state of Virginia. Where do we stand on that, and what's the sort of next steps there?","Well, Fish and Wildlife, we have the permit we need from the Fish and Wildlife. There's been a lawsuit ﬁled over that permit that's sitting in the courts right now. There's no other process with Fish and Wildlife.     Just the Incidental Take.     Yeah. There's the permit through the Forest – I'm sorry. I was confusing out, I thought you were asking about Forest Service. Forest Service were done. Fish and Wildlife, the court said that their Incidental Take permit needed more speciﬁcity. They've been working on that, and we expect it to be issued relatively soon. But they've put on the docket at FERC that a very small part of the pipeline was aﬀected by the Endangered Species Act and the Incidental Take permit, and that's why we've been able to go full bore with a lot of construction."
"I see. So, basically, yeah, the portions aﬀected were very small. That allows you to continue forward with your work. And then I guess we'll just have to assess when the court comes out with the revised language on the Incidental Take I guess then we would then assess what that means, or is there anything further to read into that?","No, there's really nothing further we would expect. This is Diane Leopold, sorry. The Fish and Wildlife Service would quickly then reissue a new revised Incidental Take Statement consistent with that. But all through this time, their biological opinion remains in full force and eﬀect.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Good morning. So just to follow up on the asset sales, just in terms of tax and tax leakage, what's the kind of numbers we should be thinking about for potential tax leakage and is there a preference given the tax proﬁle of those two assets in terms of which one you would like to sell?","There is probably a preference, but it's not one I'd like to talk about. They all have diﬀerent tax proﬁles. And so, again, we'll look at the bottom-line value that's oﬀered net of tax. It's important to note, too, we have a signiﬁcant number of NOLs currently, so we may be able to protect ourselves on some of the tax exposure. But tax will be part of the ultimate decision, so I wouldn't lean one way or the other on what the tax basis is for any of those as being the driving factor."
"Got you. Fair enough. And sorry if you've already addressed this question, but just on the MLP side, given there's no real drop-down planned at this point and given where the market is, is there a call you plan to take at some point in terms of the future of the direction of the MLP?","Well, I mentioned earlier that we will be talking to both the Dominion Energy and Dominion Midstream board here over the next couple of months on the status of current equity markets in the MLP sector. I referenced that, at least this year, to my knowledge, there's only been one very small equity transaction in the market, and it's been at pretty signiﬁcant discount. So, obviously, if these equity markets aren't open to us, the DM structure that we've set up to ﬁnance assets that are dropped in doesn't work, and we'll have to determine what the best course is. But I would expect we will review that more in the near term than in the long term.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Got you. So by year-end 2018, you would have a direction kind of where you want to take DM?","Well, I think one of the other callers asked a timeframe of three to six months, and I said I'd probably put it on the short side of that."
