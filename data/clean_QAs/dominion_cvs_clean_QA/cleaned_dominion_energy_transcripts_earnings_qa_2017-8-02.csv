Question,Answer
"Hey, I was wondering if you could go through how you're dealing with the environmental opposition to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline within Virginia. What kind of deals have been reached with the opposition at this point?",I'm not sure I understand your question entirely. But there's no deals to be reached with the opposition. We're going through the permitting process as we have for the last two-and-a-half years. We'll get our FERC permit in the fall and it's a matter of going through. There's public hearings that will be held on the water permits in Virginia this month. They had them last month in North Carolina and those permits will be issued later in the fall and we will start construction in November. No deals to be struck with anyone.
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. So it doesn't sound like there is anything – any signiﬁcant opposition that you're dealing with. Is that a fair statement or?,"There's certainly some vocal opposition in some isolated localities, but overall, folks in Virginia support the pipeline as they do in West Virginia, North Carolina and we expect to get all the necessary permits later this fall."
"Just real quick on ACP. Is there a point you need a quorum at FERC before construction shifts into 2018 or are you conﬁdent that you could start constructing in November? And then as you sort of think about incremental growth opportunities with the project, how should we sort of think about the next set of priorities? Is it starting with compression, upsizing through compression or maybe an extension of the pipeline through surrounding states?","Thank you, and good morning. We'd like to see FERC commissioners impaneled in September, would be our best guess on when that'll happen and that would allow us – no later than September is our best guess on when that'll happen, and that would allow us to start construction on this particular schedule. We won't talk about potential expansion opportunities until after we've received our FERC permit. And then, we will sit down and talk to folks."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a question on DM here, is it deﬁnitive that you need equity in 2018 or can you sort of ﬁnance this ﬁrst ceremonial drop with Cove Point cash ﬂows maybe looking at some investment grade debt at the DM level. So, how should we think about the ﬁrst drop in 2018?","Shah, it's Mark. Now, we're going to need a drop and some equity in 2018, not signiﬁcant. But I think if you do the math, cash ﬂows on coverage is very strong for us at DM well into 2018. But right now, we anticipate a drop and we want to get more liquidity in that stock anyway, there is limited trading on it. So, our ability to put more shares out, I think are advantageous."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly, a lot of back and forth with the headlines in the media on Millstone and – especially with the recent governor order, can you just maybe just talk a little bit about some of the back and forth we've seen in the media, and then how far or how willing you are to provide ﬁnancials on the asset? Thanks.","Good morning. There's been obviously lots in the press about what's going on in Connecticut legislature. We're working very hard on that project in the legislation. As long as they're in session, we will be working on it, and we think there are prospects to have that legislation be adopted during the course of this legislative session. The governor's issued an executive order you referenced calling for a study. We don't feel the need to – for a study to be conducted, but we will certainly participate in the study. I think it's pretty clear what's necessary in Connecticut, and we'll let it play its course."
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Wanted to just follow up on the last question on Connecticut. Do you have a sense for the process or timeline for this to play out just so we can try to follow the milestones along the way?,"Stephen, good morning. This is Paul Koonce with the Generation Group. The session ended oﬃcially on July 7. They went into special session on July 28. It really comes down to what happens and how do they close their budget deﬁcit. Two weeks ago, the House approved a union concession package. Monday, the Senate approved the same union concession package, which closes the budget deﬁcit by a substantial amount. So, it really is up to the House and the Senate in Connecticut to continue to work to close their budget deﬁcit. That could play out over the next several weeks we expect, but hopefully they will come to conclusion by Labor Day. But it's a legislative process in August, it is a diﬃcult month to get people together. So, I'd say weeks, but we think that they're making progress."
"Okay. And the study that is underway, is that essentially – do we have a sense for how much time that will take to complete and how that sort of factors into this process?","Yes, I'll just comment on that. This is the governor's executive order, he's asked the Department of Energy and Environment to conduct the study. As we've said publicly, we think the time has passed for conducting studies, but be that as it may. The Department of Energy and Environment is to report out to the legislature next January. So, that's part of the legislation that was approved by the Senate, does not take legislative action. So, he's taken steps himself to move that forward. But, as the Senate bill 106 called for was action, and that's really what we think is necessary at this stage."
"Okay, understood. And then just shifting gears, if I could, to the development on oﬀshore wind. At a high level, could you talk to the growth potential here and the economics and how you see the future of oﬀshore wind? Could this become a signiﬁcant contributor in the state? How should we think about the growth potential there?","Well, this ﬁrst two turbines are test turbines. They will be built in the area that's been designated that we have the lease rights to. It's about 25 miles, 26 miles oﬀshore of Virginia Beach, so the turbines won't be visible. We've been working on this for a number of years, long, many years trying to ﬁnd a partner who would give us the kind of certainty we needed on the cost to protect our customers. So that we could go to our commission, because it will need commission approval to authorize the construction of the turbines. They are – will be subject to rider recovery.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   If the turbines demonstrate that they work well in these waters and produce the kind of capacity that we expect, then it's up to 2,000 megawatts of oﬀshore wind that would be available. We're building a lot of solar as well. Our IRP calls for up to 5,000 megawatts of solar. Solar uses a lot of land, and that's beginning to become obvious to people as maybe not quite as obvious to folks in the West, where vacant land is abundant. It's a little more obvious to folks in the East, where vacant land is not quite as abundant. So we're exploring all of our options to meet our customers' demands for decades to come. That's part of why we're looking at the relicensing of North Anna and Surry as well, and pump storage in the Virginia mountains."
"Hey, Tom. The 2017 earnings range is still pretty wide. So, I guess any kind of commentary or thought toward kind of where you're heading in that range and when you might be able to narrow it?","Steve, this is Mark. No additional commentary really. We typically don't change our ranges that we establish at the beginning of the year. And we give the quarterly guidance to see where we land. So we don't anticipate changing the range. Would also say that in the third quarter – we're a weather-sensitive company, as we've already talked about, we're down $0.10 to weather through the ﬁrst half of the year and the third quarter is the most sensitive we would be to weather, both positive and/or negative depending on how that turns out. So that can move us. But I think for now and probably through the remainder of the year, we will keep that range as is and just report the actuals as we move through."
"Can I ask on just the Connecticut and Millstone strategy? You say you're going to stay unhedged pending an outcome. If I understand the proposed measure correctly, it was going to enable maybe half of Millstone to be covered. So why not hedge the other half in the meantime or are you thinking you might have something more comprehensive as an outcome?","Jonathan, this is Mark. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have started hedging 2018, but that we were going to limit that hedge until the outcome of the legislation. So to your point, we would expect that a portion of that output needs to be hedged, even if it's not bid into a future auction process. We're working on that now and I'll have a disclosure on that in the third quarter."
"Okay. Great. I must have misheard the prepared remark. Can I ask – we were just looking at the solar slide and it looked like, in the last quarter you were expecting these projects to all be late   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   2017, and the North Carolina 79-megawatts of capacity came forward into 2Q, what happened there? And is that the same project and how must that beneﬁt the quarter?","Jonathan, this is Paul Koonce with Generation. Actually, we're sort of right on schedule. So we had a full year plan, the plan is moving on schedule. So, no change."
