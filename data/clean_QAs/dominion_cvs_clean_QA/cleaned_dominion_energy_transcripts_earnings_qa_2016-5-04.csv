Question,Answer
"As you didn't talk about or reiterate your near-term or long-term earnings growth aspirations. Can I assume that they all remain in place? And then, if so, over the last three months, four months, have there been any major evolutions in things that would be going in or going out of the asset proﬁle or the margin proﬁle that have changed relative to what you thought three months, four months ago?","Greg, this is Mark. I would say nothing in the last three months or four months. We still have the same targeted growth levels that we've talked about historically. But I would say that over the last six months or eight months, that power prices in the Northeast have been weak. We think they will recover as we move into 2017. But that's probably the one variable that's out there that has gotten more negative over the last six months or eight months."
Okay. And can you give us any sense of timing on the rest of the ﬁnancing activity for Questar?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"It'll all be done between now and close, except for the DM equity which I think I said on the last call that we have, as part of our bridge ﬁnancing, taken out a one-year term loan that is eﬀective at close for up to one year that gives us ﬂexibility to access the DM marketplace when we want. But the rest of the ﬁnancing will be completed between now and close."
"Hey. So, a couple quick questions here. First, you kind of alluded to it already in the prepared remarks, but can you elaborate a little bit on Blue Racer opportunities? Where do you see that trending right now in terms of your quarter-over-quarter developments? Obviously, we've seen gas prices come back a little bit here.  And then the second question related. What about Wexpro? Are there opportunities to reinvigorate that investment plan, either because of pricing improvements or, perhaps more importantly, because of developments on the land side or what have you?","Julien, with respect to Blue Racer, Blue Racer continues along its plan. There haven't been any changes there. It's a very insigniﬁcant part of Dominion's earnings. But it's doing as anticipated and as we expected it to do this year and it's contributing as it should to the earnings proﬁle.  With respect to Wexpro, we're going to reserve all of our comments on what happens with Questar and on what our plans are with Questar until after their shareholders vote and we have   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   a chance to further our dialogue with their management team."
"Got it. And then unrelated, if you can talk about the renewables opportunity. Obviously you guys are trying to scale that in Virginia. But given the extensions, how are you speaking about deploying further, especially solar, assets in 2017 and 2018 as you think about any potential pressures on your earnings growth because of commodity, et cetera?","Well, we're looking primarily in Virginia, both regulated and, as we discussed in the script, a couple of diﬀerent quasi-regulated opportunities have arisen. Now, we're looking actively there. As you commented, we're much more interested in solar than we are in wind. Wind is not a good asset in the territories where we do business for producing power reliably. Solar is better and we are continuing to look at 2017 and 2018.  So far with respect to all of our other growth projects, they're all on time and on budget or ahead of time and below budget. And we'll see how we go along through time and see if we're going to deploy any additional capital into renewable projects."
"If you could, I'd like to understand the $0.16 CP, Capacity Performance, driver in the second half. Can you just remind us – I think we talked about this before, but does that persist into 2017, like through the ﬁrst half of the performance year? And then does it also persist beyond the 2016, 2017 year?","Jonathan, this is Mark. Obviously, we had a huge pick up on the Capacity Performance Auction, which we think a lot of people probably overlooked in both 2016 and 2017. The 2016 number on just Capacity Performance will be higher than it is in 2017, but when you combine that with node rolloﬀs, it will be about the same year-over-year. And if you add on top of that the Millstone capacity in 2017 over 2016, we will actually have an increase in our total income associated with capacity from 2016 to 2017 when you combine those three together.  But we were a very, very large beneﬁciary. And as you reference, year-over-year it's $0.16 for Capacity Performance. It's $0.14 in the last six months and there's about $0.02 worth of incremental rolloﬀ of nodes in the last six months. That brings you to your $0.16 total."
So is there a roughly similar uplift in ﬁrst half of 2017?,"On Capacity Performance speciﬁcally, the number is lower. But as I mentioned, if you combine all of our capacity resources, Millstone and node obligations, the number is actually higher."
"Right. But then as you roll into the next capacity year? Sorry, I may have missed your answer here.","Remember how this capacity option works on PJM. You had to cover 60% of your load in the ﬁrst year and I then think it was 70% of your load. So the opportunity on Capacity Performance will get smaller as you have to cover more of your load moving forward. So 2016 is the biggest year for that one single item and it starts to whittle down from there, but we're quite pleased with the result for us."
"Okay, great. Thank you, Mark. And then you referenced – I think Tom mentioned at the end of his remarks there was a possible restructuring of one of the farm-out deals that you'd previously   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   struck? Can you give a little more insight into what you're alluding to there, what form that might take?","We did one last year, Greg (29:06), and they could be a variety of diﬀerent examples. Some of the cases, when we did the farm-outs, there were agreed-to drilling schedules. And, for example, if someone want to modify the drilling schedule, they would have to compensate us for that. So that's the kind of activity we're looking at. But the primary activity is in the traditional farm-out. We still have a lot of Utica acreage and we have a tremendous amount of interest in it."
"Okay. So, the restructuring would be a smaller item than hopefully entering into new ones?","May or may not be. I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion, Jonathan."
"Wanted to dig into the Connecticut legislation and just ﬁrst perhaps try to understand the next steps involved and then we can discuss a little bit more about how that would exactly function. But just next steps, what should we be looking for there?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Well, the legislation you're referring to was adopted in the Senate and it has not yet been adopted by the House. I believe Connecticut Legislature ﬁnishes their work today. But I think this is a part of a dialogue that's going on all through New England and that's going to continue, it's going on in Massachusetts, it's happening in Maine, it's happening in New Hampshire, on how to deal with the carbon rules and existing carbon-free generation, which Millstone obviously is the largest asset in New England. It provides half of Connecticut's power when both units are operating in its normal operations.  And Connecticut has very little prospect of complying with carbon rules if Millstone were to shut down at some point. So I think the legislature, the political hierarchy in Connecticut is aware of that. We're following the legislation, obviously, closely. But I think it's part of an overall dialogue that will take place over the next few months in New England generally about how to protect these assets, of which I guess there are only two left that are still going to be running, Seabrook and Millstone, which is about twice the size of Seabrook."
"Understood. That's helpful. And in terms, is there a timeline in Connecticut through which we need to see either progress or resolution, i.e., is this fairly binary in terms of deadlines for passage or are there opportunities to hold, for example, I'm not sure, special sessions or you mentioned an ongoing dialogue? I'm trying to think through what milestones we should be looking for there.","I think it's going to be an ongoing dialogue. They recessed or adjourned, whatever the right word is. They ﬁnished their work today."
"Understood. And is it possible to have a special session or some other opportunity for passage at a later date, or when would the next opportunity be if it were to pass now?",There's certainly always a possibility for a special session in any legislative body. But I would expect it to continue over into the next regular session of the Connecticut Legislature.
"January. Okay. And do you expect any legislation to get done today, or you don't think it's going to get done today?",I've been in my job long enough to never speculate on what's going to happen in the legislature.
"Okay. And then just one question on the – and I apologize on the detail on this -- just on the Capacity Performance, so (34:47) to make sure I understand this. So your Virginia generation is getting Capacity Performance on all the generation. But in this year, you only have to buy out 60% Capacity Performance from your Utility. But as that 60% goes to 100%, then they'll match up and there won't be a beneﬁt. But there's a beneﬁt from that mismatch. Is that correct?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Hey, Steve. This is Mark. That is almost correct. The assumption, though, that you get the beneﬁt for all of your generation is probably not correct. Each company would have to make a decision on how much they wanted to bid in that generation against their Capacity Performance and hedge their risk for any units that might not perform. So, we made that analysis and based on the generation we bid in covering our load requirements at 60% in the ﬁrst year, that excess is the beneﬁt that I referenced."
"Two things. One, I notice you all took about a $70 million pre-tax charge related to severance. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and what your plans are company-wide in terms of O&M, what's embedded in guidance?","Hey, Michael. This is Mark. The program that was referenced was really an eﬀort across all the businesses and the corporate support areas to drive decision-making to a lower level, eliminate layers of management, increase management control and make the decision-making really   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   more eﬃcient by having those fewer layers. So that was the focus. We took a charge of about $70 million pre-tax. I think it's $43 million after-tax. And those labor costs will be recouped as the employees move on and so you'll see a full year's beneﬁt in 2017 and a partial beneﬁt in 2016.  In terms of ongoing O&M, we're targeting a ﬂat to CPI growth on O&M going forward. It will probably be diﬀerent year-by-year and the only thing that would change on that of signiﬁcance would be the outage period for Millstone, we might have two outages versus one in a given year. But I look for us and for you to model a ﬂat to CPI growth on O&M going forward."
"Got it. And real quick, can you talk about what was weather-normalized power demand for Virginia Power in the quarter and how does that diﬀer versus your expectation?","Sales weather-normalized for the quarter were down about a little over 1%. We have an annual expectation of a 1% positive sales growth for the year. We still feel pretty good about that. So that was a net for the ﬁrst quarter. April seems solid and supporting the 1% growth. And we had actually pretty strong growth in all sectors but residential.  I would add, as I always do on sales, is when you're coming and comparing to a very signiﬁcant weather season, we had a very strong ﬁrst quarter of 2015 on weather and a light 2016, and so the weather normalization process is not penny accurate. That's why we think 1% growth is still a good assumption for us. Also recall at 1% growth year-over-year, it only equates to about $0.04 a share or $0.05 a share for us."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And I apologize, but Michael (39;52) to a certain degree. The ODI, it looks like there's a $0.02 beneﬁt in the second half of this year. How should we think about that going forward?  And in general, the expense – I'm sorry, the organizational design initiatives and how should we think about the expense associated with that, the one-time or do you think you might see more of that going forward? Or how should we think about those things?","Hey, Paul. This is Mark. No, I don't think you should think about additional programs going forward. We took a one-time charge, as we always do with a non-reoccurring event, and disclosed that. And we showed on a breakdown on Slide 8 that we would expect to see lower operating expenses in labor due to lower the staﬃng levels of about $0.02 this year for the last six months of the year. And I would expect to see probably $0.04 or $0.05 next year, which is supportive of the growth rate that we have out there."
Okay. And that's it. Actually all the other questions were asked.,"Thank you.     Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. This does conclude this morning's teleconference.
