Question,Answer
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Notwithstanding just the very short delay that you've got on Cove Point, when I think about the structural beneﬁts of tax reform, the $0.10 to $0.15, because obviously being delayed a few months of Cove Point is just few months, doesn't really matter, in the long run. Is it fair to think about the steps you've taken in terms of issuing the 500 million of equity and reducing the CapEx budget about $1 billion and bringing -- starting the $800 million of targeted debt reduction at the parent early. Like all those things are sort of -- you're taking the earnings beneﬁt of tax reform and utilizing that to get a jump-start on the deleveraging goals. So in other words, like your earnings targets are still on track because you were able to take the beneﬁts of tax reform and use them to get a jump on the deleveraging that you've articulated you're looking to achieve. Is that the right way to think about this or am I not thinking about it correctly?","Hi, Greg. This is Mark. I think you're right on track there. A large piece of that we're using to go ahead and aggressively support our credit. One reason we went ahead and issued equity aftermarket in January knowing where our position was going to be even with a slight delay in Cove. So we did take advantage of that and we're committed to the ratings that we have. We will take the steps necessary to support that and we took advantage of taxes to get a jump-start."
"Great. I just wanted to make sure I understood that, that was sort of the -- what you're doing. Other than that, I actually don't have any other questions. Congratulations on a good year.","Thank you, Greg.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead."
"So, a quick clariﬁcation actually. Just given the conversations of Moody's and other agencies of late, just things under which you've updated your plan at present, does this puts you in a position to get back on track and remove some of these outlooks. I mean, obviously, you've probably added some of the conversations you've shared with us this morning. Is this more of a   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   question of timing and execution to get your eﬀort both to debt metrics and a place that is consistent with the agencies for your current rating? Is that the right way to think about that at this point? And maybe you could even share just a little bit on how you see the FFO-to-debt proﬁle of the lows you're progressing?","Hi, Julien, this is Mark. We have shared with the agency our plans and this is obviously an industry wide issue for regulated utilities in terms of FFO pressure because of tax reform. We think this gives us a very strong start to support our FFO metrics going forward, but there's probably more work to be done in the future. The approach I think -- we believe the agency is going to take are for all the companies that are impacted by the FFO, is to make sure they can execute the plans that they outlined for the agencies and for investors, and that's what we're committed to do, to get our FFO metrics where all the agencies are comfortable with them and very strong investment grade. That's our commitment and will remain our commitment."
"Got it. And then I wanted to just come back to earnings growth. Obviously, you've got a number of moving pieces in the update, not least of which is the $0.10 to $0.15 in tax reform. I know you -- in the key takeaways reaﬃrmed this 8% plus trajectory, but can you talk about ex-SCANA just how this might shift your standalone prospects for the earnings outlook, if it does at all?","Julien, I hope we've been clear on that. Our 2017-2020 growth rate is 6% to 8% without SCANA on a compound annual rate. And I think as Tom mentioned, 5 plus percent post 2020. If we're successful in the SCANA transaction, that growth rate from '17 to '20 could move to 8 plus percent. So with or without SCANA, we're in terriﬁc position with one of the best growth rates we believe in the industry and one of the highest dividend growth rates as well. But certainly, SCANA would be a positive result for us.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."
"Hi, thank you. Same question in a diﬀerent way. Assuming that $0.10 to $0.15 net beneﬁt continue through 2020, why wouldn't you be a little bit higher in your 6% to 8% growth or is it -- does that $0.10 to $0.15 change over the period?","I think -- Steve, I think it's going to change a little bit over the period, but again, I think the 6% to 8% range we feel really comfortable with. And there's a lot of moving parts on tax reform still in terms of how states might handle it, how FERC might handle it, and the timing of the cash   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   impacts on that. So, we bait our best assumptions here and we think that 6% to 8% is the right range without SCANA. Could it move us up a little bit? It's possible. I don't think it'll move us down at all. But I think taxes could move around a little bit post '18."
"Okay. And then just to clarify, could you remind us if you are including any Millstone kind of the beneﬁts of the potential contract here or not in your plan?","We are not. Again, our range that could move us within our range depending on the success at Millstone, but we do not put a speciﬁc number in when we came out with our 6% to 8% growth range prior to the Millstone legislative work."
Okay. Could you maybe also just talk a little bit about the Virginia legislation that was recently proposed and then what's Dominion's view on that and potential impacts?,"Good morning, Steve. This is Tom. There is a comprehensive piece of legislation that has been developed by a variety of leaders in the General Assembly, both in the Senate and the House that deals with lots of issues in the state energy policy. It's moving through. Virginia moves legislation through in a very rapid pace, normally, and I don't think this will be an exception. They have to adjourn by the end of the ﬁrst week in March. So, we are working with a variety of stakeholders on it. We think there are some very good things in it, there are some things that we'll have to accommodate ourselves to. But overall, we think it's constructive piece of legislation for our state and our customers.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning guys. I was wondering if maybe you could just discuss some of the opportunities that you see from the legislation for both investors and customers. I know in the past we've talked about (inaudible) and Riders, and some other possible beneﬁts.","I don't -- I think it's premature to talk about it. We've still lots of work to be done on it. Maybe a little bit later when we see the ﬁnal product, you know, committee hearings will be coming up in the next couple of weeks and we'll see how it goes from here. We'll be in a position to talk about it, I think, more thoroughly on the next call.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay. And on Dominion Midstream, you know in the past you use to talk about the 7 billion to 8 billion of cash from 2016 to 2020. Is there any update for that as well post tax reform?","No update on that, Michael. We still expect that cash to come back to Dominion and that is the one of the main levers we're going to have to delever the parent, that story has been consistent in terms of the drop of Cove Point into Dominion Midstream and the beneﬁt back to Dominion shareholders since day one and we fully expect to execute on that beginning in this year."
"And just one last question, on -- in New England, can you talk about whether you plan to bid in the forward capacity auction at Millstone or is that dependent on the outcome on February 1st of the start of the year review?","Go ahead, Paul.     Michael, this is Paul Koonce. So, we are not prepared to discuss what we're going to bid. I mean, that's obviously competitively sensitive. So, we are working very well with both DEEP and PURA to kind of get through that process. They're going to issue their ﬁnal report, as Tom said, later this week. That will, we believe, lead to an RFP being issued in the May time frame. And so we'll be working with DEEP and PURA between the ﬁnal report in May to understand the structure of a bid and then we will submit our bid as any others.  Operator  Thank you for your question. The next question will come Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Group. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. So my question is, okay, so the $1 billion reduction in your CapEx doesn't impact your growth CapEx, so what is this? Is this maintenance CapEx that is getting reduced?","Hi, Angie, this is Mark. It's going to be a number of things. The largest component of that $1 billion is associated with an announcement we've made recently to go ahead and put nine of our generating facilities in Virginia into coal storage based on current market economics. The timing of that over the next 12 months or so would require a lot of maintenance at all those units   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   and that will be a lower portion of the reduction. But there will also be reductions in other non- core maintenance activities over the next couple of years to come up with the $1 billion over the two-year period, but we have very good line of sight on that."
"Okay. Second question on the credit negative outlook -- credit outlook and okay, so the negative outlook was issued in January, and if I understand it correctly, the credit agencies were already aware of the equity ﬁnancing and the lower CapEx that you are proposing? Does it mean that you need to step-up some of the credit improvement initiatives i.e., do I need to account for more equity come in '19 and '20?","Angie, when we shared with the agencies our plans over the next three years, it was associated with the SCANA transaction. We had not adjusted for the equity that we've talked about today or the $1 billion adjustment. They were not advised of that until very recently and that was a decision that we made internally here to make sure that we are focused on the metrics and they know we're focused on the metrics and are making quick headway to improve that based on the tax reform impact. So, they weren't in their original numbers and we think this is a big step forward as we go ahead and complete the SCANA transaction.  Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Just wanted to check in on the overall goals in terms of leverage, you've given a lot of helpful commentary this morning on targeted credit metrics. But just -- you'd mentioned in the past, the desire to reduce the holdco debt as a percentage of total debt moving from 50% down to a lower level by the end of the decade, I believe 30% to 40%. Is that still we should be thinking in terms of how you think about your total holdco leverage?","Yes, sure, that's the same range. We may get there a little quicker with some of the changes that we talk about today, but that is the range that we're targeting by 2020, 30% to 40% at the holdco as a percentage of total family debt.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay. Great. And then shifting, this is I know a little broader and oﬀ the beaten path, but I couldn't help notice the Amazon shortlist locations, three of them are in or near your territories. Have you all thought through what might be required in terms of infrastructure if one of those selections took place. Is this something that could be material in terms of infrastructure or is it more likely you can probably utilize the existing infrastructure that you have?","Well, there is talking about a lot of jobs and lot of -- that means a lot of homes and residences and businesses, a spin-oﬀ of that, 50,000 jobs over a decade I think. And obviously, depending upon where it is, they want mass transportation. You're referring, I'm sure -- what you're referring to I think obviously is the District of Columbia, Suburban Maryland and Suburban Virginia were all -- Suburbs of Washington were all included on that shortlist. There will be a lot to deal with over a decade and we're hopeful that they see the wisdom of coming to the right state.  Operator  Thank you. This does conclude this morning's conference call.
