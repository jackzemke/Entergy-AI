Question,Answer
"Hey. So, perhaps, ﬁrst quick question, can you elaborate just a little bit on the Millstone hedging plan from here on out? I just want to make sure if I heard you right; 80% from 8% largely today by early 2017. Is that sort of irrespective of the commodity environment? And perhaps, more importantly, how are you thinking about hedging future years, 2018, 2019 at this point?","Julien, it's Mark. The answer to the ﬁrst part of your question is it's regardless of what the market power price will be between now and the end of January. We committed over many years to investors and the credit agencies that there'll be a clear ﬁrm cash ﬂow stream from Millstone as we put guidance out in the current period. So we've always hedged Millstone in the 80%-plus range by the end of the year call, and we plan on doing the same for 2017.  In terms of future periods, we will be very cautious on hedging Millstone for a number of reasons. One is we believe that the current forward strip is dramatically understating the value of the market. And second, as you know, there is a lot of discussion in Connecticut about potential legislation and the ability to Millstone bid into future auctions. We hope that would be cleared up in the ﬁrst half of next year, and we would want to see what the outcome of that would be before we hedge 2018 and beyond."
"Got it. Excellent. Just to follow up real quickly – obviously, well done on closing Questar. Just what's the status in terms of future growth opportunities? Can you elaborate just real quickly in terms of where you stand on some of the initial thoughts you'd originally delineated with that transaction?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Julien, the more we look, the more opportunities we see. The West – that part of the West is largely powered by coal-ﬁred power plants. Many of them are going to have to close or be converted to natural gas. There's an increasing amount of RPS requirements in states on – particularly on the Western Sea Coast where, as you know, and I think investors know, the more renewables that are built, the more gas-ﬁred peakers are going to be required to deal with the fact that it's intermittent.  So, that's just one potential opportunity that we see in the West. There's a lot of natural gas infrastructure that's going to be required in the future there. Now, it's not on the same scale obviously as the Mid-Atlantic as far as population goes. But starting from the base that we have in the West, we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity."
"Okay. Excellent. Thank you, guys.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come...","Nothing more after six weeks of ownership, no.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Arnold, please make sure your phone is not on mute, sir. The next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead."
"Congratulations on the equity oﬀerings today, especially on the preferred, which eﬀectively look like the same cost of equity as the common when factoring in the IDRs. Given your ability to access far more equity than the majority of your MLP peers out there, I'm just wondering if you   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   can provide us any updated thoughts as far as what you think about opportunistic M&A out there given your ability to access so much equity on attractive terms today.","Jeremy, this is Mark. We were very pleased – although we were always conﬁdent, as we've stated to investors over the past nine months, based on what we've heard from investors that lack (24:39) liquidity in the DM stock. We knew there'd be a lot of interest. We've been particularly pleased with the convert and interest shown in that by multiple parties, and the very aggressive ﬁnancing around that. So, I think that just reinforces our view that if we see an asset out there that ﬁts the DM proﬁle that we can fund it within the DM umbrella if we need to, or with D parent support if required. But I think today's results just validate for us that the DM shares are highly valued and will be a great source of future equity ﬁnancing if we decide to enter the M&A stage (25:20) at all."
"That makes sense. And then, just one follow-up if I could. There's been some concern in the market with regards to recent developments from the IRS, and just wondering if you might be able to comment there, maybe this alters one mechanism that you guys were looking at for dropdowns, but it seems like your targets over time would be largely unchanged. Is that a fair way to think about things?","Yes. Our targets will be unchanged, and I think your reference is that the IRS after this calendar year do not allow certain tax shields that existed prior to that – that MLPs can make themselves available to. But we have a long-term tax planning for each of the years through 2020. We were aware of that potential down the road, and it will not impact either our growth rate or distribution focus going forward. That has been incorporated into our tax planning for quite some time."
"Yeah. Hi. Mark, just on – you mentioned this solar that you booked in the quarter, but then some of it will come out in Q4. Could you just explain that a little better?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Sure, Steve. This solar involves partnership income from one project, Four Brothers in Utah, and it's complicated partnership accounting. When we put the guidance out – actually, when we put the budget together this year, we thought the contribution will be evenly distributed over a number of quarters, but the ﬁnal accounting determination required us to book $0.04 in the third quarter and that will roll oﬀ $0.02 in the fourth quarter and $0.02 in the ﬁrst half of next year. So that's a timing issue for the quarter, but for year-end, there's no impact on our guidance at all."
"Okay. And then, can I just have handy the number for the full year of what you're expecting for earnings to be for 2016?","And I believe – in terms of ITCs, I think we're looking about $290 million."
"Hi. Can you provide an update on the outlook for the ITC realization in 2017? I think on the last quarter call, you indicated potential for up to $0.30 of ITCs next year.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Yes, Rose-Lynn. I would continue to model $0.30 for next year."
"Okay. And are those from identiﬁed projects at this point or still to be announced, still to be determined?",Almost all of them are identiﬁed. We have a few others that we're still working on. But I would say we're very far down the road in terms of identifying what supports the ITC estimate for 2017.
"Thank you. So, I just want to go back to the 2017 guidance. So, what do we need as far as developments to happen for you to be able to provide 2017 guidance? Are we waiting for some legislative actions in Connecticut? Are we waiting for the start of commercial testing at Cove Point, or are we simply waiting for the annual Analyst Day around, say, February, March timeframe?","Angie, for 2017, we almost always give guidance on the year-end call, which is typically at the very end of January, beginning of February. The only thing we're really waiting on for 2017 is what will the actual hedge price be at Millstone. And since we're pretty open at Millstone right now, we hesitate giving any guidance range for 2017 until we're much further down the road on hedging."
"Okay. And now, the dropdown today to DM, clearly very successful, but is it coming a bit early in a sense – I understand that the funds that you're raising from DM are aimed to de-lever the balance sheet, but are you, in a sense, trying to manage your interest expense for 2017 by accelerating this DM dropdown, or is it simply an opportunistic timing?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","It's more of the latter. We really believe we have overhang on both these stocks based on an anticipated oﬀering at DM. We also, I think – as I mentioned earlier, people have been waiting for us to validate the structure of D and DM and those advantages and really answer the question, can you access the equity market at DM at a very high level that beneﬁts both DM and D. So, based on that, we elected to go early. We didn't have to do it until the third quarter of next year, but we wanted to get it behind us. It does help us on ﬁnancing a little bit at D next year, but the principal reason was to validate the model and to show the investor base that DM is a security that is sought after and has huge beneﬁts to DM and D shareholders."
"And then, the last question on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. So, with the start of construction in, I think you said, second half of 2017, are we basically assuming that you're booking AFUDC from the moment you start construction, and so the impact on earnings of the delay of the start of operations (32:53) simply because you're booking AFUDC earning during construction?","I think that's right, Angie. I think that's why you ought to have it in your – in mind."
"The ﬁrst question – hi. Good afternoon. First question was on – you've kind of indicated the $7 billion to $8 billion of cash that you expect Dominion to generate from the MLP through 2020. Just wanted to understand what kind of ﬁnancing mix you're thinking about at the MLP to kind of fund the growth and kind of pay back Dominion. And secondly, in terms of future ownership, how do you see that ownership level of Dominion stay over this timeframe through 2020?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Praful, this is Mark. I think you're going to see it, and today's examples are a good one. You're going to see the ﬁnancing will be a combination of preferred common units and debt by adding leverage at DM; although, we said many times that we're going to make sure it's investment-grade rated when we decide to rate it, but it'll be a mix of the three. We'll also potentially take back some units as part of that for tax planning purposes.  But again, with the ability today and the market we have today to raise over $1 billion for the ﬁrst transaction out there, and as the size of DM grows over the next couple of years, we're very optimistic about being able to place the ﬁnancing.  In terms of ownership, I think you could – should assume that for the next several years our ownership is going to stay in the 50% range, and then over time, toward the end of the decade, start to move down more into the 40% range."
"Got you. Thank you. And then originally, you were talking about Millstone, and just nuclear in general, you were talking about – thinking about hedging depending on the support you get. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on what you expect in terms of the kind of support, is it similar to a New York ZEC kind of program or what you expect and where in the regulatory approval process it stands right now?","Let's go back to – the hedging will happen, as Mark said, regardless of what the price is. We've done that for a long time and we will continue to do it into the future. So everybody knows what expectations we should have for earnings and cash ﬂows.  As far as the Connecticut, the New York example, as I understand New York, is a – basically a tax payer subsidization of two facilities in the northern part of New York without any support going to the Indian Point reactors outside New York City. That's how I understand it. Just from recent trade press, I see similar moves are being followed into Illinois, for example.  Connecticut has gone about it in a diﬀerent way. They have a RPS standard there and an auction has been established for some years where the LSEs bid – take their – meet their RPS requirements by auctions from renewable suppliers into that RPS auction on an annual basis. The contemplation by the legislature, not the regulators, in Connecticut is to expand that to a clean power standard that would include nuclear which would allow up to approximately 50% of Millstone to be included in that auction. That at this point obviously is still in contemplation by the legislature. There is some momentum behind it. We're following it very closely, but it won't aﬀect 2017. It would aﬀect 2018 and beyond."
"Sorry about that. Hi. Congratulations on getting the ﬁnancing done. What kind of an assumption are you making on the $7 billion to $8 billion cash projection going forward? Considering the price that was received, I guess, for $23.20 for the LP units, and can we assume that it's going to still be a 10 to 11 (37:43) dropdown based on $7 billion to $8 billion?","We can't answer that question today. We'll have to see what the market bears and what the conﬂicts committee is comfortable with. It's a long period of time, but I will say that the remaining dropdowns this decade are principally around the Cove Point export facility which we place a very high value on. So we'll see. We said two years ago if we were to model it, we'd model 11 times. So, this transaction went at 10.3. I think anything between 10 and 11 would be a very realistic data point, but we'll have to see what asset drops and what the market will bear at that time."
When do the converts – when do the preferred converts convert over?,"That's a complicated question. We have certain conversion rights here at Dominion and then there's other conversion rights by the owners. I'll be glad to answer that after the call for you, but it's probably too complex to go into on the call."
