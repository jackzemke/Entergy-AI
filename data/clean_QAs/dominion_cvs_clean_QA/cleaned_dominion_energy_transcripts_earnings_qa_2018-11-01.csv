Question,Answer
"Got it. Okay. So it's incremental. Okay. Great. And then just real quick on ACP, we got the delay. We've got the higher cost estimate right? So can you elaborate a little bit further on how we should think about the impact to the project's returns versus your original estimate? Or does tax reform mitigate any return pressures versus what your original assumptions were?  And then just real quick around the delays. I mean it seems like you are hedging yourself a little bit around potential for further delays. Can you just hit on a little of contingencies you have in place to mitigate any further delays? I mean do you feel better about this updated in-service date?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","I'll answer the question on the return Shahriar and Diane Leopold will talk about the hedging as you referred to it. Through this process -- we've already been through one process with customers on the rates and we'll continue to work with them. The returns are going to be very adequate and commensurate with the normal returns we get on projects like this in our Midstream business. Now, I'll turn it over to Diane.     Okay. Good morning. This is Diane Leopold. What I would say is, ﬁrst, when we updated the cost estimates in light of the delay and the stop work order, we also updated all cost estimates for aspects of -- all aspects of our construction plan, including seasonality and when we're going to be building each of the spreads and related productivity factors. We believe those are very reasonable for the plan that we have in place. And then, we did add appropriate contingency levels to cover a range of risks that are typical for a project at this phase."
"Got it. Okay. Thanks. Jim, congrats on your ﬁrst earnings call. Thanks, guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
"Okay. Great. And then, Jim, you mentioned the business mix improvement. Is that so -- obviously, we can see that. Is it possible you also get some kind of business risk rejiggering from the agencies, or from these changes or is that not likely?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","I think that's possible. We certainly see it that way, it's the reason we have done it in this manner. It's a little bit early to comment as we haven't really held those discussions yet with the agencies, but that will be a fair argument to make in my view."
"Okay. And then, maybe one last question for Tom, just on the SCANA deal. I think you said you remain very optimistic on getting it done. It's obviously very noisy down there, and it's hard to -- when you are watching it from the newspapers to necessarily be that strong on it. So could you maybe just give a little more rationale, why you're very optimistic on getting it done?","Sure, Steve. It is noisy. There's lots of things going on, lots of moving parts, but we've been working on all those moving parts now for 10 months. We're very familiar with the folks that we're dealing with and what their interest are and needs are. And in the end of the day, the Dominion oﬀer or two oﬀers now, our original oﬀer which is very popular with customers by the way and the alternative oﬀer which is popular with other kinds of customers, are by far and away -- it's not even close, the best alternative for SCANA in the State of South Carolina. And we were conﬁdent that the policymakers will come to that conclusion. We saw that last week or earlier I guess this week with the letter from Speaker Lucas, for example, recognizing that among all the alternatives, this was the best."
"There is no mention in the oﬃcial slide deck or the release on dividend policy, so can you just restate where you are on the dividend policy please?",No change to our dividend policy.
"So, 10% growth for '19?","Yes. But obviously it's up to the Board -- it's up to the Board, but that's the expectation, yes."
Okay. Thank you very much. That was my only question. Take care.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey. So, just wanted to follow up a little bit on the credit question still. Can you elaborate a little bit on the use of proceeds here? Just -- Blue Racer, obviously, very well done on the magnitude   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   of proceeds there. But just in thinking about the near-term and practically what you're doing?","Yeah. So for the Blue Racer sale proceeds and the generation sale process, are expected this quarter. So we will take that and use it to repay parent level debt as mentioned. And we have array of debt in parent company, some of which is prepayable, some of which is commercial paper, which is kind of shock absorber based on timing of their fees [ph] , et cetera. So we have identiﬁed ways to use that cash this quarter to pay down parent level debt. What I would say is, I wouldn't expect some big bang liability management exercise with tenders and the like. It's going to be managed on a more subtle basis with our existing securities which are prepayable, et cetera."
"And maybe to clarify that just, obviously, it's a very good multiples here. I mean net-net, how do see it in terms of accretion/dilution on an earnings basis relative to the liability management?","Given the sales price -- prices achieved and given the reduction in interest from the debt pay down and given the likely receipt of earn out proceeds on the Blue Racer side, we are very comfortable that that impact is modest and in line with our 6% to 8% growth proﬁle through 2020."
"Got it. Excellent. And then, just a quick clariﬁcation and last one on SCANA. Just with respect to the deal and obviously, the court case pending, I mean how do see that court case, if there is a pathway to that court case and the ability to close the transaction given any range of outcomes?","Well, one of the conditions we have to close is, there is no change in law, that court case would change the law as we -- as it existed when we made the decision transaction. But no order has been entered. Lots of rumors running around South Carolina and I just wouldn't believe everything. One reads in the newspaper about every single thing everybody is saying. We're going to continue to work with all the parties, including that we have the lawsuit, we're not a party of lawsuit. But obviously interested in the outcome of that lawsuit, as well as what's going on at the Public Service Commission. So all of these things have to be resolved without aﬀecting ﬁnancial parameters that we entered into -- the original ﬁnancial parameters we entered into with SCANA in January or we won't close. I'm optimistic that that will all work -- we will work our way through all of it and we will close by the end of the year."
"All right. Excellent. Congrats again, Jim.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
"So quickly just following up on SCANA, I wanted to understand what prompted the new proposal? Was there some feedback you received that suggested this would go better? And is there a room for another proposal or this is it, at this point this is what's on the table and you're expecting one of these to go through?","We have been in dialogue with people, variety of customers, customer classes, policymakers, all gamuts, for literally last 10 months. And it became apparent to us that there was a signiﬁcant interest by many in moving the refund into more of a non-going rate reduction. So we've worked through that and came up with the proposal that you saw us put forward I guess this last week. Things are all sort of running together, but I guess it was last week we put that proposal up. But that's all. There is two proposals, either one we're comfortable with. We don't expect any changes to either one of them."
"Got you. Fair enough. And then, secondly, in terms of Blue Racer, the 300 million earn out, Jim, is that expected to show up in operating earning or is that going to be removed more as one- time?",The 300 most likely in operating earnings.
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   I got you. And them, ﬁnally, just on ACP, if you have -- that you kind of highlighted the point that you want to hit the late-2019 timeframe to meet the critical winter period. If you don't hit that timeframe, is there any implications from an earnings or any penalties' perspective?",No. I wouldn't expect any change in earnings. The construction plan and costs are going to be similar regardless given the AFUDC that we have when we get into service.
