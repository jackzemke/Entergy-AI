Question,Answer
"Just going to ask, can you provide a little more of an update on the conversations you're having around Questar pipe sales process, such as what parties you're talking to and balancing the considerations there? Any additional color you're willing to provide will be appreciated.","Yes, sure, Paul. Thanks for joining. Good question. You'll probably appreciate that we need to exercise a little bit of discretion as we're in the middle of process. So more information will come over time. But really high level, we, of course, laid the groundwork for this process with a bunch of preparation prior to the termination of the prior deal. So we're in a pretty good spot.  We are -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're in the relatively advanced stage of that process, of an auction process. We have, for example, received ﬁrst round bids. I can say that the participation and the interest level is certainly robust. We have a really good number of highly credible strategic and ﬁnancial participants there. And beyond that, I'm sorry to say more information will come.  We'll provide updates when we can. But it's very much on track. We're satisﬁed with the progress. And we, as mentioned, expect that transaction to close late this year. But again, no impact one way or the other on our ﬁnancial guidance of operating earnings for the year."
"Okay. Also, I wanted to check, given the relatively unique geographic footprint you have being in Virginia, could you discuss some potential opportunities you're focused on from the draft   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   infrastructure bill, threats around some of the support for advanced clean technologies, renewables procurement, things like that? Thank you.","Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think it would come as no surprise, we're philosophically very much aligned with the intent of the package. We are focused on rural broadband, EV charging, grid reliability and resiliency. These are all items that are in that package that we're -- we think, make a lot of sense. So we'll obviously be watching as it makes its way through the process, pay attention to how the details get work out -- worked out for appropriations if the bill passes.  A couple of speciﬁcs. We're very much in favor of support for R&D on clean technologies like hydrogen, small modular reactors. Those are things that we're focused on. And to the extent that there's broad-based support that allow a commercialization in a way that can be quick and customer beneﬁcial, we think that's very important and certainly something that we support.  And obviously, clean energy manufacturing tax credits, which can help enable U.S. renewable supply, particularly oﬀshore wind and solar, we think, are really valuable. So we're very much engaged in Washington and participating in the process. We like the direction that it's going. Details yet to come, but we think there are some real possibilities there."
"First question I just have is on the Trane triannual review in Virginia. I know you have intervenor and staﬀ testimony due next month. But can you maybe just better frame out some expectations heading into that? And also understanding that downside risk is limited in this case just by law, but could you also touch on or remind us some of the tools for the T2 review?","Yes, sure. Thanks, David. So on triannual one, look, it's a rate proceeding. And we would expect, as in any rate proceeding, that there's going to be a wide variety of approaches and positions taken by the parties. We'll obviously know more, as you said in the question, early September we'll hear from interveners.  And then a couple of weeks later, we'll hear from the staﬀ. So we'll get a sense then, but it's a rate case covering a 4-year period and then setting rates going forward with the guardrail you mentioned. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see a pretty wide variety of opinions expressed by the parties.  But if you take a step back and just think about the bigger picture here in that case, we have rates below national regional averages. Our performance of our utility is outstanding on the generation and the wire side. And we're reducing our emissions and improving -- reducing our impact on the environment. And so that's a pretty good place to be in a rate case. So we feel very good about that.  As to T2, that's obviously -- we're only a few months into the period that is going to be reviewed for T2. So a lot of details yet to go on the second triennial. But the tools that are in the toolbox, like the customer credit reinvestment oﬀset will be available to us in triennial two.  And then as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, and as we've noted for some time, as we move forward in this plan, the portion of our earnings that come from Virginia base as opposed to the rest of the business and, in Virginia, in particular, the riders, decreases as a percentage of the overall amount. So I think those are important considerations to keep in mind. Obviously, a long ways to go between now and triennial 2. But we've got tools in the toolbox and the percentage of our earnings aﬀected by triennial 2 as compared to the rest of the company will continue to decrease."
"Great. And then maybe just one more. I know you have another ﬁling pending before the Corporation Commission for capital related to the great transformation plan. I think last time in your Phase 1 plan, there were some disallowances for some of the grid-mod related spend. But just could you give us a sense of how you're feeling about your proposal this time around? And has kind of anything changed?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So we're feeling very good about our proposal this time around. So last time, bear in mind, I think about $200 million of capital got approved in the ﬁling last time, but some things have changed since that last ﬁling.  The most signiﬁcant one is that the Virginia Clean Economy Act has passed, and we now have an obligation to seek approval for a substantial amount of renewables over the course of the next 1.5 decades , oﬀshore wind, storage, all of that. And we're going to need to modify the grid in order to make sure that we keep operating in that environment. And that's what we told the commission in that ﬁling. Things like distributed energy resource management system will be incredibly important in this new world that we're moving into.  So the Clean Economy Act is diﬀerent. That didn't exist when we ﬁled last time. Obviously, we also have the beneﬁt of what we heard from the commission and the order on the last ﬁling, and we can target and we have targeted what we're doing with this most recent ﬁling based on precisely what they told us last time. And then some of this ﬁling is continuation of programs that they did approve last time.  As I mentioned, they approved $200 million of capital in the last ﬁling. So all of those factors lead us to believe that we should have a lot of conﬁdence in that ﬁling. We'll hear, as I said in the opening, around the end of this year, but it's a strong ﬁling. It's important for us as we integrate additional renewables to make sure that we operate the system well."
"Just wanted to start oﬀ with RNG. I know you guys touched on that a bit in the slides here, but I just wanted to see if you can outline the expanded Vanguard alliance a bit more and the factors that went behind this expansion. How does this ﬁt within your overall R&D strategy, I guess, going forward?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. Sure. Good morning, Jeremy. Diane Leopold here. So as Bob outlined in his prepared remarks, we really see RNG as a great way to intersect the essential gas service that we provide in reliable and aﬀordable means to our customers in all of our states with our local gas distribution companies and enhanced sustainability.  So while this is a very early phase of development with renewable natural gas that we have been on the path on for the last several years, we decided in our investments to focus on agricultural RNG, so our swine and our dairy partnerships. And the reason we did that is because we believe that was the most carbon-negative, carbon-beneﬁcial means to capture methane and repurpose that waste stream for a more environmentally friendly use.  So when it comes to the actual investment side of it, we now already have between, both partnerships, one project in service, which happens to be a swine project; and ﬁve projects under construction; and several more under construction by year-end.  So as we were looking at our Vanguard partnership, we were really moving forward with development of a lot of prospects at a good rate, and we saw enough interest in the demand for this renewable natural gas, multiyear contracts with customers that are interested in ensuring a source of supply for their sustainability targets.  So we're really looking to develop these projects in the short to medium term for these customers. It could be the transportation market. It could be other local distribution companies. It could be thermal industrial users. And then long term, look to our regulated gas customers to help them lower their carbon footprint.  So we're working with stakeholders and regulators and policymakers towards that goal. And the green therm programs in Utah, and we've already asked for in North Carolina, is just one step in that path to try to move the renewable natural gas towards our regulated customers."
"Got it. That's helpful. And maybe I just want to come back to Questar for a moment, if I could. I know you can't comment too much on the sales process here. But just wanted to hear your thoughts the overall environment to sell an asset now. I think oil was approaching negative 37 when you were ﬁrst marketing it. Now it's about 70. Just wondering any thoughts you could share about the environment to sell a midstream asset now.","All right, Jeremy. I'm taking notes during your question. I'm going to distribute that to our bidder universe like where we're going. Well, look, the environment is pretty strong.  As you know, in the last year, equities are up, midstream phase, commodities way up, as you mentioned, Equities are up in part because for true midstream companies, growth is up, so all good. The macro environment is good.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   I would mention, just to moderate that a little bit, that Questar pipeline, this asset, as you know, it's awesome. It's an awesome asset. It is, though, a utility like. That's the way we always operated it, what it is now. It earns money through long-term contracts for its capacity. So it's not really as much as a rocket ship up or down as maybe the overall midstream true midstream market. That said though, we're pretty happy with where we're going, robust interest, as mentioned, and we'll come back and give updates as soon as we can."
