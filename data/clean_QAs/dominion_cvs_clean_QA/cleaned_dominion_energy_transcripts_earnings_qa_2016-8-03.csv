Question,Answer
"So, perhaps just to follow up here on 2017, can you elaborate a little bit on where you stand? Obviously, a little bit preempting guidance here later this year, but where do you stand relative to Millstone and hedging? And provide a little bit more thought on timing for hedging, given where the commodity markets has been this year?","Hey, Julien, this is Mark. As you can see from our hedge schedules, we didn't hedge anything in the second quarter of this year and we actually don't expect to hedge much in the third quarter of this year either. Our view is that the oversupply that occur because of a very mild winter and a very high production cycle over the last year or so is normalizing. And we think with a warm summer this year, going into the fall, that storage will be full early, and we will see more bullish price signals in the Northeast, as we go into the winter period.  That being said, we've referenced a number of times that as we go into a calendar year, and certainly by the call at the end of January or early February, we would expect Millstone to be hedged between 80% and 90%, which it always has been. But our hedge view is that we are going to wait till later this year to place more hedges on that facility."
"Got it. And therefore holding oﬀ on providing anymore formal commentary on 2017, right?","That's right. I mean, we always give guidance for the calendar year typically in January, and that's still our view for 2017. But there's no question that the Millstone revenue stream is driven   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   by power prices, are a big driver to 2017, one way or the other, and we want to get a very clear view on that before we give our annual guidance for 2017."
"And also to clarify, I know you're trying to time things for hedges on 2017. Just, and going forward, what are your expectations for your hedging policy? Anything beyond kind of year-one hedge in January?","Well, we typically over the years have averaged hedges over a three-year period pretty routinely. But we changed that about a year or so ago when we saw this very steep, very quick decline in power prices, which we do not think is sustainable.  Obviously too, Julien, and you watch this closely that there's a lot of legislative activity occurring in the Northeast that could well impact nuclear and power prices in general. We want to see, if we can get a little more clarity on some of those activities. So, we will be market-sensitive to this. But unless the forward curves move, we're not going to be in a hurry to hedge right away beyond 2017."
"Got it. And then just following up on a separate subject here, on ITCs, can you clarify a little bit, where do you stand on 2017 relative to plan? I know you guys talked about $0.10 to $0.15. You've announced a few projects thus far I think for next year in VEPCO. And can you also clarify which projects qualify for the ITCs and which ones don't under VEPCO? And then maybe just a further detail what's the total for 2016, just to get it out there, between VEPCO and (22:38)?","Okay, there's like eight questions here, Julien, I think, but I'll be glad to answer all of them. Let's start with this year's ITCs, based on projects that have been announced. And we talked about this on previous calls, the projects in Utah, which are very large projects, will produce between $0.30 and $0.35 of earnings from ITCs. And that range is really based on whatever the actual capital cost might be at the end, so that's a good planning range. In addition, we have one other project that we anticipate ITCs on this year in Virginia. It's an Eastern Shore project contracted with Amazon, and we would expect ITCs in a range of probably $0.06 to $0.08 from that project. So that makes up 2016.  2017, I mentioned, if I recall on the January call, that for planning purposes, we had anticipated between $0.10 and $0.15 of ITCs in 2017 based on the activity that we knew of at that time. Since the ﬁrst of the year, we've seen a tremendous amount of interest from a number of parties in Virginia, state government, military facilities, data centers and others, to step up the generation solar build in Virginia.  And I would expect that that number for 2017 could easily double from that $0.10 to $0.15, and be in the $0.30 range, based on the activity we know of today. Now, we have not announced all   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   the projects for 2017. But again, based on the pipeline of interest and the folks that we are discussing projects with, I would expect, again, ITCs in 2017 probably now to range in the $0.30 range."
I wanted to discuss the power demand growth outlook in Virginia. Just wondered if you could give us your latest thinking. We've heard from you before in terms of your overall take. Just curious what you're seeing lately in terms of the outlook for power demand growth?,"Stephen, this is Mark. Our view, as we've stated in the past, currently is about a 1% power demand growth rate to stay. If you look at the ﬁrst half of this year, it's been less than that. It's actually slightly down to the previous period. But the mix is pretty interesting. For example, in the second quarter, although sales were down about 1% over a similar period last year, revenues were actually right at budget at about 1% higher. And that's because residential sales were very strong in the quarter.  So, we still believe that 1% sales growth over the next couple of years is certainly in the realm of possibility and that's in our planning data. We would like to see stronger commercial sales growth outside of data centers. And we think that will again be driven by spending from the government, where it was curtailed during the sequestration and is starting to come back, but it's been slow. So we, again, believe that 1% growth is achievable and a realistic goal as we go forward."
Understood. And weather adjusted for the quarter. How did it turn out in terms of maybe for residential and commercial in particular?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),"For the second quarter, weather normalized, residential sales were up 1.5%. Data centers were up almost 21%. Commercial customers, excluding the data centers, were down about 3%, and industrial customers were down about 9%. And that's a very large percentage of industrials, as you know, industrials make up a very small portion of our revenue streams. But they were down pretty strongly for the quarter."
"So, when you talk about the demand for solar in Virginia, I mean, as I am thinking about the diﬀerent business units, VEPCO gas operations, merchant power, should we assume that that – where will those projects reside? Will they reside at VEPCO or would they reside at another operating company?","Greg, it's likely to be a mix of both, depending upon who the customer is and what their interest is. If you – rather, we can get into a discussion of tax normalization if you'd like, but I think it might mind-numb everybody."
"Well, that's fortuitous, because obviously with uncertainty around where the Millstone revenues are going to be, that could be a good substitute if power prices don't recover. Is that fair?","I'll just say there's a lot of solar opportunity for us. So a lot of tax credit availability, to the extent we have an appetite for, next year."
"Great. And when do you think we'll have some clarity around the timing of the ﬁnancing plan for Questar? It doesn't sound like you're looking at any signiﬁcant roadblocks to closing by year-end. Should we presume that the timing of the converts come around the time of close? Or will you be more opportunistic, like, for instance, NextEra, which is pre-funding the Oncor deal even though they're in a (30:20)?","Greg, this is Mark. We will be opportunistic on this. We have some Dominion debt to issue still and we have some converts issue still. And we will be utilizing the market for that here over the next several months. But there's a lot of interest in both, from what we hear from bondholders and investors, and we'll go to the market when we think the timing is right. We won't wait till it's much closer to Questar, if we think we can go earlier."
"Great. And my last question is, as of sort of your last investor presentation, the May deck, you're still pointing to a consistent earnings and dividend growth proﬁle as outlined in your Analyst Day from a year-ago February. At what point, once we get through the rest of the year, see the   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Millstone hedges, get more visibility on solar, close Questar, are you going to be in a position to give us a fulsome update on the outlook?","I think, Greg, it will come after we give 2017 guidance in January. We probably look to do that sometime early in 2017. We have two (31:48) make sure we're very comfortable with in. The ﬁrst one is Cove Point, which is scheduled for late 2017. And obviously, that is a huge driver for us, 2018 and beyond. Project is going very well, but we'd like to get a little more construction done there.  And then we also want to see that the forward curves move much based on, as we go into this winter, is 2017 going to move or is the whole curve going to move. So, again, timing wise, I'd look for ﬁrst half of 2017 for a more detailed outlook."
"Thank you. I actually wanted to follow up on that question. So, does it mean that when you guys provide your 2017 guidance, you're not going to give us an outlook for 2018 and beyond at the same time?","Angie, it's Mark. I don't right now anticipate unless the forward curves move signiﬁcantly and we have hedged Millstone, that we will give any new update on 2018 and beyond when we give 2017 guidance in January."
"Okay. And now, given what just happened in New York with the support for the upstate New York nuclear plant, do you feel like there's going to be a similar move potentially impacting Millstone?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   The Connecticut legislature, Angie, as you know, the Senate unanimously passed piece of legislation that is supported by, Governor Malloy, and it came very late in the session, so the house didn't get to it. It's expected to come back in the session when they reconvene in the early part of 2017. It's a little bit diﬀerent. New York is, as I understand, the New York (33:51) straight subsidy to the upstate New York nuclear facilities.  Connecticut has taken a diﬀerent approach which is to allow carbon-free production to bid into what has been set aside just for renewables for the local utilities. So, I think a very innovative approach and one that Millstone would participate in. And I think the last version of the legislation had up to half of Millstone would be eligible to participate, which would be a good anchor for that plant. So, yes, we expect to see more activity as we get into next year, when the legislatures come back to work."
But it has no bearing on the hedging of the plants?,"Well, I think as Mark said, before we talk about 2018, before we look at 2018's hedges, we'll look at the forward curves, we will also see (34:58) legislation is, because we want to be able to participate in the auction, if Millstone becomes eligible."
"Okay. And the last question, would you consider potentially selling the plant to an operator with a larger ﬂeet of nuclear plant?","Angie, I think we've always – we said we'll consider selling most any asset, but I think that is highly unlikely in this situation. Millstone provides half of Connecticut's power. Connecticut has exactly zero chance of meeting its carbon goals if something were to take Millstone out of the energy mix in that state. It's a very good plant and it's got some economic challenges at the moment, but we're not anticipating any consideration of selling it."
"Good morning, Tom. One other clarity on the ﬁnancing of Questar. So, the remaining ﬁnancing was going to be converts and still DM dropdown. So, do you still plan to do some drops into DM later this year related to that?","Hey, Steve, this is Mark. Yeah, the remaining – there's just a debt piece remaining as well. But what we said was we had about $2.4 billion of ﬁnancing, which we plan to split between mandatory convertibles at Dominion and equity and other sources at DM. But as part of our bridge ﬁnancing, we've taken out a term loan or will, I should say, take out a term loan, eﬀective for 12 months at very attractive rates to us at close.  So, it gives us a lot of ﬂexibility at DM on when we drop those assets into DM, we don't need to drop the assets to support our distribution growth rate until latter part of 2017. So, we will be very opportunistic on DM and when we do that and we may well utilize the term loan for a period of time to bridge the ﬁnancing."
"Okay. I guess my other question, just too kind of ﬁll in the discussion more on new solar, what would be – because obviously it'd be helpful to get the ITCs, and the other part of it is though you do have – you would have a lot more capital need, I assume. So could you give a sense to get to the $0.30 or double this, like how much more capital spend might that require?","I don't have that number readily available, Steve. I will follow up with you on it though."
"Just going back to Millstone, you've made it very clear that you have a particular point of view on where the forward curves could go. If we wanted to simply assume where the forward curves are at right now, then relative to the assumptions that are embedded in guidance, can you give us a sense of how diﬀerent the guidance might be, just help us calibrate where things stand at the moment?","Well, we haven't given, Brian, speciﬁc guidance for 2017 yet. The only thing we've done is we gave directional opportunities in February or March of 2015, where we showed a potential growth rate long-term. What I would do if I was modeling this, I would go back to the end of 2014, see what the NEPOOL market price was then for 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and reference that to what the current strip is, if you wanted to see a range of potential impacts for that one asset alone.  So, now again, that doesn't take into consideration other opportunities that have developed since our last Analyst Day. For example, capacity performance improvement that wasn't there before, and other solar opportunities that we've talked a lot about today. But for that one speciﬁc asset, I would look at the prices at the end of 2014 and reference that to whatever the market has today or whatever you believe the strip is going to be in January of next year."
"So, couple of questions. When I look at your fourth quarter earnings build out – I apologize I wasn't on the whole of the call, so tell me if this was covered, but it looks like you have $0.08 coming out of O&M/Other. And when I look at the past second-half bridge you gave us last quarter, it was presented a little diﬀerently, but there were like $0.02 coming from restructuring- type eﬀorts. So, is this just kind of a presentational thing or are you doing more on costs and just how to bridge those two numbers?","There is a couple things here. I would say it's probably format, more than anything, Jonathan. But to give you little more color on that $0.08, there will be incremental cost control beyond the $0.02 of staﬃng savings that we referenced on the last call.  We also would expect that Questar will close by the fourth quarter and we would see some potentially slight help from that. And we think we will have some ﬁnancing savings as well as we move through the year, based on our current plans versus our previous ones."
"So the plan has – you have got a little more aggressive on the plan, but there's also some presentation. Is that a fair summary?","I think that's probably right. We're very focused on O&M. If you look at the ﬁrst six months of this year, we were – versus the similar period last year, I think we were down about $0.06 on O&M. We're going to be down on O&M between now and the end of the year.  And we're anticipating a recovery in weather, but we're a little weather short in the ﬁrst six months versus norm. So we're very focused on that. And O&M is one of the levers that we're working on to try to oﬀset some of these unforeseens."
"Okay, great. And then just on Cove Point, you're obviously staying on time, on budget, et cetera. I notice that the percentage completion went up 3% this quarter, would seem to be just kind of a quite a lot less than it has done in several recent quarters. So, can you give us a sense of what the trajectory from 67% to completion over the next however many quarters it is?","Jonathan, I'm not sure – you have to go back and check your reference. I don't (43:02)."
"That's plus 3%. The last three quarters has been like plus 11%, plus 9%, plus 8%. So it just seems as probably the nature of how it works, and I am curious how we get from – what's the timing from getting from 67% to 100%?","The plant, well, we're going to start commissioning middle of next year. So, you'll see that percentage continue to grow. You're in a part now Jonathan where you're doing this – you're laying the pipe racks and you're laying the conduits for the wiring and put the wiring in the big chunks of progress, the rapid chunks of progress, putting in the big pieces of equipment. That's all largely complete.  So the concrete is all poured, for example. And the sound wall is ﬁnished. We don't have any hesitation that we're on time and on budget and we will be ready to come online late next year."
"Just wanted to go over maybe the revised outlook for Blue Racer, given the fact that NGL prices have moved in, propane and ethane are a little bit stronger. Has your CapEx timing changed in terms of bringing on processing plants and just your overall view of the wet gas Utica and opportunities there?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Neel, this is Mark. As we've said over the last 6 months to 9 months, Blue Racer, we should have had ﬁve processing plants online based on forecasts that we put out at our Analyst Day 18 months ago. We only have four online and they are almost all at full capacity. We have not seen a big step up based on current NGLs or oil in the basin. And we're being very cautious on Blue Racer to only invest capital when we have ﬁrm commitments from drillers. We have had some reach-out from producers and drillers here in the last several months inquiring about their interest in moving ahead in the last half of this year and ﬁrst part of next year.  But right now, I would say, we're in a cautious mode on Blue Racer. And I don't expect new processing to be put in this year and maybe not for the ﬁrst half of next year."
"Got it. And then my second question on the farm-out agreements, are those typically lumpy or should we expect that they'll come on over a generally linear time period or are they going to come on in some sort of concentrated level and if you have some predictability around those earnings?",They fall into the lumpy category. We've been constantly in negotiations. We have lots of diﬀerent Utica ﬁelds. We have restructurings. We have a variety of activities going on and we are involved in multiple conversations even today.
"Great. And my last question, just on the quarter, in all three business segments, your operating expenses had come down. Is that a trend or is it kind of speciﬁc to this quarter?","I think this quarter is probably larger, Neel, than you're going to see in the remaining part of the year as just a single number. But as I mentioned to a previous caller, that we're very focused on expenses and controlling expenses here to help us meet our guidance. And so, you will see expense savings between now and the end of the year versus original guidance and that is included in the reference on the slide where we think between O&M and other activities that we've highlighted, we will year-over-year be about $0.08 better in the last half of this year than we were last year."
