Question,Answer
"Hey. Good morning, guys. Tom, it's been a pretty tough quarter, quarters for the MLP space probably and kind of the gas infrastructure assets. Are you guys seeing opportunities of things coming up for sale looking interesting and certainly interest enough for you to go out and issue some more equity capital to get deals done? Are you more content to sit on what you have for the time being and stay out of the equity markets?","Well, it's certainly been a tough quarter, really for like maybe four months for the sector, although, I think, objectively that Dominion Midstream Partners has done relatively well compared to some of the rest of the sector. I think that's largely due to the long dropdown schedule we have for organic growth projects. We have looked for things like the Carolina gas transmission, the Iriquois assets, where we were able to place the LP units directly with the sellers. That's the kind of thing we're looking for. We have plenty of projects. We recognize the volatility of the markets right now and we're inclined to just focus on our own projects."
"And I guess, kind of in that spirit, obviously some pretty big M&A transactions this quarter. Can you remind us on how you guys think about M&A and how you prioritize it against the internal growth opportunities you see?","I think we've been fairly consistent for quite a long time. I hope we have, we think, we don't talk about M&A at all. In case somebody decides slightly, we've got a diﬀerent nuance in the way we say we don't talk about it. So we try not to talk about it. With the exception, we have said since we created Dominion Midstream Partners that we would be looking for assets to contribute to the MLP and we are. But like I said, we have anything that we look at that we're going to judge against our own projects and what issuing LP units, how we've prepared through just organically growing. We like what we have."
"Okay. Got it. I guess, the last one on solar, you were able to get the SunEdison deal put together this quarter. What do you think about doing with the rest of the megawatts that haven't been committed to the SunEdison thus far? And is there appetite in the market to monetize that next chunk?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Hey, Dan, this is Norris (22:57). We're happy with the sell-down arrangement that we have with SunEd. As you are aware, we can't monetize a fourth those until after the sunset of the ICC period. So you shouldn't look for us to be back in the market anytime soon for that. Those transactions took us through the end of 2015. So we do have some 2016 projects that will be developed next year. We'll see what the market bears at that point in terms of those projects. But, again, don't look for us to access the market for additional sell-down for a bit while."
"Good morning. Hey, quick questions. One, have you guys talked at all about the beneﬁts that you expect to have from capacity performance at PJM?","Michael, this is Mark. We haven't talked about that. There have been a lot of questions about it. I guess, what the way I would summarize that is, we were very happy with the outcome of those auctions and expect to be a beneﬁciary."
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Yes.,"We have a pretty good line of sight through the 30% ITC window through next year. I guess, the only caveat I give you on that is, we expect some projects in 2016 become available due to some distress with YieldCos that have a time commitment to build, may need some assistance in ﬁnancing those. We'll very selectively look at that as we go out, and we will deﬁnitely look at Virginia projects for us to build in Virginia to support our future needs in terms of our carbon compliance, so again merchant wise, I'd say, very selective, but our focus really being on the Virginia service territory."
"And one question about dividends. How are you thinking about dividend growth going forward considering the buybacks of DM shares? And I guess looking forward, spin-oﬀ of the GP of the MLP also little less interesting these days than it used to.","Yeah, we've never talked about doing anything with our GP, just to answer a statement rather than a question. We see no reason to change our distribution growth rate which is 22%, which is – we think is best-in-class at the MLP and we stated in February that it's our anticipation, subject to board approval, to increase our dividend at Dominion about 8% a year through the balance of the decade."
"Right. Right. And one last question, about cost savings, if you could just make a comment on that going forward at the utility and also at the merchant generation company? And then, that's it.","Michael, on the cost side, you should think about our operating budgets growing at about a rate at CPI that we roll out. The only major ﬂuctuations would be the timing of Millstone outages, where one year you might have two and next year you might have three. But we're focused on CPI type growth going ahead."
"Okay. And then, on the issues with the – all the things we've heard in terms of lower oil prices, gas prices liquids prices, maybe slowing production, et cetera. If you look at not just your new projects, but also the existing ﬂeet of assets, could you maybe just characterize your exposure, if anything? I assume it's pretty small, but just if it's – is it enough, is there anything that we should worry about in terms of numbers over the next year or two due to these issues?","Steve, I'm going to let Paul to answer that question, but I'd also take you back to the script where Tom diﬀerentiated our projects versus a lot of others that are in the marketplace. Almost all of ours are demand pull projects with regulated utilities or counterparties, hence we feel real good about that. But let me have Paul to give you more color."
"Hi, guys. A quick question on merchants, on the merchant side. With all the retirements happening in New York, New England, how do you see that impacting your ﬂeet of gas assets in New York and New England?","Praful, while of course we only have two gas assets, last one in New England in Manchester and one in CGM outside Philadelphia, Fairless. We do see pressure particularly on capacity, ultimately on energy and NEPOOL with some recent announcements. And I think the New York announcement this morning will also put pressure on Northeast prices, particular on capacity as you go out. Since the infrastructure there on gas is not going to be able to signiﬁcantly, expand gas at least for the next many years, I think continued shutdown on NEPOOL's side in the Northeast will support both higher energy and capacity."
"Got you. Thank you. And then in terms of, sorry, in terms of taxes. You talked about ITC expiration post 2016 and moving away from solar, merchant solar to more utility scale. I just wanted to understand from a tax perspective, both book and cash taxes, how do you expect the ITC expiration post 2016 to impact your book and cash taxes?","I think it's going to depend on, one, what ITC is available. Right now, it's just 10% and on the projects we'll be focused on, they'll be regulated projects. So they will ﬂow through regulated rates through riders to customers in Virginia. So that beneﬁt will ﬂow through back to them."
"If we can go to the farm-outs and you mentioned that there is about 160,000 acres left. Just, I guess springboarding a little bit more speciﬁcally oﬀ Steve's earlier question, given where gas prices are at right now and commodity prices overall, are you seeing a change in the market place out there with regards to farm-out interest and can you just comment on the updated sort of industry outlook for farm-outs here?","Brian, this is Paul Koonce. It's interesting, there is certainly a lot of stress among the producer community, but there is also real interest in getting a secure acreage position in this basin. And what our acreage oﬀers is really a lot of acreage that's blocked up, that's contiguous and because this production is held by production, there's no time limit on when the lease will expire. So from that standpoint, there continues to be a lot of real interest, especially when you look at some of these Utica initial production rates. So we've seen a real strong interest and have seen no let up."
"Excellent. And then one last question. Historically, you guys have not done analyst days in consecutive years. You've generally done it every other year or so. Generally, this year it seems to me at least that you guys have just been executing on what you talked about on the Analyst Day earlier this year. Should we go under the assumption that you guys won't need to do any Analyst Day for next year or do you think one might be merited given just the change in the commodity price environment?","Brian, this is Mark. I think, we'll have to evaluate that if we get closer and give guidance for next year. We had a lot of a signiﬁcant change to talk about it in February this year. I think an Analyst Day will be driven by how much the plan changes long-term, if at all. And if it stays pretty much on course with what we have, we probably will wait another year for an Analyst Day, but again, we'll talk about that in the ﬁrst quarter call based on what events are at that time."
"Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
"I wanted to touch on the solar procurement process in Virginia, given some of the recent regulatory activity in the state. At a high level, could you talk about how you think about procuring solar on the utility side within Virginia?","Well. First, I think you're probably referring to the order, I guess, with last week on the – or the week before on the Remington Solar Project. Steve, to distinguish between that project and the projects for example that we just ﬁled, the projects we ﬁled – I guess, we ﬁled Remington in January or February. We had done a lot of work around RFPs and market conditions in solar in the region, when we ﬁled that and believe that we adequately demonstrated that. We went through a much more rigorous or I shouldn't say a more rigorous -diﬀerent process, which – over the summer, for these new projects, which we think are more than compliant with what it was the Commission was looking for in the Remington Project.  So we do RFPs, test the market, look at what we get back in return and then we'll ﬁle them. The projects are going to be required – are going to be required to meet the Clean Power Plan and they are – the General Assembly said and it's built those path early this year that they believe these are in the public interest. So we'll work our way through this process with the commission. Projects are going to get built and I think they'll look like the ones we just passed."
"Understood. Thanks and shifting over to, I'm sorry, can I ask this?",I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Sorry, shifting over to nuclear. I wanted to just, at a high level, get your thoughts on the O&M environment for nuclear. Any trends that you're seeing there just as we think into the future? I know your nuclear operations are very diﬀerent from some of these smaller units that are retiring. But I'm just curious, any trends you see in terms of nuclear operations' cost requirement going forward, things of that nature?","Let me just give a high level response to that, and then I'll turn it over to Dave Christian. Steve, I assume you're referring of course to the announcement today of Entergy and FitzPatrick. We've seen other single merchant power plant, nuclear plants under stress from other companies. We had this happen here, we had this happen with Kewaunee. When I say here, I mean at Dominion. I guess it's happened three years ago, it was very, very diﬃcult decision for us to make. We tried very, very hard to keep that unit operating, but we just couldn't see with the way the market structure we set up at Millstone in particular, that we could make it work without seeing it drain on the balance of our nuclear ﬂeet.  Wasn't a happy day to announce that closing. So everybody is in the diﬀerent environment. We are all at diﬀerent plant economics, but it's a structural issue. I think more macro than micro at least it was for us. But today, particularly on O&M and nuclear, well, I think Mark characterized it pretty well. We've had a cap to expected O&M growth at CPIs and that we are also try and work to culture a continuous improvement, we're always scrutinizing costs. We happened to be blessed with some very low cost units and some very large units. So Millstone in particular is largest unit in New England, dual-unit site. It doesn't have a lot of those same characteristics that Pilgrim, BY and Kewaunee, right."
"Just, I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you elaborate a little bit on the merchant performance that drove earnings this quarter?",We had higher hedge prices than – versus last year and I'm assuming you're referencing to quarter-by-quarter or versus ...
Yeah. Just quarter-by-quarter.,So we had higher hedge prices than we had in quarter last year and we also had additional one at all of our units at Mills – at Manchester and at Fairless. So it really was a pricing and volume issue for us.
Okay. And then would we talk to the hedging at Millstone? I didn't see any information or any hedging information for 2017. Any thoughts about that? What we're looking at in terms of the hedging for Millstone?,"Yeah, Paul. A couple of years ago, I'm changed our view on hedging based on the forward curves really being depressed. And as you know, at Millstone, what moves that market is winter weather. So as you saw from the hedge tables today, we have hedged out most of 2016 production hour from 60% to 83%. And as we go into any calendar year, we've always and we'll continue to hedge Millstone between 80% and 90% going into a calendar year. So we're right on schedule for 2016. For 2017, we have not hedged 2017 as of yet. We will see what winder curves look like as we go through, but as we sit here at this time next year, we will be in a very similar hit position for 2017 at Millstone. Then we have historically or just a little more opportunistic about it than we have been in the past."
