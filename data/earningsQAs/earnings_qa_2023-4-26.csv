Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. So just real quick on ﬁnancing, you guys obviously have a CapEx plan through '25, but ﬁnancing is still based on a '24 plan. When do you sort of anticipate rolling that forward? And what can we anticipate in terms of capital allocation, especially in light of the current capital market conditions? Is asset optimization still an option you guys are kind of looking at?","Thanks, Shar, for that question. As it relates to our capital plan, as you know, we have $16 billion through '23 through '25, and we've provided the ﬁnancing for that, which includes that little bit that's left in '24. We have talked about, the last time we talked about '25 was at Analyst Day where we gave a number for '25 and '26, and I would expect, as we turn the corner on '24, we would be looking at that ﬁnancing more speciﬁcally. As it relates to your asset optimization question, certainly, we don't have anything too new here, but as you know, we would pursue that if it met our three basic grading criteria around, is it executable? Does it distract? And does it create value. But certainly, to the extent that something met that criteria, we would look at it."
"Got it. And then just on some of your recent solar RFPs and kind of announcement, how is that I guess kind of tracking versus your plan for up to 13 gigs and what portion of the new solar is being sort of deployed to support retirement versus new load? And just that initial ownership share versus PPA has always been kind of skewed to contracts. Do you anticipate that's going to change over time?","Yes, Shar, this is Drew. And it has been skewed and that's not where we want to be, frankly. So we are working hard to improve our self-build capabilities, leverage our economies of scale, ﬁnd more ﬁnancial discipline in the packages that we're putting together in those RFP processes so that we can improve. And we do believe that, that will happen. But you're right, we haven't been hitting the mark, and that's important, because it is creating some -- it's taking up some of the room in our balance sheet and limiting our operational strategic ﬂexibility in the long-term. So we want to make sure that we get up to that number. And we're still working towards it."
"Terriﬁc. That's all I had, guys. Thank you so much. See you soon.","Thanks, Shar.    Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. I had two questions, both on sort of the resiliency ﬁlings. Maybe ﬁrst part of that question, can you just give us any initial stakeholder feedback that you may have gotten in Louisiana and New Orleans, the two ﬁlings that you've made. And second, Drew, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned about this separate docket in Louisiana, maybe a little bit more color there. Do you have to kind of use that docket for securing the approval in Louisiana, or just maybe any added color there? Thank you.","It's Rod. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Louisiana, in terms of stakeholder feedback, I think, part of the answer is in the question that you asked. The fact that the staﬀ submitted proposed rulemaking around resiliency ﬁlings for all utilities in Louisiana, we view as reﬂective of a constructive stakeholder engagement strategy for the company over the course of the last six to nine months in Louisiana. Because the proposed rulemaking actually puts us in a position to be very much aligned     given the strategy that we laid out for the commission, both in Louisiana and in New Orleans.  And so the feedback has been constructive. So our expectation is, as you think about the procedural schedule that Louisiana laid out, they're backcasting from a January 2024 hearing date. Their procedural schedule backs up from that date to give us an opportunity to perhaps settle with stakeholders to accelerate agreement around the Louisiana decision-making on resiliency.  So we view that as a net positive. New Orleans tracks Louisiana. In that, we have clarity from the city council on our initial proposal, which was $1.5 billion to that stakeholder engagement process. We narrowed down narrowed down the grouping of projects to about $1 billion at the $1.5 billion. And that $500 million that did make the cut, wasn't about a lack of agreement on the need for the projects. They just tracked on a diﬀerent path outside of the accelerated resilience. So in both Louisiana and New Orleans, we view the stakeholder engagement feedback being positive and constructive, and the existence of procedural schedules in both the LPSC and the New Orleans City Council is consistent with our ﬁnancial plan."
Awesome. I appreciate that.,"Durgesh, this is Drew. I have one thing to add to what Rod was saying, just to make sure you caught at the beginning of the comment, he actually answered the second part of your question in the beginning on the second docket. And that second docket does actually create an ability for us to do the math on how the beneﬁts and the costs should work. It speciﬁcally allows the economics of customer outages to be part of the conversation. And so there is a mechanisms that they create for that, but that's an important piece of that framework that the staﬀ established.    I will also -- thanks, Drew. I will also add that in New Orleans, as we think about the $1.5 billion that we initially ﬁled and the $1 billion compliance ﬁling after the feedback process, it is roughly two-thirds of the proposed CapEx and 80% of the customer beneﬁts just going with the $1 billion versus the $1.5 billion in the accelerated docket process. So again, we view the feedback as constructive in both Louisiana and the City of New Orleans today."
"Appreciate it, guys. Sounds like solid progress. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.    Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Julian Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much, appreciate it. So perhaps just pivoting to SIRI here and the pending complaints, is it completely path dependent on FERC, or are you able to facilitate progress at FERC in any speciﬁc way? I just want to come back to that back and forth, and the -- just the procedural elements a little bit more speciﬁcally here if you will? And then if I can as a follow-up, are you still having settlement conversations with perhaps any of the parties considering maybe some of the ambiguities here?","I think the short answer to both of the frames of your question is settlement discussions will be aided by clarity from the FERC that we are awaiting with regard to the sale leaseback, and the uncertain tax position ruling, as you recall from the December ruling and the procedural order out in this past February. So yes, there are ongoing conversations and settlement on all of the ancillary cases, but clarity around where the FERC sits on those two issues will go along the way towards setting the path for our path forward on settlement. There's no --"
Right. And --,Yes. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
"No, I'm sorry. And it seems like it's path dependent on them, right? There's no ability to facilitate progress at FERC or otherwise enable it in a separate parallel docket as you alluded to a second ago on storms.","I think that's a fair assessment just given the positions that certain of the stakeholders have taken around their reaction to the December order. Clarity from the FERC will clear the lanes for ongoing discussions. There's also a timing element where we expect the FERC to act sooner rather than later in order to maintain jurisdiction vis-?- vis the Fifth Circuit and others. So we're expecting -- we don't have a date, but we're expecting FERC to act sooner to get ahead of what might be the appeals process if left unresolved."
"Got it. Excellent. And then if you can click right on '23, just super quickly on the guidance. I know, Kim, I think you said a second ago about the $0.22, and the $0.10 here of O&M. How much further ﬂex is there in the plan to the extent to which obviously other items materialize? And/or if you can elaborate a little bit more on just the components there at.","Thanks, Julian. It's early in the year, so we certainly have good line of sight on our ability to manage that through the rest of the year. There's some additional puts and takes that we would manage through, depending on what happens. Obviously, if the weather is milder in the summer, we'd have to work through that. If it comes in more normal or hotter, then there may be opportunities to ﬂex up. For some speciﬁcs, certainly, we talked about last year that in 2022, the higher O&M was tied to higher volumes, and we ﬂexed up, which helps us to derisk '23 and we're able to take advantage of some of that here.  And then we've seen some favorability, as you probably saw in the materials around volumes in residential and commercial and that and that may give us continued opportunity throughout the year if that continues to persist. The other area I would point out is interest expense, and we've been able to manage through some potential upside there as it relates to timing of debt issuances, for example."
Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate it. Good luck to the team.,Thanks.    Operator  Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
"Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. A little bit of a follow-up on the last question. I was curious for the utility O&M targets for the year. You notched that up to $0.70 in terms of the savings. But I was curious, it was only about $0.03 of kind of a help in the ﬁrst quarter. Are there any underlying challenges that you've hit or inﬂationary pressures or anything like that, that make it more diﬃcult to achieve the O&M savings for the year, or is it more just kind of a timing issue versus on a year-over-year comparison?","Thanks, David. You're right, for the ﬁrst quarter, we were down about $0.03, but our O&M doesn't occur ratably over the year, it's really tied, as I said particularly last year. We ramped up with the higher volumes in second and third quarter, so I would expect to see assuming normal weather, a much more spread versus last year in O&M in that second, third, and fourth quarter."
"Okay. Got you. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I was just wondering, are there any legislative bills in Texas that might be meaningful for your business as we get closer to the end of the session in the state for next month?","Yes, there are a number of items in consideration. The one that we're certainly paying attention to has to do with resiliency ﬁlings, not just Entergy, but other utilities. There's ﬁve weeks left, so the good thing is that it's been progressing nicely. The signiﬁcant attribute that we're looking for in coming out of those resiliency ﬁlings would be the types of precedents that were set in Texas where -- when we were making AMI ﬁlings in Texas, we were able to take assets that still had useful life out of service and replace them with the newer, more modern, and in this case, more resilient assets and still be able to account for those undepreciated assets.  So we're tracking the progress of those various pieces of legislation to ensure that we have the appropriate ﬂexibility with the commission to facilitate our resiliency and reliability investments in Texas. So it's moving along. Stakeholder engagement has been strong and quite active, but ﬁve weeks or so left in the session, so we'll continue to go at it."
"Okay, great. Thanks very much.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead.",
"Morning, Drew. Morning, Kim. How are you? Just one from me around -- or two from me, but the ﬁrst one is on Slide 38, so following up with Julian's question. So if I kind of just look through what you're showing here, I see sort of $0.10 of the O&M and then sort of corporate being down $0.05 kind of oﬀsets the $0.05 of better sales mix. So versus the $0.22 of weather and $0.10 of sort of oﬀsets. And Kim, to sort of get into your answer, I think what you were saying there is there's more oﬀsets to come to oﬀset the balance of that $0.12 or maybe some of that's in that slightly favorable impact around other income and lower interest expense to sort of get back to the midpoint or absent further mitigation, are you kind of pointing to the end of the range for 23 here.","Yes, Ross I think you're right in that there are small pennies in a number of categories beyond what you went through there. So you're right, you have $0.10 in O&M. You've got then $0.05 in parent and other and the weather volume there is about $0.05 and we saw that mix in the ﬁrst quarter. And then you will see probably not speciﬁcally in the side but just on a throughout the balance of the income statement, pennies here and there that balance the rest out.       Yes. And Ross, it's Drew. So while we would certainly concede that $0.22 brings us lower than the midpoint, it's early in the year and we wouldn't say that, that's where we are at this point. We're just targeting the midpoint and we expect to do better than that by the end of the year."
"Got you. No, that's very clear. Thank you, Drew. And then just maybe contextualize for me. You're showing 2% industrial growth in the quarter year-over-year. And Drew, you kind of went through this in some of the prepared remarks. But maybe give us a little bit more contextualization of your sort of 6% long-term aspiration versus what you're currently seeing.","Yes. I'll take that. So we've seen -- what we talk about the drivers and you -- and we have a couple of slides in there about the drivers. And as we've said for a number of years now, there's a lot of advantages to the Gulf Coast, and that's access to global and national markets and the available energy infrastructure, low energy prices, supportive communities, available workforce. All of that has been driving investment domestically towards the Gulf Coast, and frankly, our service territory all the way up to Mississippi River.  Now you've got the broken global supply chains, geopolitical uncertainty, you've got the tailwinds for the IRA. Before you even get to the IRA, we've seen a lot of onshoring, and that's basically what our 6% is based on. And we see a lot of investment, we have -- the 6% is a probability-weighted assessment of where we think it will come out that takes into consideration, some projects don't always make it to the ﬁnish line, some projects are a little delayed. All that kind of stuﬀ. If all of it landed, it could be signiﬁcantly larger than 6%, but that's not our planning assumption at this point.  Then throw in the tailwinds of the IRA and it could get bigger. The rules are still a bit uncertain associated with that and particularly around hydrogen, green hydrogen in particular. But we are seeing an awful lot of interest in the Gulf Coast Area to try and take advantage of frankly, the existing infrastructure that's already there.  The hydrogen infrastructure, for example, we have production, we have consumption, we have transportation, we have storage, if everything you need to move hydrogen. And we have a lot of people that are coming to the Gulf Coast to try and take advantage of that existing infrastructure. I mean, it is eﬀectively a hydrogen hub already. And similarly, we all have -- we also have CO2 pipelines and CO2 consumption, CO2 production. And so carbon capture is going to be the game. There is existing infrastructure for that as well. And so folks are looking at all that stuﬀ and thinking about how to expand on that opportunity in the long-term. And so we see a lot of exciting investment opportunities.     In fact, when we were in Texas on Monday for the groundbreaking for Orange County, there was a lot of discussion about hydrogen and about carbon capture with state oﬃcials in Texas. They're excited about it. They're excited about the growth opportunities that they see. They're seeing all of it as well. And they are very supportive of us having dispatchable generation to make sure that we can support that potential investment that we believe is on its way. So that's frankly what we're looking at. It's very exciting, and a lot of opportunity ahead of us."
"That's great, Drew. Thank you. And of course, we'll be watching the potential for EPA plant rules around carbon capture too. But for now, I'll jump back into queue. Thank you.  Operator  And our ﬁnal question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.",
"Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on the question related to CRE where, I think, Rod, you mentioned a timing element that FERC needs that before they lose jurisdiction. Could you give us a sense of what that timeline is or limit?","Yes. I don't have the actual procedural schedule in front of me, Steve, but it's my appreciation that the ﬁfth circuit process that includes our -- actually all of our utility jurisdictions. There's a appeals process at the Fifth Circuit that would impact FERC's ability to provide clarity around that December 23rd decision. And so it's our appreciation from the lawyers that the FERC has an interest in resolving any lack of clarity in avoiding having to create a conﬂict jurisdictionally between the Fifth Circuit's answer to the appeal from the parties and their ability to drive their respective order. And so that's why you hear the hedge of sooner rather than later, because we don't know exactly what that time frame is, but we recognize that objectively it is an issue."
"Okay. And then I guess a question for Drew. Just things have quieted down a lot once the securitization was approved and fuel prices have come down and alike. Could you just give a latest sense of relationships with the Louisiana Commission? And do they kind of have appreciation of the volatility that was created around stuﬀ early in the year? And yes, any color there would be helpful.","Sure, Steve, I'll start, but then I'll kick it to Ryan, who has the subject matter expertise in that particular area. But it is -- you're right, it is a little bit more constructive right       now, compared to where it was last fall. I know you had to piggyback to last fall, it's easy to forget that we had an election going on, there were contested elections. There was a lot of outside money in those elections, which were putting additional energy into the political process.  And it was coming on the heels of a hot summer with escalating gas prices, and that was all just coming to a point as our securitization was showing up there. We believe that we still continue to have strong relationships in Louisiana, and at all levels of the government, and including the commission. And so we endeavor to work closely with them on an ongoing basis. But that's still, we're not taking that for granted -- that is something that we are very much focused on. We know that our commissioners are very focused on customer outcomes, and so we are as well. And so I'll turn it over to Rod to talk a little bit more.    Yes. And I think, Steve, your preface was on point. The fact that gas prices have come down and we have aided in providing relief to customers, and there's been some time since the election that's given us an opportunity to reengage with commissioners around our customer-centric strategy, I think, it's proven very helpful.  I will note that our most recent engagement with the Commission was around a 5-0 vote on a -- on the gas business rate case. That was a big deal. The prudency of our Lake Charles power station along with the gas rate case was all 5-0. And it is not insigniﬁcant that the proposed rulemaking from the staﬀ with regard to resiliency, that too was the result of the intentional work in part that we have -- we've done in engaging with the commission and our other stakeholders, especially the customers.  So look, in response to the noise coming out of the elections and the end of the year, we've certainly ramped up our engagement processes to make sure that our commission and staﬀ from related stakeholders are informed. But also I want to be explicit in saying that the fact that we have a new commissioner in Louisiana for us represents a new commission. Anytime, there's a new addition to the commission, it's an opportunity for us to reassess, reset and reengage, and we've been quite deliberate about doing that for the purpose of keeping alignment with the commission.  Because we have a really -- and you know this, we have a really aggressive regulatory agenda given all of the myriad of customer-centric opportunities and investments we have in Louisiana and the growth in Louisiana is going to put a lot of pressure on the commission. And our engagement process is geared to help make their lives easier as we try to solve our customers' problems. But we get it and it will be ongoing. It is not a thing where we check the box and say, oh, we have ﬁnished the work. The stakeholder engagement process is 24/7/365, Steve."
