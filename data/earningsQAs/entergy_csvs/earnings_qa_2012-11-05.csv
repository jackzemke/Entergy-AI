Question,Answer
"Wayne, ﬁrst of all, congratulations on retirement, and we'll see you at EEI, but just publicly wanted to say that.","Hey, thanks, Dan."
"You know, when we look at the '13 guidance you guys provided, I guess question number one is, when you look at the breadth of the band at this point in time, the $0.80, given how much smaller the generation business is as a total percentage of the mix, and how much you've hedged, where do you see the big variability points as you look at that number for next year, based on what you guys have now? And based on conditions today, do you think you're falling in at the midpoint of that range or somewhere higher or lower than that?","Well, the big drivers are pretty consistent with what they've been in the past. The big driver part of the range is what happens from an EWC point of view with pricing.     And as you can see with the sensitivities associated with what we've got on slide six or in table 7 in the release, there is some variability associated with price movements at EWC. And that's really still the biggest driver that we see there. In the utility, we do have some major rate actions as part of where we see them going forward. So if you look at what happens with the Grand Gulf, with Waterford 3, Hinds/Hot Spring, there's certainly a signiﬁcant amount of variability around those rate actions as well. And as I mentioned, and as we've seen in the past, things like pension expense, depending on where the discount rate is, where the market performance is for the year, those all have an impact. So, really, there's, I guess, more variability in there, Dan, than you think, based on some of those open items as it relates to pricing, pension expense, as well as those rate actions."
"Okay. And I know this year, there's been a lot of weather variability year-to-year in the last couple of years. The 1.5% growth of the normalized growth for next year at the utilities, how is that going to compare to the full year this year, once you back out some of the unique weather events?","Dan, this is Theo. It's going to compare fairly close. It will be probably, I think, our guidance for this year had a rate of about 1.6 or so and we're on track for that. So it's going to compare fairly favorably, fairly close to what we're seeing this year."
"Okay. Thank you, guys.    Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS.",
"And Leo, once again, congratulations on the new role. Wayne, congratulations on moving on up.",Where?
"Bigger and better things, right?","Oh, yes, right, I guess. Yes."
"Anyway, going back to the guidance, ﬁrst on the subject of O&M, could you maybe elaborate a little bit? Just EWC has a litany of various things driving costs up. Could you perhaps just provide a little bit more of a sense for next year, as well as going forward into '14 and '15? What's kind of the trajectory, if you will?","Well, some of the things as far as normal O&M, we've got increases associated with merit and compensation expense such as that. Also, we do have, at EWC, we've got higher maintenance expense because of the outage at RISEC next year. Those go into that picture as well. In terms of normal O&M as it relates to what you see in the nuclear business, obviously, what we look at is any kind of costs that are associated with regulatory requirements and the like, which have driven costs in the past. And those are kind of the primary drivers of what we see next year and going forward -- plus the timing of refueling outages and amortization. And we did have some changes this year because of what happened at Vermont Yankee as well, because of the impairment."
Got you. Is there a percentage number that you'd want to throw out there just for us on a modeling purpose basis?,From a long-term point of view?
Broad-brush.,"Yes, not particularly at the moment, no."
"Okay. And then maybe on the second half there, EWC again, the economics in nuclear obviously have come up of late following Dominion's announcement. I'd be curious if you could just talk about your portfolio and I suppose BY, in light of certain taxes that have been raised in Vermont, potentially.","Julien, this is Rick. I mean, we still think it's a good plan. I mean, we're pursuing it through the court in the Northeast markets. We're bullish going forward where market prices are. And the taxes is not a big item that's going to determine for us whether or not we continue to operate that plant or not. So -- and we're going to pursue additional appeals on the taxes. So at the end of the day, we're still conﬁdent on our position on the taxes in Vermont."
"Great, thank you.    Operator  Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank.",
"And I add my congratulations, Wayne; and Leo, too. Thank you for everything, Wayne, over the years. (multiple speakers) Quick question on dividend policy for the ongoing, that sort of post-spin-merged company. I remember that -- I think that the assumption was that you were going to leave the dividend the same. And the comments on the last quarterly call were you'd maybe have a higher payout and then grow into it over a period of time. But obviously subject to the Board. Is that still how we should think about this? Any change in thinking around that? And then what type of payout would you be willing to weather for a period under that strategy?","Jonathan, it's Leo. (multiple speakers)  Leo's looking at me. He's looking at the wrong guy here.    Usually Wayne handles that question, but I guess he's pushing that one oﬀ to me. This is part of transition. The -- you know, our thinking around the dividend post-ITC transaction hasn't changed. The bottom line is the utility sizes the dividend; always has. And buybacks come out of transaction-based items or out of the EWC or commodity-based businesses, depending on what we're doing at any point in time. What we've indicated all along as it relates to the dividend is that, one, it is a board decision; two, you're going to be getting a dividend from both Entergy and ITC, once the transaction occurs. And when we look at the dividend post-transaction, we'll be looking to size that dividend accordingly based on the prospects of the utility business. And when we looked at it originally, we were looking at -- we have the potential to be able to grow into that dividend that we have today, the $3.32 as the utility continues to grow. As far as overall payout ratio, obviously, things do change. And we're going to have to pay attention to not only what happens to EWC pricing and overall earnings, and what that payout ratio looks like, but also investment opportunities at the utility. And so, the thinking hasn't changed. It's consistent with what we've been saying all along. But we'll just have to look at where we stand when that -- the time comes when we close on the transaction. But our dividend level is what the ITC dividend level is, because you'll, again, be getting a dividend from both of us at that point in time; what our capital program looks like, and what overall earnings look like at that time, as well."
"So Leo, if I may just to clarify, are you saying that the combination of the Entergy and the ITC spins would be where we are today? Or that the Entergy dividend itself is likely to stay where it is today? Well, because I heard before it was that the ITC piece would kind of not be part of the equation.",The ITC piece is part of the equation. I'm not sure I understand exactly what you --?
"I thought originally, the idea was there would be a dividend that would be on the ITC piece, but that the dividend on the ongoing Company would kind of remain the same as today's dividend. And that -- you seem to be kind of linking the ITC piece to that now.","Oh, no. Well, originally, when we've been looking at this, certainly, our intention is that you end up with more dividends after the transaction than you would have had without the transaction. What we'll be looking at when we make that decision is, again, the overall Entergy prospects; what the ITC dividend is; what our investment proﬁle at the utility looks like; and what the overall payout ratio would be. And to the extent that that supports $3.32 continuing, then we may be able to grow into that utility, given that payout would be high, relative to where we stand today on the utility earnings piece. But if we can grow into it, that's something that we'll consider at that time. And that's what we were talking about when we announced the transaction in December."
"Okay, thanks a lot, Leo.","Thank you.  Operator  Steve Fleishman, Bank of America Merrill Lynch."
"Wayne, we'll deﬁnitely miss you on these calls. And Leo, congratulations. Just a quick, maybe a little bit technical question. In the release, it talks about moving allocation of earnings between EWC and the parent of about $0.40 a share. Could you be a little more explicit what that relates to? And is this some kind of ongoing allocation that will stay this way? I think this is the second time there's been a change     in allocation between segments the last few years. I just want to make sure it's kind of representing the better going forward and why.","Well, the why is to better align EWC activities within EWC. We're actually moving a couple of legal entities, names of which you wouldn't recognize, from the reporting segment that is parent and other to the reporting segment that is EWC. And what happens between those is you have some intercompany interest and you have some taxes that are really more closely aligned with the EWC business. And so we're lining that up better. And that's what that $0.40 is. And it's probably, I want to say, 70/30 in terms of tax and interests."
"Okay. So, is there better or if we match up the debt at EWC -- I guess the question is, are you now allocating some of parent debt to EWC in this calculation? Or not? (multiple speakers) Or less of that?","No, it's actually some intercompany loans that we're matching up."
Okay. Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  We have time for one ﬁnal question. That will come from Greg Gordon of ISI Group."
"Thanks, guys. So I just want to follow-up on the question on the dividend. So are you saying that the current $3.32 dividend might, in fact, be resized post the spinoﬀ of ITC, depending on the remaining earnings power and cash ﬂow of the utility? Or are you saying that you're going to maintain it?","Well, again, Greg, we'll make the decision at the time we close on the ITC transaction. And we've always said that we'll make the decision and we'll size it based on those factors that I mentioned, at the time of the transaction, when it closes. When we look at where we -- when we were talking about sizing that up back in December when we announced the transaction, we mentioned that as those things looked at the time, it was possible that the $3.32 could stay in place and we could grow into that dividend. So we're not really saying anything diﬀerent right now, other than we'll make that call at the time, based on what happens during the     18-month-plus timeframe between when we announced it and when we actually close."
"Okay. I guess I'd just -- in the context of you having lowered your net income growth aspiration for the core utilities business from 6% to -- I think it was 6% to 8% or 6% to 9% to now 6%, I guess there's some -- just a question of whether or not that puts you at a payout ratio at which you're somewhat uncomfortable with the current dividend?","Well, again, those are the kinds of things that change, but it will be more not what happens between now and 2014, but what happens 2014 and beyond that will drive that decision on the dividend."
"Okay, thanks. I just wanted to be clear. Take care.    Operator  And this does conclude today's Q&A session. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Paula Waters for closing remarks.","Thank you, Robert. And thanks to all for participating.
