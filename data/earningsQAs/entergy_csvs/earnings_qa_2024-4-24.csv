Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Thanks for taking the questions.","Hey, good morning."
Can we start on the updated thoughts around the CapEx plan given the data points around resiliency and additional industrial customers? You had about $900 million in plan with a bigger number now approved. Is that pushing CapEx higher in the near term? And how should we think about the moving pieces there?,"Thanks, Constantine. Yes, from a capital plan, we did get $1.9 billion approved. We had $900 million through this outlook period. Of the $1.9 billion approved, about $1.5 billion of that is in that same three-year period. So that's an increment of about $700 million for Louisiana. The Louisiana portion of that $900 million was $800 million.  So that's an incremental $700 million. How that rolls out through the capital plan, we'll update all that in at Analyst Day along with what the eﬀects of the rider and any other changes to our capital in our ﬁnancing plan."
"Okay, perfect. And maybe can you help us reconcile some of the charges taken in the quarter and how the refunds may impact cash and ﬁnancing needs in the near term? Do you anticipate any pull-forward of equity issuance or are there oﬀsetting factors that we should think about?","We don't see any needed change in equity. We had already reserved a substantial portion of the income tax or the deferred tax eﬀect for New Orleans, we did increase that, but it's a -- the return period is a pretty long period. And so there's no eﬀects in the outlook period -- no material eﬀects in the outlook period."
"Okay, perfect. And maybe just one last follow-up on some of your commentary around regulatory outcomes. Do you have any updated thoughts around the FRP process and rate case process in Louisiana? And is the period after the direct testimony kind of the make it ripe for the kind of more intense settlement discussions, any kind of lessons learned that you can implement?","Hey, good morning. It's Rod. I think I can say, look, ﬁve weeks ago, we ﬁled -- we suspended the procedural schedule to facilitate settlement. If you think about the date of May 21st when staﬀ and intervener testimony is due. In the next three weeks, I think it's reasonable to assume that one of three things will happen.  We'll either announce the settlement, we will mutually agree to extend the dates procedurally to facilitate settlement or pivot back to a procedural schedule. With the resiliency docket addressed last week, I think the next three weeks or so we'll be telling about the progress we make. But we're comfortable that the stakeholders in Louisiana are now focused on settlement discussions."
Perfect. Thanks for that and appreciate taking the questions. Best of luck.,Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning. Jeremy
"Hi. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on plus $0.15 revised weather, normal sales, just a stronger industrial sales outlook as you put out there. If you could kind of bucket whether that's more the pet chems beneﬁting from cheap ethane and the outlook improving there, or cheap methane beneﬁting ammonia, other industries or whether that's data centers. Just wondering, which one of the industrial activities out there are you seeing, I guess more upside?","I think -- this is Rod. I can touch on that and certainly Kimberly can follow. But beyond the AWS transaction in Mississippi, we're continuing to see signiﬁcant interest in the data center sectors, both hyperscale as well as colocation in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. But we continue to see strong interest from the metal sector as well, speciﬁcally aluminum and steel with projects in various stages of development.  You can add in there with the IRA, developments are showing up in blue ammonia in addition to the conversations around carbon capture. And that's not to exclude what we would consider to be our traditional sectors of growth in the service territory around reﬁning and petrochemicals. We plan to give more color, of course, at Analyst Day, but I didn't want to suggest that there was one speciﬁc sector.  There's a fair amount of diversity in our backlog and growth outlooks.  And Jeremy, just to add to that, for the $0.15 for this year. You can think about that speciﬁcally as our historic industries along the Gulf Coast and those industrial customers are online and taking power currently."
"Got it. That makes sense. It's very helpful there. That kind of leads into my next question. I was just wondering for the Analyst Day, obviously you're not going to give us all the details here, but just wondering any broad parameters of what we should expect on the day?","Well, I mentioned a few of them in my remarks earlier around some of the things that Rod just discussed and the opportunities that we see for growth from a sales perspective and where that's coming from, some more color in depth to that conversation, certainly more clarity around the kinds of investments that we plan to make and that includes the generation side as well as the poles and wires side. And we're talking about reliability and resilience. Some of the work that we are doing to drive productivity internally. From a data perspective, we'll be giving a more robust outlook that goes out to ﬁve years.  That will include capital and earnings. And we'll make clear, as Kimberly just mentioned, about our expectations from a ﬁnancing perspective. And also since we'll be in New Orleans, we'll have a number of our leaders here with us and you'll get the ability to access a broader segment of our management and leadership team than you normally do when you just see Rod and Kimberly and Bill Abler and myself out on the road.  So you'll get to see what we are seeing in our various jurisdictions and get a more boots-on-the-ground view of how things are progressing."
"Got it. Sounds great there. And if I could, I just want to ﬁnish with SERI real quick. It seems like a lot of meaningful progress over the past year or so. And just wondering your thoughts on, I guess, the prospects for continued positive momentum here in settlements given all the ground that's been covered so far.","Yeah, and I think the -- you're right. Being in a position where we can stay comfortably that roughly 85% of the SERI risk has been addressed through settlement, it does lend itself to what I would think would be a compelling case to resolve the rest with the State of Louisiana. We can't speak and don't speak around the nuances of negotiations in any period, but we do believe that the fact that New Orleans is now oﬀ the table, it gives us a shot to pursue settlement with Louisiana near term."
Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lonegan from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.,
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide a preview of your planned resiliency ﬁling in Texas. You laid out a cadence of spending for Texas at the EEI conference, and I was just wondering if the Texas Resiliency Act since then has changed how you're thinking about it in terms of the amount and timing of planned investments?","Yeah, it's Rod again. We're going to make that ﬁling in the second quarter, and some of the considerations around the amount will be inﬂuenced by how we think about the contribution to the resilient spend from the state grant program, not to mention, to your earlier point, how the capital would ﬂow through the recovery mechanisms aﬀecting both aﬀordability and credit. But we'll make that ﬁling before the end of second quarter.  I'll add that, as you probably recall, the Texas part of the resilience investment was pushed back a little bit because we have a lot of growth upfront and so we probably won't see as much. And that's where the grant piece comes in. And also the mechanism, as we've talked about before, since we have all of this growth in our service territory, the mechanism doesn't work as well from a credit perspective for us.     So we're working on that. We have another legislative session coming up, but you'll see all of that reﬂected in our ultimate resilience ﬁling."
"Great. Thank you. And then secondly, for me on the Bayou Power Station, is the $411 million of investment included in your base capital plan? And also given that it would be ﬂoating oﬀ the Louisiana coast, I was just wondering if you could talk about the protections in place for the plant from severe weather with work crews and equipment potentially being impacted. I know sometimes you see that with oil rigs oﬀ the coast.","Yeah. As far as the $411 million that is included in our capital plan from a protection, it's a technology that's been used elsewhere. It's -- and certainly just not necessarily in this area up along the east coast. And certainly is expected to be resilient in heavy winds and storms.    And I'll just -- just to be clear, it's not out in the middle of the ocean. It is on land, but it's in a canal so that it can ﬂoat with the storm surge. And so that's really what we're talking about here, not an oil rig out in the middle of the Gulf."
"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay. Well, thank you very much.    Operator  Our next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Your line is now open.",
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"I guess just -- good morning. Good morning. Going back to the data center discussion, just, you gave this stat on one point gigawatt -- 1.1 gigawatts of new load is going to be about $150 million of new gross margin. And this relates to the Mississippi Center. But just thinking about how that drops to the bottom line when you kind of take in the ﬁnancing costs or other items there, can you kind of help us understand how it translates to EPs? Just I'm thinking about, there's clearly more opportunities like this on the horizon and trying to see what those are worth. Thanks.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Nick. When you think about the Mississippi data center it ramps up over time. So you're not going to see a lot of that in the three year outlook period. We can talk more about what that means over the ﬁve year that Drew referenced it at Analyst Day.  But you're right, when you think about AGM on that sort of customer, you are also putting in infrastructure to support it. So there is -- you saw a shift in spending in the fourth quarter update where we added incremental renewables, for example, in Mississippi. So those investments and the associated costs associated with those investments will oﬀset some of that from a bottom line perspective and then ﬁnancing costs for those type things as well. But again, you will see most of that eﬀect outside the three-year outlook period.    Yeah. It's -- the investment is the thing that will ultimately go to the bottom line. The AGM is there to support that incremental investment. So we think it's really important and it demonstrates the growth opportunity that's out in front of us and the demand from our customers to help them meet what they want to do."
"Great. That's really helpful. Appreciate it. And then I guess you mentioned in your remarks, and you have it on slides here, you've been above the 14% FFO-to-debt target that the agencies (Technical Diﬃculty) you at. I'm just thinking about Moody's continuing to be on negative outlook. Do you think that there's a window to kind of address that ahead of summer? I mean, what's your latest conversations been there?","We certainly have regular conversations with the rating agencies and they are constructive conversations about what's happening in the business. If you look at our underlying calculation, the FFO trailing twelve months for the quarter was similarly strong to what it was at the end of the year.  And then we issued more debt in this quarter. As I mentioned in my comments, that would balance out over the course of the year, putting us strongly in the rating agency's expectation at the 14% or better. So strong discussion.  Certainly the rating agencies have to do their evaluations and make those decisions, but hitting that threshold for 2023, which we did, and then continuing to execute on that, and as we work to build towards 15% are important to us."
All right. Thank you so much.,Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is now open.
"Hey, good morning, team. Hope all is well. I guess just quickly, if I could get Rod busy here just on SERI, Rod, I know there's -- you're working with the Louisiana Public Service Commission on maybe settling there. Separately there's the formula rate plan issue.  Is there anything that prevents both of those being settled together, meaning one's a FERC issue and one may be more of a state issue?","Short answer is no. We're pursuing our eﬀorts today with stakeholders on settling both, and the interest being avoiding any litigation associated with either. So short answer is no. There's nothing preventing us from pursuing settlement on both issues, regardless of federal versus state jurisdiction."
"Great. And then just an easy one, I guess. Drew, on the gas sale update. I know it's a very long window for approval. Just any update or timing or procedural schedule you can provide us?","The gas LDC, as I mentioned, is on schedule. We have -- there's more details in the appendix, and so I think that at the LPSC, it's moving on quite quickly. The timeline's a little longer in New Orleans, but at this point, we don't see anything that's impeding the progress and the ultimate completion of the transaction.  So we're ﬁrmly conﬁdent there is a possibility that it could move up a little bit. But at this point, we're sticking with our by third-quarter 2025 timeline."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.,Thank you.      Operator   Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Most of my questions were answered. Just wanted to get a little more information on this Waterford trip. Do you expect that you'll have the new transformer by kind of summertime?,"Probably not. That's a new transformer. And as you -- I know you're aware there's a backlog for large transformers like that, and we don't have one of that size as a spare. So we do have the interim transformer ready to go, and it should be ready by summertime. That gets us back to about 90%. And so the plant should be online this summer, but we won't have full deliverability out of the plant until we get a new transformer in place."
"Okay. All right. But you can run 90% just with the spare. So it's kind of most of the way, so.","Yeah, that's correct."
"Okay. And then maybe just on MISO transmission, when are we going to get -- I know they're going through their diﬀerent tranches. Like, when are we going to get to the Entergy zone area for MISO transmission?","I believe that they are expecting to put something out late this year, but the timelines have moved around a little bit for them. But I think that was the previous expectation. You're talking -- just to be clear, you're talking about the long term planning piece of it, right?"
That's right. That's right.,"Yeah. Yeah. I think they're -- as you know, they've been in MISO north for a while working on stuﬀ, and I do believe that they plan to put out some expectations later this year."
"Okay. Okay. And then I guess just on the Cogen sales, just is this -- you still expect -- I expect industrial growth for the year. Cogen sales, if I recall, are pretty low margin.","That's absolutely correct, Steve. And the cogen sales were for the quarter, but that's really a volume diﬀerence, slight EPs diﬀerence. But as we discussed, incremental industrial sales certainly support that, helping us achieve our objectives at the end of the year."
Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is now open.
"Hi. Thank you. So two questions. First, as you see this, the data center load materializing in your service territory, is there any discussion about potential changes in like T&D tariﬀs that these big users would be paying? I'm mostly trying to see if there's any way to shield residential customers from payments for any sort of T&D upgrades that will be needed to accommodate this load?","Good morning, Angie. Yes, when you think about data centers, they certainly are requiring infrastructure to support them. And so we are ensuring that the pricing of those customers priced in a way that support those, the customer coming, but also support the rest of our customers in the infrastructure build that's needed. When you reference Mississippi speciﬁcally, we worked closely with the legislature to ensure that we had the ability to add the infrastructure that we needed, but also that we protected all of our other customers through the contract.  And so it was a beneﬁt both to add the customer to the system, but also to the State of Mississippi and all of our other customers. And I would think about it the same way for future data centers that add to our service territory."
"Got it. And speaking of Mississippi, and I'm just thinking about SERI, all of these issues that are related to the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. I mean, as you are basically       trying to ﬁnish all of the litigations associated with that plant, is there -- I mean, would you, for example, consider signing like a long-term contract with a data center instead of having those sort of disputes with on the regulated level just to make this asset dedicated to an industrial or commercial user as opposed to having it. Again, it seems to have led to a number of regulatory disputes in the past.","Yeah, that's a good question, Angie. And we are thinking about various potential solutions there. Right now, the output of those facilities are contracted for the life of the unit to each of the operating companies that participate. So I don't think that there's any room for data center pieces, but we are looking at all other alternatives in order to try to mitigate that future potential litigation risk. That is deﬁnitely on a radar screen, although we don't have anything to discuss about that right now."
Very good. Thank you.,Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now open.
Good morning. I was hoping you could touch on how you may approach attracting data centers outside of Mississippi. You mentioned Arkansas and some other locations. Can you just provide some context or some color around regulatory attractiveness of those states on the comparison base?,"Yeah. This is Rod again. And I think Kimberly alluded to it. The example in Mississippi, I think serves as a blueprint for other states. When you think about how we shaped both the legislation from the actual state, the contractual guarantees, if you will, from AWS, and the regulatory outcomes that facilitated our ability to meet AWS's needs, I think plays well. It would certainly focus around job creation and economic development from a stakeholder engagement standpoint, similar to the way that we did in Mississippi. I see that being very relevant in, say, Louisiana and Arkansas.  Certainly, there's going to be an expectation regardless of where these data centers are cited that there's rate protection for the other customers in the service territory. Notwithstanding any conversation around the green or the clean dynamics, we are going to serve that customer's needs and the attributes that are important to them.     But here's the piece that I think becomes really important as we are engaging our regulators and our customer stakeholders. What Mississippi was able to do was to expedite the CCN approval process to help us build the infrastructure around transmission and generation to serve that load and also providing credit accretive, for instance, in Mississippi, allowing for cash CWIP during the construction of those facilities, allowing us to ﬁnance those projects and lower the overall cost for customers.  If you think about those dimensions, the rest of the states are taking notice of the success in Mississippi from purely a competitive standpoint or trying to ﬁgure out how to replicate that -- those types of frameworks in their jurisdictions. But we think it's a blueprint that really projects well for our other states.    Yeah. And I'll just add that given what Rod just outlined, our regulators and our communities are excited about these potential investments. They are large investments that are going to throw oﬀ a bunch of tax and hollers and provide some really good jobs. And we are areas in Central and Northern Mississippi, Northern Louisiana and in Arkansas, there's a lot of rural space out there that data centers can go to and those jobs are meaningful in those areas.  So they're really excited about the opportunity for those investments and the economic activity that comes along with them. That's why, as Rod said, they're competing to ﬁgure out how they can serve these potential customers."
"Great to hear. And then on one other topic, just in terms of the Texas resiliency ﬁling is giving your service territory, is there any opportunity to add a ﬁre mitigation or wildﬁre mitigation risk management as a plan?","Yeah, that's a great question. And where we are along the coast in Texas, a lot of the resilience investments and the wildﬁre investment is going to be very similar and overlapping. So yes, that is going to be part of it. I'm sure that wildﬁre is going to be a part of the conversational legislature coming up early next year. And so we do anticipate that there will be some overlap there. I'll just mention, further away from the coast in Mississippi, Northern Louisiana, Arkansas, we are also thinking about wildﬁre mitigation investment there to complement all the things that we've already done to monitor and prepare, and respond to potential wildﬁres and all the community work that we're doing.  But we realize that the next piece of that is the investment to mitigate or eliminate wildﬁre risk. And so that conversation is ongoing with our stakeholders. And so we'll be looking to create opportunities to manage those risks for all of our stakeholders in the near future."
Thanks for taking my questions.,Thank you.    Operator  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Your line is now open.
"Thank you. Hello, everyone. One on the new industrial customers, including both data centers and the other industrial customers. What's the general split in terms of the CapEx between T&D and generation that you're anticipating?","There's both there, Travis. The transmission certainly generally is less than the generation, but some of it is timing. When you think about we have long-term supply plans and where we may have had generation in a plan and perhaps there's some earlier execution of it in order to meet that demand. And as you know, we're in MISO, so transmission is planned through MISO as well. And so we also have long- range planning on the transmission.  So I don't have the exact split and I know you can get with Bill and get that speciﬁcally. But generally, when you think about the data centers probably heavier weighted to generation than to transmission."
Okay. And then do you anticipate on that generation piece doing an RFP or would you have ﬁrst strikes to any kind of new-generation build?,"In Mississippi, the legislation enabled us to -- it eﬀectively gave us CCN authority to build what was needed for that data center to meet their timeline. And so that doesn't require an RFP process. Some of our jurisdictions have RFPs and others don't. I think it comes down to a customer timeline and how you work with all your stakeholders to bring the customer on the timeline they're looking for and then what that requires to ensure that we are building strong appropriate assets in order to support the customers overall."
"Okay. And then general, the comments here you just made in general are for any industrial customer or more for data versus other chemical producers or factories,       etcetera?","Yeah, I mean the data center is --"
In general time [ph]?,"Sorry, the data center is unique and then it's a larger customer coming in at one time on a faster timeline, but I would think about the planning principle for same for all of our customers."
"Okay, great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Absolutely. Thank you.    Operator  There are no further questions as of right now. I'd like to hand back the call over to Mr. Abler. Thank you.
