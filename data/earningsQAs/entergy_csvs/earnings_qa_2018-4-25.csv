Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning.  Good morning, Shah."
"So let me just start oﬀ by asking on the performance of your decommissioning trust funds. Obviously, the performance for the quarter was somewhat materially less than your expectation. So can you kind of, one: elaborate what drove this? And more importantly, does your fundamental view point that you exit EWC in a cash ﬂow positive position and I'll put the question. Because what you saw, and do you sort of see any impact on the sales process with the performance?","Okay. Shah, this is Drew. And your ﬁrst question about the drivers. I think it's just the - - it's the accounting change that reﬂected the equity markets over the course of the quarter. And so, of course, last year we did not have to mark-to-market the equity fees. We only saw the realized gains and losses associated with the trust. And this year -- and the rest of it was in other comprehensive income. This year, all of it's ﬂowing through the income statement.  And as part of that, as we went to this accounting change, we actually moved 600 -- about a $600 million positive into retained earnings. It didn't go through the income statement, it was just re-classed on the balance sheet from other comprehensive income. So those are the things that were going on there. And of course, we also had some of the portfolio management activities that we talked about last quarter that were derisking our portfolio. So, our overall loss was a very slight loss compared to maybe an equity market loss, a couple percent over the quarter.  And as regards to our EWC plans, it doesn't change anything overall for EWC plans or for cash expectations towards the end of the -- through 2022. So we still expect 2017 to 2022 to be neutral or positive. In fact, as we were thinking about this earlier, here we are pressure testing these -- several things that could happen to make sure that we can sustain that statements through any volatility that we might see in the markets."
"Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just I appreciate the comments that you had on the equity. But your prior thoughts or language seem to point that you were more shifting toward something more market based versus initiation of an internal program. So is that sort of still kind of what you're tilting or should we assume sort of a combination of both given sort of the size of the potential oﬀering. So sort of like, how is your thought process generally evolving?","Yeah. So, we are still -- we still have all our options on the table because we are thinking about optimizing against the timing and the need with the markets and the cost that we might incur associate with that. So all those things are still on the table. And they likely be later this year when we get into the market."
"Okay. Thanks, guys.","Thank you.  Thank you, Shah.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Julien.  Good morning."
"Hey. So wanted to chat on transmission, brieﬂy. Clearly there were some events in the quarter with respect to sort of North and South integration that transpired. Also I suppose, in the settlement itself in Louisiana, there's been discussion about capital spending. Can you discuss sort of the state of aﬀairs and process with respect to MISO and your own capital budgeting plans around that. And I acknowledge that, this may preempt little bit at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to delve into it, if you could?","Julien, this is Rod. One, we are staying in MISO and much of the capital planning for the utility business is consistent with the MTEP processes through 2017, certainly 2018 and beyond. The signiﬁcance of the settlement in Louisiana plays along with that. Part of that 9.95 [ph] resets in our Louisiana FRP includes an expectation of about $0.5 billion a year during the period in transmission alone. And so, the capital plan is consistent with our expectations around our earnings opportunity and the growth in CapEx will be fueled in part by what comes out of the MTEP process with MISO."
"Just to be clear about it, is there anything that's shifted in the MTEP process with respect to some of the limitations on the North-South capacity. I suppose, this Winter, there were some events?",No.
"Okay, excellent. And the 0.5 billion is consistent with the 8.45 [ph] as well.",When you say the 8.45 [ph]?
The '18 to '20 average for preliminary transmission capital plan.,"Yes, yes. Thank you."
Excellent. Thank you.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open."
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.  Good morning."
"Just -- I thought, I heard, you say and I may have misheard this. Apologize, if so. As of March 31, the decommissioning funds were approximately $4 billion.",That's correct.
"So can you help us, deﬁnitely that might not be on the same basis as the slide 29, where the escalated funding adds up to about 5.8 as of 12.31. And then the question is, sort of when you say escalated, can you just remind us what that means?","That's using the 2% growth rate. But the -- I think where you want to look, there is a diﬀerent slide in there, that I believe has -- on slide 25 in the appendix, has the NDT balances as of March 31. That's on slide 25."
"Okay. So, that's the one.",Correct.
"But it is -- that's not on the same basis right, as the --","No. They are escalated, that's using the NRC funding formulas on the other page. I apologize for that confusion. We will make sure to clarify that."
That's ﬁne. That was really -- I just wanted to get that straight. Thank you.,No problem.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
"Hi, guys. Thanks.","Good morning, Praful.     Good morning, Praful."
"So, ﬁrstly just on -- hi. So, just on earnings, in terms of where you are tracking relative to your guidance, I know there was some talk on -- not at the lower end, where exactly do you see yourself now given Q1 is kind of done at in terms of 2018 EPS guidance?","Yeah. That's a good question, Praful. And I think, we're expecting to be about in the middle at this point, I mean, it's early in the year. We have a lot of levers to manage the current volatility in the decommissioning trust. And so we are expecting on an operational basis to be about the middle, when it's all said and done. For Utility, Parent & Other, we are right on track as of the ﬁrst quarter, so there wouldn't be any change there."
"Okay, great. That's helpful. And then secondly on this unprotected DTL refunds, they look meaningful and clearly it looks like you are doing them sooner than you had originally planned. So just to understand the impacts of that from the cash ﬂow side and the credit side, I'm assuming that's a negative, but you're saying you're going to recover from that pretty quickly. Just touch on that a little bit.  And then secondly on the rate base side that should probably be a positive helping your growth. So if you can just help us understand the kind of implications of the decommissioning unprotected (inaudible) deferred income tax refund impacts?","Sure. In regards to the cash and the credit metrics and the pay, so we were anticipating when we talked last quarter a little slower pace on how fast the unprotected excess ADIT would be ﬂowing back to customers. And now it's little faster. So the expectation is the way that that's going to work from an income statement perspective, as it will be no eﬀect, but we'll be getting less revenue in the door, which would be a cash item and we'll also be experiencing lower income tax expense, which will be a non-cash item on the income statement.  So that will oﬀset there, the ﬂow into the cash ﬂow metrics. And so the measures that we were talking about are the metrics like FFO to debt. Last quarter we talked about 14% on a longer-term basis. Now we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that upfront, but we will recover much quicker. And so by 2020, we expect to be above that level, because of the more rapid return of the unprotected excess ADIT.  And from a rate base perspective, we would expect that as -- and we haven't ﬁnished it in our regulatory process. But as we return unprotected excess ADIT to customers,     our net rate base are to increase. And so, on the last call we talked about opportunity for about $1 billion of increased net rate base by 2020. We still expect that to be the case associated with the return of the excess ADIT, both protected and unprotected by the way for that."
"Super helpful. Thanks, Drew.","Thank you, Praful.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open."
"Yeah, thanks. I guess two clariﬁcations. Just on a comment on the middle of the range for this year that you're tracking to. Is that good for both the overall company and Utility, Parent and Other?","Yeah. (inaudible) that one too ﬁrst Steve. This is Drew. So, yeah, we have several levers that we think we can pull to manage the operational spot. But, as far as Utility, Parent & Other, we are right on track to begin with."
"Okay. And then, just in terms of thinking about the comment on the ADIT get back and alike, so to a degree, you have this kind of lower upfront metrics, does that kind of (inaudible) to get the equity issuance done sooner. And then just to kind of manage the consistency of the metrics or is that -- is the fact that you get there by 2019, 2020. That's ﬁne for the agencies, they don't care if it's lower for one year.","Yeah. So this is Drew. So, in terms of the overall timing of the excess ADIT return, it is moving forward. And we were and are trying to match up our excess of the equity capital markets to that in some way. So it's going to move it forward a little bit, but the rating agencies are certainly aware that we are going to access the equity capital markets there looking at that, plus a number of other factors like our progress on changing our business risk proﬁle at EWC and the positive regulatory environment within the utility that's improving. So they are taking a number of things into consideration. I think, only one of which is making sure that we match up the timing of the equity with the return of those cash ﬂows."
"Okay. And then just on the -- kind of on a long-term discussion -- I mean, it sounds like the plan overall is to kind of just continue with more of what you're already doing, and then obviously help these how this better regulatory structures in place to recover it. Is that kind of at a high level, what the plan is? And obviously you're trying to kind of get ahead on changes in the generation mix and customer experience and technology, things like that. Does that --","Yes, Steve. The bottom line is that, as we have been for really over 10 years now, we're in a major technological improvement of the entire system. Started in generation, worked its way in the transmission and now it's getting more into distribution. And I would say, in some respects, you start to see a melding of some of the distribution opportunities with the kind of generation opportunities we have. So we continue to have an aging generation ﬂeet that we're updating in terms of what we've got going on right now, St. Charles, Lake Charles, Montgomery County, Washington Parish Energy Center, and the New Orleans Power Station.  The 1,000 megawatts of renewables that I talked about are things that would come into play to both -- on the one-hand replace other aging generation that we would deactivate as new generation comes in line, but they come in line as renewables because they're both, a, competitive with generation that they would replace, certainly the market and potentially as we go forward with other types of generation, but also some of them have distribution reliability opportunities as well, which start to be more localized with generation. So you're not necessarily avoiding a generation investment, you're avoiding a large transmission investment.  So those kinds of technological improvements plus distribution, automation and other things that we could pursue that would allow us to better operate to create lower cost to our customers, improve reliability and get close to them in solutions. All of that we see is just a continuation of the process we've been undergoing. From a regulatory front, you're right. What we've done over the course of the last ﬁve years in particular is we've taken the opportunity to outline the types of investments that we need to make for our regulators and allow us to sink up that regulatory model to match the customer beneﬁts that we're providing with the investments.  Excuse me. So for example, what we've done with transmission in Louisiana and the new FRP lines up really well with what was a big source of regulatory lag and a big sources of dollars for our customers in the transmission space. So we already had AMI and generations covered really well. Now we've got transmission in the same bucket that get a little bit more closely aligned with the regulatory mix, with the type of investments we're making.  So you're right, the future is just improved technological advancements on the system across all functions and trying to make sure that we and our regulators work to beneﬁt our customers with the most eﬃcient regulatory model that we can get."
"Okay, great. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen.    Good morning, Stephen."
"I wanted to touch base on just nuclear operations at a high level, and just get your latest thoughts in terms of operational improvements, how you think about the trajectory of just really, again core operations and sort of the trajectories from here. I had good progress over time in terms of operation improvements. Just curious, sort of your latest thoughts there.","Stephen, I'll start and I'll let Chris jump in. But the bottom line is, we are continuing to spend the signiﬁcant amount of resources and eﬀort on our nuclear ﬂeet. And we're seeing progress in the areas we expected to see progress. As I think Chris outlined, when we ﬁrst began, it's going to take a few years and then a couple of outages new facility to get the equipment in the place that we need to get, but we hired a 1,000 people last year in the nuclear -- in the nuclear ﬂeet. That's some O&M, that we had expected, that Drew mentioned, that we showed up in the ﬁrst quarter, but at a high level I'd say that we are making progress in the way we expected.    And I'd just follow up with that. Leo, this is Chris. We are where we expected to be in terms of the execution of the plan. As we did outline at the last Investor Day, you are looking at two to three year period before you start to see signiﬁcant improvement. We believe we're on track with that. We've been using the opportunities with the refueling outages, some improvement in safety and the reliability margins as planned. And from a regulatory relations perspective, as you mentioned in the opening remarks, Leo, we do expect to see ANO return back to normal NRC oversight at the end of the second quarter. So we've been making good progress."
"Okay, helpful. And then just shifting over to, Leo, the renewables investment opportunity you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Without getting into the speciﬁcs around some of those projects, is it something where we should expect a fairly material ﬁling where you are proposing a number of projects that total quite a bit of megawatts you mentioned -- 1,000 megawatts plus of potential opportunities.  In other words, this is likely to result in a fairly chunky ﬁling or request or is it likely to be, relatively smaller in just sort of building momentum over time as you get more projects develop. How should we sort of think of that progressing.","At this point, I would say, this is fairly ratable at some point in time. But right now what we're in the midst of is the couple of RFPs that were out there in terms of negotiating some of those projects. Got a couple that we've announced, that are PPAs. And obviously some of these are going to end up being owned as I mentioned on the last call.  The majority of the dollars that you would see, which show up kind of if when they do at the end or outside of the current outlooks that we provided. As you might guess, we are in discussions with things, most of which would show up in the 2020 and beyond timeframe.  Some of the projects could be decent sized, but it's our objective. As I mentioned earlier to the last question is just that, we continue to evaluate these on two fronts. One is, as new generation resources, but also given the nature of how you can locate and the speed with which they can be put together where they would make transmission sense as well. So we are excited about the opportunity, a lot of it has to do with how the cost curves move over the next few years as well."
All right. That's all I have. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.,
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Real quickly on the nuclear O&M. Really O&M is the utility in general. Do you anticipate in guidance O&M at the utility being up more than an inﬂationary level for 2018, and then how do you think about what the trajectory looks like, like what's embedded in the 2019 and 2020 guidance.","So, Michael, this is Drew. Yeah. So in the 2018, I think we're still consistent with our expectations. I mentioned earlier that we're looking at some opportunities to help close the gap on the NDT performance through March 31. And so we're working through some of that, but as of now in our guidance expectations, I don't think there's really much of a change.  Looking forward, I guess then you had a question speciﬁcally around nuclear. As we have mentioned, we hired a 1,000 people over the last year. We are just going to hire some this year. The eﬀect of that payroll change is most acute in the ﬁrst quarter. And so, it will -- the aﬀect of it will lessen over the next few quarters, but we also have -- even though it's still larger, we have some projects that we had last year that will even out the overall O&M spending for nuclear during the course of the year. So it will be comparable to 2017, by the end of the year. Looking forward, in terms of 2019 and 2020, I think we have a little under inﬂation expectations for O&M growth, nothing, nothing dramatic at this point."
"Got it. And I want to make sure I understand coming back to the return of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. Can you help me understand what the oﬀset is? I get the cash outﬂow and kind of the accounting around the cash outﬂow. But can you walk me through what makes it, what kind of oﬀsets that over -- you know, that hurts near-term FFO to debt, but can you walk me through how it might help longer- term?","Sure. Well, just after we ﬁnish giving the $1 billion back that eﬀect will stop being in our FFO measure. So what you're seeing is lower net revenue while we're giving that money back. And to the extent that you lengthen that out. If you are going four or ﬁve years with that give back, you would see a depressed FFO number for that period of time. The way it's shaping up is we're going to given it back over the next 18 months. So it will depress FFO maybe more so than we are planning, but by the time we get out to 2020 that eﬀect for the unprotected fee should go away."
Got it.,But your FFO to debt measure should improve.
"Got it. And then one last one and I don't know if to Leo or Rod question, but you guys have added or in the process of adding a lot of generation in both Louisiana and Texas, which makes a ton of sense giving the industrial petchem related demand that's occurring in that quarter [ph].     Just curious as you look at Arkansas and Mississippi, are there over the next few years or beyond opportunities for conventional generation either additions or re- powerings? And when I'm thinking through this, I'm thinking there were some higher heat rate units in both states that maybe aren't as suﬃcient as kind of newer technology, newer gas ﬁre technologies are. You still have a sizable coal unit in Arkansas with that lacks signiﬁcant pollution controls. I'm just trying to think about those two states as drivers of kind of future rate base growth after going through the cycle you're going through right now in Louisiana and Texas.","If you think about what our generation moves have been over the course of last 10 years, Michael, that actually have been generation that we've acquired in Mississippi and Arkansas. Both, it's all the same strategy, the majority of the generation and has to do with age and the eﬃciency as you mentioned with the existing ﬂeet that we had. So as we deactivate those less eﬃcient higher cost, less environmentally friendly units, we are replacing those with a combination of acquired units whether it'd be union, (inaudible) the long list of things that we've already acquired or the new bills like St. Charles, Lake Charles and Montgomery County, Ninemile 6, et cetera.  So, in those other jurisdictions that will be there as well on the ﬁrst -- on the last quarter call, we identiﬁed, I think that somebody asked the question about new generation dollars that hadn't showed up. Those had shown up as one of those others jurisdictions because of that same need. And as you mentioned, down the road, we do have the coal plants that certainly gas has become very, very competitive with coal and depending on what happens with environmental regulations, et cetera.  So the short answer is, yes, we do see the need for new generating resources across all of our jurisdictions, not just Louisiana and Texas. And in fact over the last decade, we've seen us add generation in New Orleans, Mississippi and Arkansas as well. Going forward, it'd probably be a combination of looking at new gas, but also some of the projects have already been announced, for example, the Stuttgart project in Arkansas versus PPA, that's a renewable resources.  So we should start to see renewables, battery storage, those sorts of things show up at some point in time in there too as they become competitive. So yes, those ﬂeets are aging as well. And yeah, we'll end up with new generating resources there."
"Got it. Thank you, Leo. Much appreciated, guys.",Thank you.  Operator     Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open.
Good morning. How are you?,"Good morning, Paul.  Good morning, Paul."
"Just really quickly to sort of follow up on Shah and Jonathan's question on decommissioning. There was a letter that the NRC sent with respect to Vermont Yankee, basically indicating that they didn't believe that there was enough information to make them feel comfortable with the ability to decommission the plant and given the information that you guys have provided today, and just in general, it's a little surprising considering that everything else in terms of the decommissioning funds seems ﬁne. So can you elaborate a little bit on what the issue there and how that's going to be resolved?","Hey, Paul, it's Drew. That's just a part of the normal NRC processes. There was a request for additional information, and our expectation is that, we are -- I guess in that case probably NorthStar responded to that at Vermont Yankee. And so that, I think it's just part of the normal back and forth. We didn't see anything particular in that we are concerned about at this point."
"Okay. So I mean, just to clarify this, through, they've felt all along there's enough decommissioning funding. Is it just simply because of the transaction taking place and NorthStar hasn't given them the information. Is that what we're dealing with here, I guess?","Well, in the normal course of business like the ﬁlings that you saw that Jonathan referenced on page 29, that was more formulaic. And so when we go through a speciﬁc transaction, they are going to dig much deeper into the ﬁnancials of the buyer. And we totally expect that and understand why they're doing it. And so we will consider that like I said, just part of the normal process compared to that normal annual ﬁlings which are very formulaic in nature."
"Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.",No problem.  Operator  Thank you. And our ﬁnal question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Your line is now open.
"Thank you. Just one more question on slide 29, which I believe is a new slide. The site-speciﬁc study, so one at Indian Point 1 and also in Vermont Yankee, that takes place after the unit was shut down, and then at that point, you make a decision whether you pursue a NorthStar type solution or something else. Is that the process?","Sure. So site-speciﬁc studies can happen in a couple of ways. If it -- like you said, if you're shutting down the plant, you will give a site-speciﬁc study to assess the overall cost of the facility and match that up against the trust and make sure that your adequately funded.  If you are having, then this doesn't happen very often, but there are ways that you could also do it on an ongoing basis during the operation, normal operations when you do these formulaic assessments. If you didn't get all the funding you need in the formulaic assessment, you can't do a site-speciﬁc study to see if you meet NRC requirements. But typically, I think as Paul was pointing out, Charles, I think you would do that at the end of the year or at the end of the life of the unit."
Okay. And then also make the decision of what process to pursue whether it's a NorthStar or something else?,"Sure. I mean, I think you would do it relative to a same store environment or an environment where you would more rapidly decommission the asset. Or if you -- but if you're going to go through a sale process like we have at NorthStar, that's almost like a separate assessment than what you're seeing on page 29. Page 29 is more of the normal stuﬀ."
"Okay, got it. Thank you very much. That was helpful.","Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. That's our last question in queue, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Borde for closing remarks.    Thank you, James, and thanks to everyone for participating this morning. Before we close, I remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G Compliance statements. Our annual report on Form 10-Q is due to the SEC on Monday on May 10th and provides more details and disclosures about our ﬁnancial statements. Events that occur prior to the date of our 10-Q ﬁling that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet would be reﬂected in our ﬁnancial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Finally as a reminder, we maintain a web page as part of Entergy's Investor Relations website called Regulatory and Other Information, which provides key updates of regulatory proceedings and important milestones on our strategic execution. While some of this information maybe considered material information, you should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information. And this concludes our call. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you very much for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.
