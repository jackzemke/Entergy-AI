Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. It's Julien here.","Good morning, Julien.    Good morning, Julien."
"So, I wanted to just dig into the guidance a little bit further here. Can you expand, and I know you alluded to it already, but what exactly is driving the tax changes? Can you elaborate here a little bit and what you think about a normalized tax rate would be in subsequent years or just kind of in a generic year?","Julien, this is Drew. That's a good question. If you look back over the last ﬁve years, we have had an operational eﬀective tax rate in the range of what we're talking about. I think corporate wise, it's been about 26% and at the Utility, it's been about 23%. So, what we're talking about is not unusual in that regard and as we look forward, this year, when we usually talk about these things, we talk about a portfolio of opportunities and it's still certainly no diﬀerent now. We have a portfolio of opportunities that we're looking at in 2015 and by laying it all out this year upfront, we're trying to give you a better view of what we expect this year. Beyond 2015, certainly, our expectations continue to be that we will look for opportunities because that is one of the largest items of our income statement, but just to make sure that we are all clear about what the underlying business expectations are, we haven't – we put statutory tax rates in for 2016 and our 2017 outlook that we rolled forward today.  So, as far as 2015 goes, like I said, it is a portfolio of opportunities. We have a number of cases that are rolling forward with various tax authorities and it's based on what     our expectations are today. Certainly nothing is guaranteed in that because there are ongoing discussions, but that's the best estimate that we have today. It could be higher or lower than that by the end of the year."
"And just relative to the initial guidance, you kind of laid out there, at the time of EEI, what exactly changed if you could elaborate brieﬂy?","So, I think it just has to do with some of our expectations about what's going to transpire, particularly, towards the end of the year. And our desire to make sure that our investors were fully informed about what the possibilities could be rather than get surprised. Even if it's an upside at the end of the year, we certainly didn't want to land that in your lap as a surprise."
"Great. Excellent. And then just coming back to the other side of the house here on the EWC front, what are you thinking about sort of or what gives you conﬁdence rather in still having kind of a long-term bullish perspective; obviously, you have a view on 2017? What are you seeing out there? Is it capacity? Is it energy? I mean could you elaborate a little bit?","Sure, Julien, this is Bill. A couple things from – in the long run as we look at gas supply, obviously, we're seeing a huge cutback in drilling, so we think that eventually that will have an impact, a bullish impact on natural gas prices. As it relates to heat rates, we think that those are also undervalued in the market as you think about the number of shutdowns, either economic shutdowns or shutdowns due to environmental reasons, we remain bullish on heat rates. And we are seeing some positive changes in the capacity markets such as what was evidenced recently this week up in New England."
"All right. Great. Well, thank you, guys.",Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. You may begin.
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Dan.    Good morning."
"Hey, if I just kind of look at what you guys did in 2014 and you look at 2015 at the Utility level, right, and if we back out the beneﬁcial tax rate, 2014 being pretty close to statutory, 2015 being much lower. It looks like your earnings are a lot closer to ﬂat year-on-year – I know there's always going to be moving parts, but how should we think about earned ROEs this year for 2015 and then 2016, 2017, how you get to your earned ROEs if that tax rate does normalize?","I'll take a ﬁrst crack at this and then Theo can jump in. So – and I'll let Theo talk about ROEs. I'll talk about the big drivers for the earnings blocks as – particularly as we move forward. So, I think you're right in terms of 2014 to 2015, we are not seeing substantial growth because we don't have a lot of rate actions, but as you look forward certainly this year, we have some signiﬁcant investment opportunities. We're talking about like Union Power and those kinds of things that we expect to come on at the end of the year as well as rate opportunities within Arkansas and Texas. And those are going to be the main drivers that are going to push us forward to sort of the 2016-2017 timeframe. And I'll let Theo talk about the ROEs in particular.    Hi, Dan, this is Theo. I mean I think when you look at 2015 ROE, I think you see an ROE that it's slightly below 10%, not much diﬀerent from 2014. I think as you've somewhat illuminated on. But I think as you go forward through 2016 and you look at the things Drew just mentioned earlier, sales growth, the fact that the Union purchase goes into – plan it into rates in – anticipate it goes in rates in 2016.  And also, you see some changes relative to some of our O&M levels pension cost. I want to mention you'll see those ROEs start to move as we have said many times that EEI and other venues in the 10% to 11% range in 2016.  As you look at the various operating companies, we see ourselves making constructive progress at Arkansas as it relates to moving towards the allowed ROE as a result of 2015 plant rate case and other actions in Arkansas. The growth that we see in Louisiana, we'll move our Louisiana utilities. I think when you look at it on a combined basis, you will see that company at within its earnings band range based on its 1995 allowed ROE.  And I think as you look to Mississippi, New Orleans, we see those companies also earning at their allowed ROEs when we get into the 2016 timeframe. Texas gets     closer, we'd see growth in Texas as well and also we would, because of the Union acquisition, we'll have a rate case in Texas to move forward with that and so, we'll see some – likely see some rate change in Texas as well. So, all of that, as you look across the jurisdictions, we moved closer, but those that aren't at that point today, they move closer to or get to their allowed ROE and, overall, as we've said over the past few months and now you see Utility business that's in a 10% to 11% ROE range."
"So, I guess, thank you for that Theo. But, if you think about kind of next year and beyond eﬀectively the $0.95 of tax that you presumably could go away next year, you're thinking that the Texas case, the Arkansas case and putting Union in a rate base should more than compensate for that headwind. Is that the way if you're going to simply balance things out?","Yeah. I think you see the right actions and, again, as well as I think we'll see some O&M impacts as well as we go into 2016."
"Okay. And I guess one dumb question. If the discount rate stays at the same level, was is it ended of last year? What happens to pension expense beyond 2015? As you say, catch up year or would it stay at these levels, so that would be ﬂat year-over-year comp?","No – that's an excellent question. No, it would actually; it would go up. So, we build our forecasts with a interest rate increases as the market tells us in mind, and mark- to-market, if you will, it's not exactly like a mark-to-market, but it's similar. And so, we're anticipating interest rate rises, which should mean lower pension liabilities, which will mean lower pension expense. And so, right now, we are anticipating in 2017, a 5% discount rate on a pension liability and as I mentioned that's 4.27% is where we ended the year. So that would be somewhere in the neighborhood of about $0.20 of earnings, $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share impact if we were sort of ﬂat to where we are today versus our expectations for 2017."
"Okay, got it. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. You may begin.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul."
"Just on the 2015 guidance, you guys mentioned that there's an increase in depreciation and decommissioning for 2015 and you talked about, I just wonder if you could just review that a little bit in terms of what's driving the increase in depreciation expense and decommissioning at the wholesale business at the non- regulate business?","Okay. This is Drew. So, I mean I think it's due to just normal activities. The depreciation is the higher – is the capital investment that we've made at EWC in 2014. And then the decommissioning expense is, as we get closer to the end of these lives, particularly, as you shorten up your expectations that decommissioning expense is going to rise naturally as you go out that direction. So, I think it's just the normal expectations based on capital investment and shortening life of the assets."
"So the capital investment that you're making, the actual plant value of the nuclear plants is increasing as the lifespan of the plant is decreasing, is that correct?","Certainly, from a GAAP accounting perspective that you're seeing, largely, you're growing the asset base still right now and it is as you are getting to a shorter life expectancy, you're having that greater depreciation, yes."
And we should expect that to continue going forward?,"Yes. Yeah. I mean, well, like you said, last year, I think or maybe just two years ago, we did a depreciation study to try and balance it out a little bit. So, it's less dramatic than it would have been before. But..."
Right.,"...certainly, you will see some of that still going forward, yes."
Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen."
"I wanted to discuss a hedging strategy from here. And just given the environment that we're in and your point of view, would you want to be a bit more cautious in terms of hedging in the expectation of improving heat rates et cetera or how do you think about sort of your hedge philosophy at this point?","Stephen, this is Bill. Well, absolutely we think about that. So, given the point of view that we just discussed earlier, as we look into the outer years, we want to be very careful about the products that we use. So, that we – not necessarily really interested in a lot of ﬁxed price products at this point in time.  So, we look to move more towards structured products that have that asymmetric upside. Obviously, that depends on a lot of things, counter parties, cost of the products, et cetera. But we are carefully looking at that strategy as we speak, speciﬁcally, as it relates to 2016 and 2017."
"Okay. And just shifting to Indian Point, speciﬁcally, there is a recent, I guess, a state ruling regarding just the hearing process around potential summer shutdowns for tax eﬃcient Hudson River. Could you give us a sense of just procedurally that the process, through which that hearing will take place, just so we can try to focus on next steps and understand that process?","Sure. That ruling just did come out this week. So, kind of from a high level perspective by February 20. Riverkeeper and the staﬀ needs to make some recommendations, as it relates to, speciﬁcally, what it thinks. It would like to recommend in terms of the outages that will go through the normal discovery process, probably more or less throughout the summer. And then, in the fall, we will actually have a hearing on the issues of outages, and then hope to get some initial replied briefs by the end of the year."
"Okay. And then, in terms of after the reply briefs, what would the step after that?","Well, depending on what happens there then you would work through an appeal process, et cetera. To kind of sum it up, Stephen, I mean we think this process probably goes on for several years before you get any ﬁnal determination."
"Oh I see. So, there could be a decision late in the year or early next year, but then there will be – there could be various appeals after that.",That's correct.
Okay. Thanks very much.,"Thank you, Stephen.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. You may begin."
Good morning guys.,Good morning Jonathan.
"One quick question on: when you gave the sensitivity on interest rates, and the discount rate just now on the pension, so I think it was $0.20 impact on 2017 if the       discount rates increase did not materialize, is that a holistic estimate including, your exposure to short-term debt or is that just the pension?","That was just the pension and I was trying to do math on the ﬂy. I tried to widen my range out a little bit. But I think $0.08 is our rule of thumb on 25 basis points. So $0.20 to $0.25 is probably a better estimate for that, but, yes, it doesn't include the interest rate oﬀset."
"Okay. And the second point was, I was just curious on your – you have the slides with the 2017 point of view, but you also have the 2018, 2019 disclosures in Table seven of the release. Can you share with us what capacity price was embedded in that for the option that just happened? Yeah, you did...",You're talking about for ISO New England?
"Yeah, I am guessing it wasn't updated overnight, but it might have been your point of view that was in there?","I think it is in our point of view. So, you know that the option results for both Pilgrim and RISEC came back for the SEMA zone at about 1108 KW for that option."
Right. Is that what was in your Table here?,I think it's fairly close to what we had. I mean I think we had talked about that. We anticipated it would be net coned (46:35).
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thank you, Jonathan.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. You may begin."
"Hey, guys, can you talk to us a little about your plans in Arkansas. You've hinted at times about trying to seek legislative relief. Just trying to think about the timing of trying to do that and what type of relief or what type of mechanism should like to seek versus the timing and process for a potential full blown rate case there?","Yeah, Mike. Well, this is Theo. I mean I guess I'll start with, we believe in Arkansas. We're starting from a common goal, common goal with those that are in state, we believe with commissioners as well as state local oﬃcials, which is really about attracting jobs, supporting economic development, growth and regional prosperity in the state.  When you think about legislative actions that we've talked about, and we said this before. The legislature is currently in session now in Arkansas. And any legislative actions would clearly go through the legislative processes within the current session. In terms of the diﬀerent, what may be a part of that, I think as we said before, we would be looking at mechanisms that would align Arkansas with some mechanisms we see in other jurisdictions across our service area.  Things like, for instance, FRP, FRPs, maybe similar to what we saw in Mississippi that has various forward-looking elements that recently came out of the Mississippi case. And also, I think one thing we would look to try and address in Arkansas is really given the commission some criteria, other than kind of a simple DCF method to determine ROE. I mean really this is really about giving the commissioners some, I think, more tools in a toolbox, sort of really giving them various options they can look at, again, in a diﬀerent way at Arkansas that would help achieve the common goal that I talked about earlier. So, with the legislative session going on from a timing perspective, I would expect that we'd follow some legislation around us and around these various components in the next few weeks in Arkansas."
"Got it. So, we should probably think that any rate ﬁlings wouldn't happen until after the legislative session closes. So, kind of thinking about a mid-year case that implies a mid-year 2016 revenue change?","Well, I think if you look – I mean, honestly, Leo mentioned in his opening comments that we did provide notice that we would a ﬁle case in Arkansas, I believe in 60 days to 90 days. So – and we did that at the end of January. If you count from that point in time, you're sometime in March-April timeframe in terms of ﬁling a case. And given the statutory timelines in Arkansas that would probably put you with, if I'm doing my math correctly in my head, a rate eﬀective timeline somewhere at the beginning potentially of 2016."
Got it. Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated.,"Great. Thanks, Michael.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. You may begin."
"Thank you. Leo, you made comments concerning the way the board would look at the dividend in 2016 at EEI. If I take slide 10 on your 2017 outlook, the way I understood those comments at EEI, I should look at the Utility, net income, your outlook, less Parent & Other. And it appears to me you're probably, by 2017, you're getting close to the payout range you want to be in. Is that a fair assessment that the board and the way the board would look at it?","Yeah. When we – I think even when we were talking back at EEI, the view is that we'll start to have the conversation with the board when we start to look at 2016 and 2017's results. If you look – and you're exactly right. What we're talking about this the payout ratio around Utility combined with Parent & Other, as the dividend paying entity that we would be looking to, excluding EWC, of course, given the volatility associated with that kind of business. But, as we start to look at what 2016 and 2017 hold and what those combined earnings will be, we think that that's when the conversation begins with the board.  As we've mentioned that a lot factors will go into that in addition to just what those earnings levels are. So, for example, the investment proﬁle, what's going to happen in terms of our investments in the Utility in 2016 and 2017 and if it makes sense to reinvest versus the dividend or raise the dividend because we have the growth path there. So, you're right about the metrics and like I said the timing would show up right around the – as we look at the 2016 and 2017 earnings proﬁle."
Okay. Thanks for the additional color. That's it.    Operator  Thank you. Our last question is from Andy Levi of Avon Capital. You may begin.,
"Hi. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Andy.    Good morning."
"Hey, just a few questions, I'll keep it at to two, two and a half. Just back on the taxes, I guess, the concern I have that it is about $0.90 of earnings power. So, if you kind of back that out, 2015 actually looks kind of weak. And so, I'm just kind of want to understand your thinking on that and why that is the case because if you kind of just put a Utility multiple on it, it's quite a bit of value, $10, $15 of value in the stock. And then I have a follow-up.","Okay, Andy. This is Drew. And I think the way we're thinking about it is 2015 is sort of a foundation year for the growth opportunity that we have over the next couple years. And as we look at it, I mean we're really focused on making sure that we put the building blocks in place for making that 2017 aspiration. Taxes are a big piece of what we do every day and we manage them as well as we can, like every other line item on the income statement. And like I said earlier, it's not out of line with where we have been in terms an eﬀective tax rate over the last ﬁve years. So, we think this is part of our normal operating procedure and this year, it's – there's a couple of lumpy items in there that are helping us get there. But this is part of our expectation and what we expect to do every day when we come to work."
"No, I understand that, but again, I'm not going to debate it with you, but if you go back to your Regulation G disclosures, your statutory tax rate's 36%. So, I'm just trying to look at the true earnings power longer term of the company. The follow-up I have, this is on Pilgrim, I guess, since the big snowstorm the plant's been out. If you can kind of give us an update there and if I'm not mistaken, you were supposed to have an outage in 2015 on Pilgrim. And so, whether this unforced outage will help on the scheduled outage that you had, or is this just an unfortunate outage event in the spring, you'll go into your regular outage and also the cost of having the plant down during this time of year?",
"Yeah, Andy, this is Bill. So, to answer the question regarding Pilgrim, the plant shutdown due to Storm Juno shutdown orderly, safely, without incident on the 27th. We did lose oﬀsite power to the facility. However, all safety systems and backup power systems worked as planned. So, we've been working through that. Dealing with a number of issues, we expect that plant to start up in the near-term in the next couple of days and be back to full load probably sometime this weekend. As it relates to the planned outage, we do have a refueling outage that's scheduled in the     spring that remains unchanged. So, we still need to refuel the facility and perform normal maintenance on that facility as we originally planned. So, nothing really changes there.",
"And then I have one really very quick question. On just EWC, I didn't see any CapEx numbers for 2015. Is that something that you guys disclose or you don't give?","No. It should be in there, Andy. It's on Table – it's in Appendix B."
Okay and how much is that for 2015?,$425 million.
"$425 million, okay, and so, your operating cash ﬂow at EWC is how much?",I don't think we've disclosed that speciﬁcally.
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.,"Thank you.    Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Paula Waters for closing remarks.
