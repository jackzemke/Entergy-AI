Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys. So congrats on the Pilgrim and Palisades decom sales. Just one question, mainly around Indian Point, anything to read into the fact that Indian Point wasn't sort of part of this package deal. Is there sort of some logistical challenges that are partnered to Indian Point? So how we should we think about the last remaining asset you guys own?","There is no, there is no challenges associated with that Shar, it's really a function of, if you recall, at -- not until a little while ago, Palisades was going to be the ﬁrst plant that we will close. Since that didn't come to fruition we continue down the path of the package deal with Pilgrim and Palisades, because they were originally the ﬁrst -- after VY the next two in line. So nothing to read into it, I think the only thing to read in is that, as we've mentioned before, there is a developing market for this type of activity, as we and as you've seen others start to head down the path of decommissioning these plants."
"Got it. That was it and congrats, it was a really big step. Thanks guys.",Thanks Shar.  Thanks Shar.  Operator    Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citi. Your line is now open.
"Hi guys, thanks.","Good morning, Praful.  Good morning, Praful."
"Hi. So again congrats on Pilgrim and Palisades, just any more color you can provide in terms of the price or -- you have provided some terms, just wanted to get a little bit more color around the transaction? And what are the -- what are the challenges you think in terms of approvals?","Sure, Praful, it's Drew. In terms of the price, it's a -- I think what we said was that at the nominal amount which I mean, I think that probably means that you could aﬀord it if you could demonstrate the capabilities to decommission the nuclear plant, but it's not a lot of money. And so the main objective for us of course is to move the risk to a party that is capable of doing it and doing it much quicker than we can. And that will beneﬁt our communities and our other stakeholders much better. I think that's the main point of that."
"Got you. And from an approval process perspective, you would see a similar path that you went down with VY as an NRC kind of the key driver or do you see other kind of a pool that may take longer here in this transaction?","Sure. From an approval perspective, it's really just the NRC in this case. We don't see any speciﬁc state regulatory role right now."
"Got you. Thanks. And then ﬁnally as you continue to make the successful transition through the pure play utility story, wanted to understand, again strategically, is there anything else we should be thinking about as you step back and look at the path going forward? Is there anything in terms of utility growth or in terms of your own portfolio optimization? Anything we should be thinking about as you look at the utility story going forward?","I think it's all the same, the same story that we were telling you, little over a month ago at Analyst Day. We continue to see a robust capital plan at the Utility. We continue to see the mechanism that we have in place that currently match up with that plan, and changes around the edges to a regulatory constructs to match new types of investments as we go forward.  So really has given us between all the things Drew mentioned in terms of the hedging and the operations, sales of these facilities gives us a lot of capacity, ﬁnancially, operationally, management bandwidth et cetera to really focus on the growth of the utility and the beneﬁts that our customers will see through those types of investments, whether those are the new generating plants that we're building, the renewables that we're putting in place, AMI and whatever comes after that.  So really just a big focus on making investments that fuel the growth of the business. But as you can see, we continue to be one of the lowest price options as far as the provision of electricity in the United States, and we're trying to hold onto that, while we grow the business rapidly."
"Great. Thanks so much Leo, Drew. Congrats again.",Thank you.    Welcome.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
"Hey, good morning. Congrats on the recent announcements, just keeping with the EWC business quick. Can you give any additional color on how to think about the       cash ﬂow impacts of the agreements? I am speciﬁcally thinking about kind of the NRC minimum site cost required versus the NDT balances that you disclosed in your slides?","This is Drew. So on an overall cash ﬂow basis, as I said in my remarks, our expectation from EWC is that, we would have positive net cash ﬂow back to the parent through 2022. That's still the case and as it relates to NDT expectations, we do not expect to contribute anymore funds to those NDTs prior to transaction for Pilgrim and Palisades."
"Thanks. Just switching to UP&O quick, I know that there has been higher authorized asks at Arkansas, speciﬁcally in the 5% to 7% forecast for UP&O, how do you kind of think about the high-end versus the low-end of the forecast in your assumptions for equity layers? If we kept equity layer kind of ﬂat through the period, where would that put you within your guidance range?","Well, our expectation, and we've talked about this a little bit at Analyst Day, is that we would see the equity layers at the Utility actually grow a little bit over time. And so we are getting around 49% over the next few years, so I don't have a forecast that would say we would keep it ﬂat. We did that -- I think it would obviously change things a little bit, it would lower our parent debt for sure. And so that would be helpful from a parent debt perspective, but I think overall that might me slight negative. But the -- our objective is to raise our equity layer in utilities over the next few years."
Thanks. Congrats again.,"Alright, thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Paul Fremont from Mizuho. Your line is now open."
Thanks. So with agreements in place for 3 of the nukes and also a signiﬁcant amount of hedging through everybody's remaining life. Can you just give us a sense of what the cash ﬂow associated with those 3 units is going to look like through 2022?,You're talking about Pilgrim and Palisades and Indian Point?
"Well, Pilgrim, Palisades, and I guess Vermont Yankee, right.","Okay, you're talking about (Multiple Speakers)"
"Because Indian Point still isn't resolved, right?","Right, so, Vermont Yankee of course is in decommissioning now and its funds are primarily coming from the trust and hopefully we will close by the end of the year, which is our expectation. And then those cash ﬂows, there wouldn't be any signiﬁcant cash ﬂow on an ongoing basis in that regard for decommissioning there. The Pilgrim and Palisades are really no diﬀerent from what we were showing, before, I guess from a cash ﬂow perspective once Pilgrim was going to close again, those dollars in our forecast, are going to be coming from the decommissioning trust, as well as Palisades, but Palisades was pretty much at the very end of our forecast that we showed you at Analyst Day. So net-net, our cash ﬂow forecast overall for EWC, which includes our expectations for shutting down those plants, and then completing the sales of them is positive, net cash back parent through 2022."
"So, is it fair to assume that for Pilgrim and Palisades, it's likely sort of a negative cash ﬂow proﬁle that's oﬀset by the contract revenue that's coming in from Indian Point?","I'm not sure. There isn't a contract revenue at Indian Point, there is one at Palisades."
"I'm sorry, that the hedge -- in other words, the hedge run is still coming in --","Yeah, so Palisades is our most cash ﬂow positive plant, to be sure during the contracted period, on a merchant basis, of course, that's the diﬀerent question. But there is positive cash ﬂow at Palisades through 2022."
