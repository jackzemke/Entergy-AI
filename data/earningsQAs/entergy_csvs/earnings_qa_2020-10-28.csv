Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning.    Good morning, Jeremy."
"Good morning. Just want to start oﬀ with the O&M savings that you have -- you've really kind of a succeeded with achieving this year. And just wondering where that stands, I guess year-to-date, so far? What's driving your ability to kind of get to that target and go-above that target? And how much of that could be kind of recurring into next year? Just trying to get a feeling on those items.","Yeah, Jeremy, this is Drew, that's a good question. I think, it relates to the operating leaders in the Company really following the plan that we laid-out early in the year. And we talked about this really, actually on our ﬁrst quarter call, about how we plan to go get the $100 million, and then it was identiﬁed. And we have actually pretty much run the exact game plan that we talked about back then. It had to do with -- some operational planning, deferring some maintenance items during outages and things like that. Those are the -- probably the primary drivers. And we had to do that with reliability and safety in mind, of course at all times.  And then there were a number of things that -- that we identiﬁed that were related to COVID-19, a lot of employee expense related items, travel, cost for gathering and things of that nature. Now that we were working in a more decentralized fashion. So those make up the bulk of the opportunities. And I'll say that, typically we -- in any given year we have what we call ﬂex spending opportunities and those largely include the things that I just talked about. But not all of them are necessarily     repeatable. They may be diﬀerent types of options in any given year, but our goal is to manage to an objective where we meet our steady predictable earnings and dividend growth because that provides the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and the credit quality that we need to continue to grow.  At the same time, we do always look for continuous improvement opportunities in some of the things that I talked about, could contribute to that namely, some of the things that allow us to work diﬀerently today that we've discovered some of the more decentralized learning, some of the employee expenses like travel. We may not have to travel as much. So we are examining those things, closely to see, if they will ﬁt into our continuous improvement programs and ultimately get reﬂected as continuous improvement. And that eﬀort is where we would see opportunity on an ongoing basis to create more headroom for our customers for incremental customer investment."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that. And just one more if I could. Could you provide kind of color on local sales trends and what assumptions went into kind of underpinning your expected 3% growth in 2021, however [ph] your thoughts kind of evolved since the Analyst Day?","I'll take that one as well. They have really evolved much since Analyst Day, pretty much exactly where they were at that point. But we do expect some continued rebound in the economy year-over-year and so that's where the growth is mostly coming from, I will say, like I said at Analyst Day. Our experience to-date has been the so-called V-shaped recovery. But at Analyst Day, we said that given the economic forecast that we had seen, we were not forecasting a continuation of that be necessarily. We were smoothing that out and making it a little bit of a longer-term recovery.  And so that's what's reﬂected in our forecast and that is sort of that 3%. So we're not seeing as much as of a rebound as we might have, if we saw the more of the V- shaped recovery. That opportunity is still potentially out there. Because like I said, our experience has been more of the V-shaped thus far. So perhaps we have a little bit of conservatism built in, if the economy does, in fact slowdown we should be well-positioned."
Got it. That's helpful details there. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator     Thank you. And our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open."
"Great, thank you. Good morning, guys.",Good morning.  Good morning James.
"Just two real quick questions. I guess, ﬁrst just following back Drew, you answered the question on the FFO, your quarter-over-quarter. But I also noticed that in your slides that you're talking about an average share count for 2021 is now 204 million shares versus 201 million in '20. So we can infer that you've kind of made a decision on the form of equity that you've undertaken 2021 in any considerations on timing, we should be thinking about?","No new considerations on timing. We are going to have to access equity capital by the end of next year, which is consistent what we've been talking about. So you can see that in the numbers. But we haven't made deﬁnitive decisions on exactly how we're planning to go source that at this point, but we have some placeholders end to reﬂect diﬀerent opportunities."
"Okay. And so you were still looking also, what [ph] I guess at the preferred options tiers [ph] is one of the things you talked about mature shareholder approvals with that.","Yeah, we do. We still have that on the table and we will still be seeking shareholder approval of that with our proxy in the spring."
"Got it. Thank you. And last question here. Slide 15, just looking at your Entergy Arkansas, there was a date here I guess today where you were expecting potentially stipulation or settlement deadline, do you think that we'll hear anything on that today?","Hi, it's Rod. I can answer that. Today was the deadline for settlement on the FRP ﬁling and so not the extension. And we are actually working with both the commission and the stakeholders to extend that deadline in another day or so, to give the parties an opportunity to continue to work through the issues. The nuance there is that there are a number of issues around the FRP that might implicate the actual extension and we're trying to narrow that list down.  So today you might hear of an extension but just know that's an intentional eﬀort on our part to provide some clarity to the commission on the issue that we've addressed between the actual FRP and the actual extension, which has a longer another month or so timeline from a settlement perspective, but they are connected. So that's what's going on there."
Understand. So you're basically just trying to narrow the scope.,That's exactly right.
"Right. I guess -- just into that last point, the Arkansas staﬀ appeared to come out rather forcefully I guess on the FRP extension, should we now expect that the time- frame for the clarity on that getting extended beyond, I believe it's December 4th settlement deadline and this can pivot to a fully-litigated process or are you still optimistic that you could get a settlement on that side of it also?","No, our point of view and our optimism around getting that business done has not changed. What you're seeing with the recent ﬁlings, both the staﬀ and other stakeholders is a normal part of the process that essentially sets the conversations that we have when we actually in negotiations as we are now. So between now and the actual extension of settlement timeline, the beginning of December, I believe, we'll be going to work to close out the very issues that I alluded to before. So, no, I don't expect there to be any diﬀerence because of what was ﬁled, all of which have been expected."
"Okay, great, thank you guys very much for the time.",Thanks.  Operator     Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.
"Yeah, good morning guys. Thank you. Hi. I anticipate the answer to this may be sort of storm, et cetera, but I was -- just curious on the balance sheet, there was a really big move in accounts payable, seems to go up, about [ph] $1.03 billion over the second quarter. And just a lot bigger than usual, anything you can provide there to explain that?","Yeah, that's exactly what that is Jonathan. And there is a corresponding regulatory asset in there that oﬀsets that and ironically, that is part of the FFO challenges. A lot of that cash haven't actually ﬂowed out the door yet. But it's reﬂected in our FFO because we've taken out the working capital piece. So the -- payables are taken out, but the assets still in there. So it looks like the cash is ﬂowed in the FFO metric."
"Great, thanks for that. And then, could I just sort of opt for an update on arrears and bad debts and I thought that [ph] on the balance sheet went up another $30 million versus June and guess [ph] on the rule of thumb you shared with us last quarter, you tend to book 30% of your arrears of bad debt. So does that imply an incremental $100 million over the sort of $100 million increase you had in the second quarter, or is there another way of thinking about that?","That's about right. Jonathan. We have booked a little bit of over $50 million in terms of bad debt expense, and you're right, it's about a third, typically of our overall customer arrears. And so that math would lead to about $150 million overall in that ballpark."
"Okay. And then, you had said that you felt like last quarter the -- just people who could pay they just weren't paying and is that -- what's your current view like?","Yeah, we've been -- since the beginning of the COVID, we had a point of view around what the experience would likely be like for customers who didn't pay and that align with our what we call the dunning process, where we were not disconnecting customers for non-payment. And we're seeing our expectations materialize and there were some conservatism built in. As you recall, we saw regulatory accounting orders from our commissions as a backstop to the potential and likely outcomes on bad debt and customer arrears. And so we're actually seeing it play out the way that we expected, and we expect to be at some point in the near- term, we haven't deﬁned the date yet when we return back to more business as usual, whenever that might be, we'll actually begin the ﬁlings to connect recovery     from customers including through the regulatory mechanisms on the bad debt and other expenses associated with COVID."
"Okay. Thanks, Rod. So do you guys think that (inaudible) what's the trajectory from here though and as you think -- talk about your expectations. Do you see it rising further or we sort of -- we reached a level here?","It's too early to say candidly because there is the unknown as to what are the -- what are going to be the continuing impacts of COVID, as we round out the fourth quarter into the new year. What will likely be diﬀerent is the stance of the regulator is relative to the relief we provided to customers relative to that bad debt. So that's going to be continued. On our end, we're going to be prudent in the way that we continue to provide service to customers, but take advantage of the opportunities given to us by the regulators to at least present to them, what if any trends we are seeing on a rare just beyond sort of the path that we are currently on."
"Thanks very much, Rod.","Thanks, Jonathan.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning guys.","Good morning, Shar.    Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. So let me just two quick questions here in appreciate the transparency on issuing the '23 guidance. Can we just talk a little bit about the cadence of the earnings growth year-over-year. Because it seems that at the mid- point of those ranges, you're expecting more tailwind growth rather than sort of front years of the plan, i.e., 5% in the front year, 7% through closer to the '23     timeframe. So I just wanted to maybe get a sense on what's driving that, is it the equity in the front-end of the plans just kind of curious how we should think about the cadence?","Yeah, I think from our perspective, Shar, it's fairly ratable pretty close to that 6% when we have done a little bit better last year and we're on track to do a little bit better this year. Yeah, we're not necessarily projecting that out into the future years just yet. So we're -- so it looks like when we go from a little bit higher or we started for '20 to out in the future it slows down a little bit, I think. But I think if you look at our original guidance midpoints, you'd see that fairly predictable 6% growth is what you'd see."
Got it. Since you don't look at the year-over-year midpoint growth and assume that it is going to be more back-end loaded.,"No, not now from the revised spot. As you start from the original spot. I think you'll get to that same place."
"Got it. Perfect. And just one quick follow-up, Drew, just -- the equity question. So just there is a lot of moving pieces right, you've got storm recoveries and clearly there's another pending one coming, with a bit lower volumes, the credit metrics somewhat were lower than I guess not expectations. But as we think about it from a comparable standpoint, how do we may be just can you frame the cadence on how we should think about equity? I mean obviously there is a little bit in plan now in '21. Should we just assume that equity should be more front-end loaded versus back-end loaded or something that's more annual, just given some of the moving pieces that was -- that you've highlighted and obviously, Leo highlighted in the prepared remarks?","Yeah, I don't -- We are not planning any change in our cadence to our equity at this point as a result of COVID or the storms. So we do still expect to -- as we've been talking about, have some equity by next year to maintain our path. Although, we probably won't be hitting our FFO to debt target exactly the same, as we were [ph] but we've committed down to the rating agencies that we will have some equity out there. And we will continue with that process on through the next ﬁve years, but no real changes as a result of the storm or COVID at this point."
"Got it. Terriﬁc, thanks guys.","Thank you, Shar.    Operator   Thank you. And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Your line is now open."
"Hi, can you hear me.",There you are Julien.
"Hey, sorry about that. I apologize. I wasn't quite sure if -- it's a little bit. Well, thank you to the whole team here really appreciate it. I'll make it easy -- quick and easy hopefully. I'm curious as to how you would characterize the totality of the storms and the bill impacts incurred this year. I appreciate it doesn't necessarily ﬁt into the traditional framework, so, we call it, of the FRP. But really just curious how you think about that and to the extent, which may shift timing of CapEx or otherwise as you think about bill impacts in future years, securitization otherwise still through the way in rates?","Hey, it's Rod. I'll take a stab at it. How do we think about it? As you rightly stated the storms operate outside of the traditional FRPs, and as a result it -- but it nevertheless still has an impact on the overall customer bill. And my answer to that is the way that we think about that is not any diﬀerent, what are the ways in which we can mitigate the build impact or what are the tools we have available to us. Yes, we are starting from an advantageous standpoint of having amongst the lowest customer rates in the US. But knowing the storms will ultimately impact our customers. Well, we are exploring with the Fed's as we shared with you all at Analyst Day, opportunities to oﬀset some aspects of the customer bills as they relate to the storms.  There is the opportunity that we've had in prior storms and that we've already begun to take advantage of around securitization to lower the cost, the near-term cost of storm recovery for customers. Aside from the self-help opportunities we have to lower our overall cost of service to customers. So between the opportunities with the federal government and DOE and others regulatory mechanisms we have, the ﬁnancial structures we have used in the past and our own self-help, we are going to continue to do what we've done before. And that is work [ph] to mitigate the impact on customers. And the storm is from our vantage point is no diﬀerent than any other cost to provide those outcomes for customers. So that would be a work in progress, but our objective to keep our going back to Leo's point our objective around the reliability part of -- I mean the aﬀordability part of reliability, sustainability and aﬀordability. That's our normal course of business and so there is nothing is going to be diﬀerent about that.     And Julien, I'll just add. This is Leo. We talked about it at Analyst Day, given what our current rate level is and what the current trajectory is without the storm costs are manageable. And we still believe that they are manageable within the capital budget that we've got. And, as Rod mentioned it's totally consistent with the way that we've operated over the years is totally consistent with the way we've gotten recovery of storm costs over the years. And it is our objective to attempt to continue to try and do better for all of our stakeholders. So through continuous improvement in everything we anticipate that we can even make that a little bit better for our customers. So we think, it's all manageable in the context of the size of the balance sheet, the size of the asset base and everything to be able to make all this work."
"Great, thanks guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
"Hi, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question.",Good morning.
"First -- Yeah, hi. So ﬁrstly, be on the O&M, so you clearly have over-achieved on the O&M costs so far this year, but I will [ph] now open the slide the guidance slide it seems that there full year goal remains the same. Would that -- should we expect a reversal of O&M costs in Q4 then or should we expect you to try and sustain the cost cut trajectory into the end of the year?","Hey, Sophie, this is Drew, we're going to get a little bit above that $100 million, so I might -- get to the $120 million range or so by the end of the year that's baked into the new narrowed range that we talked about this morning."
"Got it. Thank you. And then on the equity and sort of balance sheet again, this is a real possibility as we sit here today, that we will see some form of better reversal [ph] of the tax cuts from 2016 right under the Biden administration, which is presumably would be balance sheet positive for utilities, would that inﬂuence your I thinking about equity needs, would you wait to get more clarity on that type of development?","Yeah, this is Drew. So absolutely we would be thinking about that. And since our equity plan goes out for ﬁve years, I expect that in the course of that we would get some clarity around how the new tax rate would play out and how it would get ultimately into rates and assuming those -- all those turn into deferred taxes, the extra [ph] cash ﬂow that we would get that we could use to oﬀset any potential equity.  I don't know that it's going to oﬀset all of our equity. And as, of course, there are other proposals out there like alternative minimum taxes that are less clear at this point about what those might actually be. But we'll have to monitor those closely as well. But, yes, you're correct, it should, if you assume that went from 21% to 28% on the federal tax rate. And those were deferred taxes that should improve our FFO. We should reduce our equity needs."
Got it. Thank you so much.,"Thanks, Sophie.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Stephen.  Good morning, Stephen."
"I wanted to check in on regulated nuclear operations, I know you've made a lot of investments in that regard. I was just curious -- have those investments been paying       oﬀ, are the metrics you point to just in terms of how the operations are going on that side?","Thanks, Steve. And they are paying oﬀ. We've seen the beneﬁt of putting those investments into the plants in operations of the plants improving and so everything is on track for those as we mentioned, we just came out of the last big outage, as it relates to the program that we went under as we went from 2016 to this point throughout the regulated ﬂeet as we were preparing most of those for their new extended lives. So we are seeing the beneﬁt of those investments. We continue to have investments to make, although they are not the kind of size of what we've been doing over the course of the last couple of years."
"Got it. That's really helpful. And then just going back to storm damage and thinking through that, I appreciate you have a lot of tools at your disposal to think about the customer bill impact. One tool, I was just curious about just as duration of recovery whether that over time might be adjusted. I guess one thing I've been thinking through is just, if we annualize some of the damages, we've been seeing of late [ph]. It does start to show a more material impact on the bill, but if you have the ability to kind of spread that out over a longer period of time that could help alleviate the impact a bit how do you think about that element of in the toolbox?","Yeah Steve, this is Drew. So all of our retail regulators are going to expect us to utilize securitization in order to minimize the cost of capital associated with that. And right now, 10 years securitization is probably around 1% cost of capital. If we were to stretch that out to 15 years, you might be able to get, it would be a little bit higher. But you would stretch the overall bill impact a little bit.  So somewhere in there is probably what we are thinking about some place to optimize the impact on the customer bill or as I should say probably minimize the impact on the customer bill that optimize probably the wrong word. But that's plus, as you know, we're always thinking about structural ideas. I'm sure if you remember our aﬃliate preferred and things that we've done in the past to try and minimize the customer bill impact as well. So we're looking at structural alternatives that we may trying to come up with to help mitigate that as well."
"I got you. It's a good point that if you extend the duration a bit, the cost of that debt ﬁnancing probably doesn't, go up a whole lot. So that's a tool for sure. Okay, thank you very much. That's all I had.","Thanks, Stephen.     Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning. Team. Just one quick one from me on -- good morning, on FFO to debt going back to that. Just curious on. So it looks like you moved the target six months from Q4 '21 to mid 2022. Just any color on sort of what gives you conﬁdence that you can get there by mid 2022, is it the regulatory approvals of storm cost recovery or is this something that you sort of put together in discussion with the credit agencies? Just any color around the timing of those target credit metrics would be helpful.","Sure. That's a good question, because we were pretty speciﬁc with mid 2022. But really we're tying it to the timing of our securitization more or less. Once we get the securitizations in place that should help us move to FFO to debt ratios that are much closer to our target. So the -- yeah, with Moody's wrote about it, they said 2022. And if you think about our securitization, typical securitization timeline, it's 18 to 24 months. So we saw -- it said. Okay, well, 24 months from basically whenever Laura came along. Of course, now we are looking at Zeta this afternoon. But, the 24 months for that might be a little bit longer, but we are going to be seeking expedited treatment for some of this and hopefully we'll be able to move that timeline forward a bit."
"Got it. So essentially the lever is securitization of those costs. And if you're able to get it early, probably be earlier than mid 2022.","That's what we be thinking about, yes."
"Okay, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate the time.",Thank you.       Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Fremont with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
"Thank you. Couple of questions on EWC. One would be, can you help us understand what the objections are for New York in transferring the Indian Point license? And do you think that's going to hold up a potential transfer of license to whole tax and can we also get maybe a little bit of an update on the cash ﬂows that you're now expecting between now and when EWC winds-down?","Okay. Hey, Paul. Good morning. This is Drew. On the regulatory front, we are in discussions with various agencies in New York, as well as the NRC. And the NRC is getting closer to the end of its process and of course they are evaluating the operational capability and the ﬁnancial capability of whole tax to do the decommissioning. And we have full conﬁdence that they will pass the screens from the NRC. From the state's perspective, they're asking the same questions really. And so it's just a matter of working through the process in New York. It's not a deﬁned process, as well as it is at the NRC. But we are working through. We are having conversations and we still believe that at this point, we are on track to close sometime around the middle of next year.  In terms of the cash ﬂows that I believe they are still positive from kind of 2020 through 2022 cash back to Parent that's kind of the metric that we've used. If you just used EBITDA, of course, you might not be looking at that. We don't have much capital left in these plants before they are retired. But our overall cash back to parent is still slightly positive."
Great. Any order of magnitude there?,Less than $100 million.
Great. Thank you.,"Thank you.       All right, thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. And our last question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning. Sorry, I was on mute there. Just a very quick follow-up on O&M, you say you're on track to exceed $100 million. I think I heard $120 million but I see you're continuing to call for $2.7 billion for 2021. I guess my question is, as you go through the year, are you still thinking those savings won't be repeated or recurring or is your reiteration of $2.7 billion conservative?","This is Drew, that's a good question. It's a question that Leo asked me every day about why we're still a $2.7 billion. We do have a lot of cost that came out of this year that did move into next year. And so a lot of these things as I mentioned at the outset, were a part of operational changes that we made during outages, maintenance decisions that we made and things like that we do have to make in order to maintain the safety and reliability of our assets.  So that's probably the main thing. But as I said, we have learned some things and we have some continuous improvement opportunities that are coming out of that. Some are pretty immediate like travel expenses, others may take a little bit of time like trying to realize real estate savings from a smaller footprint or something of that nature. So they're all going to be some opportunities that result from what we've done this year, that become continuous improvement and those will be baked into our expectations over time.  Yeah. Andrew, this is Leo, I Drew has been a little bit funny you about what I ask him every day, he is trying to be a comedian today on the call I guess. But the fact of the matter is, we think we're in a pretty good position in terms of the business model, the investment opportunities, we have the ability to create value for our customers.  I went through in my prepared remarks just consider the value of the new transmission infrastructure versus the old transmission infrastructure on a day-in, day- out basis, but certainly in times like what we've seen the anomaly that has been 2020 all the way around. We've learned a lot about the way we operate the business, both from our Flex levers, our continuous improvement in the things that Drew was talking about what we're capable of, when we put in our mind to it.     Obviously, when we talk about how we're teeing up sales growth and how we're teeing up O&M certainly for next year and the years beyond. There is a lot of uncertainty out there that we just need to make sure that we're prepared for. And so we've set ourselves up to be prepared for that uncertainty, and the biggest one being obviously the pandemic had owned [ph] ago, when is our vaccine. We can control what we can control. We can't control the public health crisis. So we are going to control what we can control. For example, the posture that we're in today as it relates to our travel schedules and our remote work schedules and our meeting schedules and all that, we've announced to our employees that we're going to continue in that process until the middle of 2021 at a minimum. So obviously, there could potentially be some opportunities in there. There can be some opportunities as Drew mentioned in the sales forecast, but those are dependent in some respects on things that we don't control.  So I guess the point being is we're going to control everything that is under our control and then we're going to prepare ourselves to be able to handle the stuﬀ that we can't control whether it's continuation of the pandemic and a sales forecast it shows up diﬀerent than our sales experience has been. But also give ourselves from capability to manage on the cost side too if that happen.  So we feel like we're in a pretty good place teed up for 2021, certainly by the time we get to the end of 2021, we would anticipate that we get back to a much more normal trajectory and we are prepared for a continuation of 2020, if we have to. We're really excited about how we can perform under normal circumstances. So I don't know, if that directly answers your question or not but."
"Yes, no, that's very helpful. Certainly hoping for a return to normal sometime soon, but I don't guess -- it's going to be imminent. And Leo, I think we all know that you do [ph] your hard time day-in, day-out in a very good way. So keep it up. Thank you guys.","Thanks, Andrew.  Operator  Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to David Borde for any closing remarks.    Thank you, Jimmy.
