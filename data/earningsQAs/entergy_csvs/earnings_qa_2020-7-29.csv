Question,Answer
Good morning and thank you for taking my call. Can you guys hear me?,"Yes, we can. Good morning, James. Yes, good morning."
"Hey, how are you?",Great.
"Just two real quick questions. I think your previous guidance had assumed a 2% decline for 2020 -- I'm sorry, 2.5% decline for the full year and now you're at 2%. Can you kind of give us a breakdown of how you are thinking about that for the balance of the year? And do you think there is some -- maybe some conservatism baked in there on the industrial side, as you're kind of looking at the recovery through the end of 2020?","Yes. James, this is Drew. Yes. So, we haven't changed our outlook for sales actually for the third and the fourth quarter from what we described in May, even though we did see a little bit better outcome in the second quarter than what we were anticipating. It is possible that we could do better, but given the spike in cases around the country and our service territory, we thought we should just keep it about where it is for right now.  We do continue to see the phased reopening, even though it's paused in certain municipalities right now. So, there is opportunity perhaps over the balance of the year, but for the time, we've elected to keep our outlook for sales where we had it for the second half."
"Perfect. So basically, the improved sort of outlook really comes from just the second quarter and the weather you've kind of -- in the sales you've seen sort of quarter to the date?",That is correct.
"Okay. And then the other question, I guess this comes back to sort of credit, is that are you still comfortable with the equity guidance that you had given before, where you're looking I think for the high end as a 5% to 10% of the planned CapEx? Is that still sort of how you're looking at things and do you still feel like you're on target for the end of the year to get to 15% FFO to debt, which I think is where you guys were sort of targeting last time we spoke?","That's right. We are still targeting now. We still expect to make that by fourth quarter next year, and our equity outlook is in that same range that we've talked about previously. We have continued to think about timing and we think it's probably in the later half of next year when the need will actually arise and we have continued to think about the method in which we would deliver that. And in the past, we've talked about block trade. That's what we did a few years ago. So, that's still on the table, but we've also added other options to the table, including an ATM possibility and even perhaps preferred equity.  Right now, we don't have authorization for preferred equity within our chart. So, we would need a proxy vote to ensure that that would be shareholder friendly. But we are considering that as well."
And just a follow-up on the preferred equity. I'm assuming that'd be like a mandatory convert?,Yes.
"Is that -- From a rating agency standpoint, I know that you'll get anywhere from 25% to 50% credit for something like that. Does that kind of limit, I guess, how much of the funding you can do through the convert, just considering it's a little bit farther out and you don't get as much equity credit as you would versus, say, a block sale or through an ATM?","Yes. So, that's why -- the preferred equity gets you actually, I think, up to 100%. There are options around preferred debt and other versions of convertibles that will give you various credit depending on the rating agency. And we have authorization for all of those. What we don't have authorization for is the preferred equity that would allow you to get the 100% credit."
Got it. Okay. I understand. Great. Thank you so much for all the time.,"Thank you.    Thanks, James.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open."
"Hey. Good morning, guys.","Good morning.    Good morning, Shar."
"So, good to see that the $100 million cost savings program is on target. Is there any plans to hold recurring savings into '21? Any sort of rough numbers to think about, I mean, what could be recurring with the 2020 savings? Anything perpetual? And I've a follow-up.","Shar, this is Drew. So, obviously, at this point in the year, we are also thinking about 2021 and what that might mean -- and we have started to think about opportunities for savings in 2021. So, that is actually well underway. Currently, we are monitoring everything that's going on in the world and making sure that there isn't any other risks that may be out there that we would need to apply those to. But that network that you're referring to is well underway, but we're not prepared to talk about speciﬁc numbers at this point."
"Got it. And obviously, you've highlighted, it's been relatively a strong start to the year. Can you just maybe point us to kind of where you're tracking within your 2020 earnings band? It seems to be, just with rough modeling, you're getting a little bit closer to the top end, especially if the 3Q weather transpires. Just maybe a little bit of, from a trend perspective, where you're within [ph] the deck.","Yes. So, we are still tracking towards the middle of the band. There are opportunities potentially out there for us, but we continue to track towards the middle at this point."
"Got it, okay. Thanks, guys, congrats.","Thank you.    Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your line is now open."
"Hi. Good morning, guys.","Good morning.    Good morning, Jonathan."
"I would just -- Could I just come back to sales and just ask you where they most sort of deviated into the positive, or otherwise from -- in the second quarter, because the way you showed that slide on the Q1 deck, I believe that was sort of versus guidance rather than a year-over-year comp. So, just curious whether they're sort of down. I think it was down 1% in industrial, for example, in Q2. Was that where the favorability was, or was it more on the residential side?","Hi, this is Rod. Good morning. I think the story line remains consistent with what we expected back in May, where the growth was driven by residential, because so much of the shelter in place were showing up in our residential sector. And you had some volatility in the commercial sector, because you had so many diﬀerent levels of uncertainty with schools and churches and restaurants and the like. And I think the clarity we had in the industrial sector sort of played out, although it was a little bit better than expected. So, the fundamentals have not changed dramatically, when you think about sort of this cross-sector contribution to grow. So, residential is really showing up for us in oﬀsetting a large part a lot of the volatility we're seeing elsewhere.  And I'll just add that it pretty much was across all three clients, where we were a little bit ahead of expectations. It wasn't one or the other that completely dominated."
"Perfect. Thank you. And just my follow-up on --. So, on the balance sheet, it looks like your uncollectibles went up from $7.5 million to $43 million or so. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there, whether it's sort of on -- has it kind of spiked, and is it plateauing now or is it sort of on a accelerating trend? And then just how to think about some of those variables going forward?","Yeah, Jonathan, that's a good question. So, we are seeing more uncollectibles right now. We actually -- As you noted, we booked about $30 million of bad debt expense this quarter, that was oﬀset by regulatory assets given the regulatory orders that we have in our retail jurisdictions. So, there's not really any bottom-line impact associated with that, because we would expect to be able to recover those costs.  Historically, we've experienced about -- bad debt expenses about a third of our typical arrears. So, typically, we have arrears in any given point of about $75 million and we experience about $25 million of bad debt expense. We are about $100 million higher on our arrears right now and that's why we booked $30 million sort of consistent with that ratio.  We expect that there are some people that are able to pay that are just taking advantage of the current situation. But -- And we do expect that to grow a little bit more. We haven't turned on our dunning programs and we would expect that that balance would continue to grow through the summer, although we expect it to continue to be manageable and it is -- that growth is reﬂected in our liquidity expectations, which continue to be strong. So, that is something that we're closely monitoring and it's important for us to continue to work with our customers in order to help them through this."
Thanks for that. And good quarter. Thank you.,"Thanks, Jonathan.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for your time.",Good morning.
"If I can -- and I, ﬁrst oﬀ, want to say that (technical diﬃculty)","Julien, we're having trouble hearing you."
"I apologize. Hey, guys. Apologies. On your bears of your argument with CRE, and just understanding the ﬁnancial implications, Drew, you speciﬁcally said that there were some mitigating factors, but didn't quantify or specify what they were. Can you help walk through what they might be, be it from a reduction in ﬁnancing needs or otherwise? Just help us understand what reserves you might have already taken and/or other mitigating circumstances?","Julien, I'll start with the quote-unquote mitigating circumstances and I'll let Drew ﬁnish up. But ﬁrst and foremost, my expectation would be that we would -- that whatever impact ultimately happen, that we would overcome that and still meet our expectations. So, that's our going-in position from just an organizationally; that whatever the impact is, that we would continue to meet the objectives that we've laid out for you.  There are also some -- Within the CRE case, I think there are some things that we talked about in the past that could be used to mitigate such as the interest cost that we've been paying the IRS and some other things like that. So -- And obviously, there'll be some ﬁnancing or whatever that would ﬁt into whatever ﬁnancing plan Drew has. But I guess that overall, the overarching mitigation is that whatever it is, that it would be our expectation to overcome it.       All right. And I would say that the opportunity within our business is embedded within our continuous improvement program. And so, as you know, we've been working hard to continue to develop that. We feel like it's continued to grow and mature and that is where that opportunity would come from.  So, not all of it clearly has been identiﬁed at this point. But as Leo said clearly, just articulated, this is an expectation about how we would be expected to operate within the company. And just like we have in the past, I have 100% conﬁdence that the company is going to ﬁgure out how to make that work.  And of course, Julien, our perspective is that there won't be an impact because of our position in the case. So, I just want to make that clear to you."
"Absolutely. I appreciate the merits of the argument there as well. (inaudible). But if I can ask you to expand on it, because you obviously have $100 million in cost cuts that you are well on track to achieve this year. When you say you will ﬁnd ways to oﬀset that, does that include leveraging or oﬀsetting it with continuation of $100 million in cost cuts? And maybe even more broadly, actually, I know, the last quarter and at the outset of COVID, we've been talking about the sustainability of these price reductions, how do you think about that now, given the plans for the back half of the year and how that might impact '21?  And also considering potential timing in '21, a resolution of the sales basis is when you say as (multiple speakers).","So, I'll unpack a little bit of that, Julien, and I'll ask my colleagues to tell me if I forget some of the points and then you can get that in there. I appreciate the question, because really, there is a couple of things at play here. The $100 million is, by and large, our Flex program, but what we're doing within the year to manage the impacts of COVID and weather? We -- Obviously, we've had negative weather so far this year, plus the impacts of COVID. Last year, we had negative weather and those intra-year dollars are primarily what we talked about at the beginning of the year when we started to ﬂex associated with weather and then continued to ramp up the ﬂex because of the impact on sales of COVID.  In parallel to that, we do have a continuous improvement program, which is more akin to what we did last year on this call, where we found permanent cost reductions that, as you recall, allowed us to invest more capital into the system, to improve the reliability of the system and the impact on the experience in our customer base plus grow the business, allowed us to actually add money to our charitable foundation and to our employee beneﬁts through those -- the headroom that was provided through those and continuous improvement.     So when we start to talk about next year, there'll be a combination of the two as well. I will say that, I'm sure this is not unique to us, that we are ﬁnding there are some areas of impact on our cost associated with our reaction to COVID that will likely fall into that bucket of continuous improvement and could be permanent. We're in the process of trying to marry what goes from an annual thing to a permanent thing, but I'm sure even within all of your ﬁrms you've found things that you used to do one way that you do in a diﬀerent way today, that's much more eﬃcient, that you'll probably continue to do.  So, I hope that helps. There's really two parallel things that we work on. One is just a normal ﬂex within the annual budget that every department has. The other is the permanent continuous improvement that everybody is also focused on. And you saw that second quarter last year, when we changed our outlooks because of the continuous improvement. This year, we're holding onto our outlooks because of ﬂex. Does that make sense?"
"Right. And that's the oﬀset potentially, the impact next year?","Yeah, yeah. So -- But I would say, impact next year, depending on what it is, whether it's weather or whatever it'd be, a ﬂex sort of thing, we were just talking about CRE, that would be more of a continuous improvement sort of thing."
Got it. All right. Excellent. Thanks for clarity.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Good morning.,Good morning.
"Just wondering if you could speak a little bit more on the 90% of CapEx not dependent on customer growth, and is this kind of a shift in planning and strategy or       is it kind of just more reﬂective of current system investment levels that are needed?","That's a great question, Jeremy. It's consistent with the capital plan that we've had for the last 10 years. Awesome. And I felt like it was necessary to add a metric that keeps that top of mind with everybody, because I believe that's important about our plan.  If you think about what we're doing in the generation space and what we've been doing for over a decade, we are replacing 50-year-old generation with brand new generation. The heat rate is lower. It creates a signiﬁcant production cost improvement at pace for the plant. Emissions are 40% lower than the -- they use less water. All those things are good about new plants. And so, what we've been doing over the years is adding new generation and then subsequently retiring old generation. So, it's meeting the needs of the system with new stuﬀ rather than old stuﬀ. The same things goes with the investments that we've had in the distribution system. So if you think about AMI, we're replacing old meters with new meters. It's not new customers. Although there are new customers that get a new meter, the majority of that program is driven by the technological improvement.  Our distribution automation strategy, our asset management strategy, all of those are really based on improving the level of service that our customers achieve by deploying capital that lowers costs or provides a service that was not available in the past. So, 90% of it has been and continues to be based on the fact that we need to modernize the system. Where the fact that we have customer growth has assisted us is that it has provided a lower rate path for everybody as we expand the sales that we have on those assets that we're using to modernize the system, which contributes to the fact that we historically have either the lowest or second lowest rates in the United States.  So I just felt like it was necessary, given the impact the COVID has had on the economy and sales, that we point out that the capital plan is still there to modernize the system and COVID hasn't changed the need for us to modernize the system. If anything, it's actually enhanced the need for us to modernize the system, particularly at the distribution level. And so while 90% of what's in there today is based on technological improvement, if -- there is a lot in the wings for more technological improvement that we could do, to the extent we ﬁnd the headroom to do it.  I hope that helps answer your question."
"That was very helpful. Thank you for that. One more, if I could. Just wondering if you could talk a bit in how your position MISO impacts Entergy's renewable planning? And do you see opportunities here changing over the next ﬁve years from MISO level planning and changes?","Well, we do our resource planning obviously in conjunction with the resource adequacy that we need for MISO, but our resource planning is done at state level. So, the resource plans that we have in the type of generation we need incorporates our participation in MISO. But it's not -- MISO is not driving what resources we pay."
Got it. Thanks for that.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.,
"Yes. Hey, good morning, Leo and Drew. Thank you.","Good morning, Steve."
"One very brief clariﬁcation on the CRE. Because of this change you're going to make to the uncertain tax position, does that cause the earnings impact to occur kind of temporarily until you get the ﬁnal decision?","No, there shouldn't be any real earnings impact associated with that other than the fact that we did have an expectation that we would be successful, which would have reduced future rate base and subsequent earnings. But I don't -- that's not what we're referring to when we're talking about maintaining our expectations. It would have to come through other means."
"Okay. Just the FRPs, the extensions, I think Louisiana you ﬁled and then now you're doing Arkansas?",Yes. Both (multiple speakers).
Yeah. Just how much do we need to worry about these as more like normal rate cases as opposed to these annual reviews? Can you just explain the issues in the multi-year extensions versus the annual?,"I think the primary question on the renewal is, has the FRP accomplished the objectives that we set out ﬁve years ago in Arkansas and three years ago in Louisiana. And when you think about how we've shaped the capital plan and we've disclosed to our regulators what our plans were, then the question becomes can we achieve the objectives. And you've heard it before, Steve, around reliability, sustainability, aﬀordable, low-cost competitive rates, can we achieve that given the capital plan for customers.  And if the answer to that question is yes, and as we laid out in our renewal ﬁlings the answer is yes in our view, then they'll -- we expect that they'll -- they as well as the other stakeholders will agree that it makes sense to keep it going. It's not a -- It hasn't been viewed, as we've discussed with the stakeholders, as a full-blown rate case where we are reviewing -- we spend a year going through the traditional backwards- looking base rate case. So, that's not the expectation.  But of course, the regulator has the ability to weigh in on whatever component that they wish. But we believe the interests are aligned. We think the way that the FRPs have worked historically have been consistent with what we represented ﬁve years ago in Arkansas and as you know, this is a series of three-year renewals in Louisiana. And again, given the shape of the capital plan, we're going beyond just renewal of the FRP in Louisiana, for instance, recognizing as Leo laid out. We have been shaping the capital plan with more distribution investment, for instance, as part of that asset renewal. That's going to show up in what we are asking the jurisdiction and Louisiana to consider with a distribution rider.  And so, it's those type of policy considerations that we're going through with our stakeholders and not as much a rate case review, if that's helpful.  Yes. Steve, Rod mentioned it. We -- Just look -- To look at how it works in Louisiana, you just ﬂip back to the last renewal and the renewal before that and renewal before that and the renewable before that. This is obviously the ﬁrst time that we've done it in Arkansas, but it's been pretty clear that the Arkansas formula rate plan has worked exactly the way it was intended to work with the combination of -- All you have to do is look at something like a year like 2018 where we ended up with a year that worked out diﬀerently because of tax reform than we thought it was going to and then we ended up earning our allowed rate of return and we refunded dollars to customers in the next formula rate ﬁling that went through.  So, that's worked really, really well for our customers as well. So Louisiana, obviously, we have a long history of renewals. This will be the ﬁrst one in Arkansas, but it appears to be working exactly the way it was intended by all the parties."
"Okay, great, thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Your line is now open.
"Thank you. So, I wanted to go back to CRE. So, I appreciate your classiﬁcation of the downside case here, the $0.15 to $0.20 and your ability to oﬀset that potential earnings drag. But it seems like that's just potentially half of the impact, right? Because there is the separate proceeding regarding the ROE and probably, equity ratio for the asset. And I see that the ALJ recommendation is expected on May -- in February of next year, but if you could just explain how -- I'm assuming that there's some negotiations on that front. We have the MISO ROE decision from FERC. We have some adjustments, a basic proposed adjustment to the calculation mechanism for the ROE and how that could impact the earnings power of grand goal? Thank you.","So, this is Drew. And we've had, Angie, an expectation for ROE and capital structure baked in for three years or so, at this point. And our expectations -- And those are in our outlooks, based on the outcome of this proceeding. And at this point, we don't see any reason to change those, based on how the proceedings have moved to date.  And even if those outlooks weren't met from an ROE and capital structure perspective, we don't think that whatever that delta would be, is something that we couldn't manage within our current expectations."
"Okay. Even if there were those overlapping impacts, right, with the reduction of the rate base and reduction of the ROE and a reduction in the equity layer?","That's correct.    Yes. And we're saying that we already reserved on the ROE.  We've already -- We have an expectation for that base in our outlooks, but we don't want to obviously talk about that, because we're still in the proceeding, but we're       comfortable with where that is in our outlooks right now."
"Great. And just one follow-up. So, what should we expect in going into your Analyst Day? I mean, do you plan on making any announcements, for instance, regarding more renewable power spending or is it just additional cost-cutting initiatives? Again, I mean, just a big picture, expectations going into the Analyst Day?","Yes. I think big picture, Angie, what we'll be talking about is being able to give a little bit more color on how we operate and what we're doing and what's in the capital plan and how we're thinking about it. The capital plan is pretty certain where it is.  As you know, there is a large mix of renewables in our future as it is. As we've stated before, between 22 and 30, we anticipate a lot of renewables. We've got RFPs that we've been involved in, the construction -- the projects that are up and running, the ones that are under construction. So, I think the capital plan is in pretty good shape. We may give some more details about that and talk about what's in our future, particularly as we spend time on the customer solutions side of things, but really a little more depth on things like what's in the capital plan, what's in our path to lower emissions, what's in our customer solutions space, what's in the distribution space, how are we operationalizing continuous improvement, things like that."
"Okay, thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
"Hi, good morning and thank you for the time and for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"So, I wanted to go back to maybe a little bit to the volume picture. And just looking at the breakdown by the class, right, it seems like industrial is doing pretty well here, right? It's barely down year-over-year in the weather-adjusted basis. And commercial,     understandably, is suﬀering a little more, and the residential is up and I think we will get that.  My question is, I guess, could you help us a little more as in what's going on on the ground right now? Is this a trend we should just expect to continue the same way? And if the -- given the shift in the mix, if the sensitivities to this changes that we had pre-COVID still hold in this new environment?","Yeah. So, Sophie, the industrial piece in particular that you noted, we were expecting pretty solid growth this year at the outset, in the 5% to 6% range for industrial. So, the fact that it's 1% down is a pretty big drop relative. Even though year-over-year it's 1% down, we are expecting to be 5%, 6% up. And on the balance of the year, I would say that we expect the residential to trend -- start to trend down as people return to work in diﬀerent places in their home and we would expect the commercial and governmental to slowly begin to trend up and industrial to hopefully begin to improve. And that's all, I think, consistent with where we lined out our expectations in May. And so, I think that we are continuing to expect the phased reopening to support slow but steady improvement in these numbers."
"All right, thank you. And then lastly, maybe if you could give us a little bit of sneak peek into your Analyst Day? I think things are going on track for the most part for your company. What topics or what areas do you plan to give us an update on?","As far as topics for the Analyst Day, we'll probably just -- A little more depth and color around what's in the capital plan, our trend to lower emissions and as well as continuous improvement structure and things like that will be subjects that we'll talk about. We don't want to talk too much about it today. We want you to tune in."
"All right, thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is now open.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Ryan."
"What projects are in your capital plan that are most sensitive to load outlook that was incorporated within that 10%, that was highlighted in the prepared remarks?","There probably is smattering. Obviously, there is -- the new customer hookups are the big piece of it in the distribution of the transmission space. So for example, if you had a major industrial customer that was located in your service territory, the substations for them can be pretty signiﬁcant. So, you'd have to build in the substation. And then we just have general line extensions to our distribution business every day, when a new house is built or something like that.  So, some of the transmission infrastructure could be put in that bucket as well to the extent that we need to put transmission infrastructure into an area because of either prior load growth or new load growth, but it's really more in getting into that last mile."
"Thanks. And then in terms of the industrial load assumption in your guidance, what are your conversations with customers suggesting for that outlook and are there any big lumpy customers that you have color as to their plans or timing of when some of that industrial load can return throughout the remaining portion of the year?","Hey, Ryan. It's Rod. I know we will talk more in detail about the nuances of our industrial engagement perhaps at Analyst Day, but part of our conﬁdence comes from -- and our growth observations comes from the fact that we're actually talking to real customers and we can quantify and identify the existing projects. And so what we are paying attention to at the moment are not just sort of the macroeconomic commodity spreads and other indicators. We're talking to those companies who have made ﬁnal investment decisions and whether they've delayed projects or ramping back up, we can point to speciﬁc companies and tie them to speciﬁc projects that are in our outlook.  And as we've shared before, we probably await not just the projects in the plan, but there are other projects that make up our economic development type of pipeline. And that are -- we're also monitoring to determine whether or not we need to include those or exclude those as the case may be in the plan.  We've not seen much movement in our existing plan with regard to projects that we've identiﬁed that, for instance, that were canceled. There might have been one or two here and there, but they were on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of     impact, but our conﬁdence comes from the fact that we are tying them to actual project that is still in play."
"Okay, thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.",
"Okay. Close to good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me here. I just want to quickly clarify, Drew, the $0.15 to $0.20. I'm trying to reconcile that to the Slide 26 where you showed the rate base exposure. Is it -- Am I right in thinking about the $0.15, $0.20 as essentially you sort of, in a worst-case scenario, losing the return on that 400 -- north of $400 million rate base? Is that the right way to think about it, or am I comparing apples and oranges?","Yeah. So, the $400 million plus the $100 million of interest that is part of the refund, because they are saying that we owe the money. And it's not actually really rate base. It's refund. So, the rate base doesn't really change in that regard. It would only change if we were successful in our outcome with the IRS, because then there would be a deferred tax and the rate base would go down -- the net rate base will go down. So, really what we're talking about is the $510 million that you see there. That total amount is the requested refund. And so, we've had to ﬁnance that and then the lease payments that are above the $17 million a year on an ongoing basis."
Understood. Thank you. Thanks a lot.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to David Borde for closing remarks.
