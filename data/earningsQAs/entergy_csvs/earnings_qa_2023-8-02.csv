Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Thanks for taking the questions.,Good morning.
"So, starting at the LPSC, with the LPSC turnover, are there any actionable changes in relationship or alignment that you've implemented? And do you feel the LPSC is, in general, comfortable with the current regulatory constructs? Or would you look to add anything beyond the new resiliency framework kind of going forward?","Hey, good morning. It's Rod. I think the best answer to your question is really the proof of concept, the decisions that the LPSC has made to date. We've gotten support, as you'll recall, after the election at the end of 2022. We got the support for our securitization. We got support for our Lake Charles Transmission system. We got support for our gas business rate decisions, all from the new Commission.  And so, I don't believe that we have a relationship issue. And in fact, we continue to work collaboratively with this new Commission. We acknowledge that the addition of the newest Commissioner, Davante Lewis, has created an opportunity for us to engage diﬀerently in educating a new commissioner on the historic relationships between the company and its stakeholders, not just the relationship between the Commissioner and the company, but also the Commissioner and the customer impacts.     I know that you're reacting, your question reacts in some respects from some of the comments that have come out of individual commissioners, and our reaction has been consistent. As long as we maintain our focus on ensuring positive customer outcomes, whether it's resiliency, whether it's renewables and clean energy, and certainly aﬀordability, we expect to be aligned, continue to be aligned with LPSC.  And so, we're moving forward, as Drew alluded to, with our regulatory calendars and to ﬁle our rate case and an FRP, as well as a strong renewables portfolio, in addition to continuing to fuel the growth for the state. And we expect the Commission to be supportive to open up these positions. We'll have a lot of debate along the way, but we'll continue to work constructively with them.  And, Constantine, as part of your question, whether there's -- we think there's some continued support for formula rate plans within LPSC."
"Right. And I guess, just anything that you feel like you need incremental to narrow some of those are kind of earned ROE gaps.","Well, from that vantage point, that's less of a change. It's Entergy's interest in ensuring that the both, whatever the regulatory mechanism is, we're using both the ﬁling of the rate case as well as the planned FRP renewal to align those recovery mechanisms with our capital plan.  We're not necessarily disclosing any speciﬁc tweak at this point to the FRP because we haven't even made the ﬁling yet, but we expect the Commission to be receptive to the case we're making for why an FRP is in the best interest of customers long- term. We're ﬁling the rate case because it was a condition of the settlement during the last FRP renewal, but we expect to continue to make the case to the Commission for why the FRP is in, in certain adjustments to it, would be beneﬁcial to our stakeholders long-term."
"Excellent. That's great color. And maybe shifting to the other regulatory, SERI, with the operational prudence complaint kind of reaching a point of settlement impasse in July, and re-hearing is still pending, are you embedding any range of outcomes in the current ﬁnancial plans, just in terms of cash or ﬁnancing drag, and maybe any guidance on kind of capping the potential liability in any form from the last complaint?","Sure. Thanks for the question. As it relates to SERI and our ﬁnancial plan, as you know, we recorded the reserve last year equal to the Mississippi settlements applied broadly across, and that is reﬂected in our ﬁnancial plan. And then we assume that       we are able to continue to work with the parties to resolve the litigation and that Grand Gulf is an important asset to our ﬂeet and continues to operate and contribute to our results.  And I'll add that, in terms of capping the exposure, the ALJ order from May regarding the UPSA is, while it had, as I mentioned, it had about $250 million of requested refunds, it did prune oﬀ quite a bit of additional liability.    And so, you do see that the amount of liability continues to come in as we move forward in the process. But we're still working through all that. And certainly, that's -- the amount that we believe we are at right now is what we have reﬂected on our books."
Perfect. Thank you. And I'll jump back in queue.,"Thank you.    Operator  All right. Perfect. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet. Jeremy, please go ahead."
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.
"Just want to stick with Louisiana here a bit. And I think you touched on it a little bit but wanted to see if you might be able to expand more and how do you think that Louisiana resiliency process could unfold once the staﬀ engineer report is ﬁled this month. Any sense from the Commission on how the Commission would like to handle it and if this could be kind of rolled together, the resiliency, the RFP, the rate case all get tied together?","I totally understand your question, and my hesitation is only that I don't want to get ahead of the regulatory process, but I think your instincts are aligned once we get initial feedback from the staﬀ on the ﬁling. I think it puts us in a position to evaluate the timing around how we might pursue potential settlement discussions.     Our objective obviously is to remove as much uncertainty, as we can, and whenever we have the opportunity to avoid going through the expense of litigating issues where there's an opportunity to ﬁnd common ground, part of our expectation going in is to ﬁrst make the compliance ﬁlings as is expected by the Commission. But the moment we do, we're trying to ﬁnd a path to settlement that isn't diﬀerent.  And I think your instincts about how we think about between now and the end of the year, assessing the likelihood of aligning around both the resiliency ﬁling in concert with the discussions around the rate case FRP, are spot on. That's our ultimate objective, but we have to make the ﬁling and get the feedback. We have to make the ﬁling on the rate case but, to your point, get the feedback from the LPSC staﬀ on the resiliency ﬁling and take it from there. But great point."
"Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. And sticking with Louisiana here, our stakeholder communications let us to hear about, when there's recent outages, there was some system glitches in communication to consumers was maybe not where it could be. Just wondering eﬀorts on this side to, I guess, the improved customer response and kind of address some of those local stakeholder concerns there.","Yes. Jeremy, this is Drew. We have folks all over that issue. We've got over 100 people squirreled away in a large conference room in Texas working on this, but we feel like we have a good plan going forward from where we are. Certainly, some of the performance of some of our systems after some upgrades that were intended to improve things last -- earlier in or late in the spring didn't work out as intended. And so we worked through all that. We have a good plan going forward, and we expect to be back on track for any future storms."
"Got it. That's helpful there. And then just the last one, if I could. I was wondering if you might be able to unpack a little bit more FFO-to-debt and kind of the trajectory over the balance of the year and hitting the goals that you want to hit there. Just any incremental color would be appreciated.","Sure, Jeremy. Really two key factors there. One is closing the Louisiana securitization, which we did in the ﬁrst quarter. And as we go through the year, you'll see the debt associated with previously carrying that role oﬀ. And the second is around the recovery of the higher deferred fuel balances that occurred last year with the higher gas prices and higher volumes we saw. You can see that the deferred fuel balances are down back to, what I would consider, more normal levels. And so, as those debt levels roll oﬀ, those two items will signiﬁcantly help us. And then just managing through our normal operations as we go through the end of the year puts us on target to be at or above that 14%."
That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Thanks, Jeremy.    Operator  Thanks, Jeremy. Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro. David, please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"Let's see. I think, Drew, you alluded to some initiatives that you're pursuing on the renewable development side of things to make the organization more competitive in some of these RFPs and to give yourself a better ﬁghting chance to do some more self-build. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what types of initiatives that you've pursued there to lower costs and build the pipeline, it sounded like.","Yeah. Thanks, David. That's a good question. We have been working on building capability in the development space, as I mentioned, and we have been actually successful for the projects that we have been able to put forward and competing in our RFPs.  So, I think we're making good progress in terms of what does it take to be competitive on the solar RFP front. The challenge we've had is we just haven't had a large pipeline of projects to support. So, many of the projects that are even in the 30% that I mentioned earlier are build and transfer projects, where a developer is constructing it and then moving it over to us just before the completion of COD.  What I'm referring to when I say we're making progress is we are ﬁnding some success in building up our portfolio. So, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of about four gigawatts of development pipeline that we have put forward at this point.  Now, I wouldn't say that's all ready to go in RFP. We're still building out some of those projects, but it's a much larger portfolio, and we are expecting to add maybe another half gigawatt to that by the end of the year.     And then beyond that point, we expect it to continue to grow, and that should be very strong, given where we have been competitively. That should be very strong in the RFPs going forward. So, that's what we've been seeing, and that's what we're focused on.    And the only thing that I'll add to Drew's comment is that part of the sort of declogging, if you will, that pipeline, we've been securing additional sites for renewables development, including our generation sites as well as the transmission interconnects that are all part of the development process, and that's adding to our improved competitiveness, to Drew's point."
"Got it. Thanks. That's helpful color. And then, let's see, curious, a similar topic, but in Texas, one of your peer utilities in the state has had challenges just getting a few renewables projects over the ﬁnish line there. I was just wondering how that's aﬀecting your strategy in the state of Texas, how that might maybe impacting the outstanding RFPs that you've got there.","Yeah. And the short answer is that it's not impacting -- one, it's not a surprise to us, because our point of view is consistent with and has been consistent with the PUCT. We understand the signiﬁcance of reliability ﬁrst. We do believe, because of the interest of our customers, that the renewable resources should be an important part of our supply portfolio, but we recognize that the Commission's position has been rather consistent in Texas.  It's notable that our position outside of ERCOT in our service territory and the success we've had in our CCNs has given, in our view, given us a better vantage point to discuss the attributes of renewables with the Commission, perhaps in a diﬀerent light, because we're not having the same reliability issues in our service territory as they've expressed concerns about the inside of ERCOT.  We are paying close attention, though, to, particularly in Texas, if the Commission were to have a change in policy around renewables, we see a tremendous opportunity in both hydrogen and CCS for other capital investment opportunities. But we think our position is strong. Our customers, particularly given all the growth we have in Texas, are requesting the attributes of renewables and/or clean energy. And we're well positioned regardless of what direction the Commission might take from a policy perspective in Texas to help them meet those needs."
Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.,"Thank you.      Operator   All right. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo. Paul, please go ahead."
"Hi. Good morning. Thank you, team.","Good morning, Paul."
"Drew, I think you mentioned that, although some projects might be shifting around the timing a little bit, you're net seeing stronger industrial growth in that 2025 period, '25 plus, just -- if you could give a little more color on that and kind of what that means for the plan and if this is something you could roll into the plan with an EEI refresh.","Yeah, so it would be expected to be part of the EEI refresh, and we can give you some more details for sure.    Then I would characterize the movement from '24 to '25 as the normal roll around of these large industrial projects that are billions of dollars and they're hard to get done. And so that's nothing that we haven't seen before. And so that is why I wouldn't say that was expected. I would say we're not surprised. And that is -- So, that part's not really new news.  As we look forward beyond 2024, we are continuing to see a very robust industrial sales pipeline, lots of interest from a lot of diﬀerent parties, particularly around the clean energy. I mentioned a particular CCUS project from ExxonMobil in my remarks, but there are other projects like that out there. There are projects like that related to hydrogen.  So, we are, I think, well positioned to take advantage of all of that, and we'll give you more details whenever we get to EEI."
"Okay. Great. Understood. And then, just pivoting to Texas, following up on a couple of questions that were asked, is there a good way to think about what the earnings improvement opportunity is after the legislation, whether it's earned ROE basis points, additional capital spending opportunities? Just if there's some way to think about that, that'd be helpful. Thank you.","Sure, Paul. Are you referencing out of the Texas legislation speciﬁcally? Was that your question?"
"Correct. Yes. The legislation, plural[ph].","Yes. There were a couple of or a number of favorable things out of the legislation. Obviously, the resilience ﬁling gives us a path to ﬁle our resilience plan and seek recovery of that in a way that helps provide our system higher resilience standard and support our customers.  The DCRF change from an annual ﬁling to a biannual ﬁling, that certainly gives us an opportunity to improve or decrease the lag associated with an investment, but from an overall perspective we're still -- we haven't changed our outlooks really with regards to that, but certainly a better way to recover investments.  And then the third item is around compensation. And that one really for us on executive compensation is around recovery in a rate case. It's not really eﬀective to us, but it certainly is helpful from a precedential perspective."
Okay. Is there a way to kind of quantify like an ROE improvement or something from all of that?,"Yes. I think it's too early to do that at this point, but certainly they are positive tailwinds from our perspective that help us when we think about our overall outlooks, but nothing changes on that regard."
"Okay. Great. Thanks.    Operator  All right. And it looks like right now that it's all of our questions. If there are no more questions, I'll go ahead and turn it back over to Mr.Abler.","Thanks, Jeremy, and thanks, everyone, for participating this morning.
