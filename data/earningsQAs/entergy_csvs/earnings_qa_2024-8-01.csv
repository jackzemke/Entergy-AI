Question,Answer
"Hey guys, good morning.","Good morning, Shahriar."
"Drew, starting oﬀ on sort of the--the regulatory progress in Louisiana and FERC. Any further updates there with the updated schedule, and more importantly, would that be a potential catalyst to maybe revisit capital allocation and the CapEx plans, especially as you settle the FRP and look at new generation deployment under the new 3 gigawatt mechanism? Thanks.","Hey Shahriar, could you repeat the ﬁrst part of your question, you cut out for just one second?"
"Yeah, no problem. Any--any further updates on--on Louisiana and FERC in that process? That's the ﬁrst part. And the second part is just as we're thinking about concluding in those processes, depending if there is a global settlement or whatever; is that sort of the catalyst to revisit kind of capital allocation and the CapEx plans, especially as you kind of settle the FRP and look at new generation deployment? Thanks.","Yeah. So I'll let Rod talk about the ﬁrst part and I'll let Kimberly talk about the second part.      Yes. It's Rod. In terms of FERC, as we did in the--in the prior SERI settlements, we actually have to ﬁle the FERC settlement, the SERI settlement. Can you hear me now, Shahriar?"
Much better. Rod.,"Good deal. As was the case with prior SERI settlements, we will ﬁle the proposed SERI settlement with the LPSC, and--and nevertheless, it will still be subject to--to FERC approval and there'll be subsequent ﬁlings with--with the FERC in that regard. So we--we still have work to do. All of--all of what we've shared is still subject to approvals, but it will be a methodical process and it will begin with--with what we submit to the LPSC for their consideration on the 14th.    And I'll just add to that, I think and it goes to what Kimberly will talk about in a second. The thing that we're pleased about is the nature of the way that these results came together and--and all of that.    Yeah. And--and we talked about this at Analyst Day, Shahriar, that our stakeholder engagement strategy was far more deliberate and far more discrete in terms of the stakeholders that we brought together to put us in a position to--to have this--this settlement. The outcomes was a--was a function of each of the interested stakeholders having an opportunity far earlier in the process to weigh in on this conversation. And while--while we are--we are pleased that we're able to get to this point, our work--our work continues because as Drew mentioned in his earlier comments, this simply sets the stage for us to be able to execute on capturing the growth with far greater clarity. But it is a stakeholder engagement-driven process that includes our regulators, includes our customers and policymakers and we're-- we're really at just the beginning and certainly excited about what's now possible with clarity on--on where Louisiana is headed. That same strategy is playing out in the other states. So we can now focus on the growth store.  And Shahriar, from a capital allocation perspective, certainly, we're pleased to--to be at this point, we'll let the process play out, and then we would expect to give a full update in AI in November as we typically do."
"Great, looking forward to that. And then just lastly, obviously the '24 assumptions picked up. You talked about load growth, more coming in 4Q. You've got the O&M beneﬁts also kicking in, in the back end. It sounds like you're kind of ahead of schedule for '24, but I don't want to lead the witness. Is there kind of any read through to '25 as we're thinking about bridging from '24 to '25? Thanks.","Yeah, we shared our outlook at Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, and I think that is the best place to point. We continue to be on track for this year and as--as Rod said, we're setting ourselves up to continue to deliver on what we provided in our last update a few weeks ago."
"Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. See you soon.","All right. Thanks, Shahriar.    Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy, please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
I just wanted to come back here to Louisiana. And could you outline more on the scope of your FRP and SERI settlements? Does this leave anything else critical to be addressed for either matter at this point?,"Now, as a--as a general matter, the settlement addresses the formula rate plan extension and terms and conditions of the go forward regulatory construct. It resolves prior--prior issues. There are eight or so reated--related dockets that are also cleaned up, much of them dealing with historical administrative proceedings. And then SERI settlement, the SERI settlement is a diﬀerent--is a diﬀerent settlement posture, but--but essentially it clears the deck of the major litigation between-- between Entergy and the Commission and its stakeholders."
"Got it, it clears the deck. Great to hear. And just moving on here for that August 14th LPSC meeting, do you expect the commission to vote on both settlements or just discuss the details or if the latter, when--when do you think they might vote?","So on the--on the 14th, and again, this is all subject to the Commission's consideration. It is our expectation that the Commission would take up the--the       proposed settlement that the staﬀ would put forward on the FRP, the settlement associated with SERI and its related dockets and the other--the other, I'll call them the other additional dockets that--that we were able to--to seek alignment on. But we expect the Commission to take them all up.    And lets also and Drew made reference in his remarks that at least for the Louisiana Public Service Commission's consideration of the gas LDC sale, the staﬀ had already issued a report recommending that the LPSC approve their portion of that sale, so that--that may very well be taken up on the 14th as well. So we expect a pretty comprehensive docket that the Commission will take up on the 14th."
"Got it. Very helpful. And just real quick one to revisit, I guess, as the data center opportunity set that sits before you. Any--any updates to provide there as far as, I guess, just what potential opportunities do you see the paced of, I guess, opportunity set if that's accelerating? Just any color would be great.","Yeah. We laid out at Analyst Day the--the--nothing that we had presented in terms of our outlook included anything other than AWS. And as Drew alluded to, the 5 gigawatt to 10 gigawatt opportunity was not something we were speculating around. Its in our pipeline because we're having actual conversations with--with prospective customers in that regard who, as we laid out, we're taking advantage of a lot of the structural advantages of the Gulf Coast, the low-energy rates that we provide, certainly the constructive regulatory environment that's been --that's been supportive of--of economic development and growth in our regions.  And so we expect that at the appropriate times, we'll be able to give details. But as was the case in--in prior customer additions, we're--we're not giving out or talking about where any speciﬁc customer is in the process until such time that--that both we and--and they are prepared to go public with something. But again, we're--we're bullish about the prospect because of all the advantages that we laid out at Analyst Day and on top of that our stakeholder engagement strategy, making sure that all the right stakeholders are at the table quite early in the process."
"Got it. Thank you for that.    Operator  Thanks, Jeremy. And our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead.",
"Oh, hey, great. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"Hey, I was wondering just maybe on the--well, congratulations on all the progress that you're making in--in these proceedings. I was curious on the SERI settlement. Is that consistent with the others--with the other commission settlements in terms of like the allocational app or proportional split to Louisiana?","The short answer is yes. The SERI settlement that's proposed is consistent with the-- with the settlement constructs in the other jurisdictions, Mississippi, Arkansas, and New Orleans. Yes."
"Okay, great. Understood. And then I was wondering just considering that settlement in the Louisiana FRP, how do those line up against your earnings projections here? Does that shift or solidify where you are within the range? And then also on the cash ﬂow side of things, is this consistent with what you would have expected in terms of the cash ﬂow forecast going forward?","Yeah, thanks, David. The settlements and, for both settlements are all considered in both our EPS and our cash ﬂow outlooks that we're aﬃrming today. So I would think about that from that perspective."
"All right. Sounds good. Thanks so much.    Operator  Thanks, David. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo with Jeﬀeries. Paul, please go ahead.",
"Hi, good morning, team.","Good morning, Paul."
"Yeah. You know, very great to see the productive settlement oﬀ. I know you'd all be hard at work while I was hanging out on the beach. So good to see that one for       those two. I've got two totally unrelated questions. The ﬁrst is on the renewables RFP updates. Good to see more utility owned assets there. I know that's been a priority for you. Is there a good way to think about in a measure of the progress as we go forward on these RFPs about like how much is embedded in the plan versus kind of upside to the plan?","Yeah. We--we shared our capital view a few weeks ago, which gave you sort of owned renewables and then I believe there was a slide that also showed the breakout there. And so as we go through the RFPs, we'll be able to see as they're announced what comes through there and we'll provide periodic updates with EDI and other places about how those are performing.  And we would expect to have a large RFP in the fall for Louisiana."
"Okay. Okay, great. I'll stay tuned for that. And then the other was just on hardening. I know you've been very vocal for years about hardening. I just want to see if there is any kind of potential amendments, changes in philosophy for the--the Texas plan. I know you have Phase-1 in there, whether it's an amendment to Phase-1 or pull forward over your thoughts for Phase-2. Just any perspective you could provide?","Yeah, that's a good question. So we've been thinking about this in terms of sort of where we were pre Beryl and post Beryl. Yeah, certainly, whenever you have a storm, you--you reﬂect on where you are, what you're doing and--and those kinds of things. Pre Beryl, we have a plan that we have submitted in Texas, our resiliency plan and it's based on what the current rules and legislation that was introduced a couple of years ago. And so it reﬂects those priorities.  And as we've talked about, there are a couple of things that we wanted to see in the legislation previously that we weren't able to get it in, namely around transmission being included and also our ability to accelerate the replacement of existing assets by getting return oﬀ and on. And if we don't get that return on, then it's harming our credit if we try to accelerate. So we have a more measured pace.  Having said that, now we've made the ﬁling and now we are post Beryl and the opportunity is for us to engage our stakeholders to ﬁgure out if this is the plan that we want to stick with or if there is a diﬀerent plan that we want to go with. So its now open for conversation and we're excited about where that might go. And of course, we'll have another opportunity coming up in the legislative session as well, to--to potentially address some of the things that we weren't able to address last time. And with that, I'll pass it over to Rod to see what else he had to add.        Yeah. And I would just reiterate the point that--that Beryl provides an opportunity to revisit the public policy backdrop to our--to our capital plans. And not only just in Texas as Texas a state revisits the resiliency conversation with the recency of Beryl, but other jurisdictions are certainly paying attention to some of the lessons learned as well. And while Louisiana is well on its way with its resiliency plan where so much of the attention has been paid of late, Drew referenced New Orleans in his ongoing conversations and--and we know empirically they--they were paying close attention to the experiences in--in Houston. And--and it is an opportunity for us both at the technical conference as well as our ongoing conversations with the--with the Council between now and the end of the year to revisit the scale, scope, and eﬃcacy because we're still very much in the middle of storm season. So the--the unfortunate storm from a customer standpoint provides an opportunity for the states and other stakeholders to revisit the resiliency conversation with whatever new information and lessons learned from Beryl. So."
Great. Now thank you both very much for the color.,"Okay. Thanks, Paul. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lonegan with Evercore ISI. Michael, please go ahead."
"Hi, thanks for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"On the industrial sales growth speciﬁcally, just wondering where you are tracking for the year. I know you expect new customers in the fourth quarter. Are all these customers on track? And just trying to get a sense of where you stand versus your long-term 8% to 9% industrial sales growth outlook?","Yeah, we're still on track through the end of the year for what we've provided about 4% for the full year with most of that coming late in the year. There are a couple of large industrials that we expect to come on. We do have those customers are on minimum build type contracts that if they are delayed, we still have some protection from a--from a bottom-line perspective because of how they're contracted in. But we believe we're still on track and then we continue to see a strong pipeline throughout the forecast period that supports that growth trajectory that you referenced."
"Great, thanks. And then secondly for me, on the pension lift out, just wondering how much you're reducing the volatility of your pension plan, the pricing you got versus par and if you see opportunity to do more lift outs?","Yeah. We were pleased with the outcome of that lift out. As I said, the net pension plan is funded now at 96% and we continue to ﬁnd ways to reduce volatility. We use smoothing mechanisms in our regulatory jurisdictions to help reduce that volatility as those costs on the regulated side are recovered through rates. As far as weather, we could do another pension lift out. We--obviously that would have to--the math on that and the ability to execute on that would have to work, but we think that we are in a good place with where we are currently and what we've done to derisk our pension plans."
"Great, thanks (inaudible)","In the appendix, there is a sensitivity chart for pension, which is 25 basis-points or for every--for every 25 basis-points, plus or minus a penny is kind of where our sensitivity is at this point, which is a lot lower than where it used to be to Kimberly's point."
"Great. Thanks for taking my questions.    Operator  Great. Thanks, Michael. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi. Ryan, please go ahead.",
"Hi, everybody. Regarding the lessons learned from Beryl, what do you think is the best way to address the issues around vegetation outside your right of way hitting electric lines in Texas and more broadly in your service territory? Any color or initial thoughts around how to address that potential problem?","Yeah, its--its Rod. The--the best way to address it is--is to be proactive and to communicate. Its embedded in our capital plans and has been across the jurisdictions. Its also part not only of our reliability capital plan, but also the--the resiliency capital plan and--and the conversation for us around stakeholder engagement includes making it clear to our stakeholders exactly how those investments are--are beneﬁting customers. I think the--the opportunity we have here is to accelerate the--the asset component of resiliency. That's what's diﬀerent than our normal reliability conversation. But we've been particularly in the areas where we     serve in South Louisiana and--and certainly Southeast Texas, vegetation has long been both a challenge and an opportunity for us.  And--and I think from a regulatory construct perspective, and I think Drew alluded to this in his comments; what really--what really created the problem for customers in Hurricane Beryl were trees outside of the right-of-way. What do we mean by right-of- way? That is the area from where our facilities are situated. What's the--the area of, how many feet outside of where our facilities exist, do we have the capacity to--to trim those trees or--or vegetation as the case may be? And I think when you're paying attention to the regulatory processes in Louisiana and Texas and beyond, I think you'll hear more of a conversation around extending the right-of-ways, allowing us to trim in a further area surrounding where our facilities are located to provide greater margin for when those winds come and those trees and other vegetation gets into--get into the facilities that disrupt service for customers.    And the capital, when we go back and we build to modern standards those then, there is the--the potential to widen right of ways or deal with that. But if you were able to go from an H frame transmission structure to a vertical transmission structure, that does reduce the target area a little bit for the trees that--that come from outside the right-of-way. Its not perfect, so like Rod said, you got to go trim maybe, you may need to widen the right of ways because those trees are pretty tall and you just don't have that many feet and a lot of areas in our preservative territory in particular, a lot of tall pine trees out there. But some--some of it can be mitigated with--with design and acceleration of resilience investment."
"On the expansion of right of ways, would that require a legislative solution, or is there other mechanisms to be able to eﬀectuate that stated objective?","And we had to get permission from the commissions to extend the right of way. That's--that's basically rulemaking that sort of sets the terms and conditions under which we operate under our franchise. And so that is a commission by commission state--state-by-state conversation. But yes, we would go to the Commission to seek an expansion of the existing right of ways.  And then maybe even a right of way by right of way. And we may have to go back to each individual right of way and renegotiate."
"Okay. And then just one last on this. In terms of the--the length of your right of way, is there an average number that you're citing? I think the 18 inches for one of your peers? Yeah, do you see that varying geographically in terms of the distance that you have in certain high risk locations?","Yeah. That's a jurisdiction by jurisdiction conversation, but its usually articulated in numbers of feet away from--from existing facilities. And that's on top of what I'm sure is going to be a conversation about more resilient poles that--that hold up a better, not just the tree trimming around the facilities, but remember that resiliency is about more resilient facilities themselves that--that can do a better job of--of with standing wind, not just wind, but the trees themselves. But yes, its usually in feet and jurisdiction by jurisdiction.    Right. And urban versus rural, right? I mean, we have in the City of New Orleans some pretty tight right of way elements and tree trimming requirements, not unlike some other urban environment. So yeah, we're--we're very familiar with some of those challenges."
Thanks for the color.,"Absolutely.    Operator  All right. Thank you, Ryan. And our ﬁnal question today comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead."
Good morning. Thank you.,Good morning.
"On the AWS facility, what type of regulatory approvals or ﬁlings or anything else related to that are necessary before or to get continued shovels in the ground?","Yeah. We talked about it just at Analyst Day and--and before. One of the--one of the big advantages that--that allowed us to move at the--at the speed of their expectations was getting pre-approval. So in order for us to put the shovels in the ground, the Mississippi Commission with the support of the Mississippi Legislature have already pre-approved the CCN process in order for us to--to begin the design build-out to serve AWS."
Okay. And was there a CapEx or a rate base number associated with that?,"We haven't given a speciﬁc number associated with that customer, and you can see the update at--at year end and that there is additional renewables, for example, for Mississippi to support the clean energy associated with that customer, but we haven't broken out a speciﬁc CapEx for that speciﬁc customer."
Okay. And that wasn't part of the CCN?,"No. Those, as Rod said, from a CCN perspective, that was handled through working with the PEC or with the Mississippi Public Search Commission and--and the state as well."
"Got it. Okay. And then real quick, you mentioned an answer to an earlier question about legislative session potential around some Beryl and other storm related issues. What are the possible outcomes legislatively, what are you thinking about there or did I misinterpret that?","No, you--you heard me correctly. And I think Drew--Drew also alluded to it in Texas, the legislative session for us in the last couple of years has been around allowing-- giving the Commission of Texas the ability to do rulemaking to facilitate resiliency spend. And the point that Drew made was that, that in the last legislative session, which is every odd year in Texas, which would have been the '23 session. We along with other--other stakeholders in the State of Texas made a lot of headway to facilitate resiliency spend, but there were some items like the accelerated replacement of transmission facilities as part of the resiliency plan that didn't get addressed in the way in which we thought would have been--would have been ideal. And its an opportunity for us to go back in the '25 legislative session with the support of the commission and other stakeholders in Texas to revisit--revisit that legislation that would--that would add-on or complement what Texas has already done to facilitate accelerated resiliency spend by utilities."
"Okay, got it. So it was just Texas in terms of the comment about legislative?",That's correct..
"Okay, got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.    Operator  Thank you.","Thanks, Travis.    Operator  And there are no further questions at this time.
