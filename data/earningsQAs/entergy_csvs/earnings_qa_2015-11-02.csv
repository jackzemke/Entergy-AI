Question,Answer
"Hi, guys. So I have a quick question on the cash taxes. Given the change in the NOL position down to $1.9 billion, I know you've clariﬁed that you will still have a pretty low cash tax rate. Can we just understand what's the driver or what helps you get to that low cash tax rate given the NOL position change?","Sure, Praful. This is Drew. As we've talked in the past, we have a portfolio of strategies out there that we are pursuing and those strategies are still intact. Over time we could see the NOL start to move back up again. But right now, we just settled, and so the NOL is back down to where it is at $1.9 billion. So we just wanted to make sure that when you saw it come down, you'd know what the driver was and what the settlement was. The important thing is that our tax team is still here. They're still working hard on new ideas and new strategies, and we expect that those will continue to bear some fruit going forward."
"Got it. Thank you. And then in terms of the FitzPatrick retirement, from a decommissioning perspective, do you expect there to be any impact from a cash ﬂow perspective to Entergy, or is the decommissioning fund fully funded and how do you see that playing out?","Well, it's Drew again. So the decommissioning fund meets all the NRC requirements, and consistent with how Vermont Yankee did, we would expect the same kind of approach for FitzPatrick going forward. So we wouldn't see or anticipate any cash contributions to the decommissioning trust fund associated with the decommissioning the plant."
"I got you. Thank you, guys.","Thank you.    Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open. Your question, please?"
Yes. Hi. How are you?,"Good morning, Paul. We're doing well."
"Just in terms of the tax rate, the 10%, that's the cash tax rate. Is that correct?","Yes, sir."
And what's the expected book tax rate that we'll see in earnings?,"Well, the book tax rate, as you know, we don't usually give out a forecast for book tax rate until the prompt year. There are deﬁnitely some things that could improve over the statutory rate that we've used in our forward-looking expectations. But at this point we're not prepared to say exactly what those are. There's too many things going on in conversations with federal tax authorities, state tax authorities, state regulators to be able to successfully pin that down until we get closer to that time."
Okay. And then with respect to slide 36 and it looks like you guys are going to be expensing the fuel and other things associated with FitzPatrick and Pilgrim with special items. I'm wondering how will you guys be treating the revenue.,"Well, the revenue will be operational. What we're going to be choosing – or not choosing. What we'll be treating as special items are things that would otherwise had been capitalized. So any signiﬁcant capital expenditures or in the case of Pilgrim refueling, outage costs or fuel costs that would have normally otherwise had been capitalized and amortized over coming cycles, those will be considered special items. And just for sake of making it clear which pieces are part of the ongoing operations and which pieces aren't, that's the same approach that we used with Vermont Yankee and we think it's more helpful that way. We'll try to be as transparent as possible about all the moving parts in there."
"Okay. And then just in general, with the economies of scale, you've shut down three nukes in a pretty short period of time in the northeast. Is there any impact to the economies of scale of what's left I mean in the allocation of expenses or any thoughts on that?","Yes. So there deﬁnitely is some lost economies of scale. We manage our nuclear ﬂeet as a ﬂeet across the north and the southern utility nuclear assets. So we have a lot of economies of scale, but it will be shrinking over the retirement schedule over the next few years. Depending on how far you go with the retirement schedule, depends on how much of an impact that economies of scale has. For the Northeast, we do have about $35 million of overhead at each plant, and about half of that is direct cost. And so beyond that, we'll be targeting a level of costs that are prudent for the business size and the size of the ﬂeet going forward to make sure the plants stay safe and reliable."
Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Your question please.
"Yes. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.    Good morning, Jonathan."
"Just to clarify, you've said very clearly that you expect the 2016 and 2017 Utility, Parent & Other outlooks to be unchanged, or I think that's what I heard. But you're also saying that beyond the prompt year, you'll guide to statutory tax rate. So is 2016 still good assuming a statutory tax rate, or is that one of the things that might shift as you give us the drivers?","It's assuming the statutory tax rate. We were trying to hold, quite frankly, Jonathan, the forward-looking stuﬀ to EEI, and we just removed it from this to do it at EEI next week. But it seemed to raise some questions. So the previous disclosure that was at the statutory tax rate, that's what we were talking about."
"And so you expect that to still be the case? Okay, great. That was my question. Thanks.","Yes, and to the earlier question about the eﬀective tax rate, I guess. We would hope to do better than the statutory tax rate in 2016, but we're not prepared yet to identify that. But taking that aside, we still are at the current disclosure that we put forth previously."
"But if I may, just on one other issue around guidance. The ANO costs and you referenced those as, I think, $85 million, which is the same number between 2015 and 2016 that was in the 10-Q. Were those already in the guidance you showed us last quarter fully, or is there an element of that being added in?","No. Those are already fully baked in the guidance. They were not in the guidance that we set up at Analyst Day last year, just to be clear. So at Analyst Day last year, it was when we originally set up our range of where we thought the midpoint could land between $4.35 and $4.75, and it didn't include ANO at that point and it     expected higher interest rates for pension beneﬁts, et cetera. So there are several things that have moved around, but ANO was speciﬁcally not included at that time but it is now."
And was it included when you showed us $3.65 last quarter?,$3.65 is for 2015.
Yes.,Just to be clear.
Right.,"And it was not included – when we originally set $3.65 that was at the beginning of this year, that's before we had clarity around what ANO was going to be. So it was not included in the $3.65."
Okay. So that's part of the change to this $3.30 number.,"Yes. That's exactly right. So the drivers between the $3.65 and the $3.30, I think it's in my script but it's like $0.17 is related to ANO and -- I'm sorry, what was that?    $0.06 O&M and...    Oh, yes, $0.06 O&M and some other stuﬀ."
"Okay. And so similarly on the 2016 outlook, the $35 million of ANO that you disclosed in the 10-Q would not have been in that range, but you're saying the range is still good, so something else must have oﬀset it.",That's right. What we said -- the lower end of the range is what we previously had said.
"Right. That was, again, without the ANO drag. Am I right in that?",That is with the ANO drag.
"The lower end comment included the ANO drag, but it wasn't in the 2015 $3.65?",That's correct.
"Okay. Great, that's...","I'm sorry. I think I'm confusing you worse than I really need to, but our original guidance for 2016 was $4.35 to $4.75. Where we said at the lower end, that includes ANO."
Okay.,"For 2015, it was at $3.65. That did not include ANO, but the $3.30 does now."
Perfect. That is very clear. Thank you.,"Thanks, Jonathan.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is now open. Your question, please."
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.    Good morning.
"So, let me actually start where you guys just left oﬀ there. In terms of weather- normalized impact, the 2015 update you just provided, I know you just alluded to the ANO negative hit, but you've had $0.23, if I have this year-to-date positive weather. What's kind of the impact of the weather-normalized sales year-to-date, if you will?",I believe that the weather-normalized sales year-to-date -- I don't know what the year – I can't think of the year-to-date number oﬀ the top of my head. For the full year...
"Or for the – yeah, versus the guidance update you just did.","Right. For the full year, I believe, it's $0.07, of which about $0.08 is residential weather, so – not weather, just residential, weather-adjusted."
Got it. $0.07 negative versus the $0.23 positive weather.,Yeah. That's correct.
"Got it. All right. Excellent.    Turning to the more strategic issues, looking at the Nuclear business today, how are you thinking about Indian Point? I mean, is this something – Indian Point, Palisades -- this is something that you would consider continuing to own just as two standalone units given the contained portfolio beneﬁts of owning it in the context of the regulated business? Or is this something that you would imagine that you could arrive at a strategic juncture on?","Well. Julien, this is Leo, I mean, obviously we continue to evaluate what the best thing to do with those assets is. But as we mentioned before and when they were talking about overheads a moment ago in that discussion, we still have economies of scale and an operating capability within nuclear assets.  And as Drew mentioned, we do operate the facilities as a ﬂeet. And we can continue to do that from an operational standpoint. And so, we're prepared to do that. Doesn't mean we aren't looking at alternatives, but as you know, the alternatives around Indian Point are limited and then we'll just have to go from here.  But obviously, we can do it and we will if we have to. And it's not a problem for us, but the strategic options, obviously become limited given the regulatory approvals required, et cetera."
"Right. And just this clariﬁcation there in the spring refueling outage on Pilgrim, that's a ﬁnal decision now that you intend to pursue that rather than retire going into that?",We have not – in which year?
"The spring 2017 refueling outage, have you committed to doing that or is there still the thought process you could buy back the capacity?",No. We have not committed to do that yet.
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Your question, please?"
Good morning. How are you?,"Good. Good. How are you?    Good morning, Paul."
"Quick question, on Jonathan Arnold's question, you referenced $3.30. Is that really the $3.35 I see on slide nine?","Oh, yes. I apologize. Yes, it's $3.35."
"And year-to-date, UP&O is at $3.55, so does that imply we're going to have a loss in the fourth quarter?","That's including tax and weather – the $3.30 is tax, weather and special items adjusted."
And your year-to-date...,"And we're not anticipating a loss in the fourth quarter, if that's what you're asking."
But your year-to-date results are $3.55 at UP&O. I'm just trying to bridge between – from here to there.,"So that including – that includes weather and taxes, I believe."
"Okay, so $3.35 does not include weather.",That's correct.
"Got it. Okay. And then, is $15 million this year and $35 million next year still the right split for ANO?",Yes. That's correct.
Thank you very much for your help.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Your question please.
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen."
"I wanted to just follow up on FitzPatrick and check whether there are any limits on being able to put the plant into safe store, or if there are other approaches being discussed that would be perhaps more rapid on the actual decommissioning of the facility. Should we be assuming a long-term safe-store option, or is that still to be determined?","Bill, why don't you go ahead and answer that.      Sure. Stephen, this is Bill. Yeah. I think you should generally assume a safe-store option. We're going to have to go through the process of getting a detailed decommissioning cost estimate put together and then ﬁle our post-shutdown activity report closer to the shutdown date. But we are assuming the same type of approach we used at Vermont Yankee."
"Understood. And just on Indian Point, there's been a series of extensions of the standstill agreement with the State of New York on sort of CZM-related topics. Should we be thinking given that there have been those extensions that there is very much an active dialogue going on there or active discussions? It struck me as likely that there are active discussions given the continued short-term extensions of that standstill. Any color on the dialogue there?","Bill?      Yeah. Stephen, we have been in some active discussions, but that standstill agreement did expire. So we'll kind of go back to our position on that before we executed the standstill. Again, we feel very conﬁdent in our legal position that we had an eﬀective withdrawal of that CZM application. And as always, we're open to constructive discussions with the state."
Great. Thank you very much.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Your question please.
"Yeah. Thanks. Couple of questions. First, Leo, could you maybe give us some sense of the how you kind of came at the dividend decision that you did in terms of, I don't know, just target payout or something of that sort?","Sure, Steve. With the growth in investment and rate base and resulting earnings growth, Utility, Parent and Other as we've been mentioning for some time, it's our objective to provide a glide path into a consistent, more predictable dividend path. As we've mentioned in the past, we've taken more of I guess a lumpy approach to it, where we raised it 29% one year, and then we take a few years oﬀ, and we raised it $0.10 or something like that.  So, as we look out into the future, consistent with our expectations around the growth in the Utility, Parent and Other segment of the business, we're kind of on a glide path. So we would hope to provide a consistent growth that will work its way into that payout ratio over the next few years."
"Which is the payout ratio target, is it 65% to 75%?",Correct. Correct.
Okay.,"So at any given time, we might be over or even under depending on how we're growing the business and then obviously it takes into consideration the reinvestment that we have and the opportunity in the Utility for all the items that I outlined that we've put in the disclosures."
"Okay. Just one question on the nuclear. Just you guys historically used to have kind of top tier nuclear operations, so kind of having the ANO and Pilgrim kind of in this Tier 4 was deﬁnitely a change. And I'm just – I think, there's been some changes in management, and I'm just curious, is there – what are the implications for the broader nuclear ﬂeet at Entergy, overall nuclear costs? Are these really just speciﬁc issues just for these two facilities?","Well, ﬁrst, Steve, we take the operations of the ﬂeet – obviously, the safe, secure, and reliable operations of the ﬂeet very seriously. We did have a couple of issues that kind of compounded on each other at both facilities to get us into Column 4. We would anticipate that this is not going to happen anywhere else, and that we'll work our way out of these judiciously and expeditiously with the NRC over the coming couple years."
So it's not cost like for the overall organization or the other plants...,No.
"...related to that. Okay. Great. And then last question just in terms of the FitzPatrick decision, there has been a decent amount of articles just kind of on the political aspects of that. Potentially, I mean – is there any sense of any reaction we might see from this not only just at FitzPatrick, but also maybe Indian Point in terms of kind of political regulatory stuﬀ?","That – I can't really comment on that, Steve. I mean, we did work to try and come up with some way to extend the life of FitzPatrick and we were unable to do that. It's in everybody's best interest, but it just wasn't possible. But the state oﬃcials worked just as hard as we did, as I mentioned in my script, to come to a solution. Some things are just diﬃcult. As you saw from the disclosures, there's a lot of money lost at the facility, and that's certainly a diﬃcult thing to overcome. But we certainly aren't out looking for any kind of political issues."
Okay. Thanks so much.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Your question, please."
"Hey, guys. Yeah. Just curious on FitzPatrick's decision. Can you give us a view of how material from an EPS and from a cash ﬂow accretion and dilution the retirement is for kind of 2017 and beyond?","It's Drew, Michael. So, from a cash ﬂow perspective, we are going to be cash ﬂow positive over the next few years, consistent with the disclosure there of $225 million to $275 million. And so that's the biggest piece. I mean, I think that comes from the fact that we're basically operating at a loss there, and we're also would be incurring costs associated with capital and refueling going forward.  So, I think that's a – those are the biggest things from a cash perspective. From a net income perspective, there's going to be – there's a lot going on. Because of the impairments, you're going to see the costs associated with the refueling outages and the fuel expense that we have. Those are going to be reduced considerably. Obviously, the depreciation is going to come way down. The one thing that's a little diﬀerent for FitzPatrick is the decommissioning cost, the decommissioning expenses that's – currently the fund is still sitting over with NYPA. And so, we're not – we won't see any changes there until a point where we actually get the fund and the liability over to us. So that's a little diﬀerent than Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim going forward.  So those are some of the main drivers that you'll see, I think, if we are thinking about the income statement for that business."
"Okay. But if I'm just kind of – I think my question is kind of focused on kind of the materialness, if there is such a word, of how earnings accretive would it be if I looked at kind of 2015 run rate versus 2017 and beyond post retirement and how cash ﬂow accretive? Directionally, are we talking huge level of accretion or dilution, either of those, tiny, middle of the road?","Well, I think, $225 million to $275 million is, that's materially accretive to me in terms of cash. The earnings piece is not – is going to be accretive, but it's not going to be hugely accretive upfront. There'll be some accretion in 2016 and then in 2017, we'll start incurring the decommissioning cost and stuﬀ like that. We're going to provide some better transparency around what we think the drivers are at the EEI conference next week."
"Got it. Okay. Thanks, Drew.",(48:57)
Much appreciated.,"No problem.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is open. Your question, please."
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.
"Just wanted to clarify where you are with the industrial sales growth; obviously, it was better this quarter than last quarter, but still not up to kind of the 5% that you're guiding to. When do you expect it to really ramp up? And what are the factors that you're evaluating right now?","Neel, this is Theo. You mentioned the 5% we were guiding to. I think we started the year at about 4.4% for 2015. And what we've seen is our new and expansions have come online, they've come online as we said a little slow, some have been delayed, the ramp-ups have been slower than anticipated. But what we've also seen in the ﬁrst two quarters of 2015 was we saw some lower volumes with our existing customers, and as you recall in the ﬁrst couple of quarters, that was really big – had a big impact on the lower than expectations in terms of the industrial sales.  As Drew mentioned in his script, we saw a comeback relative to that in the third quarter, especially in the petroleum reﬁnery area. And from that perspective, in that particular segment, we expect to see that returning to the levels we somewhat expected as we go forward. He also mentioned in the fourth quarter, we've got an existing customer probably in the chlor-alkali sector that is going through some outages. And so, we won't see – likely not to see the volumetric changes in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third quarter. But again, those are outage related. And as Drew also mentioned, you generally don't see a relative relationship in terms of revenue change relative to volume change when that happens with existing customers.  In terms of the drivers, I think we are seeing some things that others are experiencing, stronger dollar, kind of weaker commodity prices, and it's challenging our expectations, as we've said before. What we see happening primarily is delays in some cases, and as I said earlier, ramp-ups not happening as soon as we had thought. But we'll provide more color around that at EEI in terms of really diving more into what we expect to see in 2016 and going forward."
"Okay. And just as a follow-up with the 2016 and 2017 Utility EPS, is that more contingent upon rate based growth or sales growth? And are the two related over the next two years or three years? How are you looking at that?","This is Theo again. I'll start and Drew may also have comments relative to this. But the two are related. The growth, as we all know, in this business is really driven by rate base at the end of the day. And from our perspective, our investment thesis is still intact. And we see the opportunity, as we've laid out in the past, to continue to make the investments that we've talked about. And it's not so much dependent upon the level of sales. Sales is an opportunity for us to mitigate the impacts of those rate based growth changes. And clearly with our sales volumes, we have the opportunity to mitigate that probably much better than maybe some others once you see that don't have the level of robustness as it relates to sales growth.  But again, the volumes do help in terms of getting to ROEs. And as we've shown in this last report, it's really a combination of the two to some extent. But again, the growth is really tied to the investment thesis, and that thesis, from our perspective, is still well intact.       Yeah, that's true. I'll just add that the big drivers are going to be getting the Union deal done and then the regulatory actions in Arkansas and in Texas, getting those resolved, primarily to get the investment that Theo is talking about into rates. And then the sales growth is going to be helpful, but it's an element of lag reduction as we see it. And there are some O&M beneﬁts out there we talked about earlier, ANO rolling oﬀ hopefully by the end of next year. And then we continue to see our pension expenses coming down, and we do see some higher operating costs this year because of some of the nuclear compliance costs and other things that we see, so we expect that to moderate a bit going forward as well. So, those are the main drivers, they shift a little bit as you go from 2015 to 2016 and then to 2016 to 2017. But they're pretty much the same."
Thank you very much.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your line is open. Your question please.
Good morning.,Morning.
"Make sure I understand this: the ANO Column 4, enhanced inspections and the associated spending -- you see a path that that would be eliminated after next year?",Yes. That's – goal is to get out of Column 4 and reduce the compliance cost associated with being in that regulatory situation.
"Okay. And then just the second question on the lower residential sales. Just an anomaly for the third quarter, you seeing more energy eﬃciency. Do you have any other color you could provide on that?","Charles, this is Theo. I mean, as we've talked I think on previous calls, I think like most other utilities, we are seeing energy eﬃciency impacts, federal programs as well as programs that we have speciﬁc to our states. We generally talked in terms of kind of organic residential growth in the 1% area and we see that somewhat being challenged through this year and we saw it somewhat last year as well.  In terms of third quarter, we had two years where we had fairly moderate weather last year and fairly positive weather this year. And when you see those swings like that year-over-year, sometimes the adjustment in terms of the weather for periods like that gets little challenged. And so, we continue to watch and monitor the residential sales volumes. I'll note also we saw 1.2% growth in commercial in the quarter as well, but it is something we pay a lot of attention to and continue to look at. From our perspective, we don't see a kind of ﬂat to negative as a trend, but it is something for us to continue to monitor as it relates to our view of our organic residential growth."
Okay. Thank you. I'll save my rest for EEI.,"All right. Thanks.    Thanks, Charles.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Your question please."
"Hey, guys.","Hey. Good morning, Shahriar."
"Most of my questions were answered. Just on FitzPatrick, is there any situation where you could think of where you would have to use decomm versus safe-store?","This is Drew. The safe-store option is the one that gives you the most time to allow the fund to grow to meet your decommissioning needs. So, that seemed like a likely candidate, but I don't know if Bill Mohl wants to add anything and...    Yeah. So, again, we'll have to go through and calculate our costs. We've got $728 million in the fund. And we'll go through the same process of kind of looking and forecasting when the fund would grow to have an adequate amount to begin decommissioning. According to the NRC you have to have it fully funded before you can start. So, it'll be some form of safe-store, probably won't go to the end of six years, but depending on that cost estimate, it will be out in the future, so."
And then you don't expect any indirect inﬂuence from New York to shut the plant down quicker?,No. Nothing that we're aware of at this time.
"Okay. Got it. And then just what caused the talks to break down? Was it sort of – was an RMR contract an option as a bridge? So, maybe a little bit of color on that.","Sure.    Sure. We're not really going to get into any of that.      Yeah. We can explain the RMR issue. We're not going to obviously discuss any details or discussion. But we previously had the New York ISO do some analysis regarding the FitzPatrick plant as to whether or not it qualiﬁes as a reliability must-run. And that most recent analysis indicates that it does not.  So, we have submitted our shutdown notiﬁcations to the PSC and the New York ISO as of today. They will have to update that study, but we certainly do not expect that answer to change. And as Leo suggested, all of our discussions with New York are really conﬁdential and not appropriate for us to comment on any details."
Excellent. Thank you so much.      Operator   Thank you. I'd like to now turn the call over to Paula Waters for any additional remarks.,"Thank you, Roland.
