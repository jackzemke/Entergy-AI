Question,Answer
"Hey. Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"If I jump to the back of the slides, you have updated CapEx numbers and the CapEx increased quite a bit from what you had at EEI. I know part of that's probably Union slippage. But can you just help us think about the rate base growth and the eﬀect of bonus depreciation on the rate base growth net of the increase in CapEx?","Yeah, Dan. This is Drew. And so we previously discussed that for the ﬁrst couple years we already had an expectation for bonus deprecation baked into our ﬁnancials. And so getting out to 2018 there's really not much impact on our overall rate base expectation. In fact, it still remains right in the middle of our previous ranges that we provided. So really quite minimal impact on us overall through the guidance range – or through the outlook range."
And then what was the rest of the increase beyond Union to ﬁll in the 2016 to 2018 CapEx?,I think it was mostly just minor project adjustments. I don't think that there's any major elements in there that would be worth calling out at this point I don't think.
And I guess on load growth and kind of the expectations for that number to bounce back after – maybe a little slower for 2016 than expected. Where do you rank your conﬁdence in that reset in growth today versus say six months ago or at the last Analyst Day? And what is the visibility to that underlying industrial gain?,"Hey, Dan. This is Theo. I think from our perspective we'd rank that conﬁdence higher, a little higher than we had say a few years ago at the Analyst Meeting because primarily a lot of the projects have advanced relative to that point in time. And also we've gotten a better line of sight on what's really happening from an economic perspective as relates to what you're seeing with commodity markets.  As we talked about at EEI, as you look 2015 through 2018, basically 95% of that growth of what we call new and expansion projects were related to projects that were in advanced stages, and we continue to see that to be the case. That's not to say that we see some projects, smaller projects maybe fall oﬀ as we've gone forward. And if you also recall at EEI that 95%, about 70% was made up of basically a handful     of large projects that were in advanced stages. And those projects were primarily in the steel kind of thing, cracker. We did have an LNG project. We also have projects in the ammonia area as well as methanol. So they were spread across a lot of your various segments.  As we continue to get closer, and as we move closer in time to the expected construction, date-of-completion dates of these projects, clearly we get more visibility around where those projects are just by the sheer passage of time. I think the other thing that we have gotten more visibility around is what's going on with our existing customers, and gotten more granularity as to what's happening in that particular area. We don't really see much growth when we talk about the 4% to 5% coming from our existing customer base, but as we've talked about in the past, our existing customers, our large industrial customers are on ﬁxed-demand-charge type contracts. And so we may see volumetric ﬂuctuations, we really don't see accompanying ﬂuctuations in revenue when you talk about downside situation.  So I think our conﬁdence is higher. I mean, clearly as Drew said in his script, there are still existential factors that can aﬀect what we're seeing, and we monitor this on a very regular basis. And we try to get as much intelligence around this as we possibly can, both from a customer perspective as well as a macroeconomic perspective."
So you're not seeing an erosion in these existing customers because of an economic slowdown kind of on a global basis? So you're not expecting them to do worse? You'd expect them to stay where they are? Is that eﬀectively what's embedded in guidance?,"I mean I would expect that – there's always a risk they could do worse, but we have adjusted our expectation around that group based on what we see and what we know today. And we did adjust it downward as compared to where we were a number of months ago.    And, Dan, this is Drew. And of course you've seen in the last couple of quarters, we've seen lower growth in the industrial sector. But the new and expanding customers have been growing the industrial space about 3% and existing customers have been detracting from it about 2.5%. So we are expecting a little bit of that same thing in 2016."
"Okay. Got it. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.      Operator   Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is now open.
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Julien.    Good morning."
"So just to follow up a little bit on Dan's last question, if you will, can you comment on sort of the non-industrial trends? I suppose just if you try to look at the mix, 60/40, I suppose it would imply something shifting there as well, but I'll let you elaborate.","Julien, are you relating to just the 2016 period or the same period Dan was referring to?"
"Well actually, let's stick with 2016.","Okay. I think when we think about growth in kind of the non-industrial sector for 2016, ﬁrst I'd start by saying, if you look at the quarterly GSP across the Gulf South region, we see numbers probably anywhere from 2.5% to 4% in the 2016, 2017 timeframe. Also I think if you look at what we've experienced even in 2015 for the companies within that region, we have residential sales growth ranging from 1.5% to about 3.5% on a weather adjusted basis. We had commercial sales growth basically in the 1% to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis in that area.  And so as we look forward we see, for example on the commercial side, major projects that happened in 2015 that have a full year eﬀect in 2016 that contribute to what we view as fairly reasonable sales growth expectation on the commercial side. In the residential area, we do – are seeing pockets of what we call, maybe the multiplier eﬀect related to the industrial growth that we see again in that Gulf South, that Gulf Coast regional area.     And I'd also say that one thing that we can advantage of in 2016 is another day of kilowatt-hour sales. That has some small impact on our expectation in 2016 as well. So around 1% which is where we are when you adjust – when you take out the total growth and impact of industrial. Again, the macroeconomic eﬀects we see or impacts we could see at the industrial level we could see at the residential and commercial. But we've as I've said in response to Dan's questions, we've done a lot of work around updating our expectations relative to that and at this point we feel fairly comfortable with where we are."
"Just to be clear then, you're saying not much of a change on the non-industrial?","I would say, you mean 2015 over 2016 in terms of not much of a change or where we were thinking?"
"Yeah, on the sales growth. Yeah, exactly.","If you look at 2015 weather adjusted I think residential was about 0.6%, commercial was about 0.4%. I think what we're saying in 2016 in our assumption is something closer to 1%.    And that's consistent with where we were at sort of the November timeframe. That – the residential commercial expectations haven't changed much."
"Got it. Excellent. And just a quick clariﬁcation if you can on the expectations for FitzPatrick and the retirement timeline. Is there any scenario here that you could be looking at implementing a ZEC or whatever you want to call it, scheme? Perhaps margin positive, presumably.","Bill, do you want to?      Julien, this is Bill. At this point in time, there is no clarity or certainty around what that program is and what the actual value associated with it would be. So we have no plans as it relates to changing our focus on shutting down that plant on January 27. We do support the concept of a clean energy standard and think that that makes sense, but we really need to understand the details of it and assure that it is actually implemented."
Excellent. Thank you.,"Thank you, Julien.    Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open."
Good morning.,Morning.    Morning.
"We're going to miss Paula. But anyway, just want to touch base on the Palisades impairment and how that impacts 2016 – well the Palisades and I guess the other impairment in the wind and what have you, and how that impacts 2016 guidance. If I heard you correctly, you said there was a $0.49 impact, and I understand it's sort of complicated so I don't want you to go through any laborious detail. But just in general, so if you can highlight what that is? Did I hear that correctly, I guess, I mean?","Yeah. So, Paul, it's Drew. A couple of things there. So I think that it spread across a couple diﬀerent categories when you think about these impairments. There's an impairment piece that's in net revenue for fuel. There's an impairment piece which is in O&M for refueling outage expenses and then there's an impairment piece which is in depreciation for the asset itself. And so we've actually broken down for you in the back, in the appendix, on slides 46 and 47. We give a lot of detail about the plants that are still ongoing and the plants that are planned to be closed or are closed, and talk about where you can see those impairment eﬀects for those three buckets."
"Do those impacts – I mean the impairment was done in the fourth quarter. Do those impacts, how do they go into 2017, I guess?",In to 2017?
"Yeah, I mean are they continuing or how – do you follow what I'm saying? It just seems like a large number.","Yeah. Well, I mean it is. I mean if you think about all those plants that were impaired are still going to be operating in 2016. So you're still going to see the eﬀects of that stuﬀ. Once you get into 2017, as Bill said and we announced on January 27, we'll be shutting down FitzPatrick. So you won't see those same kinds of eﬀects as that starts to fall away. But Pilgrim and Palisades will still be there. So you'll still see those eﬀects for those plants continue to go on.  Now, once we refuel Pilgrim I guess it'll be a little bit diﬀerent if we make that decision. And that would be – I think those costs would be expensed if we go down that path. And so it'll change things a little bit at that point. But you'll still continue to see those impairment eﬀects for those two assets because they're still operating in..."
Right.,Potentially beyond 2017.
"I guess what I'm wondering is with respect to Palisades, I mean what caused this big write oﬀ in a contracted plant? It wasn't completely clear to me. Is it just the lifespan has been changed? Or your market expectations after the contract has expired?","Yeah. So I think what changed there is the fact that we made decisions around the other single-unit assets. So Pilgrim, FitzPatrick and Vermont Yankee were all single- unit assets. Palisades was the only remaining one out there, although it did have the contract. Because of our decisions for the other three we had to, again, more closely assess the probabilities associated with the life expectancy of the Palisades unit. And when we did that, it failed the accounting test for any impairment. And we're continuing to operate the plant till 2022.  The operational decision is diﬀerent than the accounting decision. We'll make a decision around Palisades when it's appropriate to do that out in the future. And that'll depend on the circumstances that exist at that time, the market conditions at     that time, et cetera. But from accounting perspective we were forced by our other actions to take a close look at the Palisades unit."
"Okay. And then just ﬁnally on the midpoint outlook, it's a $0.40 range. And just in terms of the term midpoint, how should we think about that? Is there some range outside of that that we should be thinking about? Or just elaborate a little bit on that terminology.","Well, this idea was something that we originated, that idea of a midpoint outlook back at Analyst Day in 2014. And our expectation at that point in time was that by the time we got out to that date because it was pretty far out there that our midpoint expectation might shift around a little bit. And so what we tried to do is signal to everybody about where it would land. But when we get out to that point, we would give you the actual guidance and give you a midpoint for where that would be.  So I guess similar to 2016 where we landed at $4.35 which was at the bottom of our range of potential midpoints, I guess there could be a little bit above or below the ranges that we're talking about. But so I guess to answer your question directly, yeah there could be a little bit above or below in those out years but we're not at this point communicating anything diﬀerently than just the range that we have.  Paul, this is Leo. This may or may not be helpful, but what we expect is the midpoint of guidance to fall within that range."
Excellent. Thanks a lot.,You bet.    Operator  Thank you.  Apparently that was more helpful than me.    Operator  And the next question is from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.,"Good morning, Stephen.    Good morning."
"I wanted to just add on to Paul's question on thinking about slide 47 and also slide 40. There are a number of line items, but I guess in total when we look at some of these nuclear plants that may be shutting down at some point in the future, as I understand it, I guess you're including the revenues from power generated but some of the expenses are not included in sort of adjusted earnings. On a total basis from these nuclear units, what's the amount of expense that is eﬀectively going to be excluded from adjusted earnings for these plants in say 2016 or beyond?","Well, in 2016 I think it's about $50 million of capital that would fall into that category and I think that's on slide 40. And then I think if there are any fuel expenses if we'd make that again that decision to shut down Pilgrim, there could be some additional expenses that end up in that same category. But I think that's what we would be talking about, Stephen, mainly."
"Oh, okay. So $50 million you said capital. Would that be something that would be an expense but will be excluded from adjusted earnings? Or is that CapEx? I wasn't clear on that.","Well, it would otherwise be considered capital, but because of the situation where those plants are expected to shut down, the accounting will force us to put that as an expense. So you'll see it in the as-reported as an expense, that $50 million in capital. We'll break it out for you as a special item so you can understand what that is, but that's the way it would be portrayed I believe in the ﬁnancial statement."
Okay. And what amount of fuel expense is being excluded from adjusted earnings?,"I don't know that I have that number in front of me right now. So we'll have to give that to you later, Stephen."
"Okay. Understood. And then on ANO and column 4, I think you laid out pretty clearly the cost of I believe $50 million in 2016. Could you give a little color in terms of your assumption in the plan in terms of when you are able to move that out of column 4? And sort of what are the key challenges or steps that need to be taken to make that happen?","I'll answer that. So, just from a ﬁnancial perspective, we don't have any cost beyond 2016. From a operational perspective and the NRC, I think there's a longer process there that goes on. And so while we may stop incurring costs, it may be a little bit longer into 2017. I think there's a possibility it could go even longer than that. But I don't believe that would necessarily be our expectation that the NRC would make a rating change there."
Okay. Understood. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. The next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.,
"Hi, guys. And, Paula, you will be missed and welcome, David. So quick question on the capital plan and your point that it's the aging infrastructure that drives the growth in the CapEx not as much the load growth. But I'm assuming at some point you do need load growth to kind of maintain your competitive rates and keep that rate and attract more I guess CapEx and more load into the region.  So what is the minimum load growth that you look at from an industrial perspective, given the decline in load growth at least for 2016, how would you see the load growth out in the future? And is there a minimum level that you would track to say you need that kind of load at least in terms of load growth to support the CapEx plan while keeping the rates in check?","So, Praful, that's a good question. One thing to keep in mind is as you look at that capital plan, as you said, the generation piece of this is driven primarily by every year that goes by, new technologies improve the heat rate, the cost eﬃciency, the environmental output of the new plants, plus the old plants get older and more costly. So as time progresses, certainly we have the ability to beneﬁt our customers with a more reliable, more environmentally friendly and lower production cost unit. And so we're doing that over time just like anyone would. It just so happens that this kind of seems to happen in big chunks in terms of when the facilities are required. So we're in the process of doing that.     Recall that we've never been long generation also. So we're short generation. We anticipate being short generation out into the middle of the next decade even with if we were to have signiﬁcantly lower growth. So the need for the generation will continue to exist and what we've mentioned before is we have some ﬂexibility around the timing as it relates to the CTs. We have the deactivations of the units and certainly PPAs that roll oﬀ that are all part of the mix. So it's a combination of a need but it's also us making sure we have a risk mitigation strategy for the company and for its customers associated with how we put that in place.  So I know there is no at this industrial load growth number that we would give you that we say we no longer need this investment. But the fact of the matter is we would continue to be short with the ability to be in MISO and utilize the market over time as we go out there. And we really don't see that changing under too many scenarios. The transmission investment is driven in large part by changing reliability requirements, the similar type of activity as it relates to new technologies and the ability to improve the operations of the system as we go forward. Plus again the age of the infrastructure requires some upgrading as well as does our entry in the MISO provide us with the opportunity to make deliverability of assets that before we couldn't into the market going forward as well.  So in the transmission that we're doing from a reliability standpoint, a lot of that like the Lake Charles project, a lot of the load that we are going to serve there is already there so it's a beeﬁng up of the reliability, improving the infrastructure plus load growth that we already see under construction. So that's pretty solid as well under a variety of load growth scenarios. And then as we talked about before, we're also embarking on the AMI side of things and as we go forward there could be other things that would certainly show up that could either replace things that may or may not fall out or up or extend that capital growth going forward on the distribution side, which is going to become more and more important, again in the beneﬁt, to beneﬁt our customers.  So I guess the bottom line here is there's an opportunity for us to continue to invest this capital because of where the structure is and where the state of the technology is, and we're also managing it in a real risk, a risk mitigation kind of strategy. Again, not getting long on the generation side, not getting out over our skis on the transmission side and the like to make sure that we are well within the bounds of anything that might happen on a load growth point of view. But you are right, the main beneﬁts that we have from load growth are that it continues to provide us with that competitive advantage whereas I mentioned in my script we're today, over 25% below the national average in our rates. That contributes to our ability to attract new business into the region so that we have the capability to do that more. And so things like the Continental Tire example that I mentioned, all the stuﬀ that's under construction that Theo mentioned.  All of those in addition to us managing our cost levels with decline in natural gas prices, all of that go to contribute to that late advantage continuing and hopefully growing over time, and so you can't really say at what load growth you do not do capital. It's very robust over a variety of load growth scenarios but we have to be     mindful of the risk mitigation strategies that we put in place so that when we build those new plants or those CTs, but also the other cost bending that we can do as it relates to our normal O&M fuel costs and production costs as we put these new plants in place for example that help us maintain that advantage. It's more complicated than just one number I guess is the answer. But it's pretty robust across a variety of load growth scenarios."
"Gotcha. Thank you, Leo. That was extremely helpful color. And ﬁnally, just a quick question on taxes. I know you reduced your NOL balance, I think in the last call. Now with bonus helping you as well, do you see yourselves being cash tax payers through the 2018, 2019 timeframe? Or is there a minimal cash tax during that period?","Praful, I think what we said is we expect our cash tax rate to be around 10% through that period that you're talking about. And as I mentioned earlier, bonus depreciation was baked in for a good bit of that. So we would expect it to be about the same over that timeframe."
"Gotcha. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.    Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And the last question will come from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your line is open.
"Thank you, and good morning.",Good morning.
"On Arkansas, Leo, I recall that when you took your current position this was one of your top three goals was to get an improved regulatory framework in Arkansas. And now that you have it, I guess looking back – and again, I thought you said that your strategy was to tell Mississippi – or excuse me, to tell Arkansas that look at the     industrial development in Mississippi. If you have a favorable regulatory framework, that can certainly support that development. I guess my question is, was that the argument that helped win the day, number one? And I guess a related question would be, is there any more tweaking you'd like to see in Arkansas maybe besides a little higher allowed ROE?","Well, I'd say ﬁrst of all there's no argument that was had with anybody on anything. And I know you just used that term, but I don't want that to be a term that's out there. The fact of the matter is that all of our jurisdictions, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, all of them, we're all interested in the exact same thing. We're all interested in growing the economies of the jurisdictions and the states in which we operate, and the same with the city of New Orleans. We've spent a lot of time with all those jurisdictions, including Arkansas, sitting down with them. Our jurisdictional CEOs have done a wonderful job, their regulatory folks have done a wonderful job, Theo's done a wonderful job of making sure that we sit down and ﬁnd common ground with all of them around bettering the economy of the state.  And you know, Charles, I started out with the four stakeholders and our objectives for them around ﬁrst quartile TSR, ﬁrst quartile customer satisfaction, et cetera. When we bring jobs to the state, we do good for the company. We could do good for the community. We could do good for our employees. It's great for the political environment as well. So all we've done is we've sat down and discussed that with our regulators, as well as the politicians in our regions, to describe to them our desire to participate in that with them and help them achieve their objectives.  And so what we've crafted in Texas with riders, in Arkansas with the forward-looking FRP, with Mississippi with the forward features FRP, the way assets are recovered in Louisiana, New Orleans, et cetera. What we've accomplished with them is that common ground about how giving us the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to make you all comfortable with the investments that we have through the regulatory process helps us attract the Big River Steels, the Sasols of the world, the Continental Tires of the world to come to our region, to buy power from us, to help us invest in the infrastructure and then create tens of thousands of jobs. We're working on this together to be able to do that.  So I wouldn't say that anybody won the day in Arkansas other than the state of Arkansas, and we participated in that in a small way. And they worked together with us to create something that allowed us to do that, and I would say that it's no diﬀerent than the workforce development program that I mentioned in my script where we're spending $5 million over the next ﬁve years to help train people to work at those plants that we've helped attract. And that's good for all four of our stakeholders as well as we do that. So it really has been the last few years of extraordinary collaboration, foresight by our regulators and us listening to them as much as them listening to us."
"Is there anything in Arkansas with respect to regulatory framework that you'd like to tweak, let's say?","Well, I'm not sure that, that's something that we would need to do a lot of at the moment. Certainly there's always things that we want to accomplish, but really that's going to depend on the environment. As we go forward, we go forward with the great modernization, we go forward with AMI, we go forward with diﬀerent things than what we have today that might require some further collaboration with those folks. But right now we've got to make ﬁling under the ﬁrst forward-looking FRP and get that underway before we start worrying about changing things."
"Okay. Well, I think you're being a little modest because I know this was one of your goals in Arkansas and I think you did accomplish it. So congratulations, and that was my only question.","All right. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the call back over for closing remarks.    Thank you, Latoya, and thanks to all for participating this morning. Before we close, we remind you to refer to our release and website for Safe Harbor and Regulation G compliance statements.
