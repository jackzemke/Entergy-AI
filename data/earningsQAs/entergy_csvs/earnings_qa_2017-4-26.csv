Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Chris."
"Drew, in your comments you mentioned that there is the leap day in the ﬁrst quarter as well as the extreme weather which impact normalization calculations on year end. But at this time can you say that your full year 2017 normalized guidance is still appropriate? And secondarily, when you look across the diﬀerent new projects that you are working on in terms of utility generation, is there any other pushback in terms of the need for those plants, like you've seen so far in New Orleans?","All right, this is Drew. I'll take the ﬁrst one and I'll hand over the second part of that question to Rod. So at this point, obviously if nothing changes – we haven't updated our expectations for second quarter and third quarter and fourth quarter to be higher than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, so all else being equal, we would be probably slightly below where we initially anticipated the year. But it's still early in the year. So I think it's still premature for us to make any changes as to what our expectations would be for the full year. And I'll turn the rest over to Rod.    And as it relates to the rest of the supply plan, keep in mind that the rationale behind the supply plan was not primarily driven by point-of-view on load. In New Orleans for instance, out of a sense of transparency, we actually brought the change in our 30- year load forecast to the attention of the stakeholders, or again, just to be transparent. But the rationale behind the investment is still very much intact. We've not seen across the jurisdictions any response or opposition to our plans based solely on the load or sales forecast.  Keep in mind that the load is diﬀerent from the sales forecast, and I think that's a distinction we need to keep in mind as well as we look at the rest of our generation portfolio. But the answer to your question is, we are still – we have not seen any additional pushback throughout the rest of the jurisdictions.       And Chris, this is Leo. I'll just jump in as well. From a strategy standpoint, as Rod mentioned, we've got an aging infrastructure in terms of our ﬂeet and locational issues as it relates to what we need to build from a generation standpoint. New Orleans, for example, there is no generation inside the City of New Orleans, and part of the need for that in addition to meeting peak demand is to be able to supply the system should we have some sort of storm that comes through and knocks out transmission infrastructure, which has happened in the past.  So, that's a locational issue. Same with some of the other plants we've got the need because of the fact that we went into all of this transformation short to begin with. But add to that the ﬁrst quarter weather-adjusted sales is just an anomaly. As you know, weather normalization in these things are really mathematical algorithms that work well in most cases. But I think Drew mentioned that this was the most mild winter in terms of degree days in the history of recording degree days, 120 years or something like that. So, that's really not cause for any kind of an alarm in terms of what's going on long term."
"Okay. Great. Thanks for all that color. And then switching gears to EWC, I think on the last call you commented on cash ﬂow being pretty negative this year because of some outages and then slowly getting better into the early part of next decade when Indian Point shuts down. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there? And then, in particular, I'm interested if there has been any advancements with your potential oﬀsetting cost cuts to some of that cash outﬂow?","Okay. This is Drew. And in terms of the overall forecast at this point, Chris, I think it's essentially the same as it was before. We still have all of the outages this year and so that's pretty expensive, but we're anticipating pretty strong cash ﬂow generation through the next periods, primarily because we won't be paying for another refueling outage at each of the plants – well, I should say, Pilgrim and Palisades. We will be doing one more at Indian Point for each of those units and then those two units would have better cash ﬂow generation as they ramp down into 2020 and 2021.  So, from an overall cash ﬂow perspective, at this point, it's still about the same. But in regards to, I guess, your second question, are we making any progress, I would say, absolutely. Internally, we've been scrubbing the numbers down hard and so we would hope to show you some speciﬁc progress over the balance of the year to demonstrate that we are closing that gap and meeting that objective that Leo talked about in his script of getting to cash ﬂow neutral."
Okay. Great.,"Cash ﬂow – let me just clarify, cash ﬂow neutral. Overall, I think from an operational cash ﬂow perspective, we're already at neutral, it's just the NDTs that we're working on. And in addition to the operational piece, we're also working on transactions there as well."
Okay. So that cash ﬂow neutral number is all-in including the decommissioning trusts over the ﬁve- or six-year period?,"Yes. Our goal is zero, including the decommissioning trusts, through 2021. Right now, our forecast has essentially zero, operationally, not including the trust over that same timeframe."
"Okay. Got you. Thanks, Drew.",Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.    Good morning."
"So, I was going to ask about sales, but I think that got covered. So, maybe I could ask on the – could we get an update on the nuclear sustainability plan, both progress on metrics and also just maybe a reminder of where you are on moving towards getting some of this rolled into rate?","Yeah. Well, I'll let – Chris will give you the ﬁrst part and then Rod will take the second.       In terms of the nuclear sustainability plan, we remain on track. We're going to continue to make improvements in the performance of our ﬂeet and improve our regulatory margins. So, I would characterize this straightforward as on track.      All right, Jonathan, it's Rod. In terms of the timing, we expect to make a ﬁling on this coming Friday, day after tomorrow, with the APSC, formally seeking to reconcile the nuclear cost adjudication with our formula rate plan ﬁling in July. So we can handle the nuclear cost conversation in conjunction with the FRP. And nothing has changed in terms of our point of view on the recoverability of those costs. We think the facts support the ﬁnding that the costs we're seeking recovery are consistent with what you heard over the last several quarters with Chris. And that is – and Leo made reference to it – the costs associated with people, with improving the equipment in the plant to preserve those assets and the beneﬁts for customers. And so, we feel comfortable that the evidence will support a ﬁnding of continued recovery, not just of the costs that are in question for purposes of the 2016 or 2017 forward test year, but the actual 2018 forward-looking test year we'll ﬁle in July.  So, no change there, and again a consistent message around what we are seeking recovery of. I will note that the cost associated with the FRP ﬁling and what we expect to ﬁle on overall nuclear costs in July do not include costs associated with regulatory oversight or state or things of that nature. So, it's pretty much a clean nuclear cost, cost to run and operate the plant through and beyond the expected life of those assets."
"And the outstanding issue from the 2017 Arkansas FRP is still sort of pending a schedule, is that correct?","That's what – that's what I was referring to when I said we'll make a ﬁling on Friday to join or conjoin those issues from a timing standpoint at Arkansas. So the outstanding issue that you made reference to, that's what – that's the subject of the ﬁling we'll make on Friday, where we'll formally ask the APSC, let's handle it all in conjunction with the planned FRP ﬁling in July."
"Okay. So, take it out of the old one and put it into the new one eﬀectively?",That – I think that's fair.
Okay. Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator    Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Hey. Good morning.,"Good morning, Julien.    Good morning, Julien."
"So, a quick ﬁrst question on the Utility side. Obviously, AMI is the big program you guys ramping up here for. Can you discuss a little bit of the precedence in Louisiana and Arkansas with respect to perhaps peers and just some of the nuance you might expect as you move through the process there?    And then I suppose speciﬁcally on Texas, obviously it seems like you guys are looking to ﬁle later this year. Any reason for kind of the shifted schedule and what potential size of the program that might be? And the further detail would be just, is that already encompassed within your CapEx program?","The – I want to make sure, that I'm – I deal with the question in order. And you may have to re-ask the last part."
"No, no. Please.","On AMI, we have ﬁled for – we've made the AMI ﬁlings in every jurisdiction except for Texas. And we're trying to address some legislative prerequisites, so we can do that – do Texas as well. And we expect resolution of the formal AMI ﬁlings by year end. In terms of precedent with other jurisdictions, I think the timing of both the conditions precedent to deployment, that is the deployment of workforce management system, the asset management systems and the actual timeline of our     2019 deployment comes from the experiences we've gathered, lessons learned from other jurisdictions who have gone down this path before.  And the message that's consistent across each of our ﬁlings in jurisdictions is that our objective is to have the beneﬁts to our customers of AMI deployment be available to them in addition to our beneﬁts at the time we put those assets into service. And so that aﬀects our plan regarding the timing of deployment. And again, that message is consistent across the rest of the jurisdictions. The third question I need you to repeat, so I make sure I am answering it."
"That – the last one is the easy one. With respect to taxes, obviously you haven't formally ﬁled, but have you baked into your expectations in CapEx something in there for when you do likely eventually ﬁle?","Yes. Yes. Our plan includes – the capital plan includes the Texas AMI ﬁling as well. The threshold issue for us was making sure we had legislative and regulatory mechanisms and approvals setup. And so we had to take care of that with the legislative session. We've had some support on the Senate side of the Texas legislature. We are awaiting word on the House legislation that would authorize us and PUCT to go down that path. But the answer to your question is yes.    And let me just give one point of clarity on that. So, our capital plan, Julien, is through 2019, mostly includes corporate wide eﬀorts; communications, IT platforms, that kind of thing that would support the scaling of Texas when it comes in. And then, beyond our capital plan would be maybe more Texas-speciﬁc meter deployment and stuﬀ like that, that would be – so maybe starting in 2019, but certainly going into 2020 and 2021."
Got it. Excellent. Just a quick clariﬁcation on the prior. You obviously – were talking about a cash ﬂow sort of breakeven target for the business overall – or the EWC side. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what you expect the ongoing impact to operational earnings or can you remind us how we are thinking about that through the period and speciﬁcally in the later years how we should think about operational versus non-operational items on earnings?,You're talking about 2017 through 2021?
"Yeah. Or speciﬁcally, so kind of like an ongoing, right? I understand that obviously...","Yeah, on an ongoing – yes, on an ongoing basis, once we get the plants to shutdown status and we are – and removed in the decommissioning activities or the plants have been taken oﬀ our balance sheet like the VY type transaction, we would expect to be essentially ﬂat at EWC. Part of that is, next year, there is an accounting rule change that we anticipate around how you account for nuclear decommissioning trust earnings and that would give us an opportunity to not just realize gains that – we have realized gains show up on our income statement, but actually mark-to- market the growth in the trust over time on the equity side.  And the eﬀect is going to – we typically see about 6.25% of returns in the decommissioning trust, but you only recognize in the income statement about 3%. And when you kind of close that gap, it starts to close the gap to the ARO liability, the Asset Retirement Obligation liability that's out there and the amortization of that. So, once you get out to 2022, it's about ﬂat."
"Excellent. So to be clear, it's eﬀectively zero for the cumulative cash ﬂow and ﬂat on an earnings base?","Beyond 2022 – starting 2022 and beyond, yes."
"Yes, indeed. Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.",
"Hey, guys. I hate to do this. I kind of want to come back to the demand question. Can you remind me for Residential and Small Commercial demand, what is in your 2017 guidance and your multi-year guidance in terms of the assumption for just kind of – weather-normal growth there?","I'm sorry, Michael, could you repeat that question?"
Sure. What's in your 2017 guidance and your multi-year guidance for weather normalized growth for Residential and Small Commercial?,"For Residential and Small Commercial it's about – it's almost zero. In fact I think if you – we only put out till 2017, but if you went out to 2020, 2021, it's actually slightly negative. As you see automated meters coming online and customers realizing the beneﬁts associated with that, one of the beneﬁts is lower expected demand. And so we actually see negative growth over sort of a ﬁve-year period."
"Got it. And then, how – when we think about industrial demand growth – because your forecast, pretty robust, 3%, and there's a lot going on obviously in East Texas and in Louisiana with the petchem industries. But just curious how sensitive your supply needs are to kind of like every percent change in that. Meaning, if it turns out to be, I don't know, closer to what you've seen more recently, closer to 2% or even a little less than that, does that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence how much new capacity you need to build or buy?","Michael, this is Rod. I think I want to reiterate here that the driver behind our capacity needs is not so much driven by my assumptions around low growth although it's precedented. And that low growth certainly helps oﬀset the impact of those capital additions on customer rates. The driver – the primary driver locationally might be around the speciﬁc needs of Industrial siding in the region. But it's really around modernizing the grid and ﬂeet and responding to retirements of aging assets. And that represents the lion's share of the generation and transmission investment in the region, driven less so by assumptions on overall industrial load."
Got it. Okay.,"And let me add. This is Drew. Let me just add that we do still see positive industrial growth out through our forecast period and beyond. And a lot of that industrial growth is based upon projects that we see coming up and under construction right now over the next few years. And we've actually seen a bit of a pick-up recently here on some of the petrochem, chemical industries and other things getting to their ﬁnancial decision points on whether they are going to go forward with their projects.  So we are still seeing good, positive demand growth in the Industrial space. And that is oﬀsetting the Residential and Commercial piece that we were talking about earlier. So even though that part looks like it's kind of ﬂat over the next few years, we do still see overall expected growth in our business."
"Got it. And ﬁnally, on Indian Point, when does the State need to tell you guys whether they could potentially need Indian Point past the 2020, 2021 retirement       date? Meaning, I know the original agreement left room for the plant to operate through about 2024, 2025, but a lot of that is kind based on the ISOs and the State's potential views on whether it needs it or not. When do they need to tell you guys? When do you need to know?","Michael we – this is Drew. We have to make a ﬁling with New York, a formal ﬁling with the ISO and that will allow them to make the assessment about Indian Point and when it's going away and how they would deal with that.    We were working with the ISO. We expect to make that ﬁling later this year, and once we do make that ﬁling, I think there is a statutory 90-day timeline associated with the analysis that they would do and come up with a formal recommendation. But certainly, they are aware of it and – but that process will get kicked oﬀ later this year."
"Okay. And if the ISO comes back and says, hey, actually for local reliability purposes we need one or both of the units beyond 2020, 2021, what happens?","Okay. Well, if they – ﬁrst of all, if they said that there was a challenge that they needed to solve, that there was some operational system issue that they would need to solve, they would need to go through a process that would identify the best way for them to solve it. And it wouldn't necessarily mean keeping Indian Point online. It could mean we need to upgrade a transmission line or we need to get a peaker in, in some place or something like that.  So, depending on the nature of the issue they identify, there could be a lot of potential solutions. And their objective would be to go ﬁnd the most economic one that solves their problem. If, for some reason, nothing else matters until you get down to Indian Point, well, then we would need to work with the state to ﬁgure out how we would move towards something diﬀerent beside 2020 and 2021.  So, it's not unilateral if they can't tell us to do it. They have to work with us on it, but certainly we don't want to create a reliability problem in the State of New York either. So, we would work with them on that. But it seems unlikely to us that it would get to the point where they would need Indian Point to stay online at this point. It seems likely to us that they're going to ﬁnd a diﬀerent solution that will be more economic than keeping the plant online."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Thanks, Michael.       Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim.  You're there, Shar?"
Yeah. Sorry about that. I apologize. Good morning.,Good morning.
"When we've discussed in the past, I think we've talked about sort of the Arkansas prudency review, a separate procedural schedule, but now it sort of looks like it's going to be rolled into a larger one. Is that – any signal on why that wasn't separated? Is it a function of the fact that the original prudency review was small and it made sense to roll it into a joint proceeding? Just a little bit of clarity there would help.","Shar, it's Rod. I think about it as the nature of the cost. We have maintained all along that; 1) we weren't seeking separate recovery mechanism for recovery of the nuclear costs, because those costs were consistent with our objective to maintain those assets and the beneﬁts that accrue to customers. And so, as we think about what's going – what was going to happen in July anyway with the formula rate plan ﬁling and our forward-looking test year, it made sense for us to – from our vantage point, given that the APSC had not set a separate docket, procedural schedule to go ahead and address it all in conjunction with the FRP. So neither we, nor the APSC had to deal with essentially ongoing normalized nuclear spend in two separate dockets with nuclear and the rest of ANO. And so, it simply made sense to us. And because of the ex parte rules, we weren't allowed to really have conversations with the commission. And so, on Friday, we'll look to aﬃrm and clarify that point of view that it makes sense to handle them both at the same time."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then just on sort of the pending – sorry, if I missed this, but on the decommissioning expense, the activities, the sale potential for Pilgrim and Palisades. Is there sort of any update there and, eventually, could we see the same process with Indian Point?","It's Drew, Shar. Yes. So, we are continuing to make progress on this. These are pretty complicated transactions. We're working through the Vermont Yankee one right now at the Public Service Board in Vermont. And it is a ﬁrst of the kind process and it's very complicated and they're taking their time. They're very active in engaging process and so we are answering all their questions and expect to get through that sometime in early 2018. That's sort of setting the table for Pilgrim and Palisades and we are certainly learning from Vermont Yankee, as we go along. But we are making progress and it is two plants instead of one. Hopefully, by the end of the year or around there, we get to a point where we're ready to bring a transaction forward and that satisﬁes all the stakeholders."
Got it.,"And then Indian Point, yes. I was going to add that we are deﬁnitely planning on looking at something similar for Indian Point once we get down the road a little further."
"Got it. And then just your cash ﬂow picture, assuming you exit all of the decommissioning activities, are you still neutral or is there an opportunity to be slightly positive?","There could be an opportunity to be slightly positive. The objective of getting to cash ﬂow neutral includes operational elements. While we're still operating, it includes some of these transactions. So if we were – if we hit a homerun, we could certainly get to positive over the – through 2021, over the four-plus year period."
"Got it. Thanks. And Theo, congrats on the retirement. Even though I think you're too young to retire, congrats.",Thank you.    He's heard that a couple of times.    He's going to be bored.
"Thanks, guys.","Thanks, Shar.    Thank you.    Operator  And next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup."
"Hi, guys.","Good morning, Praful."
"First question, just going back to the decommissioning part, it sounds like in the base case plan, there is some funding required for decommissioning which you're trying to overcome with O&M and cost savings. Just ﬁrstly, wanted to ﬁgure out what's driving that? And secondly, what's the variability around it? Is site-speciﬁc review is going to potentially increase that or decrease that? And Drew, you mentioned just hitting a homerun. Like, what are the variables that can allow you to hit that homerun, I guess?","Well, if you look at – I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have our quarterly or, I guess, annual testing on the – ﬁrst, the NRC minimums for the decommissioning trust. And we passed all of those that we submitted in March without having to post any additional information. It is when we get to the actual shutdown analysis, which is the very detailed decommissioning estimates, and they call that the post shutdown decommissioning activity support, we have to ﬁle that with the NRC within a certain amount of time after we actually shutdown the plant. When we do that – that's actually a little diﬀerent than the NRC minimums: the NRC minimums are somewhat formulaic.  So, with all of the extra detail and the studies that we've done, we expect that there could be the potential to put in a little bit more money at a couple of the plants. And we're working through that right now. We have our own estimates for working through the estimates that our potential counterparties may have in the potential sale of those trusts to them.     And so, that's a commercial negotiation and it's ongoing, but that's where the potential beneﬁt could be. But there is also still signiﬁcant potential beneﬁts in the operating piece before we get to actual shutdown of the plants."
"Gotcha. Thanks. That's helpful. And then secondly, on the potential tax rate decrease – and if there is let's say a tax rate decrease, 15% or 20%, whatever it gets to, assuming no other tax reform, just a tax rate decrease, what does that mean in terms of – is there any change in like a capital allocation plan or a ﬁnancing plan for Entergy or is the current business plan really business as usual? And any beneﬁts or impacts you've already talked about kind of stay in place?",You are talking about tax reform administration from – at the federal level?
"Yeah, that's right.","Okay. Yes. In the near-term, we wouldn't anticipate any signiﬁcant changes. We are in an NOL position, and so whether or not we are paying taxes – or, we're not going to be paying taxes a whole lot in the near-term under the current tax regime, and we wouldn't anticipate paying taxes a whole lot in the – under any tax reform scenario, so our capital plan should be about the same either way.  We will obviously work closely with our retail regulators to get whatever aﬀects our end rates, and then at the parent level, since we also have the NOL there, is the fact – or, not the fact, the possibility I should say that we lose an interest deduction or there is a lower tax rate, both of which would aﬀect the parent negatively because of the losses there.  But from an earnings perspective, they wouldn't necessarily aﬀect it from a cash ﬂow perspective. And so, we would not anticipate changing our capital structure as a result of tax reform anytime near-term or for the – I should say, for the foreseeable future."
Got you. So the parent debt to consolidated debt targets would remain about the same irrespective of the tax reform?,That's what we are anticipating.
"Okay. Thank you, guys.","Thank you.    Thanks, Praful.    Operator  Our last question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar."
"Good morning. Drew, let me ask that last question a little diﬀerent way. You put up a slide last quarter on your preliminary thoughts on tax reform. Is there anything you've heard since then that would make you change anything on that slide?","No, Charles, nothing...      Yes. As you know, there hasn't been anything really deﬁnitive that has come out of DC as of yet. Perhaps today, we'll get some information from the administration about where they intend to go. But we've certainly been participating in EEI activities up on the hill: Leo has been up there; I've up there; our tax team has been up there; our regulatory folks have been up there to try and discuss the impact on Utility customers primarily and what they mean and the impact on our ability to raise capital and the cost of capital primarily. So we've spent a lot of time up there, but we haven't garnered any additional intelligence because there hasn't been anything to discuss really as of yet. So, we're still discussing the same kind of frameworks that we had a quarter ago."
"Okay. Thanks, Drew. That's the only question I had.","All right. Thanks, Charles.      Thanks, Charles. And the only thing that I'd like to add, and I know we're running up against the time here, but from the standpoint of where we sit, all the questions that you all had are really, really good and helpful for us to make sure we know what you are focused on, but I just want to kind of end where I started, and that is, from a strategic perspective, everything that we are doing is right on track with what we've     laid out over the last couple years. From an operational perspective, across the entire business, everything is running on track in terms of what we've laid out over the last couple years. And then from a ﬁnancial perspective, everything that we have achieved and the things that we see in our outlooks are right on track with what we've laid out over the course of the last years – couple years. So, from the standpoint of where we sit right here today, we're still very excited about the opportunities in front of us. The capital plan, we have a solid – the regulatory structures we have around it give us the ﬂexibility to beneﬁt our customers through those investments in most of what we're doing on the – certainly everything we are doing on the capital side. Investment has been done elsewhere within and outside of our jurisdictions, both from a regulatory and operational and a technological standpoint. So, we feel really good about where we sit and everything's right on track.    Great. Thank you. And thanks to all for participating this morning.
