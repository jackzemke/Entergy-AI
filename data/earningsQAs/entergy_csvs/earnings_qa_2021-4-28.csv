Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning, it's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a great quarter.",Thanks.
"A couple of quick questions here. So, you reiterated guidance and kind of with a strong result of the ﬁrst quarter. Are you starting to trend to the top half of your current range, given the strong results and maybe some of the moving pieces here and is there some sort of reserve in the current plan for the SERI complaint on the lease back and tax issues. Any kind of color you can give.","So, this is Drew. On the ﬁrst question, obviously it's just the ﬁrst quarter, it's early in the year, I would say we're oﬀ to a really good start and some of the things that are in our numbers this quarter, we have arch that we would ﬂex up to put the spending back in that we had taken out to adjust for the order like for example in Arkansas. So I would say we are -- we are very comfortable in our range right now. But since it's only the ﬁrst quarter, we're not making any adjustments just yet.  And then as it -- in regards to the reserve for SERI on the uncertain tax position, we have not -- as we said before, we haven't made any reserves for that position. We still believe that we have a good position in regards to that case and nothing has changed in that regard that would cause us to think otherwise, because nothing has changed, we haven't taken any reserves from an accounting position."
"That's excellent color. And just one follow-up on kind of given the recent regulatory outcomes and kind of how you your plan around, has that -- has any of that changed, is it $2.5 billion equity need outlook kind of maybe a few moving pieces there and       just given the disconnect between the stock, are you potentially looking at any kind of alternatives to satisfy that equity content, whether it's diﬀerent instruments or any kind of asset monetization versus issuance.","Yeah. So in regards to the amount, nothing has changed in that regard and then we are still where we were when we talked to you last summer. The other thing associated with the methods, in which we might go access that equity capital, we've talked a little bit about that in the past. Certainly we have the ability to go do block equity, but more recently, we've put a plan in place to do at the market and next week, we have our proxy results, which we've requested from you all, our owners, to allow us to do preferred equity.  We think that gives more ﬂexibility in terms of accessing the capital and we think we can do it in a more shareholder -- shareholder friendly way, because it gives us the opportunity to potentially converts and not dilute our existing owners today. So that's something that we're looking to get next week, and so we'll know a result of that.  In regards to I think the other thing that you're hinting at is something that we addressed last quarter as well around the potential sale of a portion of equity from an operating company going forward, and as we said there is a diﬀerence between obviously, the cost of equity at the operating company and where we are trading today. So that -- that is something that we would look closely at. But that is still very much a strategic decision that's a long-term decision and it's sort of masquerading around as a ﬁnancing decision and it's really not, because you can't do the transaction and then close in a couple of days, you know you're going to be waiting 18 months to 24 months, because you got to go get regulatory approval in our jurisdictions. So it does make it ideal from that perspective. There are other considerations that you have to also take into account, in addition to the regulatory and the timing risk, as we've seen others execute on that. It didn't actually solve their credit problem, they ended up getting downgraded anyway.  So that's something that we would be -- have to be keenly aware of. But as a strategic issue, it's something that we pay attention to, and it's something that we are evaluating and continue to evaluate, because of the price diﬀerences out there, because strategic question it starts to get into the more M&A stuﬀ around. Okay. So and to do this, when you go ask for approval, can you execute on it, we think there is some value there. And will it distract you from other things that are going on in the utility business, so that our ability to execute. So, that's kind of a long answer around what sort of ﬁnancing question, but really turns into an M&A question on the key point that I think you're looking for."
Yes. That's very helpful. And thank you so much. And thank you guys for taking my question.,"Great, thank you.  Operator   Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"Just wanted to kind of dive into trends in your territories, a bit more. What are you seeing behind 1Q sales and do you have any sense on more recent trends and how sales may come in over the balance of the year as we reopen post COVID here?","Hi, it's Rod West. From a sector perspective, most of the year we are expecting in the residential, for instance, residential and commercial sector, we are seeing recovery from COVID in the industrial sector, where we've had -- talked about our outlooks in the growth there, we're seeing that sector also recovering from COVID but in the short term taking into account some of the challenges from the recent winter storm. That said, our stakeholder engagement with speciﬁc customers within each segment support our conﬁdence in our ongoing outlooks for sales growth. So everyone is in their own way recovering from both COVID and the winter storms, but we have line of sight in each sector that supports what we've shared with you from an outlook perspective on continued growth and that's just -- that's not only '21, but beyond.  And Jeremy, I'll add that in the -- in Rod's reference to winter storm, but it had an outside -- an outsized impact on our industrial customers in the last quarter. So it's minus 3% quarter-over-quarter, but maybe less than 1% down without the winter storm, so that's a big impact. And you can see that kind of play out in our overall view for the year, because that's not weather adjustment that we would make. We don't weather adjust the industrial customers.  And then, I'll also add just from a macro perspective, that we are seeing some good signals in the industrial space. We are -- we see that inventories for some of our key and reﬁned products customers are trending back to normal. So some of that inventory overhang has gone away. As a result, we've seen margins improve, crack spreads -- time or geographic spreads Henry Hub to Asia and Europe for example are trending in the right direction.     And it looks like the housing market is starting to tick up, so that could help out our core alkali customers and some of the just the basic macro factors like oil prices are better now and the dollar still hasn't rebounded all that much. And those are all sort of positive signals for our industrial customers. So we, yeah, we -- we look at those signals and we're optimistic, although we want to see it show up in the sales as well."
"Got it, got it. So it sounds like the weather depressed things a bit there. That makes sense. And just wanted to turn to carbon capture for a minute here, you mentioned that. I'm just wondering what do you -- what prospects do you see in the near term there, do you think that the 45Q's as the written now maybe combined with LCFS makes these projects economic and I guess what's unique about your territories, just given the backdrop of oil and gas there, it seems like it could be more economic to do it in your area versus maybe other areas in the country. So just wondering if you could talk about how near term that potential is or how you guys might stand up versus others.","Yeah. Well, thanks. That's -- that's a carbon capture is just one one piece of the puzzle here and I think our service territory really bodes well across a variety of new technological advancements and again will be helpful, not only for the power sector, but for the people who produce some of those commodities as well as people consume those commodities.  So you've probably seen a lot of press lately about what a lot of our customers are doing in both hydrogen and in carbon capture as well as renewables. So there is a signiﬁcant amount of opportunity for us, whether it's 45Q, as it stands today or whatever happens with the infrastructure, legislation, or tax policy around that. It's really early in the game, but certainly the administration has been -- has been very clear that new technologies that provide the opportunity to -- to lower the carbon footprint of the power sector and our industrial customers are all fair game for tax credits, all fair game for other support initiatives that could help accelerate the development of things like not only renewables, battery storage but carbon capture, hydrogen utilization, and hydrogen production, hydrogen transportation, hydrogen storage. All of that is, when you say -- how do we -- how do we line up, those people who are talking in other sectors about carbon capture and talking about production of green hydrogen are all our customers and so how near term is it? That's why we are investigating those technologies on our own with our customers and through our JDA with Mitsubishi to try to tease out the technologies, tease out the costs and accelerate the ability to utilize those.  If you think about it, it's carbon capture and hydrogen for example become more economic and get to market faster and our deployment of renewables can increase and go faster, so that all works really hand in hand. So early in the game, I think there is a lot of support both through extension of existing policy plus the potential for new policy. We're working closely, not only with the industry, but with -- with the folks in Washington and the administration ourselves, plus with our partners and our customers to try -- to try to really advance the ball on this because we think we're     uniquely positioned as it relates to all of those because it's vital to us, it's vital to the - - to the customers that we have as well.  So, really think there is a lot of momentum behind it at the moment as well."
Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question.",Good morning.
"Can I just go back to your commentary around the SERI reserve. Did I -- did I capture that correctly that you did not change your -- sort of your reserve amounts or your accruals after the ALJ decision, so do I take that to mean that sort of the decision was in line with the recommendations, I'm just trying to see what the implications might be to your guidance and long-term growth rate once you do receive a ﬁnal outcome.","Yeah. No. Good question, and I was actually I thought referring more to the uncertain tax question. But in regards to the ROE and capital structure, the answer is actually the same, we didn't -- we didn't change our reserve position. I wouldn't say that we were exactly in line. In fact, it was a little bit below our expectations, we talked about a $0.03 sort of ongoing drag versus what we had in our own models internally.  It doesn't change any of our outlooks, but that was a little diﬀerent than our expectation. That would, if it stands translate to a slightly higher need for us to reserve at some point if the FERC comes out at the same place that the ALJ does, I think it would be $20 million to $25 million kind of one time on that change. But we - - as you saw, we ﬁled last week to see if we could convince the FERC that ought to be a little bit higher. So we'll wait to see how that comes out, but we will need to take a charge on the ROE cap structure piece of about $20 million, $25 million down the road if the ALJ position stands."
"Got it. Okay. So modestly worse. Okay, understood. And then maybe just, can I get your thoughts on sort of your capital allocation priorities, I mean there is obviously a large balance of deferred costs as it relates to storms and I'm sort of thinking about the timing of getting to your 15% FFO there in 2022 and how sort of patient are the credit rating agencies are going to be and then does that call for a higher layer of equity in the plan, how are you thinking about all of that stuﬀ?","Yeah. No, it's a good question. So I mean, we take the -- I think this question really hinges around the rating agency piece of this, and if you look at our metrics from S&P's perspective, I think we're in good shape, even through all of this we are above the downgrade thresholds that they've written about and we continue to -- our forecast continues to pull away from those threshold. So we are comfortable with where we are on the S&P metrics. The Moody's metrics are a little more challenging, as you know because their cash ﬂow from operations to debt not including working capital that is that sort of that 15% threshold, and that's what we've been really aiming for and we still believe we're going to get there next year.  We -- in order to do that, we have to get past these cash ﬂows items that we've experienced for the storms, some of the ones that I talked about this quarter and we need to get the securitization and ideally, we'll be able to do that all sheet as well. And as I mentioned, as legislation is moving forward in both Texas and Louisiana to do that. So I think we're actually in good shape to achieve all of those objectives.  In terms of the compensation with Moody's, I mean obviously you'll have to talk to them to get their perspective. But I think as they understand what's going on, they understand that we have very good solid mechanisms between fuel recovery and with securitization, we have a history there and they can see the results in the legislature going forward. So they are very comfortable that we are going to be able to make that progress. And they've actually written that they don't expect us to hit their target until 2023. So we are actually -- we're aiming to hit their target a year earlier than they would expect us to.  So the conversations are going very well with them I would say, because we just had our annual review, which is typically in the spring. And we have, as we've talked about and we're talking about today, forecast which should achieve our targeted objectives."
"That's super helpful. Sounds like you have some -- you have some runway of time to get to that level and assuming that regulatory ﬁlings go your way, you'll be able to -- you'll be able to get that perhaps even faster than they were targeting you to get to that level. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Appreciate it, Drew.",Thank you.  Operator   Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity. Maybe if I can --",Good morning.
"Pick it up oﬀ of the last -- Good morning. If I can pick it up oﬀ the last question here, just as you think about the latest series of developments in the regulatory front, how does that square against capital spending, largely it seems intact, but I'm also thinking here about rate pressures, the slight downtick in sales and obviously some of the storm impacts. How do you think about some of the mitigating impacts or oﬀsets to ensure your capital spending is intact. Obviously, you reaﬃrmed your earnings guidance trajectory today. So on balance, things are clearly in place. But I want to address maybe the bill pressure impacts implicit.","Sure, sure, Julien. This is Drew. So actually in terms of our capital spending, we've probably and we did capital this quarter, but we've actually accelerated some of the capital, primarily in Arkansas, we had, as you probably recall at the beginning of the year, we had pushed capital back to make room for the December order and with the more recent order, we've moved the capital back forward. So it's about $200 million that we moved out of '03 most of it into '01, some of it into '02 -- excuse me, '22 -- sorry, I'm 20 years behind. But in terms of -- in terms of the rate pressure, as you know, that's something that we talk about very -- we talked about a lot and we watch very closely. That's actually beginning to improve, work through our continuous improvement and the -- and some of the other things that have been going on have the biggest step-change that we've seen in terms of our RET-pressure is as it going to -- as it turns out, going to be between 2020 and 2021.  And now that we've gotten through all of our regulatory proceedings for the year, we think we're going to be able to manage that pretty well. Going forward, using 2021 as a baseline, we are much closer to kind of a 2% growth rate in sort of an average bill and I think that -- that going forward should be very achievable in a regulatory framework."
"Yeah. Excellent. I appreciate that. If you can just in brief then elaborate, how do you think about perhaps the renewable angle, you alluded to earlier. I mean, we've       talked about in the past, you brought it up the comments prepared again, obviously you're -- you have I suppose 3 RFPs out there, but can you -- can you address that your latest thinking on that front?","Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Julien. And as we've been talking about more -- more I think since last Analyst Day, we start with a really clean ﬂeet. As you said, we've got RFPs for 1,000 MW outstanding right now. Our current thinking is it's renewable path be about 2,500 MW by 2025 up to 5,000 by 2030. And I think the right way to think about it is we're trying to make a low cost reliable and sustainable footprint and as we look going forward as technology improves, as prices come down, as battery storage gets more economical, that just makes the possibility for renewables to play a bigger part in the resource plan going forward a reality. And that's what you've seen and we evaluate resource plan on a regular basis, but we don't stop with the resource plan, we evaluate each individual project on a regular basis. And so, as you know we've got the Orange County Power and Storage station that we'll -- that we're developing that on day-1, will have hydrogen capability and with being provided in the development space to be 100% hydrogen capable at this point in time when that makes sense to the extent that gets accelerated that allows us to put more renewables into our footprint, because we got that long-term storage ﬂexibility.  So when you think about our resource plan, we're just trying to meet the need that when you ﬂip the switch, the lights come on. That's the need, we got to meet. We want to do it as eﬃciently and cleanly as possible, and that's just as technology has come to the point, where that's a bigger and bigger renewable footprint and again, if some of these other technologies are viable and cost eﬀective, it really helps accelerate that renewable deployment as well.  And so we continue to evaluate every project and every -- and every resource plan with those -- with those things in mind. So I'm excited about the possibility that the 5,000 gets bigger at some point and we've got a lot of time between now and 2030 to make that happen. And with again the infrastructure support coming out of the policy environment, that only only will tend to make that technology advance further faster and be more economical for our customers, if there is again that policy support."
"But to clarify here if you don't mind this structural options that you're alluding to for renewable projects, it sounds like how you ﬁnance or somehow structure incremental opportunities beyond what you're already talking about.","Well, it would be utilized to structure for the opportunities we're already talking about because we think about it Julien, the -- if we can make them more cost eﬀective for our customers through those structural options that frees up capital to spend other things that improve the level of service that our customers receive     whether it's on the T&D front, customer solutions front or in other and we're in renewable projects as well."
"All right. Excellent. Well, congrats on all fronts here. Speak to you guys soon.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for your time.",Good morning.  Good morning.
"Maybe just following up on Julien's question a little bit on clean energy. It sounds like there is a pretty signiﬁcant chance that we might get congressional action that would essentially extend the solar and wind tax credits for a very long time, create a new energy storage tax credit, potentially provide more support for carbon capture and storage and a few other things hydrogen as well. I guess ﬁrst just on the utility side, if you saw that kind of long-term Federal support that really does change the economics meaningfully, would that -- would that trigger essentially a sort of a formal sort of reassessment of your resource planning across or is it more just opportunistic you'd sort of keep that in mind, in the future or is it. I'm trying to kind of think about whether that cause you to sort of immediately want to rethink some of the resource plans you already have.","So Stephen, it's a great question. We're already rethinking the resource plan based on the potential for those types of initiatives to occur. As I mentioned the resource plan, it's not like we said it and then we just put it on autopilot and we're going to follow through on it regardless of what happens. So we are already looking at the plan that we have and determining based on diﬀerent policy scenarios, what that might do to change -- to change the economics, such that -- that the plant itself is changed.     And again as I mentioned, more support, policy support for these technologies occur, the lower cost they are for our customers and the faster they're going to accelerate in terms of their development as viable. That's -- we see that as having a positive impact on the cost to the customers, as well as the sustainability of the resource plan itself. So I mean, the short answer is absolutely. We're already -- we're already looking at what those impacts might be and certainly like everybody else in the industry, we're playing our part in helping the congressional leaders and the administrative leaders understand what those impacts might be on the industry on Entergy and on our region. And as I mentioned earlier, there is not only a growth opportunity for us in some of these policies, but the people who are making hydrogen today Stephen are in our service territory and are our customers, the people who are utilizing that hydrogen are in our service territory and are our customers.  So it's our intention to work with them in helping them meet their sustainability goals and their sustainability requirements, depending on what again comes out of legislation and administrative situation in Washington to help them with their sustainability objectives. So if you think about major hydrogen producers today through gas reformation if there is going to have to get carbon capture or renewables, we want to be there to help them with that."
"That's extremely helpful and actually the last part of what you mentioned Leo kind of brings me to my second question, which was just on, I guess especially hydrogen and carbon capture, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about sort of the role of Entergy in helping your customers, I guess I'm thinking about frankly degree of technology risk you're willing to take, commodity risk, what sort of the range of possible roles that Entergy could have helping customers pursue those -- those technologies, would you mind just elaborating a little bit on that.","Sure. Certainly, we're in the -- in the early phases of evaluating exactly what their needs are, what they -- what they want to do and what they can -- what their exposure is as well as how we want to participate. So we're really in the range of investigation right now. One is, for example with our ﬂeet itself, what we're going to utilize, the Montgomery County Innovation Center that I talked about, that is a 22 MW electrolysis facility that we're looking to develop, where we would be obviously creating green hydrogen that we would then test in our own facilities, as we use that as a precursor up to then how Orange County is going to utilize green hydrogen in its own for the production of electricity.  At the same point in time, to the extent carbon capture is something that hydrogen producer might want to utilize our ability to provide them with economic renewables would be a way to obviously create new load and new renewables for us to be able to help them with that and to the extent that they want to pursue electrolysis in their own production of green hydrogen and we can provide the clean energy whether it's through nuclear or through renewables, we can do that as well.     So we're investigating in all aspects of that. At the same point in time, there is transportation infrastructure down here in terms of pipelines and everything for that we need to look at how that transportation tees up to our own facilities as well as amongst the service territory. And then, we've got storage facilities that are capable of being converted to store hydrogen and so we're looking at that and what role that can play not only for us, but for our customers.  So there is a wide range of things that we're looking at, obviously our lane is to be the utility in all of this and, but as this progresses and we collaborate with Mitsubishi and we collaborate with our customers, the opportunity to be the utility and provide the electricity for all this to happen, should be pretty signiﬁcant. If it all -- if it all plays out. And I would say that the creation of the customer organization, where we announced David Ellis' position within Rod's organization that's going to be a pretty signiﬁcant organization that we're developing is designed to help and collaborate with those customers on these new needs that they have.  So I know that was a speciﬁc list of projects, Stephen, but it's more of a of a pretty wide-ranging opportunity, where we're going to -- we're going to stay in our lane. But yet, we're going to -- we're going to really pursue being able to make it reality."
"No, that's really helpful color. That's all I had. Thank you so much.","Thank you, Stephen.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. All right. It looks like his line disconnected, so we'll move on to our next question, which comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead."
Hello.,"Hey, Jonathan."
"Yeah. On -- I'm just curious, you talked about CapEx and potentially pulling things forward or having them less deferred, but when I look at the -- the guidance you gave for this year, it was just under $3.5 billion, and it looks like you already invested $1.6 billion in the ﬁrst quarter. So just maybe trying to get a little more of a sense of -- is that just timing or could this year's number be, it could be higher than what you     were looking at before and maybe what's driven that is really much bigger quarter that you've had in a while.","Yes. So I think for the year I think it is probably just timing elements. I don't think that there is any sort of massive acceleration versus what we had previously planned, other than to say that we pulled some of that capital in Arkansas, up from 2023. So I think that I'm going to say it was in the $150 million to $175 million for this year and so that's -- at this point, I think that would be the only diﬀerence from what we previously published for 2021."
"Okay. So this is just a big fat quarter in terms of project spend and anything in particular, Drew, that was driving that?",Nothing comes to mind that would -- would be something that would stand out.
"Okay. And then could you also -- could we just get an update on where you are on arrears and the customer bad debt and are you starting to see any improvement there, how does it look versus where you were at last quarter?","Sure. So from where we were at the end of the year, I think we've improved a little bit, not a lot, we kind of got stalled out because of the winter storm a little bit and we expect Arkansas and New Orleans to lift their moratoriums in May. So that should give us a clear path to starting to move those arrears a little bit lower. But at this point, they're -- they're still -- I would say they're still around $300 million. They are down from where they -- the highs were by, I don't know, 10% or so, but they still have ways to go."
"Great. And then I think that one other -- one other maybe related issue, as we're looking at the residential sales a little more, yeah -- to what extent, I know weather adjustment can be an art rather than a science, but to what extent are those, do you think you're still seeing when work from home beneﬁt is that starting to fade just so more comment there.","We're actually seeing increasing customer accounts and the usage per customer, which is more of an indicator for us for a long-term view, usage per customer has sort of ﬂattened -- ﬂattened out in the, in the residential sector. But -- but we are -- we are expecting the actual growth rate quarter-over-quarter to begin to moderate, as folks begin to return back to a more, a more normal for us low shape the way that it     plays out, as people go back to work and school and things of that nature, but we're tracking it rather rather discreetly and no real surprises for us thus far."
"Thank you, Rod.    Operator  Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, thanks, good morning everyone. My ﬁrst question is on renewables. If you can just elaborate a little bit, you gave a lot of details on the size of the opportunity overall, but what's your latest thinking on utility ownership versus PPAs potential role for tax equity partners and how that might aﬀect any of the rate base or CapEx and therefore balance sheet impacts relative to third party PPAs.","So, hey Andrew, this is Drew. So we do expect to own a good portion of the solar opportunity that's in front of us. We think that we can be extremely competitive for a couple of reasons. And one of them, you alluded to in terms of the tax equity partnerships that allows us to manage that investment tax credit that and work around some of the -- some of the challenges from being a utility. And so that's probably the main thing that's out there. Obviously, we are working hard on bringing our cost down just like everybody else in the sector. But we think based on the last couple of RFPs, where we've ended up, we think we're getting much more competitive in that space. So we expect to own it a big chunk of those things going forward. I will say -- I don't -- At the end of the day, doing all PPAs is probably not going to be that great for our balance sheet and it might actually start harming the customers, so that's something else that we are -- we're paying attention to. But I think in order to avoid that we really just have to get competitive on the RFPs and make sure that we win our share."
"Okay. And I assume there is no change to your assumptions, when you talk about the CapEx and cash ﬂow and equity needs outlook. All of that, have you changed your assumption on a win rate, if you will.","No, we haven't -- we haven't changed our assumption. And we still are working to ﬁgure out, okay, so in the second half of this decade, where a big chunk of that renewable comes in, what does that look like. But we would expect over time if we are successful in our strategy that we -- the win rate should improve for us."
"Okay, great. Then last question. Thank you for the cash ﬂow and details on the Texas windstorms. My question is do you see any need or opportunity for incremental CapEx to improve reliability, whether in terms of undergrounding or winter rising your regulated power plants there.","Certainly, as it relates to the winter storm speciﬁcally, which is not diﬀerent than any weather event that we have are a major portion of our after action analysis will include strategically what can we do to make the system more resilient and the winter storm's no diﬀerent. And so we're doing a comprehensive look at all of our facilities in all of our functions, not just in the generation side both transmission distribution as well to get, what's the right balance of cost and reliability that we want to want to put in it.  So that is ongoing. I wouldn't say that that's a signiﬁcant amount of capital that will go into those facilities compared to sized capital budget, as it sits today, but certainly we're looking at improving resiliency and all the investments that we're making in the normal capital plan are meant to improve power quality and reliability and so as we do for example with our transmission system, all of the new stuﬀ we build is to -- is to a higher standard than what we've built 20 years ago.  And as we saw in Hurricane Laura, all the stuﬀ that we built with the new technology, which stood the Hurricane, it was the stuﬀ that we built 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago that was destroyed and now the new stuﬀ is the new stuﬀ. So that's a continuing and continuous analysis for us -- how do you improve the resiliency just on a day-in, day- out basis and the weather events like the winter storm gave us the opportunity to learn even more."
Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations to David and Deanna on their promotions.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Bill Abler for any further remarks.    Thank you, Michelle and thanks to everyone for participating this morning. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q is due to the SEC on May 10th and provides more details and disclosures about our ﬁnancial statements. Events that occur prior to the date of our 10-Q ﬁling that provide additional evidence of conditions that existed at     the date of the balance sheet would be reﬂected in our ﬁnancial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Also as a reminder, we maintain a web page as part of Entergy's Investor Relations website called Regulatory and Other Information, which provides key updates of regulatory proceedings and important milestones on our strategic execution. While some of this information may be considered material information, you should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information. And this concludes our call. Thank you very much.  Operator  This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
