Question,Answer
Thanks so much. Hi guys.,"Good morning, Praful."
"Good morning. Congrats on a good quarter. So I just wanted to ﬁrst understand in terms of nuclear operations, I know we haven't touched on it in a while, just wanted to see where it stands today, how are operations and are there any other NRC items to be watched right now?","Hey Praful, this is Leo. Eﬀectively, everything is on track with what we laid out a couple of years ago in terms of spending, staﬃng, capital investments in the plants, and so the performance is as we would expect. I think the last remaining thing you'll see from an NRC standpoint is the return of Grand Gulf to Column 1, it's in Column 2 at the moment, but we would anticipate that that would happen this year. Other than that, it's just a continuation of the plan. We should start to see a leveling oﬀ of the cost structure there, as we've mentioned before, given the fact that we've done the ramp up in the staﬃng and put the processes and procedures in place that we need, to keep things on track.  That's kind of it. That's the next thing that you'll see publicly. As I mentioned before, I think in the last call, we have one more outage at Grand Gulf that would be considered part of the catch-up in terms of the investment proﬁle, so it will be a long outage. Our next outage in 2020 at Grand Gulf will be the ﬁnal one in terms of getting things back to where they need to be, and then it's just continued climb to excellence."
"Got you, that's super helpful, Leo. And then maybe on the operating cash ﬂow, it was great to see the signiﬁcant increase versus 2018, but I guess that part of that is the ADIT. Could you just talk about what portion of that increase was ADIT, and what was just overall improvement in cash ﬂow?","Hey, Praful, this is Drew. Yeah, so on the ADIT, it's a little bit -- around $200 million, I think, is the ADIT year-over-year element. And then a little bit of that is pension expense. The rest is continued improvement in our operating cash ﬂow. And you can see that in our -- well, you'll be able to see that in our three-year outlook on operating cash ﬂow for EEI, especially as that ADIT piece rolls oﬀ. So in our three- year outlook, we should be back up over $10 billion when we get to EEI."
"Got you, and just a quick follow up on that, which is, it's great that the ADIT is rolling oﬀ, because I look at the FFO to debt and you're still below your 15% target . So just wanted to see how that 15% target ﬂows through over the next year or so once ADIT rolls oﬀ.","Yeah, so by the end of next year we should be at around that 15% level, and as you looked at the number this year without the -- or this quarter without the excess ADIT in it, it's up actually over 17%, so we are on track to to move towards that target."
"Okay, well thanks so much, guys and congrats again.","Thanks, Praful.    Thank you.    Operator  (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning to you.","Good morning, Julien ."
"Hey, so perhaps just to pick up oﬀ of Praful's last questions here. Can you talk about through the forecast period, given the success that you've seen this year in Arkansas, speciﬁcally in moderating the pace of just overall bill inﬂation and O&M? What you're seeing to the forecast period as best you look at your plan today? I just wanted to understand how sustainable some of the more moderate trajectory of overall rate inﬂation is against your current capital budget. Just want to revisit that in light of the success.  And then perhaps I'll ask the second question at the same time. Can you talk a bit more about CapEx reﬂected in your outlook around both renewables in light of what ADP and Wind Catcher is doing in Arkansas, and prospects to mirror that to any extent? And also, given your peers in MISO, has there has been any change in     transmission? I suspect not, but I ﬁgured I'd ask. So, a lot to throw at you, but I ﬁgured to get it out all at once.","That was a very, very robust question, Julien. I'll go ahead and start and I'll let others ﬁll in. Our objective, and we believe we will continue to meet it, has been to keep our bill inﬂation level consistent with inﬂation. As you recall, even last quarter when we were able to come up with some continuous improvement ideas and change our capital plan, the bill path actually went down from where it would have otherwise been. So, we think we're going to continue to be able to manage that with the current capital plan that we have going forward.  I'm not sure I'm going to remember all of these, but I think on the renewables, from a CapEx standpoint, we mentioned on the last call that we still see the need to replace a signiﬁcant amount of our aging generation, and that a portion of that will be gas, and a portion of that, we view, could be renewables. We outlined 7,000 to 8,000 megawatt need, and a roughly 50-50 gas to renewables standpoint there. We are not really doing anything outside of meeting our own customers' needs with the generation that we've got. So that is that 2022 to 2030 timeframe. So that's still, obviously, we're adding some scale on the renewable front, but -- and there are scale economies, obviously, of us doing it. So we continue to see that as a part of our resource plan, but it's really just part of the resource plan like everything else, given the fully integrated nature that we have. As far as transmission and the expenditures, nothing has really changed in that from the last quarter.  I'll open it up to my team to correct me or -- and I think I answered all of the questions.  I don't have anything to add."
"Okay, just to clarify quickly. I mean, I suppose if I were to summarize what AEP's eﬀorts in Arkansas seem to be with respect to Wind Catcher, it is something of an acceleration given the tax credit regime. And obviously, they are focused on wind. Depending on the receptivity from the commission and staﬀ around those eﬀorts on the second go around, could we see any pivot in how you guys are approaching the state and some of that resource need in the 2022 through 2030 period, in light of the credit situation?","Julien, this is Drew. So we are still looking. Leo mentioned that we have over 1,000 megawatts that we have in various stages of development, and that we are looking at scale, and what does that mean to us? And as renewables become a bigger portion of our portfolio, we think that there might be opportunities for us to take scale into consideration, and use that as part of a program. I don't know if that's going to take the same tact as perhaps AEP is taking. There isn't -- Leo mentioned,     we want to have renewables near our customers. There isn't a whole lot wind. It may be more solar oriented. But we are thinking about that scale opportunity and what that might look like for us as well."
That's fair enough. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Thanks. Congratulations. You guys are having a great year.,Thank you.
"Couple of questions. The call earlier today, I know it's not your region, and you have diﬀerent industrial drivers than they do, but Southern Company was talking about how they too were seeing a little bit of a slowdown in the demand expectations versus their initial forecast. Can you sort of point to anything in particular that you're seeing, as it relates to perhaps the global economic conditions, trade war or other things that might be driving things on power demand to below your prior guidance range? You give pretty good sensitivities in the appendix of how we should think about those impacts should they deviate from the forecast. But then again, we also see that you are under-earning in Arkansas and there could be improvements there. So as we think about how you sort of stay inside the skids, sort of, of the high end to the low end of your guidance range through time, how are you adjusting to those conditions?","Yeah, Greg, this is Drew and I'll start, and then Rod can add in. The ﬁrst thing, I think, from our perspective is that the macro fundamentals that we see that have been driving our industrial growth are still very much in place. The low inputs from an energy perspective, low gas prices, for example, or low power prices, the spreads of natural gas to oil, or the spread geographically to Europe or Asia, those still remain very fundamentally sound. Along with, of course, some of our natural advantages like here on the Gulf Coast. The access to the Gulf Coast, the access to the river, the ready, willing and abled workforce, and the strong and supportive communities, all of those things continue to be very supportive.     And then you take our industrial base. It is some of the most modern and competitive in the world, and so we expect it to continue to run. In fact, that's what we have seen for our large industrials this year. We've seen our reﬁners, our core alkali facilities, our petrochem facilities continue to perform very well.  Where we've had challenges are people that are coming up online. So we have new construction that is in place or taking place, and it's just not ramping up as fast as we anticipated. We've been talking about that for a couple of quarters. In the small industrial space, our small industrial space has been surprisingly strong, despite all the economic headlines, except for one area in Arkansas we've had some agricultural customers which are seasonally oriented and typically are pumping a lot of water. We had large ﬂoods in the spring, and that carried over into the summer, into this quarter. So our small industrial sales were down, but that was two-thirds of the driver right there. And so we continue to see opportunities in the industrial space, with all the fundamentals still in place.  And I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about what we have been seeing.    This is Rod West. Good morning. Because of the fundamentals that Drew just mentioned, and the fact that over the last ﬁve years, we have been upskilling and upscaling our commercial and economic capabilities, we're actually engaged with, not only our large, existing customers, but we have direct line of sight with the pipeline, that we are probability weighting to determine how we think about our outlooks from a growth perspective. So today, we have approximately 1,000 megawatts of projects that we probability weighted such that we're comfortable putting those in the plan.  What we don't, and we have not yet disclosed because of where those potential pipeline projects are in their industrial development cycle, we have about 4 times 1,000 megawatts that is in the potential pipeline. But, we are tracking that in real time with those prospective companies who have expressed an interest in locating our service territory. The signiﬁcant ones being Louisiana and Texas, taking advantage of those macroeconomic advantages that Drew just made reference to. But our line of sight gets clearer and clearer as we further reﬁne our outlooks, because we've been successful in upskilling our internal capabilities."
"That's fantastic. And then, in terms of, you also give a very good detailed list of all the rate activity and what your earned ROEs look like today. And it does look like you sort of deserve the opportunity to get better outcomes in Arkansas. Do you expect the rate activity there should drive better earned returns in the next 12 to 24 months?","Yeah, Greg, this is Drew. So when you look at our sort of trailing 12-months view in Arkansas, and you actually see this in Mississippi as well, last year we over-earned, and in the fourth quarter because of that, we took a charge to get us back down to       the allowed return levels, in both those jurisdictions. We haven't over-earned this year, but we still have the charge. So you see our ROEs, but then you would normally anticipate in both those jurisdictions. But I guess the short answer to your question is, yes, we would anticipate the ability to earn our allowed return in both Arkansas and Mississippi."
"Thank you, guys.","Thank you.    Thanks, Greg.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Your line is now open."
"Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter. Most of my questions have been answered, so a very detailed discussion on volumes. I'll just jump back into the queue. Thank you.","All right, thanks, Sophie.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open."
"Hey. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar.    Good morning."
"Let me just shift to Texas for a second, and maybe just around Montgomery County. And obviously, it's progressing really well. Can we just get a sense on how we should think about the recovery, i.e., the GRC process, or using the current rider that was approved? And more or less, post-Montgomery County, how we should think about the rider mechanism, because it was obviously approved after you guys came out with your original plan? So as you guys think about adding additional generation in the rider, is that sort of incremental to your growth prospects?","Yeah, Shar, it's Rod. As we stated in prior conversations, that rider was not going to create an immediate material diﬀerence in our outlook. What we talked about was, particularly given the schedule with Montgomery County, that we would shape the rate case to the extent that we needed, to ensure that the recovery of Montgomery County that's reﬂected in our existing plan will shape with the timing of that rate case.  That said, the rider that was passed gave us an opportunity, as we look beyond Montgomery County, to have more contemporaneous rate recovery. From a regulatory process perspective, we still have to have, remember the legislation only enabled the commission to provide that relief. We still have to go through the process of rule-making through the PUCT to put that rider in eﬀect. And from our vantage point, as we think about the capital plan in Texas, we have not yet determined how we wish to time the availability of a rate case as a mechanism, and the contemporaneous rule-making around that rider. We still have to go to the PUCT.  And candidly, that conversation is ongoing, because there are other parties who would be part of that regulatory process. But think about it this way, we would go to the commission to ask for rule-making that would take advantage of the legislation to put the actual rider in eﬀect for ongoing recovery, so from a timing standpoint. We don't want to set an expectation that there is this immediate upside, so we will be shaping the rate case and the regulatory process around that rider as we make the capital plan for Texas in the generation space a little more clear. So there will be more on that, but it's not something immediate, and I don't want to set that expectation."
Got it.,"In terms of, Shar, driving future capital, I mean, the resource plan will be what the resource plan will be. I mean, that's a dynamic of our business across all the generation types, is that we've got that aging ﬂeet that needs to be refurbished, and we've been doing that for over 10 years. And if you look back in time, since we started our portfolio transformation, we've added and deactivated roughly equal amounts of capacity, and we'll continue to do that going forward.     Obviously, what the regulatory mechanisms do is provide an opportunity for there to be more certainty for our customers and for our investors, in terms of us having the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to make sure we continue to make those investments. Same goes on the renewable front. They will be part of the resource plan to meet the needs our customers have. We're not doing them outside of that customer base to meet any other need. So the regulatory process isn't going to drive a need for a new power plant, for example, but it will provide a lot of certainty around the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility we have to invest in those power plants."
"Got it. That will at minimum, I guess, improve some of the regulatory lag. Okay. And I'm sure Drew is going to be excited to talk about this at EEI, but maybe just a little preclude as far as equity needs. Do you, I guess, do you envision seeing a change from what you prior disclosed around equity being somewhere between 5% to 10% of your capex needs post 2020? Do you see that at all changing?","Hey, Shar, this is Drew. We don't anticipate any changes to that outlook from an equity needs perspective, and it still remains the same as it was at our Analyst Day a little over a year ago, and those needs wouldn't kick in until 2021 and beyond."
"Terriﬁc, guys, and congrats today. Congrats.","Thank you.    Thanks, Shar.    Operator  Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions.
