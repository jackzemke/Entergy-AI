Question,Answer
"Hey, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"Leo, from your prepared remarks, just quickly on Palisades, should we assume you don't want to even remain a short-term owner until the asset is potentially sold? So viability of the asset is really a Holtec question or could there be changes to the Holtec agreement? And maybe just elaborate a little bit on some of the technical challenges, like refueling and the capital that's needed to whole decommissioning and can they even be overcome?","Yes. I'm normally not going to, Shar, get into any kind of details about what would or wouldn't work. The technical details though around the operations, the plant will have to stop operating in May because we'll be out of fuel. We haven't ordered fuel. There's a lot of work that would need to be done at the plant and prepared to continue to operate beyond that cycle.  We really haven't done any investigation into what that work would be. Because as you might guess, we've been planning for ﬁve years to shut the plant down. We do have an agreement with Holtec and obviously, that has certain features in it that by and large have all been -- all conditions have been met except for the plant still operating. So it's just a real heavy lift at the last hour.  As I said, we couldn't be more supportive of the fact that continued operation of the country's nuclear ﬂeet is important, the reliability of the bulk electric system and to the ability for us to decarbonize the economy. Shutting those plants down is just moving backwards. But -- so I'm encouraged by those -- with DOEs got going on for future plans just at this stage with Palisades. It's just a really heavy lift, is all we're saying."
"Got it. And then just on credit metrics and equity. With you guys potentially trending above your thresholds, did you see any opportunities to maybe further downsize your $570 million of remaining needs? And as you kind of getting closer to hitting your credit metrics and prepare to roll forward your capital plan, do you anticipate any improvements in credit metric threshold, especially as the business mix has improved and storm funding is moving closer to resolution? So would like for instance an improvement in thresholds, let's say, the 12% to 13% eﬀectively leave you over equitized versus the current projections?","Yes. Shar, it's Drew. So, in terms of opportunities out there that they could continue to change or improve around our credit metrics. Obviously, the one that we excited, I think last -- at the end of last year I guess, on our last call was around pension. And     certainly interest rates are changing that pension liability, the returns associated with the trust, supporting that pension aren't as good as we were anticipating either. All that kind of balancing out.  That is something that we are watching closely if rates continue to stay high and returns come back around to closer to our expectations and it could create some more headroom in our credit metric. That's probably the one that we are looking at most closely right now. So we're monitoring that. In terms of -- obviously, we need to get the securitizations done. We need those to be oﬀ sheet as we've discussed. Those things are going to be big milestones in terms of taking some debt oﬀ of our balance sheet. And so, we're watching that closely as well.  Outside of that, our expectations around capital, which obviously also drives our equity needs. Those are things that we're watching closely. We do have some capital associated with solar in the near term and we can -- I'm sure there's going to be a question on the call about that. We can talk about that here in a minute, but we have other capital projects that are waiting in the wings, particularly around resilience. So if there is extra headroom for us because of delays in solar, there's quite a bit of resilience investment that our customers are waiting on and expect us to achieve if there's an opportunity. So I don't anticipate any extra room from the capital side going forward."
"Okay. Got it. And just one quick follow-up if I may, and I appreciate that, it's just on your Analyst Day. I know you -- I mean, obviously you guys talked about resiliency and sort of the green tariﬀs. Just given the timing of sort of the regulatory initiatives and the technical conferences, I know you obviously highlighted how they would ﬁt in with the Analyst Day, but should we speciﬁcally think about the Analyst Day as a roll forward of your base planning, qualitatively maybe discuss these opportunities with some scenario or back testing analysis? We actually see some of the spending actually rolled into the capital plan. Thank you.","Well, I think Shar, we're going to let the punch lines of the Analyst Day show up on Analyst Day. (Multiple Speakers)"
"Thanks, Leo. I tried to get that passed.",Right.
Got it. Thanks.    Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Your question please.,
"Hey. Good morning, team, and thanks for taking the question.",Good morning.    Good morning.
"Hey, morning. So, I just wanted to hit the solar supply chain risks quick, and just the impact. Could you just help us to size the amount of megawatts going into rate base that would potentially be at risk? I think you said, roughly half you're secured on over the three-year horizon. So is that like 300 to 400 megawatts? And just to conﬁrm, I heard your last comments, right, to the extent that capital shifts, you were just going to backﬁll that with potential distribution resiliency spend?","Yes. This is Rod. Good morning. From Leo's comments, the near-term risk that we were referring to in terms of existing -- our existing owned projects was roughly 280 megawatts, because we were discreet about both -- we're explicit about both West Memphis and Walnut Bend. And so, from a megawatt standpoint, they really don't represent a material amount of capacity.  So, we want to make sure that we put that in some context and recall, Leo also mentioned, the lion's share of our renewable capacity actually shows up on the back end of the decade. So, we're calling it out, because we've recognized that there're some near-term constraints, but they're really don't inﬂuence how we are thinking about our build-out.    And I think, to the last point, Nick, though, I think Drew mentioned it, I mentioned it on the script. We've got a capital plan and timing that's laid out. We've got other things waiting in the wings that we could or couldn't accelerate. So, the ability to roll something else into the plan that provides beneﬁts to our customers in a diﬀerent way is always there."
"Absolutely, absolutely. And then just Drew's comments on inﬂation, if anywhere, where would you kind of call out that you're kind of seeing the most pressure to the plan? And can you just kind of talk about the current state of power markets, how you're kind of managing customer bill impacts and the ability to just continue to extend your rate base growth here? Perhaps any levers that makes your jurisdiction more unique than others, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Thanks, Nick. It's Drew. So the way you phrase it was an interesting way to think about it in terms of putting pressure on the plan. I would actually turn that around and say that it actually enhances the economics of the plan. Because we think about where the inﬂation -- what the inﬂation does to our two central investment themes beyond sort of our base capital in renewables and in resilience. We think that it actually -- inﬂation will actually strengthen the economic case from a customer's perspective to get those things done.  Certainly when you're talking about renewables and higher gas prices, there's more economic headroom there right now and that's accelerating the pressure to get the renewables done. We've already done a lot of work around improving our gas eﬃciency with the CCGTs that we've built historically and, of course, the Orange County Advanced Power Station is out there as well, a high eﬃciency unit. So, those things are helpful already, but as we think it will accelerate our plan around renewables. And then, of course, around resilience, a key piece of the plan is the cost associated with putting up hardened lines, distribution lines, transmission lines, prior to a storm compared to the cost associated with doing a massive storm and to the extent that there is inﬂation, that's going to exacerbate that diﬀerence, which is already substantial and accelerate the need for customers to do it ahead of time in a planful way.  So, obviously, those things have an impact on the customer bill, but the alternative of not doing it is an even greater impact on the customer bill. So, I think, it will drive customers who want to accelerate our plan, which will include renewables and resilience investment."
"Sounds very detailed. Thanks for the response, and see you in New York.","All right. Thanks, Nick.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your question please."
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Jeremy."
"Just want to come back to DOC a little bit more if I could and for 2023 projects, if you could just break down price risk versus timing risk and do you see C&I demand kind of insulating the project, so it's green[ph] on both these factors?",Price risk -- ask the question again so we want to make sure Drew and I are trying to ﬁgure out who's going to answer what part of the question. I know there was a price risk question in there as well.
Yes. Just price and timing for 2023 projects.,"So the -- on the projects that we just referenced that being Sunﬂower, for instance, Sunﬂower is not at risk. That's one of our own projects. We're expecting that, when as Leo alluded to, to be at service sometime in August. So, we're looking good there.  The other ongoing projects that we are expecting a bit of delay are the ones I referenced earlier, West Memphis and Walnut Bend. We're working with our BOT partners, both of whom are reputable ﬁrms to lock down both pricing and schedule certainty. And so, there is some risk on both, because of the delays for both the supply chain as well as the DOC issues. But beyond that, we'll see if Drew adds anything there.    I think the only thing I'll add to what Rod said, is that, and as actually Rod mentioned earlier, the bulk of our expectations are beyond kind of the next two-year window and we've issued RFPs, the DOCPs accepted. And they're fully aware of all the supply chain concerns and risks and they are -- prior to the DOC action, they were already aware of tariﬀ activity in that space.  So, we expect that these folks that we have we are working with coming out of the RFP will be well situated to manage through the current environment and meet the expectations that they put through in the RFPs. We expect that the DOCs will be resolved at some point relatively near term. I mean, I think most of the folks that we've been engaging with would talk about by the end of the year but even if it goes a little bit longer, we don't think that, that puts our overall expectations in jeopardy. And certainly in the near term, as I mentioned earlier, there are plenty of     other things, if projects are delayed, there are plenty of other things for us to accelerate forward and meet other customer expectations."
"Got it. Thank you for your thoughts. So that's helpful. And just kind of pivoting a bit here to nuclear in really small modular reactors. Just want to know your thoughts on, I guess, how this could unfold going forward? And we saw one of your peers potentially partnering with the university to build an SMR. Is this something that Entergy would consider doing to demonstrate the viability of the technology? Or any thoughts, I guess, on SMR, when and if that could be something that Entergy is really moving more towards or exploring?","Yes. Jeremy, we're certainly monitoring what's going on in SMR space, and as you might guess, our nuclear folks are involved in advisory capacities and others with various entities to make sure that we are -- we've got our ﬁnger on the pulse of where that goes. I think that the success of the technology is going to be critical to the decarbonization objectives of the economy.  When you think about the ability to build cost-competitive carbon-free smaller projects that aren't the issue. For example, we have with the size of the capital budgets of the existing technologies is that they're as big as the companies that fund them, and that's problematic if you've got issues with construction. So, we're very excited about that opportunity, when and how it ﬁts itself into the -- into our needs. We're continuing to monitor and it's a little bit diﬃcult to say. But certainly, I think we should all be looking for that technology to take root.  We're spending, I know, probably more of our eﬀorts in the hydrogen space, because of the unique position that we have in the hydrogen market with producers, consumers, stores, transporters all in the heart of our service territory. So, there's a unique advantage there. But it doesn't mean we're not staying involved in what the SMR technology could do for us and for the economy in general."
Got it. That's very helpful. I leave it there. Thanks.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your question, please."
"Hey. Good morning, guys and Drew, long time no see. Just --",Good morning.
"Good morning. Just other questions have been answered, just one quick follow-up from my side. Just can you conﬁrm that these the Storm Ida balance of costs which you haven't received sort of regulatory approval for, does that still sit at $1.7 billion? I believe that was the number as of the end of the fourth quarter call. So if you could just conﬁrm that or update us on where that sits now?","Yes, so the answer is the total cost estimate for that storm still at $2.7 billion in total, $1 billion of that is in the ﬁrst securitization we expect to price in the next few weeks and the balance would be towards the end of the year. The full $2.7 billion will be part of our ﬁling that we are making in the next couple of days. We still -- (Multiple Speakers)"
Right.,"Just to clarify, we have to get approval for the full amount to get cost recovery for the full amount. That hasn't -- the $1 billion down payment is not pre-approval of those costs. It's just a -- it's a preﬁnancing."
"I see. So essentially, you'll be seeking approval for the full $2.7 billion and the $1 billion that you've gotten already will be applied towards it. Is that the right way to think about it?",That is correct.
"Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color today. Thanks, guys.","Thank you.    Thank you.      Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your question, please?"
"Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity here and congratulations on continued results. If I can just to focus on the ﬁrst quarter and some of the dynamics there. Can you comment a little bit on the industrial demand in the 6.5% in the ﬁrst quarter here? How are you seeing this trend through the balance of the year as you think about it, especially given the potential for export-oriented industries to do particularly well here?  And can you talk also in tandem at the same time about some of those trends that you observed, speciﬁcally around accelerating customer desire for renewables? You had speciﬁcally identiﬁed at the start of this year, a number of very large customers, but I have to imagine based on your comments already, that there are actually several other larger customers that you're talking to.","So, this is Drew. I'll take the ﬁrst part and I'll turn the second part over to Rod. And so, certainly in terms of the sales expectations, we did have higher-than-anticipated industrial sales in the quarter. A lot of -- most of it was actually more or less in line. In fact, I would say compared to our expectations, obviously, reﬁners seeing very high crack spreads for performance well.  We did have some unplanned outages in some of the chemical and petrochemical space, which pulled this down a bit. And then there are unplanned outages for our cogen customers and that actually lifted us back up. So, that cogen piece was actually fairly strong in the quarter. There were a number of outages that helped lift this back up. I would say that the other part that unplanned outages for our regular customers, that was fairly signiﬁcant too.  So, I mean, all-in-all it is probably about what we were expecting and of -- but a little bit higher. And as we sort of go through the balance of the year, and I showed you the statistics on one of the slides for some of our key industries, we do expect them to continue to run at high utilization rates aside from planned or unplanned outages. They're going to try and trim those oﬀ as much as they can to run as hard as they can, given the current commodity environment. And I will also say, LNG wasn't on that page, but LNG utilization rates are extremely high as well.  I'll turn it over to Rod to talk about other customer --  I was only going to elaborate on the LNG piece and I'm not going to, Leo's point, give any punch lines around Analyst Day because we'll give our point of view on our       ﬁve-year outlook. But we are seeing greater interest in signing oﬀtake contracts, which would support our view on expansion in the LNG space. We'll leave it to our customers to leave that conversation, but we'll know empirically that 85% of the projects under FID consideration in the LNG space or in Entergy service territory.  And so, it just further supports our point of view that we have a unique growth story, that is, our customers have a unique growth story, and our ability to serve their expansions in addition to their -- helping them meet their ESG objectives remains a growth opportunity for us, and we still remain bullish about it."
"Excellent. And then just one other nuance here. Just seeing a lot of headlines here, our insurance costs, I am sure you guys have seen the headlines in Florida, but also in Louisiana itself. Especially as it relates to catastrophic storms, can you comment about any potential pressures from an inﬂationary perspective on your business speciﬁcs?","You talk about insurance, speciﬁcally, Julien?"
"Yes. I mean, I was thinking about insurance speciﬁcally, obviously, broader backed up here, but insurance seems to be getting headlines here outside of the utility space very late.","Okay. So, I'll -- talking out insurance is, we are not allowed to insure our poles and wires. So that hasn't been a driver on that particular space. Just like everybody else, we have seen broad insurance premium pressure. And so, we're working through that regardless of whether it's property or general liability or what have you, et cetera. So, we are -- cyber. We're working through that and making sure that we continue to meet our overall own expectations on a go-forward basis.  But that's, as you said, it's sort of symptomatic of a broader perspective around inﬂation. We certainly have seen inﬂation in the fuel space. We've talked about that a little bit. We're working with our stakeholders on how to manage that in the near term. I think long term, that is a commodity which cycles and we expect the wildcatter spirit that's out there in the oil patch take over at some point and help bringing prices back down again.  As far as sort of inﬂation in the capital space, we talked about that a little bit with solar. We're seeing it in other materials and some of our other capital projects. But I think the thing to keep in mind on that is, we're seeing it for our current marginal capital projects, but they're being added to a much larger rate base, which is already invested in and ﬁxed. And so, it's a much smaller piece of the overall rate base, when you add it in. And so the pressure from a customer bill perspective is not that great.     Certainly, as I mentioned, the fuel piece is something we're paying close attention to and as far as just other operating costs, we haven't seen much pressure as of late. But we're certainly mindful of that and we are driving our continuous improvement eﬀorts to make sure that we stay ahead of that on an ongoing basis."
"Got it. It doesn't sound like it's an outsized impact to you all here. It sounds like you guys have it under control. And also sounds like a pretty good update here at this Analyst Day, So we're going to stay tuned. Thank you, guys.","Thank you, Julien.    Thank you, Julien.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?"
Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just on the resilience.,"Hi, Steve."
"Good morning. Just on the resilience plans that you have talked about. I think going back to last year, you talked about kind of having discussions with key stakeholders and the like and just can you get -- give any sense of how those have gone and is there any -- do you get a sense of urgency from people on this? Just any color there.","Hi, Steve. It's Rod, good morning. We have just completed the analytics around the risk scenarios, probability, consequence of storms and we're in that evaluation phase of the CapEx investment scenarios. And so, what you're alluding to is the beginnings of the formal and sometimes informal technical and stakeholder conferences and conversation. That actually begins in earnest tomorrow as we began the conversation in New Orleans.  And so, the feedback loop is just beginning and we'll have more color around it at Analyst Day. I can tell you that we have certainly had informal conversations as we were beginning the analytics, and there's a keen interest in understanding, one,     what's our point of view around the risk and the beneﬁts of acceleration? Obviously, in the current economic environment, most of the stakeholders, customers, and regulators and others alike are always going to be interested in how we think through the cost and bill impact.  And so, we're beginning, but I'm expecting very active engagement from the stakeholders as we move through New Orleans with certainly Louisiana en route to what we believe to be our ﬁrst formal ﬁlings in that July timeframe for the City of New Orleans. And then the state of Louisiana, certainly around that timeframe but not just wiping later. Even in Texas, Steve, we have begun dropping ideas around how they ought to think about resiliency. They -- certainly their point of view might be a little diﬀerent in terms of the sense of urgency that you alluded to, than say, Louisiana and New Orleans, but we certainly have their attention, especially given the role of our Texas service territory in the industrial growth space and their interest in resiliency as well. But short answer is, we are just beginning, but more to say about it at Analyst Day, Steve."
"Okay. So, it sounds like at the very least, you'll have better data scenarios for the Analyst Day of what diﬀerent options are and obviously the results will be over time depending on what customer states want. Okay. Thank you.","Yes. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Your question, please?"
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
"One question, just -- can you give us a little bit of a sense you've alluded to being conscious of commodity and gas prices? And obviously take your points about the longer-term beneﬁts of some of your investment plans, but what is the sort of current bill trajectory that you see over the coming months? And maybe we could just sort of focus in on that.","Sure. This is Drew. So, in the near term, of course, it depends on the jurisdiction, the one that you're probably most interested in, of course, is the Louisiana, and the securitization costs associated with that. It will depend on what the ﬁnal pricing is of those securitization bonds, but somewhere in the neighborhood of about 10% once all those securitization costs are into bills. And I think, that includes a little bit of uptick in the interest rates that we see. So, obviously, our customers are expecting that they know it's out there. So, we're managing through that with our stakeholders. And the bulk of that has already been approved by the commission, and so it's headed forward as we've discussed.  The gas price piece, that reﬂects -- it depends on the jurisdiction, but it generally gets into bills fairly quickly in Louisiana, Texas, New Orleans. There is a little bit of hedging that goes on in Mississippi and Louisiana that can help that but it's pretty small. But they are -- yes, they're used to the gas price volatility, if nevertheless we are continuing to work through it, the continuous improvement program that we have is part of that.  We also have levelized billing programs for customers that allow them to manage through their bills and avoid some of that volatility. So those are examples of things that we are doing to try to help customers go through that. And then over time, I think gas prices are a little bit above where our previous expectations were. But they're still in a manageable range and as we said, and as you're alluding to, Jonathan, the investments that we intend to make should help with gas price risk and inﬂation risk on a longer-term basis."
"When you say over time, Drew, you're talking about sort of further out on the curve, right? Can you frame for us what the sort of 2022 impact on sort of top of the securitization might end up being on Louisiana customers, for example?","In 2022, it's again going to be a portion of what I was explaining earlier, because it's not always the overall securitization cost, so only about two-thirds of that. So about a 5% or 6% increase by -- once those get into the bills this year -- later this year.  (Multiple Speakers)"
-- commodities will be incremental to that or is that included in that number? I guess my --,"That's no. The commodity piece, you're talking about gas prices?"
Correct.,"Yes. I think a general rule of thumb around there is about $1 for MMBTU is about a 3% to 4% increase in gas prices. If that's sustained over a year, of course, we haven't seen that yet, but that would be kind of the thought there."
"Okay. Well, thank you for that color. I think, if I could just on one other thing. I -- when I look at your slide with the progress against guidance in the few buckets like utility, O&M, and the interest line, and then also, this is parent line, that's now there. It seems like you're tracking -- you've had more than a quarter's worth of the pressure you are expecting from the year in ﬁrst quarter. I know the other taxes piece, you said, would be going to more front-end loaded. But is that timing across the board or are these some things that are building, but then you hope kind of the sales uptick is going to hold you harmless eﬀects? But I'm just curious if you can frame that a bit for us.","Yes. Sure. So, in terms of O&M, I think in the ﬁrst quarter, as you're talking, it is timing elements. We are on track for our expectations for the balance of the year. And in terms of the interest expense element, we are seeing some interest expenses that's a little bit higher that we would expect to stick, as we go through the course of the year. But there's also some timing elements in that sort of category that we are seeing in the ﬁrst quarter that will turn back around. So, you're not seeing all of the interest expense in the ﬁrst quarter than it goes away. It actually is going to be building over the balance of the year, but there are some timing elements in the ﬁrst quarter they will turn around. So, that is -- I think those are the two things that are going on there."
Thank you for that. Thanks a lot. Look forward to June.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please?"
"Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, James."
"Just real quick clariﬁcation, just post Julien's question. With the slightly better sales outlook you guys have, have the drivers related to mix changed materially? Or are just really being driven more by more robust C&I sales? Or are you seeing higher demand across all classes despite an increasing trend for return to work at this point?","Okay. This is Rod. I think the short answer is, it's been actually going the way that we expected with residential demand trailing oﬀ, as our residential customers are going back to work, school and kind of a pre-COVID life and the growth story being driven by the C&I space as you alluded to. So from our advantage point, we're actually tracking -- we're tracking concordant plan there with a little bit of robustness in the C&I space, but that's about it."
"Okay. Great. And just following up on Jonathan's question too, just to clarify, the 10% increase you're talking about, that's in -- that's 10% increase across total retail sales, correct, in Louisiana.","Yes. Is there a somewhat of a skew across from a rate design basis? Like, is there a rough idea of like what that could mean for residential versus commercial versus industrial you might be able to granular at this point? I can follow up oﬄine.    Yes. I think Bill can cover that for you oﬄine because I don't -- I can't actually answer that oﬀ the top of my head. There is a diﬀerence, of course, there's a big chunk of distribution costs and then that is just going to go mostly to residential and commercial customers, not as much on industrial customers."
"Okay, great. I will follow up with Bill. Thanks so much.","Sure.    Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your question, please?"
Good morning. How are you -- excuse me.,"Good morning, Ross."
So if I think about your base capital plan at $12 billion and I think if I remember correctly from (inaudible) were talking about $5 billion to $15 billion of potential incremental CapEx. I just wanted to understand your comment around federal funding. Is that $5 billion or $15 billion of incremental CapEx sort of net of that number or would any federal funding net that number down whatever that number happens to be depending on the long-term opportunities there?,"Now the federal funding would be outside of anything that we've got in our projection. So the $5 billion to $15 billion, now that isn't over the next three years, that goes out through 2030, just to be clear on that. And it's really an acceleration of work that we could do over time based on the fact that we might take things that are working today, but are old standard and pull them down and put up something of a new standard. It's that kind of work that we'd be looking at.  So any kind of federal funding would be used to oﬀset the cost and then that provides headroom that you could potentially accelerate more. So one way to think about it, Ross, would be if you were going to spend $10 billion and then all of a sudden, you got $1 billion worth of federal funding, we may spend $11 billion would be one option to be able to and you get it for eﬀectively $11 billion worth of resilience for $10 billion. So that's why we would think about it and likely propose it."
"Okay. That's the way I understood it. I just wanted to make sure I was understanding that correctly. And then maybe longer term, as you get to the credit metrics you need on the balance sheet, you want on the balance sheet think about your 5% to 7% EPS growth, as you execute some of these opportunities and maybe grow rate base faster than that in the long term, but there might be an equity need attached to the capital, so does that bring your EPS growth rate back down.  What -- how do you think about rates and bills and their long-term growth rate? In other words, is the $5 billion to $15 billion thinking about extending that 5% to 7%, or maybe even upper end of that 5% to 7% for a longer period of time? Or is there actually an opportunity to accelerate that 5% to 7% longer term given bill pressure and other things that might be happening with inﬂation?","Yes. I guess, I'll kind of sum it up this way. We have signiﬁcant amount of growth opportunities because of the growth needs of our customers. The resilient spend is certainly one of those areas. The acceleration of renewables ahead of the schedule     that we're on to meet decarbonization goals of our current customers, as they want to get outsized access to clean resources, could accelerate renewables at the same load growth. The expansion of our industrial base is a growth opportunity.  Just the growth that we're seeing as we've talked about the utilization rates are high, inventories are low, all the commodity spreads are in the right place, that leads itself pretty right for expansion and that's what we're seeing, as we have dialogue with our customers going forward. And then the electriﬁcation side of things where they're going to take existing load or existing processes that are not electriﬁed and electriﬁed them and that creates load growth. So, there's all kinds of avenues for growth in customer demand for a higher level or diﬀerent level of service that could provide capital opportunities for us.  I would say, at a minimum, that just makes the runway pretty long for us in terms of where we are with the current outlooks. Our objective would certainly be to have a better outlook going forward and balance all the things that you were talking about the growth in sales, the growth in investment, and the growth in ﬁnancing needs, and balance all that out in a way that creates diﬀerent trajectory for us going forward. And I think our customers are going to demand the types of investments we need to make that happen. But that's in the future.  So I think, all of those combined certainly bode well for a continuation of the growth that we've seen and demonstrated over the course of the last several years pretty much like clockwork. And then I think our objective and the work we need to do is to ﬁnd a way to make it better."
