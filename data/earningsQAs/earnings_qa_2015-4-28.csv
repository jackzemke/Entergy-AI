Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning and congrats on the quarter.,"Good morning, Julien.    Good morning, Julien.       Thank you."
"Of course. Now, could we address ﬁrst oﬀ the sales growth? You addressed it at length in the commentary, but perhaps can you jive the, just the ﬁrst quarter 1.5% relative to the full-year target? And also in contrast, I see that the, I suppose, in your guidance, you talk about utility revenue up $0.55 for the year. And I think you hit it net about $0.25? So, a constructive commentary there. Where do you stand vis-à-vis the EPS as well? So, the percent change and the EPS on the utility, if you can.","Drew, or Theo wants to start and then Drew can talk.      Julien, I'll maybe address your ﬁrst question in terms of the growth. As Drew said, the 1.5% is primarily impacted by what we saw in the industrial sector in terms of where it came in at 2.9%. Most of that, that was driven primarily in two areas: the timing of new and expansion projects that we expected in the ﬁrst quarter, as well as some one-time unexpected issues, or outages to some of our existing customers. And those two issues roughly represented about 50% of the diﬀerence in terms of what we expected versus where we ended up. So clearly that means we've had some softening in the ﬁrst quarter. Clearly, some of that we will see pick up as we go out into the year and into 2016 and 2017.  So it doesn't change our overall expectation as it relates to 2017 at this point in time. What I will also say though, even with the 1.5% growth, as you mentioned, our revenues were still strong. And revenues got clearly much closer to our expectations. And so, it's still early and we're still assessing where we believe we'll be as we go through the year. But I mean the ﬁrst quarter delays clearly could dampen our 2015 results. But again as Drew mentioned earlier, we still see ourselves in our earnings guidance for 2015.    This is Drew. And I'll just add that in addition to what Theo said, we do have some costs in that top line which are oﬀset in O&M. So I think in my comments, I talked about around $0.10 is other stuﬀ, is what, some things like MISO costs and energy eﬃciency costs that were a little ahead of where we expected them to be. And they were oﬀset in that net revenue line. So that's part of why the net revenue line is higher than maybe what you were anticipating as well."
"Got it. But just to be clear on the sales growth, it's fundamentally delays, not necessarily a shift in the fundamental outlook for a decline of the commodities, et cetera?","Yes, I mean what we saw primarily was just shifts in timing. As we've said, from an oil price perspective, we still don't see any signiﬁcant impact. I mean we fundamentally believe a large majority of our industrial growth through 2017 is coming from projects that are already in advanced stages of development. And ﬁrst quarter didn't change that."
Got it.,"Julien, this is Leo. Julien, I'll just add, we've mentioned this before but I guess it garners some reinforcement. A lot of these expansions and/or new customers, they're big projects, and they target a date that it's not uncommon for capital projects in the hundreds of millions of dollars, or in some cases the multi-billion dollar range to just slip a month or two here and there. So that may or may not occur in line with what we would have expected from time to time also."
"And then secondly, if you don't mind, a kind of bigger picture question on dividend. You alluded to it earlier. What's your targeted payout ratio? Or how do you think about the dividend in the context of the EWC business and the utilities at this point or prospectively?","Well, from a EWC business, we don't think about it at all. The dividend is purely from utility, parent and other. And we had outlined at the Analyst Day our expectation that a 65% to 75% payout ratio of utility, parent and other earnings was our target."
"Got it. So perhaps in looking at that initially here, remaining towards the top end of the range, would that be a fair statement as you think about growing that in the 2016 timeframe?","Well, when we look at it, just to put some context about it, our objective being to return capital to shareholders and to do it on a protracted sustained basis, we're looking to create an era of sustained dividend growth. So, as we look at the growth in that segment of the business, we're not going to chase the payout ratio and have the dividend jumping around a lot. We're going to look for what's sustained growth in the business, and we'll make recommendations for the board to put together a path with the dividend that achieves that, consistent with what those long-term earnings growth would be.     So, we're going to review that, as we always do every year. But when we get into this fall, it's going to be reviewed in the context of the growth that we continue to believe is going to occur within that segment, as well as other factors that the board will consider, like the reinvestment dollars that we have to put into the dividend, et cetera, or into the utility business. But that's primarily the way we're thinking about it."
"Great. Well, thank you for the time.",Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is now open.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul."
"I was looking – I was a little bit confused by the decommissioning beneﬁt that you guys have in the release. As I recall, you guys were expecting the decommissioning expenses to increase. So I was wondering, is that decommissioning – how should we think about decommissioning and guidance, the decommissioning trust fund and what have you, and the beneﬁt that you saw in the quarter versus the rest of the year?","That's a good question, Paul. So, when we were at EEI, we talked about $20 million to $25 million of net income drag from Vermont Yankee in 2015 and 2016, and then it kind of trails oﬀ to about $10 million after that. So, we do expect it to come down as critical aspects of the decommissioning process wind up – wind oﬀ, I should say. But, and since EEI, and as we got closer to the actual shutdown date, and we started to need to make decisions around how we were going to manage that decommissioning trust, it became clear that we needed to be de-risking that trust, as we move through the ﬁrst phase of decommissioning, which caused us to have to turn over our portfolio a little bit more than we had previously anticipated. And so we are trying to do that at a nice ratable basis as we go through the year.  It started a little bit last year, and it will probably continue on into a little bit into the ﬁrst quarter, maybe even next year. But it should be about $0.04 or so each quarter,     is kind of what our expectation is. And that, over the course of the year, is going to take up a lot of the oﬀset drag that we were anticipating for 2015. So I think Vermont overall for the year would be anticipated now to be about ﬂat or maybe even slightly positive. And I would say about ﬂat is the expectation."
For the full year?,The full year.
"Okay. So there's going to be – okay. And then in terms of the zone changes in New England, I was wondering if there was any impact on you guys – and this is in terms of the point of view change – well, not the point of view change, but has there been any quantitative change in the point of view? I know directionally, you guys are bullish, but has there been anything in terms of your outlook for the markets that has changed quantiﬁably?","Paul, we have, in fact, lowered our point of view from a natural gas perspective. And obviously that ﬂows through power prices. However, we still do remain bullish compared to the market overall.  As it relates to the zone in New England, it's really a tough call in terms of where those markets end up. We're still working through that. But really, there is a wide range of outcomes depending on supply/demand balance. And so, right now, I don't have anything to share speciﬁcally as it relates to a price range. We're trying to get more information from the ISO and further evaluate that."
Okay. Thanks a lot.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
"Thanks. Can you talk about the – what your earned return on equity has been in Arkansas? And given the recent changes in the regulatory structure there, and your       intent on ﬁling under the new structure, whether you think you'll see – over what trajectory you think you'll see improvement in that return?","Yes. Sure, Greg. This is Theo. I believe if you look at the packet, the webcast packet, with the slides, normalized was about 5.9% for the last 12 months ending March 31 of this year. And clearly, with the reform and with the rate case ﬁling, we expect to see that change. And if you think about the impact of the rate case ﬁling and the revenue impacts, as well as net income impacts, we see Arkansas, as we go forward to 2016 and beyond, with the formula rate plans for the test years making signiﬁcant movement to earnings there allowed returns."
"Okay. So you think the balance – that you'll be litigating that case for the balance of 2015. And to the extent that there is a change, and we'll see that show up in 2016?","Yes. I mean there will be an eﬀect. There's I think a long statutory period in Arkansas. And while we don't have a procedural schedule set just yet, we would expect to see the case playing out through the remainder of 2015. And we would see, at the latest, rate impacts 10 months from the ﬁling date, which was last Friday – this past Friday."
Great. Thank you.,"Thank you, Greg.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Daniel Eggers of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open."
"Hey. Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Just going back to the point of view comment or kind of the change there, I think previously it looked like you had about $100 million or $150 million of POV uplift for 2017. How much has that point of view changed? And does that have any bearing on       kind of the 2% to 4% EPS growth target you guys provided starting back at your Analyst Day?","This is Drew. I'll take ﬁrst crack at it and then I don't know if anybody else will jump in. But the – as it relates to the EBITDA uplift that we were talking about before, I think it was $650 million to $700 million. And as we've kind of gone along and prices have stayed low, and we've gotten closer and closer to those periods, it's less and less likely that we would make it into the range.  And so, our point of view has slipped in the time frames that we've talked about, below that $650 million threshold. I think, last quarter, we were right about the edge, and now we're a little bit below. So, that's what's happening with it. As we look out, we still have a bullish point of view that it starts to rise as we get beyond the period that we are talking about. But it's been pushed further out as we've gone along.  As it relates to the 2% to 4%, I think the primary driver at the utility continues to be right on track, the utility and the parent and other, combined entity. In fact, we've given those ranges for 2016 and 2017. Those are still very much intact. In fact, we have some – we are looking for additional opportunities maybe even in the 2017 timeframe.  But as EWC is the volatile part of that earnings mix, it doesn't look like at this point that that – that EWC would allow us to make it back into that particular range. However, you never know. Stranger things have happened. And 2017, in particular, is still pretty far away. So, we wouldn't say we can't make it, but right now, as we look at our view, we are probably just below that level."
"Got it. Thank you. And I guess just on the gas reserves and rate base conversation, can you maybe just share a little more detail on how those two processes are going to work? And what you guys have from an overall annual natural gas burn rate?","In terms of – Dan, it's Theo – in terms of how the process works, I mean, we have the pilot program Leo mentioned in Louisiana, and we'll be ﬁling comments relative to that this month. And that will progress based on the Commission's directive, in terms of how they see that – how that moves along. At this point, we're just, we're exploring our options. And the timing of that is going to depend on the form of the investment, and again, how that plays through the regulatory process. In terms of gas burn today, I'm not certain I can tell you exactly how much it is. We'll probably just have to follow-up and give you that information.  I would just say, Dan, I mean, obviously given the nature of our ﬂeet, our gas burn is pretty signiﬁcant. I don't, oﬀ the top of my head, have how many Bs a day we're      talking about, but it's trivial.     Well, I'll say -- this is Drew -- I'll say it's going to be a small amount of our overall gas burn to begin with. You know we are not going to be able to jump in and hedge our entire supply, as Leo said. I mean, it's very large. I mean, we're spending in the neighborhood of $3 billion a year on gas supply – maybe a little lower, since prices are lower today. But it's a signiﬁcant amount. And so, we would be trying to carve out, at least initially, a small layer that would allow us to kind of get our feet under us and really appreciate how this is going to work through all the various operational processes, as well as regulatory processes."
"And I don't want to ask a detailed question, but I'm going to anyway. The EWC guidance for this year at $0.70 versus the $0.71 you did in the ﬁrst quarter, I know you don't want to update guidance too early, but is there a plausible case where you guys would not make money at EWC for the rest of the year?","Well, if prices went lower, yes. But I don't think that's our expectation. I think we're a little ahead of schedule through the ﬁrst quarter. And we expected to earn a little bit more. But, as we've gone along, the nature of that EWC business in particular has gotten highly seasonal and anchored towards really the winter timeframe. And so, while we do expect to make a little bit more money at EWC over the course of the year, the bulk of their earnings at this point are completed through the ﬁrst quarter."
"Got it. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
"Yeah, hi. Hi. Good morning.",Morning.
"Just a little more ﬂavor this morning on the natural gas pilot. And I guess you mentioned both Louisiana and Mississippi. Could you maybe give us a sense of just rather than an amount of gas, just potential investment size? Is this tens of millions? Hundreds of millions? Billions? Just some rough idea of potential scale of these investments.","This is Drew. I'll – it's certainly not in the billions at this point. And tens of millions is probably too small. So it's going to be, I'll say, in the neighborhood of $200 million to $300 million maybe initially in that range. It could be a little higher or lower but something like that -- if we decide to move forward with this."
Is that just Louisiana? Or is that both states?,"No, that would probably be both states. I mean, Louisiana would be the bulk of it. Mississippi's fuel burn is considerably smaller than Louisiana."
"Okay. And just – like you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have no impairments on EWC, as of the current quarter I just – why did you even mention that? Is there something that you are particularly focused on there, to bring that up?","Well, it's something that we get questions on from time to time. And because of that, we think it's something that's been on investors' minds. So, we wanted to just make sure we were forthright with a discussion about it, and make sure that everybody knew that it is on our radar screen. It's something that we are paying close attention to. That was the primary reason for it."
"Okay. And just lastly in the kind of overall utility outlook that you've provided through 2017, would you say the improved Arkansas environment was kind of assumed in there? Or would you say it's a potential kind of upside to the utility plan?","Hi, Steve. This is Theo. I mean, clearly, as we laid out our plan, we had an expectation about improving our results in Arkansas. And so I would say yes, if you look at the growth that we see, there are primarily three main elements, especially when you move from 2015 to 2016 in the utility. So it's the sales growth; it's regulatory improvements in Arkansas; and clearly, it's the Union investment. And so, we did have an expectation around that.     In terms of whether there is upside or not will be more deﬁned as we go forward, and we move through the process of the case itself, and then to build the case. But we had an expectation to try and improve results in Arkansas as we laid forth – a we laid our plans out for 2016 and 2017."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you, Steve.    Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open."
"Hey, guys, two questions. One, any plans regarding, both near-term and long-term, regarding the holding company level debt? Meaning is your anticipation to leave that debt there? Is your anticipation to make sure all of it is ﬁnanced long-term and there's no short-term? You've done a good chunk of that already. Is the goal to kind of pay that down, so whenever EWC has cash ﬂow, you can kind of get back to the mode, like you used to do a number of years ago, of being able to use EWC's free cash to buy back stock? Like, how are you thinking about short-term, one or two years? And then a three to ﬁve year cycle about what to do with the parent debt.","All right. I'm not sure where to start on that one, Michael. There's a lot going on in that question. In terms of the capital structure, I talked a little bit in my prepared remarks about the parent ﬁnancing that we have coming up. I think we're going to do the ﬁxed rate notes. We're going to reﬁnance those this fall or maybe even much earlier than that.  We have a lot of ﬁnancing activity going on, on the second half of the year, with the parent note coming due, the anticipation of the Union acquisition, and the ﬁnancings that will have to go on with that at the utility level. And then, because of the ELL-EGSL combination, we have to redo revolvers for those businesses. And while we are at it, we're going to go ahead and redo the entire thing. So we're going to probably do that a little earlier in anticipation of the ability to close that combination.  So, those are the main activity things. In terms of going forward, we are continuing to anticipate that we are going to carry that short-term debt for a while, and that it's going to continue to ﬂoat. So the short-term rates haven't moved too much, and certainly we have a lot of exposure to interest rates on the pension side of our books. So, any movement on that side is balanced pretty well on the interest rate side for     the roughly $1.5 billion of short-term debt that we have. So we wouldn't anticipate that we would change that any time soon.  And as we think about the overall parent debt capital structure, including both the short-term variable and the ﬁxed rate piece, we're still targeting that 18% to 20% parent debt to total debt ratio. And so we're going to probably be a little bit above that this year as we close through the, I guess the Union deal. We'll probably draw a little bit more on that.  But over the next few years, we do see it trending down and provided we don't come up with a whole bunch more investment opportunities. So, I think those are the kind of the main things. And we're going to continue to kind of maintain our capital structure at the parent level for the time being as it is today. But obviously, we'll be looking for other ideas and opportunities as we go along."
Got it.,"And I don't know if I answered everything that you had in your question, Michael, but?"
"No. That's perfect. An unrelated question. A while ago, a year or a year and a half ago, there was a lot of discussion about Palisades in terms of operating performance, NRC oversight, a handful of other things. Can you just kind of touch base on that a little bit? It's been a while since I think you've talked about it, so I just want a sanity check to what's out there.","Sure. Michael, this is Bill. Look, Palisades has been running extremely well, above a 90% capacity factor. The one issue we have out there is the embrittlement issue, which is still under review by the NRC. We expect clarity on that by this summer. And again I think based on our own analysis, we really do not believe there's any issues there, and hope that that will get veriﬁed in July. But no, Palisades is back on track and operating very, very well."
"Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Thanks, Michael.         Thanks.  Operator   Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open."
"Hey good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.    Morning."
"Just a quick one back on sales growth, I'm afraid. I was just curious on slide 5, where you talk about existing large customers down largely on outages. But you know it would have been up absent outages. How signiﬁcant was the outage piece? And can you just size that relative to the delays you saw on the new customer stuﬀ?","Yes, Jonathan, this is Theo. I think I mentioned, as part of the ﬁrst question, roughly, in terms of where we landed versus our expectation, it was approximately half and half. About half of it was really due to timing of new and expansion projects, and half was really due to one-time unexpected issues or outages with some of our existing customers."
"Okay, great. That was it. Thank you.","Thank you, Jonathan.    Operator  Thank you. And in interest of time our last question will come from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Your line is now open."
"Thank you. My Arkansas question got answered, so let me move to Mississippi with just one question. Is the new law, I mean pre- the new law, you can make an       investment in infrastructure. Let's say the development didn't happened and the commission could come back with a used-and-useful argument and disallow that investment. Is that what this eliminates?","Charles, when you speak to the new law, I assume you're talking about what was passed recently as it relates to the ability to make investment in anticipation of economic growth."
Yes. The thing you referred to on the ﬁrst page of your release.,"Yes. I think it, really more than anything, gave clarity as it relates to how you can make that investment in anticipation of that growth. But I think it really goes to what's happening in Mississippi in terms of improving relationships, and their recognition of the importance of economic development and growth, economic growth in the state. Again, the clarity I think was more around, you can make that investment and there's an expectation, we should have an expectation that that investment would be viewed as necessary, and from a rate recovery perspective, make it less controversial."
Okay. That was it. Thank you.,"And Charles, I'll just add what we've been doing over the last couple of years is working really in partnership with all of our stakeholders in each jurisdiction. And that partnership is around what it is that we are all jointly trying to accomplish. We are all jointly trying to accomplish economic prosperity in the communities that we serve, and that they regulate or that they have administrative control over, if you are the governor or what have you.  So we spend a lot of time on that overall objective. And that objective being to promote economic development and prosperity in those economies. That has resulted in a better understanding between us all about what our objectives are that we share and what processes that we can utilize that we can agree on. So, at the end of the day, legislation and laws aren't all going to show up the way we would design them. They are going to come up the way that, jointly, between us, Governors, legislative bodies, economic development agencies and regulators, believe is in the best interest of those – of their jurisdictions and our customers.  And so what I think you've seen in Arkansas, what you've seen in Mississippi, what we've seen with the proceedings around capacity and transmission distribution riders in Texas, what we hope to see as we continue to go forward in Louisiana is, things that work to promote job creation and economic prosperity and better communities where we serve. That's really all we've done. But it should turn out well     for us if it turns out well for the communities. And I think that's what you're seeing in those types of legislative eﬀorts and regulatory outcomes that we've seen over the last couple of years."
"Okay. Thanks, Leo. But it certainly gives you more conﬁdence in your 2017 outlook for the utilities in – what's happened in Arkansas and Mississippi recently?","It absolutely does. And the reason that conﬁdence is important is, if you think about what is happening in all these jurisdictions, in Arkansas, we have a major customer coming online. We have a steel mill that we provide a lot of electricity to in Louisiana. We've got signiﬁcant growth along the Gulf Coast as it relates to the petrochemical business.  And in Texas, we see not only the industrial expansion, but in Texas, we see signiﬁcant commercial and residential loan growth as well. And we have to be ready, willing and able to serve that load, and do that while we continue with the process we started on 10 years ago of refreshing the generating portfolio, and continuing to meet an ever-evolving set of reliability requirements as it relates to transmission.  And so, the conﬁdence is good, because it gives us the ability to deploy that capital more quickly and in ways that better meet those customers' needs. So it's a win-win for everybody."
