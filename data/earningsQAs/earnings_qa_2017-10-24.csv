Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Julien."
"Hi, so just wanted to follow up -- ﬁrst oﬀ, congratulations on Arkansas. I wanted to just see if -- what your latest thoughts were about earning your ROE there? Obviously, you want to delay some of the conversations on more longer-term strategic thinking till EEI, but at least right now what are you thinking your trajectory is towards earning your ROE, again, assuming the current settlement stays, obviously there could be some shift still, but at least status quo expectations?","Julien, this is Rod. Good morning. I think our point of view hasn't changed in terms of what we've stated in the past and that is, we've reﬂected both the rate case in FRP settlements in Arkansas, the operation of both the cap and the true-up mechanism such that by '19 we expect to approach our allowed ROE in Arkansas. So, all of that is reﬂected in our existing outlooks."
Right. Absolutely. But '18 is still something of a transition year?,I think that's fair.
"Okay, excellent. And then turning to Louisiana, obviously, I'm looking for action here pretty shortly. Can you talk about what the speciﬁc impact on the transmission tracker you're talking about there, what would that mean in terms of your ability to earn and how meaningful is that within the scheme of what you're talk about there across the various points?","Yeah. When you think about what we're seeking in the FRP renewal, that transmission tracker is really for us a recognition that the lion's share of the transmission spend that we have line of sight on is in front of us and a forward-looking mechanism would reduce the likelihood of lag for us. And our expectation is that, that would allow us to earn and sustain our ROEs over the period.  And so, we're in the middle of negotiations with the parties in Louisiana and they have the same line of sight that we do on our capital outlook. And we are hopeful that they'll respond favorably to the approach."
"Excellent. Very quickly on the decommissioning trust true-up or to the extent to which is necessary, I mean, what's the timeline do you think that you could actually get this resolved in terms of thinking about any kind of bigger arrangement to deal with that? Is that a -- shall we say near-term opportunity, if you could kind of summarize that -- apologies, if I didn't hear it clearly in the remarks.","Hi, Julien. This is Drew. I don't think I put a speciﬁc timeline out there in the remarks. And with the movement of Palisades to 2022, it gives a lot more room to ﬁnalize that. We are moving forward on Vermont Yankee. So that piece of it will be ﬁnalized hopefully next year, but the other parts on Pilgrim Palisades and Indian Point might take a little bit longer.     That doesn't mean we won't make progress on it though. We are continuing to -- when I'm talking about longer, it could be longer for a transaction or something of that nature. But we are making progress on our own sort of go-it-alone strategies and other things around how we're going to defuel the plant and things like that. Expectations around those things, we could ﬁrm up as early as next year if they continue to make progress on our overall objective."
Excellent. Thank you all very much.,"All right. Thanks, Julien.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please?"
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
"I have a question about the number you gave, weather and the $0.25 negative versus '18 positive. And I think if I heard you right, you said the cooling degree across the service territory was 16% below normal. And my question -- when we look at the sort of real cooling degree data, it just looks much closer to normal than that. So I'm curious, are you sharing an index that includes humidity or other factors or just what are we missing there?","No, that's weighted on our speciﬁc, you know, diﬀerent cities in our service territory, Jonathan. So, that is -- it is just raw cooling degree data, we're not factoring humidity or other things in there at this point."
"Okay. Well, that's helpful to know. So, just pure CDDs [ph] outside your comp, that was my question?",Yeah. But it is weighted by various cities in our jurisdiction and relative size of those (inaudible).
Got it. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your question please.
"Hi, thanks. So, ﬁrstly, on the sales growth at the Utility level, just clearly you've had some improvement there. So wanted to understand, now that you're tracking now above the plan, does that mean that 2018 will be beneﬁted by that? Is that beneﬁt going to ﬂow through to 2018 as well or do you see that more as a 2017 impact in terms of retail sales?","Yeah. Praful, this is Rod. Good morning. I don't believe that the volatility we're seeing whether it'd be positive or negative in '17 changes our point of view that -- at the end of the day, we still see, as Drew alluded to earlier, our growth driven by industrials with residential sort of being ﬂat to negative. So I think the short answer is no. We don't see that is changing our point of view."
"Got you. Understood. And then on slide 35, on the EWC side, the hedging price has obviously gone up, but I'm assuming that's purely because of the PPA of Palisades. Is that right?","That's correct, Praful."
"Got you. So -- and the EBITDA impact that you also mentioned for EWC which has also gone up from a guidance perspective, is that -- that increase look quite substantial in the 100 million range. Is that also just Palisades or are there other impacts there as well that impacted your guidance for EWC?","No, that's primarily driven by Palisades. There are other minor things going on with the other plants, but what you're seeing, the eﬀect that you're seeing is Palisades."
"Got you. And just ﬁnally just clarifying on the decommissioning side. You mentioned that your goal is still maybe cash neutral on the EWC side through the wind down through 2022 incorporating some contributions that you expect on decommissioning. Just wanted to understand, have you talked about what you expect to be contributing into decommissioning at this point, as in what is the hole you expect to be ﬁlling?","No, we haven't disclosed that that yet, Praful, since we are in ongoing commercial discussions with third parties on the potential decommissioning of those facilities. So, we haven't disclosed those, but we did change the number that we put out this time slightly. Before we hadn't -- we just sort of given you a general idea of where we were relative to our goal and this time we gave you a more speciﬁc number.  We're about 100 million out. And so, we are continuing to work that down and we are making progress. And I think we probably do have line of sight to close the gap, we just haven't been able to do that in our ﬁnancials just yet. And when we do, that will be cash, it should be available to the Parent and be able to reduce some of the Parent debt or be reinvested into the Utility business."
Got you. Thanks. That's very helpful and look forward to catching up at EEI. Thanks so much.,"Right. Thanks, Praful.    Thanks, Praful.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Burke from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?"
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning.       Good morning, Stephen."
"Congratulations on the progress in Arkansas. I wondered if you could just speak a little bit further, Leo, I know in prepared remarks you talked about the scope a little bit, but I wasn't completely clear on the exact scope of this recent settlement. Could you just speak to that in terms of nuclear costs, particularly?","Sure, it's Rod. Good morning. When you think about the settlement, what we reached a settlement on with the AG and the other interveners was solely around the NSP costs. If you think about the 130 million or so that -- it was a subject of our '17 ﬁling with the '18 forward looking test year, the nuclear costs represented about 53 million of that.  And so, we resolved with the parties on the settlement of just the NSP or the nuclear related spend. And we also got the testimony from the APSC staﬀ. And so that portion of the FRP, at least as it relates to the interveners is resolved with no outstanding issues. What remains is the rest of the non-nuclear spend component of the formula rate plan.  And by the way, we also resolved with the parties a prior year's settlement that was already in rate. So that's really not anything incremental since we're already recovering that prior spend in rates. So between now and November 1, our objective is to resolve the remaining non-nuclear aspects of the formula rate plan and those issues of what we would consider to be normal and expected increase and debates around timing of spend, certain assets being used in useful, known in measurable for purposes of the cap, but at the end of the day, all of those issues will be resolved between now and November 1 and ultimately it will be resolved in the true-up mechanism next year to the extent that it's above that 4% cap.  So, nothing out of the ordinary. This is a signiﬁcant resolution with the nuclear spend and everything else is what we consider to be the basic blocking and tackling of closing out the FRP."
"Well, that's great progress, Rod. And just, if I can understand the staﬄess [ph] party to this settlement, their testimony I viewed as constructive, but can you help me understand the intersection between staﬀ and the settlement?","Sure. The staﬀ is not -- was not a party to the speciﬁc settlement. Staﬀ of course, representing their point of view to the commission. And so, both -- the settlement that we've reached with the AG and the JRA, I know them as the interveners, so the AG and the hospitals and industrials, that will all be presented to the Arkansas Public Service Commission, who is the ultimate arbiter of all of the settlements.     And so, the staﬀ is one voice and certainly a signiﬁcant one from our vantage point that gets presented to the commission, essentially identifying any outstanding issues that may remain. From our point of view, resolution with the interveners, with the supported testimony from the staﬀ gives us conﬁdence that we provide a pretty strong case for settlement to the APSC."
That's very clear. That's all I had. Thank you.,"Thank you, Stephen.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your question, please?"
"Yeah, hi, good morning. So, just on the 2018, you mentioned that your forecast assumes conservative assumptions including ﬂat sales, is that ﬂat overall sales and are you just being conservative or is there a reason that you think it will be ﬂat overall sales?","Hi, Steve, this is Drew. Couple of things there, one is we haven't really changed our outlook for 2018 all that much. We'd previously seen industrial sales kind of move out. So, we weren't anticipating much in terms of industrial sales. So, that's kind of ﬂat and we're anticipating overall ﬂat as well, but our residential and commercial hasn't really changed. It's been -- '17 has caught up a little bit. And so, it's tracking, as we said back where we were anticipating it previously at the beginning of the year. So, now that our sales in 2018 for residential, commercial are the same, but starting point has changed from '17. So it's basically ﬂat, you know, residential, commercial, industrial in total."
"Okay, great. That was it. Thank you.","Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?"
"Yeah, hi, guys, just on Entergy Louisiana, your ﬁling for the formula rate plan reset [ph], and when would those new rates go into eﬀect, is it still kind of the September timeframe or would it be before that in 2018?","Hi, Michael, it's Rod. You're right, it's September '18. And that's just the reason why we're seeking to get the settlement, if we are going to reach a settlement to get that issue resolved by the December or early ﬁrst quarter of '18. So that the Public Service Commission and their staﬀ has the ability to review, approve and comment on so that rates could go into eﬀect by September '18. That's the normal rate making path that I think Leo made reference to in his comments."
"Got it. And in the current FRP ﬁling where you didn't request a change, that's because you earned within the ROE band. I'm just trying to think about whether you would anticipate needing a sizable rate increase to get to the midpoint or you're kind of already closed to it there when you think about your 2017 expectations at Entergy Louisiana?","Well, we certainly have a request for an increase to the midpoint, that number is not public. But we do have a point of view that the interveners are working through on getting to the midpoint, but, Michael, it's not public at this point."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Thanks, Michael.    Thanks, Michael.    Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your question, please?"
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shahriar."
"Most of my questions were answered. Just, Drew, one thing I'm not clear on is on the sale of the decommissioning trust funds. What's sort of driving the complexity that's causing sort of the sales to get somewhat pushed out, especially since you've got sort of a benchmark deal already with Vermont Yankee? And then just follow-up is, can you conﬁrm if there is any other buyers out there outside of the Northstar JV?","Yeah, so, Shahriar, those are good questions. So the -- there are a couple of things driving the timeline, one, it's ﬁrst of a kind, and so any kind of ﬁrst-of-a-kind transaction is going to take a little longer. And the second one, we are working on creating a market here. And so, you alluded to any other buyers outside of the Northstar JV and the answer is yes. There are a few, but it's taken a while to get everybody up to speed, give them access to material, give them access to plans to make sure that they have a good sense of what they're trying to accomplish and so forth.  And so, as we are going through this ﬁrst-of-a-kind transaction, we are trying to build a market for us to sell into. So it's taking us a little bit longer than we anticipated. But having said all that, we are ﬁnding some robust interest. I mean, I'm not saying there's 10 buyers out there, but there is four or ﬁve people that have serious capabilities and serious interests that we are looking at. And so, the market is coming along, but it is taking us a little while to get it all together."
