Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Jeremy."
"Thanks. Just wanted to start oﬀ with the 2,500 megawatt add in RFPs. Just what is your expectation for utility owned opportunities there versus PPA?","Hey. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. Good question. Our current expectation is at least 50% or better, from an own perspective and that's what assumed in our outlook."
And does --,"That is consistent with where we were. Sorry, Jeremy -- sorry Jeremy, this Drew, it's consistent with where we were at Analyst Day."
Got it. And just I represent the opportunity that this could be a bit higher.,"Sure. That's certainly something that we're looking at recall that a lot of our investments on renewables are in the back half of the decade. So, we certainly expect to see beneﬁts from IRA in that period. And we'll talk more about that at       Analyst Day, but we do think that the IRA provides upside, as well as reducing the need for tax equity partnerships on that front."
"Got it. That's helpful. And just if I could ask about U.S. Gulf Coast industrial activity expansion, just wondering what cadence do you see for that growth as far as LNG export capacity of the factors. What timeframe do you see that ramping up? And how do you think about the secondary impact, where you're bringing kind of more and better jobs into the area and what that does for your residential customers?","That's a great question, Jeremy. It's Drew. I'll start oﬀ and then Kimberly or Rod can add to the that. But it's what we laid out on Analyst Day with 6% compounded annual growth through the ﬁve-year period. There's a big chunk of that coming in around 24. And that's -- I think that's probably the biggest step-up in our forecast, but it's still consistent with what we laid out at that point and we see it continue to be robust. In terms of jobs and it certainly will be helpful for jobs in our area. We continue to allow our customer, our residential and commercial customer bases to grow. It's not as big as it was 30 years ago, honestly because of the amount of automation and other things that are inherent in modern industrial facilities, but that also gives us the opportunity to be much more competitive on the global stage. So, I think those -- there are trade-oﬀs in those pieces. But that's one of the things that makes our region very attractive. I don't know, Rod, if you have anything to add to that.    No. I think that makes the point, the message we sent at Analyst Day around the back half of the decade representing the lion's share of the growth and even at Analyst Day, we showed what sectors we thought would populate that growth as well, tying in our industrial expansion with the electriﬁcation and ESG concerns of our customers. So, we ought to leave it at that."
That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Thanks, Jeremy.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim. Your question, please."
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
"Maybe, just starting oﬀ around your earnings guidance. Just -- like I guess looking at your own run rate increase and interest rate headwinds for '23. How are you sort of thinking about the contingency and plan levers on oﬀsets et cetera, I guess how does sort of this inﬂationary environment kind of change your planning parameters versus the analyst expectations, especially as we're looking to bridge into next year with a sort of a $0.30 band at the top and bottom end?","Thanks, Shar for that question. I'll start with your O&M question. The drivers for '22 were really around our ﬂex levers, which includes both pull-forwards and one-time items like the enhanced customer assistance program that we talked about earlier this year. The pull-forwards give us room to pull-forward things from future years and the de-risk future periods. The other impact from '22 was inﬂation as you noted and we were able to cover that in '22 through the increased weather in volume that we had in the ﬁrst three quarters of the year. That said, we have included a level of inﬂation in our forecast for 2023 and we expect to meet our outlooks as said. And we'd cover that with continuous improvement opportunities that we've been working on. As it relates to your interest rate question, I think at Analyst Day, the outlook was about 5%, we -- or 5.25%, we have increased the interest rate expense to about a little less than 6% on the long-term debt and about 5.25% on the shorter- term debt and that's included in our outlooks.  That said, our treasury team has done a lot of work over the last few years to help mitigate exposure to potential rising interest rates by reﬁnancing long-term debt in the periods of lower interest rates to help us oﬀset in future periods.    Got it. And Shar, I'll just add one thing on that last piece. We have a lot of cash expected to come in. Kimberly mentioned that we are intending to exercise the equity forwards and then we have the securitizations, which we should be ﬁnishing up over the next several months. Those two things should alleviate some borrowing needs in the next near term, I should say."
"Okay, perfect. And then just to last maybe, just shifting to ﬁnancing, I mean obviously, your capital growth opportunities are increasing with resiliency, hardening green tariﬀs et cetera. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about more accretive ways to ﬁnance this growth in this current really challenging capital markets environment, I mean, there's been some press sort of highlighting that you could be looking to raise about 2 billion through a minority sale of your utilities combined into a holding company excluding Texas. I guess, any sort of general comments here --     any sense on timing? Is there a process that started? I mean, you certainly won't be the ﬁrst utility that's looking to optimize an asset in lieu of traditional ﬁnancing?","Yes. I'll hand this over to Kimberly to address it ﬁrst.      Yes. Thanks, Shar. There's no new news on this front. I know we had talked to you about the value diﬀerence between private capital and public capital markets. And to the extent that we can capitalize on that. And there's a diﬀerence there, we can be compelled to do that, but there's no new news on that front at this point."
"Okay. Got it. Figured this is Drew(cid:0)s ﬁrst CEO calls, going try to put them on the spot. Thanks, guys.",And I handed it to Kimberly very softly.
"Like if you deﬂected it perfectly. Thanks guys.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please?",
Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.,Good morning.
"On the AMT, I just wanted to check how much of an impact are you expecting once we reach 2026? I think you had in one of the slides in terms of when the corporate AMT would start impacting the business and I was wondering in the interim over the next couple of years just given that same slide, Slide 10, we're currently seeing Henry Hub forward prices, kind of in the 450 range or above over the next few years. Is there an AMT impacted all in like '24', '25, that's oﬀset by the nuclear PTC level. Wondering if you just compare those two impacts? Thanks.","Sure. Good question. As the slide indicates, we don't expect a corporate minimum tax until 2026, that's not being oﬀset in '24, '25. If you think about how that's being calculated, it's a three-year historical average and then we can replace book depreciation with tax depreciation. So that enables us to not expect to have that minimum tax until 2026.  That said, to your point on the graph on the right, we do think that we have signiﬁcant opportunity on the nuclear PTCs. But it is dependent on the gas and the power prices and where those are at the time, but those do start coming in '23 and '24. And so we'd expect those to come in earlier than that corporate minimum tax and we'll work with our regulators to provide beneﬁts to our customers, but also oﬀset the eﬀects of that corporate minimum tax when we do have exposure to that."
"Okay, great. Thanks. It's helpful. And then on the upcoming Louisiana resilience ﬁling, I was just wondering if there's any feedback or initial conversations from relevant stakeholders in the state around the importance, the priority of kicking oﬀ this work and what the appetite might be?","Hi, it's Rod. The short answer is the stakeholders in the State of Louisiana, all have expressed an interest in resiliency. They certainly understand the compliance after several stakeholder engagements between reliability and resiliency. The commission in and of itself obviously is always going to be interested in how we face it and certainly, given the sensitivities around the current economic environment. How does this ultimately impact customer bills, but I think the -- as was stated in Drew's opening comments, it's very clear that the lessons that we learned from next era is also highlighting the work that we've been doing to get alignment around the need for accelerated resiliency spending, obviously decisions going to ultimately play out through the resiliency ﬁling when the LPSC sets a procedural schedule. But the homework that we have done to-date, all the way up to and including the most recent lessons learned from our friends in Florida, all informing our bullish point of view around the need to do this. We're not in a position to tell you in advance would get ahead of our regulators, but we do believe, we're making good progress on getting a line amongst our stakeholder group."
"Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Thanks, David.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Your question, please."
"Hey, team. Good morning and congrats to your ﬁrst call and Kimberly to you as well.",Thank you.
"Yes, of course. Well, my other questions have been answered. I was just wondering if you could update if there's an update to share on the SERI settlement. I know the -- you have this settlement with Mississippi, but anything there that we should focus on as we get into the year-end or next step there.","It's Rod again. No new news that I can communicate publicly. I can share aﬃrmatively that we are actively engaged with relevant stakeholders in trying to confect a settlement and ﬁnd common ground. And I can only report that work is ongoing, but nothing public."
"Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thank you.","Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America. Your question, please."
Hi. Good morning. Thank you.,"Good morning, Paul."
"If I could just follow up on Shar's question a little bit and thanks for the details on the O&M. If you could just break down that I believe, a $0.60 higher than the original guidance basically, how much is that acceleration versus more of the inﬂation in the organic pieces of that?","Yes. Good question. There's a number of both pull-forwards as well as inﬂationary items. It's hard to get to the speciﬁc number. But from an inﬂation perspective, we're seeing that more in -- you see it in fuel, you see it in chemical-type costs, and then we see it on the capital side and less so in the labor market side. But we have included on an ongoing level of inﬂation. And then if you think about the ﬂex side, we have long talked about ﬂexing up, when there are opportunities from -- volume or other things that happen in the business and that's really what you're seeing on the other side opportunities to spend, where we can support our customers and our stakeholders.    Yes. And Paul, this is Drew. I'll add that the inﬂation eﬀects. They are touching us. We're not immune to that like the rest of the industry, the places where we're seeing it start to creep in on the labor side or Kimberly mentioned the commodity-type eﬀects. And so we are also seeing it, when I would say in commodity services areas. So, vegetation is a big area, where we have seen inﬂation. And so we have been ramping up as she mentioned our continuous improvement eﬀorts to oﬀset that, because the inﬂation piece doesn't go away easily. And so there are continuous improvement eﬀorts are ramping up to oﬀset that over the next, however, long we need it. And we're ﬁnding actually good success in the oﬀsets. So, we're very comfortable that we're going to be able to manage through the inﬂation that we've seen so far."
"Okay, great. Understand there and staying on the hot topic of inﬂation. Just as you think about the next Arkansas FRP ﬁling, do you think that this is probably another one that's going to be at the rate change cap or do you think you can manage a little bit below that level?","Yes. The -- we have been working in the Arkansas area, the continuous improvement will help us in that space to reduce cost. We certainly look at and watch to see, try to stay under those caps. So that we're both managing the aﬀordability for customers, as well as obviously creating value for all of our stakeholders will, but we believe that we will continue to work through the inﬂation and manage that with continuous improvement. The speciﬁc number that we would ﬁle in Arkansas next year would still -- is still being developed, but we'll certainly take into considerations of inﬂation.  And we're a little over the cap for what's coming for the formula rate plan this year. So, we are above the cap already there."
"Yes, yes. Okay, understood. Thank you both and see you, soon.","All right. Thanks, Paul.  Operator   Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please."
"Hey. Thank you for taking my question and again, congrats not just to Drew and Kimberly, but obviously to Leo, as it's been a long time from coming over from Indiana. I have a couple of easy questions. One is, your demand growth especially on the C&I side has been really, really healthy, not just this year, but last couple of years. In this quarter, we saw a turn and residential demand growth. You've proposed Orange County in Texas, but just curious, even though you're adding a lot of renewable in lots of the jurisdictions, what your thoughts are around in some of the other jurisdiction to any need for any more conventional generation?","Yes. That's a good question. We do plan out over a long-term and we're looking for growth -- we watch the growth that's occurring. Our plans include a signiﬁcant amount of renewable investments as you suggested, I think we have 14 gigawatt to 17 gigawatt hours in our -- over the longer period in investments. We will add baseload generation, smaller units to the extent that they are needed to support reliability and ensure that we continue to meet the needs of our customers. But near-term, Orange County is the project that's on the plan.    And certainly, I think, Orange County is an example of how we would approach it with hydrogen capability (inaudible), because of the long-term need to make a potential transition or a targeted transition, I should say to clean energy, where our customers are taking us.  So that would be part of it, I think, Michael in the near term, we don't have any need for incremental capacity that can oﬀset that. But certainly, if the demand -- if the energy demand accelerates, then we would certainly need to look at that. And right now, I think we're looking at sort of the back end of this decade is where we start to see the need for additional capacity either from storage in some form or perhaps natural gas converting to hydrogen over the long term."
"Got it. And then one unrelated follow-up. Can you -- lots of really positive things happening in Louisiana. The securitization looks like it's going pretty smoothly, we'll have a last step or two there. It'll be interesting to watch the grid resiliency docket. Just curious though, can you remind us what your revenue request was for the formula rate plan versus what's been authorized in the formula rate plan there and     just in general, how you're thinking about getting Louisiana closer to earning authorized rates of return?","Yes. So, you're referring the fact that we've sort of been at the bottom of our end and in the formula rate plan. (inaudible) Michael."
"Either the bottom or in some periods not at the bottom, it depends how long you look.","Right, right. Well, I think we continue to work with the retail regulators around options to be to get more eﬃcient recovery particularly as we begin to ramp up things like resilience and our resilience ﬁling, you'll see that we have requests for more contemporaneous cost recovery. We have put in place more eﬃcient riders for transmission and distribution and investments in Louisiana. We'll need to get those extended. But those are the kinds of tools that we have been using to help manage the lag that we've seen in Louisiana, in particular."
"So, if I look at your EPS guidance over the next couple of years, because this assume that Louisiana at some point in that timeframe and have to kind of help her out gets closer to the midpoint of the range?","Yes. So, it certainly seems, I think the last year of the FRP is next year's ﬁling. And so we'd have to go through a new either rate case or a renewable of that FRP and we'd work with the commission to get outcomes that support the needs of the business. And so that's what we would be planning for in our outlooks."
"Meaning your outlook assumes you're not at the low end of the band, you're back towards the middle or does it assume kind of what you've delivered over the last couple of years.",I think I'd have to look speciﬁcally what it assumes. But it certainly assumes that we work constructively with our regulator in order to move us further up in that band.    And I don't think of assuming any new mechanisms that certainly pop up in the forecast. We have -- we are assuming that we have the existing mechanisms in place.       But we will need to get better mechanisms in order to hit all of the ﬁnancial targets that we need to have particularly the credit that we are targeting going forward.
"Understood, and thank you. Lots of things improving in Louisiana over the last ﬁve years to seven years in terms of regulation and look forward to seeing this on a go- forward basis as well. Thanks, Drew.","Thank you, Michael.    Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Your question, please."
"Good morning Drew, Good morning Kimberly. How are you?",Good morning.
"Congratulations on the oﬃcial New Orleans, I guess, as of yesterday, most of my questions have been asked. But just a couple from me. So, going back to Rod's comments on the Louisiana resiliency ﬁling and lessons were learned from Hurricane Ian and I guess, one of the lessons learned was the system did very well. But they were parts of it obviously that didn't perform as well and there's been some discussions, I guess, in Florida around undergrounding those portions of the system that are higher risk. Has that entered sort of the conversation in Louisiana yet or can you provide some color context around that?","Sure, It's Rod speaking. The short answer is, yes. All of the above is part of the analysis and you wouldn't be surprised to hear us say the conversation -- we expect the conversation and go towards cost beneﬁt and risk reward. As you think about the location of where the risks of high winds versus high water shows up, it's diﬀerent depending upon what portion of the region you're talking about. But in Louisiana, they're deﬁnitely taking into account the beneﬁts of underground, in which historically has been -- the beneﬁt has been that the frequency outages with underground facilities is lower. But when there is some type of disruption, the duration is longer that is after you tend to overcome the initial upfront cost of undergrounding, which in our service territory has historically been cost prohibitive. What's diﬀerent now given some of the call it, the positive recency bias with storm experience, we're -- and certainly some of the cost -- potential cost improvements and beneﬁts of undergrounding, it is part of the conversations."
"Got it. That's right. Thank you. And then maybe, one just on LNG expansion missing some softening in LNG prices, I think that probably has more to do with whether in Europe than anything else. But I know it's a days, are you still seeing a lot of interest there as you touched on this a little bit. But what interests speciﬁcally you are seeing around maybe use of electric drives for future projects and putting renewable energy into those electric drives to the extent possible to sort of make proﬁle future projects green.","Yes. It's at the core of those are the conversations we're actually having with LNG customers. We noted the recent earnings call for energy transfer on Lake Charles LNG project, where they're spending the gamut in consideration of the electric drives, gas compression, as well as a carbon capture. But across the landscape, we're seeing the expected acceleration of development of the LNG projects and the service territory, and we remain bullish as are our customers notwithstanding the current economic environment. I think, Drew alluded to some of the structural beneﬁts or advantages that those customers have. And that's continuing to show up, not just in the expansion, but also in the ESG components of the LNG expansion as well.    And Ross, I'll just add that theme around the LNG with electric drives and having a cleaner product is not unique to LNG. And we're seeing that in other industrial processes, where folks is -- particularly, if you're putting in new facilities. They're trying to electrify as much as possible. Some of the existing facilities will electrify over top of it. If anybody's putting anything new, whether it's in metals or LNG, or petro-chem or whatever they are looking to see if they can electrify those industrial processes that normally probably would have been handled through fossil fuels. So that's an ongoing thing that we're seeing across a broad spectrum of industrial processes."
"That's fantastic, Drew. Thank you and see you all in a couple of weeks.","Great. Thanks, Ross."
Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line comes from the line of Sophie Karp from KeyBanc. Your    question please.,
"Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Sorry to go back to SERI a little bit here maybe a from a diﬀerent angle. It's now up to a three or four slides in your presentation. You guys given any thought to maybe a some sort of strategic -- some more strategic solution to this situation around this asset rather than mitigating or trying to set all these dockets one by one. Maybe, it's a strategic solution or some overarching regulatory solution. There's a global settlement of all of it like is there any ideas you can share that you may be had?","Sure, Sophie. This is Drew. I'll tackle that certainly, the settlement Rod referenced the settlement that we have a Mississippi and we're in conversations with others to see if we can ﬁnd a global settlement. Prior to the work that we're doing right now, up FERC and all the diﬀerent proceedings that we have. We went, I don't know a couple of decades without signiﬁcant litigation around SERI and I would expect that once we are through this, it will kind of go back to that natural state. We'll have to see. But certainly, a strategic alternative around with that is something that we consider, but we would not have an option around that until we get through the litigated settlement.  And so if we are able to get through the litigation and then we could consider something like that. But that's -- if we go back to a normal run rate, I don't think that would be the best option for us. So, we'll have to wait and see how this develops, but certainly until we get through the current conversations up at the FERC, we wouldn't be able to go forward in any way on the strategic front."
All right. Thanks for the color. That's all from me.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Bill Abler for any further remarks.    Thank you, Jonathan and thanks to everyone for participating this morning.
