Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen."
"Wanted to go through the tax reform update that you provided. For the reduction in income tax rate from 20% – to 20% from 35%, is there a sense of the magnitude of the EPS impact from that? I'm thinking really more for Parent & Other not as much for EWC. But is there an approximation that we should be thinking about in terms of the magnitude there?","Sure. Just from the tax rate change in isolation and it's probably $0.10 to $0.15, if you went from 35% to 20%. But again, as I mentioned, we would still have the NOL in place. So, we wouldn't expect any real cash impact near-term for that."
"Understood. Understood. And then, just as a follow-up in terms of thinking about EWC and its cash ﬂow over time. Would you mind just giving us your latest thoughts on what is the likely cash ﬂow proﬁle for that business through this period of time overall?","Yeah. Stephen, our expectation through kind of 2021 is that we would be able to get back to about ﬂat from a cash ﬂow perspective. And, you can see where the EBITDA is. And, net of all the special items – and that includes all – the special items include all the impairment expectations and the capital expenses and everything else. It doesn't include the NDT, which I mentioned is sensitive, which would take us a little further negative. But, we have opportunities operationally. And, in some of our balance sheet items like working through the – working capital and other things to bring us back to negative. And, as we are successfully, we could get a little higher than that."
"Understood. So, you'd be neutral by 2021. And, any guidance in terms of the cash ﬂow position prior to 2021?","I am sorry, say that again, Stephen."
"So, it sounds like you're on track to be sort of neutral by 2021. But prior to 2021, is there any guidance in terms of the cash ﬂow position for EWC's earning sort of 2017 through 2020?","2017 through 2020? I think this year we'll probably be a negative cash ﬂow year, because we have three refueling outages in the business. And, as we move forward, it would be a little bit better than that. And then, as we get towards – we'll have expenses associated with severance and retention that we incur as each plant shuts down, I think most of that's detailed in the back, in the appendix."
Great. Thank you very much.,Thank you.    Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Praful Mehta of Citigroup. Your line is open.
"Thanks so much. Hi, guys.","Good morning, Praful.    Good morning, Praful."
"Good morning. So question ﬁrstly on the utility growth and with the Trump, growth and infrastructure plan, there seems to be lots of talk on the spend and one beneﬁt could be your service territory. So wanted to understand given you haven't really changed your utility growth proﬁle, if you expect to see anything, and if you do, how will that translate to utility growth?","Well, I'll start and then I'll let Theo or Rod jump-in. But, our growth proﬁle right now and particularly over the term that we give the outlook through 2019 is pretty set as it relates to modernization of our infrastructure across all segments of the business, whether it's generation, transmission or distribution.  And recall that a lot of what we're doing on the generation and transmission side is both catching up to a short position plus modernizing, aging and less eﬃcient infrastructure on both sides. So changes in growth proﬁle that would be caused by anything that's coming up with Trump would probably not happen fast enough to have any kind of impact on our growth strategy as it stands right now.  If we were to start to see things happen, particularly in the energy sector that started to provide a stimulus for growth or we start to see our existing customers expand or new customers show up, that would really be more of a continuation of the existing story. We've got the 3% industrial growth that we had in 2016 that we're looking at again in 2017, that just might continue that path. But that most likely would be in projects that would show outside of the 2019 timeframe."
"Got you. Thank you. The next question I had was on just the decommissioning, on slide 49 you lay out the decommissioning status and this is just, for example, Vermont Yankee trust assets are higher than the liability. But the sale of the asset was basically at no cost or no price, so I am trying to ﬁgure out how do you think about decommissioning funded status relative to your strategy to sell these assets to somebody else to decommission. Like, shouldn't there be some value in the decommissioning trust relative to the liability?","Well, this is Drew and I could just talk to the balance sheet items and what's going on there. I'll let Bill talk to the commercial element that I think is associated with your question. The trust – the liabilities and the trust, well, let me say, the liabilities are accreting over time. I am not sure I understand if there is a question in there about the liabilities, but they are accreting over time and we're seeing some expense associated with that. The trust assets and our NRC minimums are all met. The trust assets are growing at about – and we're assuming the growth around 6.25% over time.  And by the way, there is a rule change in 2018, about how much income we may recognize, because we moved mark-to-market on the equity portion of our trust. But I think that we are anticipating in our current plants, Praful that we would put some     money into the decommissioning trust we talked about that, there is some, and we're expecting to put in for both Palisades and Indian Point. But, the Pilgrim trust is pretty well funded at this point, as you can see in that table and it's at $960 million. So I'll turn it over to Bill to allow him to talk a little bit about the commercial implications of where the trusts are and how we might disposition them.    Yeah. I mean, essentially, I mean, if you take the VY deal, I mean the way it was looked at is, you've got – they've obviously, we've got our projected liabilities and if you'd compare that to what the NDT is, what we're looking at is, folks who have the capability to do this on a much more aggressive schedule and a much more eﬃcient schedule.  So while there could be a small pop oﬀ with something like VY, that is all been taken into consideration in the negotiation of the commercial deal. And if you look at what we're looking at in terms of the transaction with Pilgrim, Palisades, you're looking at one, which is over funded, one which they would look at as being underfunded. But they have the ability to kind of look at that on the combination basis. And that's why we package those together to do some – do preliminary due diligence to look at doing a very similar transaction."
"Got you. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Thanks, Praful.    Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open."
"Hey, guys. A couple of questions. First of all, Leo, you commented brieﬂy about opportunities in terms of rightsizing the corporate organization. Can you give a little bit of a detail about that in terms of how big of an opportunity from a cost saves perspective and kind of a timeline when, and how long do you think it would take you to achieve and when do you think you'd be at a more normal run rate?","Yeah, well, and I guess we're at a normal run rate right now and if you think about it, Michael, we're actually in the – and I was talking that section of my script around the nuclear corporate organizations, as well as the corporate. Corporate organization as it relates to overhead inside EWC. We are at – we are – as we've said here over the course of the last several months, we are running somewhat of a lean shop strategy, so we got that going for us to begin with as we start to ramp up to get more towards     industry benchmarks at the same point in time, the EWC shutting down. The whole point there is, we made the decision to shut down Vermont Yankee in 2014.  We started looking at the issue in terms of rightsizing the organization then with an eye towards recognizing that a lot of this stuﬀ has been in the works for a long time. From 2014 to 2021, we got a seven-year where the plants will sequentially go away and we've already started working on that organizational size. The question comes up from time-to-time about the overhead as if it's an issue, it's just not, that was the point I was trying to make."
"Okay. Super helpful. One, if you don't mind one quick follow-up. At what point like the deal with the State of New York regarding the retirement of Indian Point, and the plant retirement is 2020-2021, but there is the potential the plant could live out to 2024-2025. At what point would you know, like how does the decision making process happen in terms of the state decides or some combination of other and how early do you need to know, like at some point refueling decisions or other similar decisions have to get made, if the state decides the play it wants to operate beyond 2020?","Yeah, Michael. This is Bill. So, really the responsibility for the resource need will fall with New York ISO. So what you need to be watching for is, they will do an updated kind of load and resource study probably the second half of this year, where they'll start to incorporate the shutdown of Indian Point, as well as any other additional resources that may be coming online.  And so, that will start to paint the picture of what 2021 looks like. And so, that will look at overall capacity needs as well as speciﬁc reliability needs in terms of system security. And then, that will be updated on an annualized basis. What we're going to need to be watching for to – and the state will be watching for is that we'll have to likely make a decision sometime in second half of 2018, if we want to extend the operations of that unit.  And then, we would have to enter into negotiations with New York State, because remember that's a mutual option, we both have to agree. So obviously, they'd have to recognize the need for reliability, we'll have to ensure that we've fully recovered all of our costs."
"Got it. So, in other words, post 2020, if there is an operation it's likely under some form of PPA or some other agreement that probably looks, smells and acts a little bit like an RMR, because it's actually needed for reliability purposes.","Yes, sir. That's correct."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.","Thanks, Michael.    Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Your line is open."
"Yeah. Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Steve."
"Just didn't hear much of an update on the nuclear improvement program, could you just maybe talk about how that's progressing, any update on the kind of the cost levels that you gave before or should we just assume they're the same? And just, how do you plan to update us on how that's going kind of going on in the future?","Steve, I'd say that right now there is no update on the cost. You should assume that they are what we've outlined originally and continuing the numbers today. As far as updates, right now the nuclear strategic plan is kind of all wrapped-up in our expenditures, therein all of the guidance that you've got right now. We're beginning to see improvements in the operations or the facilities. So I think, it will just be no a regular basis and probably more by exception than anything else as far as what we'd be updating you on.  As far as where it sits in the regulatory process, as Drew mentioned, everything that we've got going on at the moment is just running through the normal regulatory processes that we've already got in place, particularly given the fact that we've put some pretty good mechanisms in place over the course of the last several years to adjust things on a regular basis.  And as you know, we're in the process of reviewing some of those costs that were in the 2017 or the 2016 ﬁled formula rate plan, there is no procedure. In Arkansas, there is no procedural schedule for that at the moment. We'd anticipate that that will get done if not before, at least, within the same context as when we make the next ﬁling of the FRP in Arkansas."
"The last point, is that, you're referring to the kind of small prudence thing that was opened up on the last, on your settlement on the ﬁling there or is that...?","Right. And really what that is, is the fact of the matter is the process is a brand new process. The formula rate plan with the forward-looking test year. And so, we're just going through the process and the Commission just wants to make sure they got it right, that's all."
"Okay. But operationally do you feel that the nuclear performance improvements are going on plan, ignoring cost, just operationally? Okay.",Both. Both. Not ignoring cost. Everything's on the plan.
"Everything is on plan. Okay. One other question, just to clarify, I know, you gave the three-year utility guidance, but the 5% to 7% that you mentioned at the beginning of the call and I think, you said something about that being some years above, some years below. What are you now kind of using as the base for that 5% to 7%?","We're still – this is Drew – we're still thinking about, sort of, I guess, you could either place, you could base it oﬀ of where we are for 2016 or if you went back to sort of an adjusted view of 2015, it would be a little bit higher than that. But either way, I mean, I think, our objective is to try and get in that range each year, although at times, it will be a little lumpier than most. So, that I think, it doesn't really matter, Steve, where you would start from is our objective. But we should be able to get in there over time."
"Right. Because I mean, obviously 2016, 2017 is below, but then I think, 2019 is well above based on your guidance. So that's what you mean by the back and forth just kind of?","That's right. That's right. If you recall, last year before we put the nuclear costs and we were expecting to be more steady in that. And now, we've got the nuclear costs in. But as time moves forward, we'd expect to get recovery of those costs and we would get back on track to our original plan. And so, that's why 2019 is still where we'd put it, I guess, a year ago. And the other – in 2017 and 2018 move down slightly, but we expect to get back on track."
"Okay. One last thing, Leo. I think, you are on the EEI Tax Committee, on the Tax Reform Committee, just maybe, any just more color on how we should think about tax reform, given the discussions that you've had and just where it might go?","Well, I mean, I think, as Drew mentioned and I think everybody else in the industry has probably mentioned, it's pretty early in the process as it relates to what's going on and the dynamics that I think will be the most determative over time or the interplays of all these diﬀerent items not only how they impact our industry, but others as well.  But, I would say that the dialogue that the industry has had with folks at the White House and on the Hill has been constructive. I think the history the industry has in terms of the way our rate regulated regimes work is understood by a large number of folks. And so, I think that we're in a position where, we're talking to the right people, we're having a lot of dialogue, everybody is doing it with a pretty aligned point of view and we hope that things constructive come about, because of it. And again, the nature of our business being rate regulated certainly does provide some nuances that are important to us that may not be important to other industries, but that's been provided for in the past when there has been tax law changes and also the fact that we're rate regulated gives us some ability to make sure that, we have rational regulation around the way the law turns out just like we do today, in terms of normalization practices and things like that."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Pete.    Operator  Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Your line is open."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Julien.    Good morning."
"Hey, just wanted to follow-up a little bit on some of the last questions here. Can you talk a little bit about some of the costs associated with EWC and how that might get allocated out in the future vis-à-vis the regulated business? It might somewhat dovetail with your talk about bringing down cost overall, but just wanted to understand, how that process plays out? And then, I got a follow-up.","Well, the way the process follows – falls out is, we have corporate organizations that allocate cost to EWC. Again, a seven-year period over which plants go away one at a time to be able to manage that process. We've already begun managing it on Vermont Yankee which is over, kind of, we've already gone through the process of shutting down Vermont Yankee. We've already managed as it relates to Rhode Island plant, which we've already sold. We've already managed as it relates to the wind assets which we've already sold. We've managed, as it relates to FitzPatrick, which will be sold this year, we'll manage it as it relates to Palisades which will shutdown at 2018, and Pilgrim in 2019, and then in 2020, and 2021. It's a process that has to be managed as it relates to what those costs are, but to right size the organization over a seven-year period is something that we'll be able to manage. So I guess, Julien, it's just not an issue of signiﬁcance that I would see.    I can throw in some modeling elements too – this is Drew – and from a modeling perspective, when we started we had about $35 million per plant of overheads. And as we've had direct cost for each plant, I don't have the percentages in front of me right now for each plant going back to Vermont Yankee. But, as each one of those is going to peel oﬀ as those plants are shut down. And I think there may be about 40% or so left at sort of indirect costs, and those are the ones that we'll have to work down over time that Leo is talking about and we've got a really good head start.  And so, I think at the end of the day, what we're going to end up with is the costs that are reasonable and necessary to operate the business going forward. And, I mean, that should make sure that we have reliable and safe operations of our nuclear plant. So I think from a modeling perspective, those are the things that you would look at as it kind of winds down over time."
"But, just a follow-up here, just quickly you talked about the non-nuclear assets and Cooper contract being generally earnings neutral. But, just outside of that on a go- forward basis, 2021 onwards, I mean, you're talking about ramping down the cost, there should be no other costs outside of decommissioning in NDT that need – that are ongoing. The remainder is either cut and/or allocated out and largely there is no other cost EPS attributable to the business.","That's correct. And in the slide, in the front, we talk about the NDT earnings and the decommissioning expense that's on slide 13. And you see initially, there is a pretty big gap between the decommissioning strength and the NDT earnings. I think, one thing that's important to know there is, for the earnings part of that we're assuming that we're realizing only about 45% of the 6.25% of the earnings in 2017. And so, it's eﬀectively showing you like about a 3% return on your NDT earnings, the rest of its going straight to the balance sheet.  And then in 2018, we'll have an accounting change, which would cause us to mark- to-market much more of the equity portion of the trust. And so, our return will go up substantially, not – from 6.25%, it's going to stay there, but we'll just acknowledge more of that in the income statement which will close that gap. And then, over time if we're successful, of course in doing more VY like transactions, that should shrink as well."
"Sorry, just a quick follow-up on Arkansas Nuclear One, what's the timeline for ﬁling for and/or process to just get recovery on the regulated expense there? Just a quick one.","I think, as it relates to – there is no ﬁling around Arkansas Nuclear One. There is a formula rate plan ﬁling that we had. The one that's already in place, there is the review that's going on where there is no procedural schedule for yet and then we'll just make another formula rate plan ﬁling, is that what you're asking about the recovery?"
"Yeah. Exactly, I was presuming it was part of the FRP, but I wasn't a 100% sure.","Yes. Yes. It was part of the FRP as it relates to the breaks that are in eﬀect today and that's where we're going through the process where the Commission want to go back and review some more information on those costs. There is no procedural schedule around that at the moment, but then there will be another FRP ﬁling this summer. And so, there will be more cost associated with every – hopeful (57:35) business including ANO at that point in time. So we would anticipate that the one that's out there today will either get a procedural schedule before that time or it will get wrapped up at the same point in time, as the next step for Vermont (57:45)."
Got it. Thank you.,Yeah. Thank you.      Operator   Thank you. And the last question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
"Well, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.    Good morning."
"Hi, Leo. Actually I wanted to clarify just on the question you were just talking about. Firstly, are those costs likely to get recovered in 2017 under the 2016 FRP if they wrap it up sooner or are they sort of, because I think they set them aside, so they wanted more information, but would it be retroactive to beginning of the year, if decided on a more timely basis than, I guess, next year's ﬁling?",They are in rates now.
"Okay. So, still the question is whether they stay in or...",Correct.
...you're collecting it today?,Correct.
Okay.,"Yeah, they are just reviewing them. They didn't set them aside out of the pricing. They are all being recovered today."
"Right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, secondly, I think you gave a number on what you thought the potential Utility, or Parent & Other exposure to tax reform at a lower tax rate would be.    If you layered in losing interest deductibility as well, in that kind of scenario, would you guys still see yourselves in the 5% to 7% range? Does it move you in the range? How should we think about that kind of incremental scenario?","Yeah.      Jonathan, this is Drew, so clearly, we have a fairly narrow range out there for Utility, Parent & Other. And if you were to layer on the change in tax rate and the interest expense that and assuming that was the scenario you ended up with, they would probably move you close to the bottom of that range.  It's too early to tell about what we decide to do with the ranges at this point. But, if you just were to take those two things in isolation that would probably, bring it to the bottom of the range. But, it's not clear yet that we would move the range or change our guidance or anything at this point."
Right. Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.,"Thank you.    Thanks, Jonathan.    Operator  Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to David Borde for closing remarks.
