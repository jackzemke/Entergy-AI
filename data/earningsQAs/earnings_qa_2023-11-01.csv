Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Hey, Drew. Just a question on the '23 earnings and the '24 assumptions building up. Obviously, you now have $0.48 of positive weather impact versus normal for the year, moving up the bottom end of the range, which you talked about, by $0.10. I guess, what other oﬀsets are you now embedding in the '23 guidance? And do you see any carry-forward beneﬁts to '24? Speciﬁcally, maybe commenting on your O&M assumption, going from $0.85 to $0.20 for year-over- year. How much of the diﬀerence quarter-over-quarter is reinvestment for the beneﬁt of '24? Thanks.","Sure, Shar. Thanks for the question. As you noted, we did have signiﬁcant weather that enabled us to pull forward some O&M spending. Some of that is, as I noted, related to that vegetation management spending that is coming into '23. There's also been additional spending in the transmission and distribution space around maintenance on those assets. All of that does help de-risk 2024. And then, we did have this higher spending in '23 in the third quarter, and it'll ﬂow a bit into the fourth as we continue to maintain the units that Drew mentioned that ran so well to support those higher volumes. So, it helped contribute to that change in the O&M space and then help de-risk future periods."
"Okay. Got it. And then just, I guess, in light of just the asset sale announcement you guys did on the gas side, I guess why keep the reiterated equity needs, especially as we're thinking about '25 and '26? And does a CapEx step up require incremental equity there as we're heading into EEI? Thanks.","Sure. The gas sale does help support the incremental capital that Drew mentioned going into our '24 to '26 outlook. We also have strong sales that support that, and we do not have incremental equity in that period as supported by those two items. And we'll go through more details of the ﬁnancing plan for that at EEI in a couple weeks."
"Okay. Perfect. And then, just lastly on the SERI complaint proceedings, I mean, obviously you noted the settlement in principle in Arkansas, but the debate has been somewhat confrontational, especially as we're thinking about Louisiana. What was the impetus of the settlement for Arkansas? And do you guys think it's sort of repeatable with the other jurisdictions? Thanks.","Well, good morning. It's Rod."
"Hey, Rod.","Good morning. The impetus for the timing of the settlement, I think, stemmed from the August FERC ruling that in our view, lowered the risk of uncertainty around further refunds due from the uncertain tax position and sale-leaseback. So, it was an opportunity for us to revisit negotiations given the clarity from that August decision."
"Got it. And then just, Rod, how do you think the read-through, I guess, to the, I guess, Louisiana for sure?","Yeah. From our vantage point, we view it as constructive. Obviously, we won't talk about or comment on speciﬁc timing or progress with Louisiana or New Orleans. But we are comfortable saying we remain in active pursuit of settlement under the, under similar terms, with the point being, obviously, as long as we're able to reach constructive settlements, that's fair and reasonable, and certainly, consistent with the way in which we approached Arkansas and Mississippi. We think we have a fair shot, but obviously, we need the counterparties to align with us and that's the work that remains."
"Perfect. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks, Rod.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.",
"Great. Good morning. Hey, Drew. Hey, Kimberly. Hey, Rod.",Good morning.    Good morning.    Good morning.
"Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in the industrial sales backdrop, just seeing the weather normal sales down for this quarter. What are you seeing in terms of activity around projects and major industrial customer expansions that they've been working on?","Yeah, big picture, David. As I noted, we are seeing, we continue to see a strong pipeline around new and expansion customers, and Rod can talk on those more speciﬁcally. For the quarter, we had some outages in our existing customers that drove to what our results are year-to-date, but our pipeline continues to be strong.       Yeah, and the short story there is that the pipeline of projects, to your question, has continued to grow. We'll provide a little more insight around that at EEI, but our conﬁdence in our growth prospects are reﬂecting the actual growing number of projects of customers coming into the service territory. So, robust is the operative word there."
"Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And so, at the end of the day, no change to your projections in terms of what you're, what you had been expecting industrial sales growth to look like going forward?",That is correct. No change.
"Okay, okay. Thanks. And then, I was wondering if you could just comment on your competitiveness in renewable RFPs and just any progress there. Thinking ahead to the potential opportunity in Louisiana with the enhanced renewable RFP 3 gigawatts, just how are you situated as that comes closer?","Yes, the pipeline continues, from our perspective, on our solar self-development continues to develop well. We have developed the capabilities to be competitive in that space, and we are continuing to plan to support customer growth and desire for clean energy in the renewable space as well as other clean energy they may warrant, but our team is continuing to ramp up and continuing to be quite competitive in that space. So we're excited to see that and see that support our customers' growth."
Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is open.,
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Jeremy."
"Just want to follow up on U.S. Gulf Coast industrial activity, if I could. Just curious, I guess, in your investor conversations, or do you feel the market fully appreciates given where WTI has moved up versus relative to gas? And what the spread is on a BTU basis for oil and oil byproducts versus gas and natural gas byproducts? How much of a material advantage that is for the U.S. Gulf Coast, both as a feedstock for the petchem industry as well as power costs for industrial businesses down there and I guess the very long multi-year trend of growth that that could underpin.","Yeah, Jeremy, those economic indicators are things that we track closely as you mentioned, they're important to some of our industrial customers. Both the spread between natural gas and some of the oil products, those, that is, as you point out, has widened out and been very supportive of the Gulf Coast here, particularly as European gas prices have gone up in the last month or so as everybody knows.  So that has made, it's continuing what we already know in some big macro trends around global geopolitical uncertainty, and that has led to, as you continued to be the case, broken global supply chains, and that brings a lot of investment to the U.S., and when they look at the U.S., they look at the Gulf Coast. So whether you're talking about geographic spreads or commodity spreads, they are all very, very strongly supporting our industrial customers and the industrial growth along the Gulf Coast, and in particular, in our service territory."
"Got it. Very clear to us. Thank you. Maybe just following up on some of your prepared remarks there with New Orleans and Louisiana resiliency ﬁling comments. You mentioned that there are varying options and opinions as how do, how much resiliency to do right now. Any sense as to how much variability you could see in the outcomes of these ﬁlings other than aﬀordability concerns? What are the other kind of big moving pieces here that are involved in these resiliency discussions?","It's Rod. If you recall, there were two primary areas where we got initial feedback. One was the staﬀ engineer and the other was the commission staﬀ. We had strong alignment on the need for resilience. So we're not arguing about whether or not this is something we ought to be doing.  There were two dynamics around the staﬀ testimony that I think is instructive. One was they referenced their support for rider recovery for retired assets. That gave us a lot of comfort that we could come to a constructive resolution once we sort of decide the scope. And they also recommended transparency and accountability features. But I think the work really for us is going to continue to align around scope, pace, and ultimately cost.     When we ultimately decide on what could be a solid outcome, our objective is making sure on the back end that the recovery mechanism continues to support credit and our access to capital. But those sort of swim lanes are where the lion's share of the debate is going to be as the commission will rightfully be looking to answer the resiliency bell but around aﬀordability for customers."
"Got it. That makes a lot of sense to us. Just one last one if I could. Given that you reaﬃrmed your 6% to 8% EPS CAGR through '26 in line with the Investor Day commentary, is it reasonable to assume rate-based growth will also continue at a similar 7% to 8% CAGR through '28? How would accelerated resiliency impact this? Similarly, how would higher renewables win rate impact this?  On the other side of the coin, do you see pressures against this, such as FRP, caps as far as inﬂation is concerned? Just trying to see both sides, how you see this playing out.","Sure. The rate base we would expect to continue to grow, consistent with growing capital investment, as those investments are made to support our customers and the objectives that we have to support them.    From a pressure perspective, certainly there are opportunities for additional capital around resilience. For example, we've assumed a base level of resilience, as we've discussed previously, but with accelerated mechanisms. For example, there is more resilience that could be placed in. If customers are interested in renewables at a faster pace, that certainly could be additional capital that would drive additional spending as well. And then, it really is about making sure that we are supporting our customers' growth and continuing to provide them the services and the reliable power that we oﬀer.  And I'll just add that as we get to EEI, we planned some additional disclosures around that potential capital increase above what we already have."
"Got it. Thank you for that. (Technical Diﬃculty) And just real quick. The FRPs, any issues as far as caps against inﬂation that are something that we should be thinking about?","Jeremy, we pay attention to customer aﬀordability, and we certainly monitor the caps that we have to make sure that we are making investments that are staying within aﬀordability for our customers. So, that we've had constructive regulatory mechanisms in all of our jurisdictions and continue to expect to have that as we go forward.       And we always are talking about our continuous improvement eﬀorts. Those are the things that help us manage against things like inﬂation. And it has been a tough bear the last couple of years, but we do believe that we can really hold the line, as I mentioned in my remarks, against inﬂation and all the other capital that we're putting to work, which also drives costs, or can drive costs as well. And so, that's our objective. So we don't see it impacting our rates as much as just all the incremental investment really is."
Understood. Appreciate the time. Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America. Your line is open.,
"Hi, good morning. Thank you, team.",Good morning.
"First, well done on the latest series settlement progress. Very nice to see. And I was hoping I could kind of merge David and Jeremy's question and kind of combine. What's the quantum of incremental capital opportunities across the renewables eﬀorts as well as the hardening and resiliency programs? I know there's been a lot of numbers and timeframes. Just if you can help kind of frame the opportunity set relative to the outlook, that'd be helpful.","Yes, Paul, we'll get into all the speciﬁcs of EEI. I don't have the details in front of me, but there is, I think we've talked historically about $900 million of resilience in the base, and then incremental resilience on top of that, that's available and assuming we get or when and if we get accelerated recovery. But we'll get into all the speciﬁcs on the puts and takes around capital in a couple of weeks."
"Okay. Great. I'm eagerly anticipating EEI. It'll be a good update. And then the other one, just on the Louisiana with the rate case slash the FRP extension, is this the kind of major proceeding that you think needs to be more fully litigated, or is a settlement an opportunity there?","Yeah. From our vantage point, a settlement is, one, an opportunity; and two, desire. But to be speciﬁc, a settlement in favor of continuing on with the FRP regime, provides clarity for both us and customers, certainly promotes certainty around recovery, given the growing investment needs to support growth in Louisiana. And certainly, a smoother transition as we began to pick up on the, putting capital to work for both resiliency and to fund the growth.  And so, from our vantage point, having the ﬂexibility that an FRP provides for both us and our customers and regulators is the optimal outcome there. And avoiding the litigation, certainly an expense to our stakeholders of litigating a rate case is something, we and other stakeholders have chosen to avoid in Louisiana. So yeah, the FRP is deﬁnitely the path that we're working towards."
"Okay. Understood. And then to clarify quickly, just in setting expectations on timing. Should we think about the settlement potentials after intervener testimony, I think March 26 of next year, or could we potentially see something faster than that?","Yeah, it's a great question, but I think it's a little early for us at this point to deem the feedback to be meaningful around timing because discovery really has just gotten underway, and we had a procedural order that was set last week that I think set the hearing for August of next year.  A couple of things that might be helpful as you think about milestones in the coming months, the procedural schedule set forth technical conferences in December, January, and February. I think that framework, those technical conferences will give some insight as to the initial positioning of the parties and give us then some daylight as to the path forward around potential settlement."
Okay. Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. See you at EEI.,Indeed.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lonegan of Evercore. Your line is open.
"Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, on the utility O&M outlook for the year, you talked about pulling forward spending to de-risk 2024. You highlighted some of the categories. Presumably also, given the record temperatures and peak demand, you had to spend more O&M for additional work crews and overtime pay to maintain reliability, given the stress on the grid. Just wondering if you could break out how much of that spending was pulled forward to de-risk versus the amount to maintain reliability on your grid.","Thanks, Michael. You're right. We did have to spend more to support the hot summer, and the volumes, and the PowerGen team performed really well. I don't have the break out speciﬁcally between that piece as well as the pull-forwards, but certainly, we have been able to pull forward signiﬁcant spending around reliability in the transmission, distribution space and in the vegetation space as well."
Okay. Great. Thank you for the call. I'll see you at EEI.,"Great.    Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Mizuno, sorry, Mizuho. Your line is open."
"Thank you. I think Mizuno sounds sporting good. Excuse me. Just, I guess, two quick ones. Approval of the gas system sale, I think you're guiding to like a 3Q '25 close, it's almost two years. Just curious on the length, what causes that long closure? Any important milestones along the way, we should keep an eye out for?","Yeah, this is Rod. The experience we have and certainly the advice of the initial stakeholders suggest that that process, given the fact that you have both Louisiana Public Service Commission, the New Orleans City Council, and the Baton Rouge Metro Council, all having a part in the process, gives us an outlook of that 18 to 21 month timeframe. And that's really what sort of sets our expectation. It's not any singular jurisdiction, it's just the process of getting those approvals. And if we're able to do something sooner, then clearly we'd be working to achieve that objective.        And I'll just add that, our buyer is new to this particular business. And while all the operations and everything is all going to be good to go and transfer right over. They do need to, we're going to work with them to set up some of the back oﬃce pieces of this. And that might take a little bit longer than it normally would if it was a strategic buyer, for example."
"Got it. And then, again, I appreciate the clarity you guys have given on SERI and the progress you made earlier this week. But just, and I know we don't want to just think the negative outcome, but if the company continued to struggle with Louisiana and New Orleans. Is there a period of time that management would just maybe view that, when you look at the book value of SERI versus maybe what the liability could be if Louisiana and New Orleans hold out, that they would just look at maybe ending the venture? I'm just curious if, like, trying to maybe gauge like how long until just management says, we've tried really hard to move (Technical Diﬃculty) given up on the weekend as well.","Yeah, well. I mean, I'll tell you, Anthony, I mean, that we're always looking at every potential outcome and option. So, that is always part of the calculation. But at this point, we think, we've made good progress with the settlement in Mississippi and then now the settlement in Arkansas, such that it de-risk roughly two-thirds of the overall exposure there.  So we feel like we're making good progress and that we don't really need to go down that particular path at this time. But that is something that we're always paying close attention to and looking at various options. And so, that's something we'll keep considering in the future."
"Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Appreciate it.",Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Your line is open.
"Hey, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the time. Just one for me today, a lot's been answered. But on the credit, I think you're doing 12.4% trailing 12 months, and you're obviously signaling you can get back to the 14% by year-end and within the appropriate minimums. Can you just conﬁrm that's more just lapping and roll-oﬀ of     items, and there's nothing else required from the regulatory standpoint of approval for this point?","Sure, Nick. That's right. There is a signiﬁcant amount of debt that will roll-oﬀ in the fourth quarter, a large part related to Louisiana securitization from earlier in the year, and then there are some items from fourth quarter of 2022, including the Mississippi settlement with SERI that was paid out in November that will roll-oﬀ in the 12 months ended 2023."
Thanks.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Levine of Citi. Your line is open.,
"Hi, everybody. What jurisdictions do you see having the biggest opportunity for incremental resilient spending, and does the current equity issuance plan have built- in buﬀer for some of this CapEx upside that highlighted already on the call?","Thanks, Ryan. As you know we have open ﬁlings in New Orleans and in Louisiana. Louisiana, between those two has much more spending than New Orleans does. We also anticipate a ﬁling in Texas in 2024 as the commission writes the rules coming out of the legislature. As far as the equity and the amount of investment. We've assumed a base level of investment associated with resilience, and depending on what is approved out of that, we'll be looking at how to ﬁnance that. But we have a signiﬁcant amount of capital in our plan, including that base level of investment. So more to come as those decisions come out of the jurisdictions."
I appreciate it. Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.,
"Hey, good morning.","Morning, Paul."
"Just ﬁnally with most of my questions been answered, but with respect to the SERI leaseback litigation, congratulations on the settlement and stuﬀ. But if Louisiana, I guess I'm wondering is from a fully litigated perspective, when will we get closure on this if there isn't a settlement, I guess with Louisiana?","I want to make sure I'm understanding the question. Is the question, when would we likely get settlement in Louisiana on the remaining issues that --"
"I guess you, I'm not asking you to predict that. I think you've sort of answered that. I guess what my question was is, if there isn't a settlement, how long does the litigation, when would you expect the litigation to come to an end?","Yeah. I got you. Yeah. It's long lived. If you think about this, the FERC process, addressing those remaining issues, could take you, well, two plus years. And it goes back to what we were suggesting around why we're continuing to pursue settlement and the opportunity to provide beneﬁts and value to customers sooner rather than later. And a settlement provides both us and now potentially Louisiana and New Orleans the opportunity to do that versus the uncertainty that comes with a couple of years or so before there's any resolution."
Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarity.,"And just to say, full resolution, not any resolution, because we've resolved quite a bit."
"That's right point. Thank you.    Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Your line is open. Travis, perhaps your line is on mute.  It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr.Abler, I will now turn the call back over to you.","Thank you, JL, and thanks to everyone for participating this morning.
