Question,Answer
"Good morning, everyone.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)",Good morning.
"Thanks for taking our questions. So maybe if we could start with the military business, can you provide some color around contribution with the new military bases after the latest wins? And then further, do you have any visibility to other opportunities that can materialize in the near term?","Well, let me take that and Sus you can jump in, but we don't break out the earnings from military services. We just do it on a segment basis, for a number of reasons, but we just don't do that. But I can also talk to, we're in four diﬀerent solicitations right now and we expect to hear back on two in the near term. So, just a reminder. We won the last three major awards from the military and we're really proud to be able to support the military and their families."
"Got it, but nothing you can provide in terms of color around contribution at this point?","No, I'm sorry Ryan. We don't break that out like that."
"Fair enough. And then maybe if you could just talk about how you're framing timing at equity, I know you guys kind of alluded in the past that may be in the middle of the plan. But curious of that mindset has changed at all given the strength of shares.","Yeah, this is Susan. We have not changed our timing and really the timing that we have laid out in the plan and you're right we had indicated in December when we rolled out this current plan that we had anticipated an issue somewhere in the middle of that ﬁve-year period that is still our current thinking and its really tied to, when we need the proceeds, when we need some additional funding for the capital plan that we have laid out as you recall from December we increased our capital expectation for the ﬁve-year period and then obviously rolled out our 10 year plan and the equity issue we have in the current plan really supports the timing of when we think the investment occurs and we really need the funding and I just don't see any need to change that at this point."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it, and then just lastly, on the New York, American Water sales process. Can you dive a little bit more into that in terms of milestones from here and the process going forward in terms of the timeline?","Yeah, as I said in the remarks Ryan, we still expect to close this in the -- in early 2021. And so we're working on an established timeline. We're still conﬁdent that we can get there. Even, as the governor has talked about proposed legislation. We don't think that would slow this down."
Got it. Thanks for the time.,"Okay, thanks Ryan.  Operator  Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. First question is for Susan. Remind us in the results and in the guidance, what COVID related costs including the bad debt is included or excluded from the results, getting the various pending regulatory approvals for those?","Yeah, our guidance overall, as we indicated we changed guidance this quarter increased it and included in that guidance range as a, an assumption of $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable for the year and that really, I think reﬂects in our current trends, we saw a fairly substantial impact through the second quarter and it's recovered some in the third as we saw the commercial business, the commercial sector come back a bit and the residential sector again continues to be pretty strong growth there.  I think challenge of course is to try to estimate how long this thing lasts and what that sort of new surge of cases may impact due to businesses across our service territory. Do they go in to some additional phase of shut down. So again, we tried to capture some assumptions around that in our guidance range of the $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable just diﬃcult to predict obviously, as we see this thing continue to unfold and it is included in that guidance range that we established.  I mentioned on the regulatory front, we now have deferral orders in 11 of the 14 jurisdictions and that really does cover in exposures to bad debt expense increases, direct costs associated with the pandemic et cetera. So really been impact that falls through if you will is just the demand   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   revenue changes that we might see across the service territory everything else, are the direct costs or direct impacts or captured in those deferral orders."
Got it. And could you quantify just year-to-date what those -- what the deferred cost amount to?,"It's disclosed in the queue. I think if you go to that footnote in the queue when we talk about COVID speciﬁcally we've laid out the reg assets recorded net of some reg liabilities. I don't have the number right in front of me, but it's laid out in the queue for you."
"Understood. So question Walter, I know you talked about, increase communications with various municipal utilities for being a potential M&A and I know that's been ongoing every year but just given the COVID environment and your point earlier on potential focus on nationally on water quality and water already in water infrastructure. Are you -- do you think all the core unit your you should see an acceleration of mine acquisitions by a typical over the next two to three years versus the rate that you've seen over the past few years?","Yeah, it's a great question. And, we're in many conversations with municipalities around the country. It's one of the reasons is the COVID impact but, there's still a lot of challenges around water and wastewater infrastructure. And we're solutions provider. So, we're going to continue to talk to municipalities of providing solutions.  Our pipeline continues to grow and we continue to talk to new municipalities. So, we'll see where that takes us. Typically it takes two to ﬁve years to complete these deals. So there is a delay from the time you see Let me see your start are talking to them to the time you take ownership, but we're very conﬁdent in our ability to provide solutions for communities."
Understood. Thank you so much.,"Hey, let me just quickly tag onto the question there. We do have a net regulatory asset of $26 million recorded at the end of September related to COVID."
Got it. Thank you.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.,
"Thank you. So what was your in your prepared remarks? You have a comment about some one of the state's admittedly forget which one that has a legislation was to provide for some adjustments for non-municipal systems water systems being acquired. If you could remind me which one it is? And also, in light of that, I'm just looking at your New Jersey Reiki settlement you -- in the original ﬁling you asked for this acquisition adjustment mechanism, I don't see it in the settlement. So I just wonder if it means it's still going to be addressed or the settlement basic, you doesn't cover it IE those three acquisitions and will not be well -- the goodwill is not going to be added to the rate -- basically, New Jersey. Thank you.","Yeah, the let me start with the second question ﬁrst the acquisition adjustment will be dealt with separately and the order there was an executive order that came out that said 90 days after the emergency orders lifted is when they have to render a decision so we don't have an exact time on it yet, but we're expecting that after the executive or after the emergency orders lifted."
"Okay, that's a New Jersey and you mention some which are the state has this, potential adjustments for non municipal systems. I thought you mentioned it.","Yeah, no. It's Indiana."
Okay.,"Is there's an appraisal process yet for the nominees for utilities and really around establishing fair market value in a reasonable purchase price. So yeah, Indiana has been a leading state in legislation, because they recognize I think the importance of what we can do as a company and addressing the water and wastewater challenges. So we're really proud to be working with the Indiana Legislature and coming up with bills that really aﬀords us the opportunity to do that."
Okay. I think that's all I have. Thank you.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Great. Thanks, Angie.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Jonathan Rider with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, Walter and Susan. How are y'all doing?",Good. How are you?
"Not bad. So question around guidance midpoint to midpoint your raisin it buys for sense. However, you're citing kind of a net $0.07 to $0.08 beneﬁt, over some options that were originally embedded in your guidance range, it's that kind of implies your core results or action tracking down $0.03 to $0.04 from the original midpoint. What's kind of the driver cause of that.",Jonathan let me make sure I follow the question and maybe correct one thing. I think at midpoint where up $0.06. We were roughly 384 midpoint before we're now at 390.
"Okay. Yeah,","And that really just is driven by the weather implications. You know, that's the big driver of the of the change in mid point. I would say I think we obviously did narrow the range a bit as we again have continued to see a little bit more recovery from the COVID cost than we had anticipated when we were discussing this with you at the second quarter we called in our range was $0.05 to $0.08 unfavorable. We're now $0.03 to $0.06 is our current best guess at that. Obviously the business continues to perform fundamentally very-very well. We've not seen any real slow down in our investment opportunities. So the underlying business performing very well."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, well, let me ask maybe a little bit of. Historically I guess investors have kind of been conditioned to AWK coming in more in the top half of their guidance range and you guys have done a good job executing. So, if it's the midpoints being raised $0.06. You know despite $0.07, $0.08 of favorable items and it kind of puts you just a little below that original midpoint. So is there anything, that kind of is causing that headwind or expenses not quite as good as you're hoping or rate relief, delays anything like that or --",No.
"Not a lot, just a couple of penny included, just kind of curious --","No, really no drivers of that nature. I mean, again, I think we're continuing to understand that the impacts of COVID from a short-term and a long-term perspective, but as I said, the underlying business continues to perform quite well. There's always a number of gives and takes in any particular year, but we've not seen anything that's fundamentally changing our expectations about the ability for the business to perform."
"Okay. And then Walter, I know you -- you guys are going to roll-out guidance in February. Should we anticipate you roll in the base year in forward one year from, 2018-2019 or is there a chance you guys use 2020?","We're still looking at that Jonathan and I think you'll just have to wait till February, when we come out and give you a sort of the full plan. I think is Walter indicated in his remarks though, you can expect to see a continued focus on investment and infrastructure and that's what drives its business and we think we have great opportunity to continue to do that."
"Okay. And last, I know you said commercial demand and is marked down nearly as much in Q3 as it was in Q2, but how did the trends exactly shaped out on the residential side I think Q2 was up only 5%, which was somewhat puzzling is (inaudible) America, which has some general overlap with your service territories was up 10% where was residential in Q3?","I think we quoted that was up and you can check me 13%. I think we said roughly 13% in the quarter and again we'd laid out by quarter in the 10-Q. Yeah. It's a resident of the 13.6%.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      13.6% Yeah,"
So that really came back strong or whatever in Q3.,"It really did and then commercial again. We saw as on a year to date basis is really ﬂat to the prior year. So yeah, obviously you would expect growth right but, we think back last to year- over-year is an indication that across much of our territory which again, we like the geographic diversity of our territory as this thing rolls through the country diﬀerent parts of the country are responding diﬀerently in terms of business reopening and we've seen that occur through the third quarter."
"Okay, great, and I appreciate the time and talk to you guys soon.","Great. Thanks, Jonathan.     Yes, thanks, Jonathan  Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session.
