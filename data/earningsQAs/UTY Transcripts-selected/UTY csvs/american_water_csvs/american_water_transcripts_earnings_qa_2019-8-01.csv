Question,Answer
"Good morning, everyone. This is actually Ryan Greenwald on for Julian.","Hi, Ryan."
"Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Can you talk about your strategy in states that you don't currently operate in? As more and more states adopt fair market value legislation, what states are most appealing for you and how big can potential opportunities be?","Sure. So, we -- currently our growth model is to continue to do tuck-ins and acquisitions in the states where we're present. We do have a model, however, where we have a corporate business development group and we look across the country and we actually rate each day pretty much on a couple of factors. One is the regulatory environment. The second is the business environment, how open are they to private water. The third one is, is there a way within ﬁve years we could have at least 50,000 customer connections because if not, we don't think that it is a beneﬁt because it could hurt our brand as being eﬃcient and making sure that we're providing the best economic value for all of our customers. So we don't disclose our ranking of those states, but we are very much aware of what's going on in all the states across the country and we do those evaluations on a frequent basis."
Got it. That's helpful. And then it looks like the quarter got some help from the asset sales to help oﬀset the unfavorable weather. How much margin do you guys have built into the forecast for wet weather in second half '19?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Well, we don't have anything built into the forecast for the last half of the year. We would expect normal weather. We talk about sort of a range of weather dollars that we would anticipate before we would have a signiﬁcant impact on guidance. We obviously saw a little bit warmer weather in July, but we've got a lot of the third quarter left so we'll see how the rest of the year plays out.     And keep in mind, Ryan, we always talk about the fact that we build in a plus or minus $0.06 in our guidance range. So, that's what we'll be looking at in the third quarter. So you can always expect, and that doesn't mean that outside of that we would make any changes, but it means that built into our range we're already expecting that type of variability."
"That's helpful. Thank you. And then just lastly, the $100 million increase in CapEx, is that purely from acquisitions?","Yes. That really is the driver, Ryan."
Thank you. Thanks for the time.  Operator  The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, Susan, Linda, and Walter. How are you all?","Okay. It's Susan, Susan, and Walter; now Jonathan. We are doing great."
Sorry about that.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   if you just say Susan, you pretty much get two-thirds of us so..."
"It's the start of a long day so I apologize for that. So if you could -- could you expand a little bit on the parent side of the legacy investment, what it pertained to and why you elected to include it in the ongoing $0.94 number?","The legacy investment we referred to, the $0.03 impact there, really relates to a holding that dates back to probably 20 years ago to a previous investment and we just look at opportunities from time to time when they present themselves to monetize investments like that and the opportunity presented itself in this particular quarter.     And also the reason that we included it is we rarely consider anything to be non-GAAP, we try very hard not to. There's a lot of puts and takes we do. If it's a one-time change in tax in a state, that can be $0.04 or $0.05, we don't pull that out. We have as we did if it's a sale of a business like CSG, we pull that out. But typically unless it's a signiﬁcant and I mean a signiﬁcant insurance type thing, we went through Freedom Industries or the one-time taxes, we just don't want to get into having these big laundry lists of non-GAAP items. So each quarter we have puts and takes on both sides that are one-time, but they tend to balance out over time."
Okay. Was the sale contemplated in the guidance range when you originally set it?,"Again, we don't look at everything on the balance sheet and we don't look at that so it wasn't really contemplated. As we look at puts and takes, it was just one of the things that we had out there. We also have had some negative I know that there have been a couple of times that we increased reserves for diﬀerent type of things related to insurance or any type of legal ongoing and we don't pull those out either."
"Okay. And then I guess maybe asked a little bit diﬀerent way, how did the Q2 results compare to your internal plan because I know you have indicated that Q1 was a $0.01 better?","So we are so good at doing our budget, Jonathan, that -- no, we don't give quarterly guidance. So one of the things we have not given quarterly guidance since we IPO-ed back out in 2008 and 2009 and there is a reason because while I know that all utilities have variability during the year, in our business for example, as Walter mentioned, with the wettest on-record; we tend to   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   look at a range and we look at a best case, worst case, expected case and there are so many puts and takes in there. But there's a reason we don't give quarterly guidance and there's also a reason we give annual guidance and of course you all like to model and look at that and we understand that and we do have budgeting inside. But this is why we don't give quarterly guidance."
"The only reason I asked it because on the Q1 call, you indicated you were a $0.01 better than your internal plans though.",Yeah.
It seems like you wanted to continue that comment.,"So, it was a good quarter."
"Okay. And then the Philly partnership, on the Q1 call you said that was like 100,000 contracts. Just wondering how that growth has progressed in the last three months, what are you up to now?","Yes. I don't have that number and I'm not sure that we have that. We can get that to you. One of the things we've seen in Philadelphia is a -- several of the elected oﬃcials see this as such a beneﬁt to their citizens that they're being very vocal about the beneﬁts of this program and what we did see is that it has already shown itself to be very helpful to many of the constituents who have taken up this warranty service and that's our point about it's doing really well, it's continuing to do well, and we're seeing a lot of community support."
"Okay, great. And then the last one, are you still thinking that there could be three military bases awarded this year and if that is the case, should we assume that you've bid on all three of those?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So, we are expecting up to three. It's always hard as you know, Jonathan, to predict exactly what the Department of Defense and these services will do. But there could be up to three based on their schedules and we are very hopeful. It is a very competitive business. We know that we can operate not just eﬃciently and eﬀectively, but we have leading R&D in terms of dealing with emerging contaminants such as P5s and all of the type of perﬂuoro-alcohols that fall into that and so we are very hopeful that from a value-added standpoint that we will be the successful winner on all of them, but we will see."
"Okay. So, you are involved in all three of those that you're saying?","The three that will be awarded that we talk about are those that we are involved with, yes."
"All right. Okay. Thank you so much for the time this morning. And sorry, Susan - new Susan.",No problem.  Operator  The next question comes from Richard Verdi of Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to say that's a really nice job with earnings this quarter of managing the weather situation, I mean that's kind of a way to manage the business that can be unfavorable, that's a nice quarter.","Thank you, Rich."
"Yeah. So when I look at, I have a kind of a something pertaining to the P&L. So when I look at my model I had $0.94 for the quarter, you guys delivered $0.94, $0.88 on the top, you guys delivered $0.82. So I mean it's pretty tight across up and down the model. However I mean inside of there was, I mean, well, it was all tight, there was a little bit of noise and when you add up that noise there is somewhat of an issue where really some of that was met with the below the line other net of $15 million. Can you just discuss maybe a little bit maybe as going oﬀ with   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Jonathan there old Susan or new Susan please, the $15 million and what we should think about that going forward for modeling purposes?","Well, I guess this is new Susan. I would probably say that maybe we need to take this a bit oﬄine for a detailed conversation around that. I think Susan summarized just a few minutes ago that we view this is a very strong quarter and it is a matter of transactions that occur and we do a nice job. I think of sort of mitigating some of the impacts from weather and other things, but we can certainly have a more detailed conversation with you about some of your model inputs if that would be helpful."
"Got it, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I just have a follow-up question to a question I had in the last quarter call pertaining to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, setting the standards for the fast contamination earlier this year, I mean that's something that should act as an impetus for privatization in a state, and in a state, I mean obviously, New Jersey, it's imperative to the American story. And so now that we're few months removed from that announcement out of the New Jersey DEP camp, I was wondering if maybe you could give us a sense of whether or not the company is potentially seeing an uptick in privatization chatter with municipalities as a result of those P5 standards out of the New Jersey DEP?","Yeah. Hi Rich, Walter here. How are you?"
Hey Walter.,I'm all right. How are you?
Good. Good to hear your voice.,"Thanks. And the answer is I'd say yes. This is coupled with the Water Quality Accountability Act with P5 standards, a lot of the municipal leaders are looking for options and we're in discussions with them about sharing our expertise and buying their systems and integrating what they do every day into what we do every day. So I think it has contributed to more discussions with municipalities as they face these challenges and we're ready to help them and   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   really to help the communities meet these challenging standards. So yes, I would say yes to your question."
"I appreciate it. Thanks, Walter and Walter, we got to get back after Malibu together. Rest of you guys, I appreciate the time. Thank you very much.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  And I see that there is one more question. That question comes from Michael Gaugler of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, everyone.",Good morning.
Just wondering if you have any concerns on project work in your Military Group. It appears we're going to shift about $3.6 billion for military-based construction to border security. Kind of how you're thinking about that.,"It's a great question, Mike. We actually have worked with our MSG folks and they have been talking with the commanding oﬃcers of the basis, the 14 basis we serve. Right now, we don't see an impact from those. These projects especially the ones beyond the O&M that our special capital projects on base are typically decided a few months out and as you know, September 30 is the end of the ﬁscal year. So at this point we're seeing actually an uptick from where we were in the last year or so in terms of interest in getting projects done and right now we're not seeing any impact. We'll continue to monitor that and we are having conversations."
And then just as a follow-up. Wondering if you think that could slow down any new rate -- any new base contract awards.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   You know that's interesting. We don't see that. In fact what we are seeing is there are several out there that are in process and we've not seen those slow down. In fact as I mentioned earlier, the three that we expect to be awarded are active. They have a big process and you basically participate with them unlike where you put a bid and you don't hear for a long time. We actually have constant contact with them and we've not seen those schedule down this year at least for those three that are expected to be awarded."
"Great. All right, thank you.","Thank you, Mike.  Operator  Seeing no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Susan Story for closing remarks.     Thank you, Andrew.
