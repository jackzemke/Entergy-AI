Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, everyone.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Hey. So a couple of quick follow-ups, if we can. Just to start oﬀ on New Jersey, I'm curious on the state income tax for -- on the corporate side. Why would it not ﬂow back to Regulated customers, just given especially the commentary in the other jurisdictions that you have in the slides here?","So we are working through that right now in terms of how that will aﬀect our New Jersey subsidiary and the parent company allocation. And so as you are aware, we are currently in a general rate case in New Jersey, and so we're working through how that increase in the corporate business tax rate would impact our customers."
"Right. Completely understood, but broadly speaking, you should think about this principally as a parent level impact?","Right, and we also have a corporate headquarters that is located in New Jersey, which will impact that calculation as well. And so we're going through all of the detailed calculations from a state tax apportionment perspective. We're also working through some clariﬁcations either through administratively or through legislation to make sure that we understand the complexity of how this will apply to water utilities."
"Understood. Excellent. Turning back to the Market-Based side of the business, if you can, just curious how is the sort of the Keystone water side of the business going year-to-date just given some of the trends there. And then separately, can you just talk to a little bit more of the sales side of the equation, the Veolia deal in the context of sort of pruning the business? Is the thought process here that this is more opportunistic or should we expect more as you think   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   about the aggregate size of the Market-Based Business and kind of bumping up against that 15% pro forma?","Julien, that's a great question. So I will take Keystone ﬁrst and then talk about the sale of the ESG, and then more broadly our views and philosophy around the Market-Based Businesses. So in the Keystone in the Appalachian Basin, we are continuing to see a ﬁrm market, a strong year for revenues. As Linda said, through the ﬁrst half of the year, it is accretive. For example, our two biggest businesses in Keystone water transfer, we have steady work continuing, we're continuing to try to hire more employees. Rig count has slightly decreased for the past few months, and so we're looking at that, but we're still seeing robust activity there. And in the oil and gas construction for pipelines, we're seeing consistent bid opportunities, increased infrastructure planning for 2018 and 2019. So in terms of the business there, as you know, there are a lot of takeaway pipeline capacities that are still under construction that will be very helpful for the Appalachian Basin compared to Henry Hub, as you are very aware of. So Keystone continues to be in a good market, and we continue to monitor the market there, and look at our main businesses and how we optimize those businesses.  In terms of how -- the CSG sale, we've mentioned in the past that our Contract Services Group -- and to remind everyone, this is where we run systems for other people where municipalities or industrials actually maintain the assets, we run the business. It's a much more competitive business. There are a lot more players in the market like Veolia, Suez, diﬀerent people. And as we look at our Market-Based segment and started looking at buying Pivotal, the growth of Homeowner Services, how well Homeowner is doing, and your earlier point about ensuring that Market-Based is predominantly 15% or less of our portfolio through 2022, we've mentioned before that it could get up to 20%, but we were very clear that would have to be very Regulated like, and currently about the only business in Market-Based that we see that would ﬁt that proﬁle is more -- is the Military Services Group.  So, as we looked at the business and the focus on that business, and the time and eﬀort to run it, we thought that Veolia could actually run that business better than we could, and we reached an agreement with them to buy the majority of the contracts. We -- there are 10 that they did not buy; four of them we're keeping because they're in proximity to our service areas, and there is very strong community relationships there. The others -- four of the others, there are other buyers who had ﬁrst rights in many cases, and two of them will terminate in the next 12 months. So this is an eﬀort to, as you say, prune the Market-Based Businesses.  And I've kind of alluded to then the general philosophy, which is at our core, we are a regulated utility. When we tell you and tell the Street that we want to keep that part of the business at 15% or less, and we grow parts of the business, we of course will always look and say, so what are the parts that we think further leverage the core competencies that we have as a water and wastewater company."
"Got it. Excellent. And then lastly, can I turn quickly to Missouri? You obviously alluded to legislation there in your prepared remarks. How does that change the strategy? I mean,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   obviously you've had some success of late in the settlement there. Does that require any kind of enabling subsequent rate case here or how do we see that actualize the latest legislation?","Yes. As far as the RSM goes, that would be applicable on the next rate case, and as far as the growth -- the legislation that deals with the vote of half -- simple majority instead of two-thirds, it's really just allowing us to have more discussions with municipalities throughout Missouri, and particularly some of the smaller municipalities that had a really high threshold as far as the vote count. So we just think it's more in keeping with the rest of Missouri and the rest of the country, and it enables us to have many more discussions with some of the smaller municipalities."
All right. Excellent I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Our next question comes from Chris Morgan with Macquarie. Please go ahead."
"Hi, everyone. Thank you. My questions have been asked and answered. Appreciate it.","Thank you, Chris.  Operator  Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Atwater Thornton. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning everyone, and thank you for taking my call, and also a great quarter too. Great on the report and on the other news delivered.","Thanks, Rich."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   I just have two quick questions regarding the acquisition front. Obviously American is the most operationally diverse water utility, and it helps -- won against unfavorable weather conditions or regulatory impact, but despite that operational diversity, I was wondering if there are any states outside of that current American Water footprint that the company maybe consider entering to the acquisitions?","So Rich, that's a great question. As a company, of course, our growth projections we give, the ﬁve year based on growth within our service area, we do have a corporate business development group. We are always looking across the country, at other states, opportunities, but as I think we have mentioned before, we have three kind of gates before we would look at going into a new state. The ﬁrst one is looking at the regulatory environment, the second one is the business environment or business climate, and the third one tends to be the one that is the most diﬃcult, which is, do we see a line of sight to get to at least 50,000 customers within ﬁve years.  Why that's important to us, you hear Walter and Linda talk all the time about the O&M eﬃciency. We're very proud of the chart we put up that showed that our O&M costs, the adjusted that's used in the calculation for O&M eﬃciency, and we have a reconciliation table in the appendix, but that calculation, our O&M costs are less today than they were in 2012. Our reputation, being able to do investment that's desperately needed in systems, is dependent on being able to also help oﬀset a portion of those impacts to customer bills by reducing O&M costs.  What we ﬁnd is if we don't have enough customers to get a critical mass, then we're not able to make the investments, we're not able to get some of the economies of scale. So we ﬁnd that that third element of ensuring that we can grow to about 50,000 customers in ﬁve years tends to be the one that is our biggest hurdle. So with that said, we are always looking at every state in the nation, we are always looking at opportunities, and we're always looking at a chance to grow and to provide our expertise to as many people across the country as we can."
"That's great color. Thank you for that, Susan. And for the second question, I was just wondering if the company is seeing any municipal acquisition competition from the electric utilities. And if so, how that might be impacting the acquisition eﬀort?","That's a great question, Rich. So again, for water investor-owned utilities, I think that of course the answer is yes. And predominantly Eversource, with their acquisition of Aquarion, and I'm sure that all of you were keeping up with what's going on with the merger between San Jose, Connecticut Water, and then Eversource's bid for Connecticut Water and Cal Water's bid for San Jose. So I think that's the main thing that we're seeing.  And again, outside of that, as we look at our strategy of buying municipalities that are between 3,000, 5,000 and 30,000, those are relatively small for someone to break into an industry. They   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   also typically are in areas contiguous to where we're already located. We have named brands in those areas, we have people and communities. So for that area, we don't see as much because, ﬁrst of all, these acquisitions of distressed municipalities take, as Walter showed in his slides, years to cultivate relationships because when municipalities are buying, yes, price is a big deal, but they also want to make sure that their citizens have the best service possible and are taken care of, and that they don't have to worry about emerging contaminants, and that they have professionals running the system. So what we ﬁnd is for that particular market that we focus on, it's more diﬃcult for someone who is not in our industry to break into that."
"Okay, great. Thank you, Susan. And actually I have one other question too, and it pertains to the military front. By our estimates, that's a pretty large opportunity and the majority of those contracts should be awarded between kind of next year and maybe 2025. And so I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the military basin that's -- on the military-based contract ops in the sense of, is that more focused on pursuing new opportunities or is it -- are you guys more focused on kind of pruning and improving the bases you have under the umbrella right now? I mean, are you guys going out and actively looking for new bases to bring underneath the American umbrella?","That's a great question, Rich. And the answer is, yes, we are. And so to back up for those that may not be quite as familiar, when you buy a base, there is typically work that goes on. It's mostly -- it's working capital predominantly. Then we have an operating -- once you win a base, you have a 50-year contract to operate on that base water and wastewater. Then, as you mentioned, it is buying new bases or doing capital upgrades on the bases.  The reason that we've seen the Military Group, for us, over the past two, three years be a little soft is because of that third category. When the Department of Defense went through three or four years of sequestration, their budget decreased signiﬁcantly. They didn't have as much money for ﬁxed capital upgrades for infrastructure. The money they did have, they put in more of the war ﬁghter training and those areas. With sequestration lifted a year or so ago, we're starting to see a little more ﬂow. It will take a bit of time for that to kind of trickle down to providing money for the infrastructure once they've met the other needs.  But you're exactly right that we have, I think, eight RFPs outstanding for bases. There is a chance that three will actually be awarded this year, and we see the rest of them being awarded over the next three to four years. As you said, we also -- there are two to three that we're looking at putting in RFPs. And to remind you, we typically only focus on the medium to larger-sized bases. Those are the ones that are worth more of our eﬀort with our size, and that tends to be $250 million or higher for a 50-year contract value. So yes, we do see opportunity speciﬁcally in the Army and the Air Force. And we actually, last November, hired a new president of our Military Services Group, General David Turner, who had recently retired as a General from the Army. And so we're very bullish on that part of our business. We like that it is regulated like, and we do, as you mentioned, see opportunity down the road for that."
