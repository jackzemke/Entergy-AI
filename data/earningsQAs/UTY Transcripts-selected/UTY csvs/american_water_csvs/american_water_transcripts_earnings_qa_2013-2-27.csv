Question,Answer
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Good morning. Ellen, congrats on your retirement and ﬁnding a worthy successor.",Thank you.
"I guess, Jeﬀ, just on this process given your whole co structure you obviously had an abundance of qualiﬁed internal candidates. So what new skill set do you believe that Susan will bring to the organization and how do you expect her to evolve the CFO position?","Yes. Very good question. What Susan brings to the table is one, senior roles in a much larger company that has strong multistate experience and her breadth of experience goes from everything from all of the fundamental services that have ﬁnancial impacts like the supply-chain and IT, et cetera, to the running of a business and the reporting of a CFO to her through that process, to being part of that management team and the ﬁnancial acumen that she developed both through her school, her schooling as well as through the roles that she had which included oversight over a number of diﬀerent functions, everything from the marketing and the derivative issues associated with that to rates.  And one of the things you will ﬁnd with Susan is that she is a very well known commodity in the regulatory community with exceptionally high marks. And so it is that breadth that she brings. And I'll say that that breadth we are able to utilize because of the strength of the ﬁnancial team that we have inside the Company.  Bill Rogers and Mark Chestlett highlight, really, our two key folks bring enormous capacity and capability in the controllers function and Mark is moving to be the Principal Accounting Oﬃcer. And in Bill's case, not just capital markets, but also because that's second nature to him because of his background, but he also brings a strategic acumen.  So I don't think about ﬁnance as a functional narrow silo. I think about ﬁnance as a resource that enables the business to be the best that it can be. And the broader base of the experience of the people that are in that area, the better able they are able -- they can provide that value while we also make sure that we have got the necessary and appropriate controls, accounting mechanisms and visibility transparency into the ﬁnancials of the Company."
"That is actually a very good answer. Thank you. And should I almost view this as a CFO position today, but likely evolving into maybe succession plans for you as well? [multiple speakers] -- successor, sorry.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   My succession plans are not even my subject. That is the Board's.  So, my objective is to ensure that when we have the opportunities to expand our skill sets, strengthen our bench, that we exercise those opportunities because they don't come around very often. And I think through a number of the hirings that we have done in the last year and a half, two years, probably with the exception of maybe them deciding to hire me, we have had great success. From Bill Rogers coming in as Treasurer to a person that we hired brought in recently to head supply change who has got a wealth of experience as VP of supply-chain in many companies from pharma to telecom to the individual we have got running our continuous improvement and process excellence, lean Six Sigma to a new head of HR.  In each of these cases we have, I believe, enhanced our bench strength that gives us the ability to look at succession in a diﬀerent way for a lot of positions. So I had the luxury of never being able to hold a job for about more than 18 months because I just kept getting moved to diﬀerent things. And the result was I learned a lot about a lot of diﬀerent pieces. That makes an executive much more eﬀective, I think, particularly at the senior level.  So to have people that have that broad-based experience, for Walter to have operated in the competitive world and now operate in the regulated world, that gives great exposure and experience to both of those markets which are diﬀerent. So any time we have the opportunity to enhance and strengthen our bench, I am all for it."
"Great. Thank you. And again, Ellen, good luck.","Thank you, very much.  Operator  Andrew Weisel, Macquarie Capital."
"Good morning. Just one question on behalf of Angie Storozynski. Regarding the ﬂow-through tax accounting for repair costs in Pennsylvania, why haven't you changed your tax accounting for that?","Let me -- if I could just step back and give a little history on this. Let me start with the fact that we adopted this in 2008 on a system wide, total Company wide basis. So we have had and will continue to have the cash beneﬁt of this since 2008.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And really that goes back to 2005, right?     Right. The extent that we could then apply any of those generated losses to prior years we were able to do that. We have created out of this plus other things that have happened over the years such as bonus depreciation. We have an NOL on our books of about $1 billion. And our goal is around maximizing cash.  So what we wanted to do and why we are under the normalization is really match when the beneﬁt is given to our customer with when we actually received the beneﬁt on our taxes. And because we have NOL and most of that beneﬁt will be in the future and that is when we are matching it with when we give the beneﬁt to our customer."
Great. Thank you.,"Let me add one thing. If you think about and the way I look at it, obviously I wasn't around when they had the foresight to take this action as early as they did, so we picked up the beneﬁt of this for our customers for now really going back to 2005. So eight years. If you think about it when you ﬂow through something, yes, it ﬂows through your income statement, but it also ﬂows through the ratemaking treatment for that year. When you normalize it, it goes over time to the shareholder and to the customer. So it links the two.  For us, given that NOL position, if we ﬂowed through, yes, you may get a bump in earnings in one year, but then you are going to reduce in the following year when you have the rate case occur. And for us, we operate in 16 states, having a process -- policy that works across all states has worked well.  We will always take a look at new approaches, but what doesn't sound very attractive to me is to give the cash back to customers when we can't get the cash from the IRS for another 10 years, because we have got the NOL carryforwards that are already keeping us from being a cash taxpayer except for AMD. So for me that is the real issue.  If we were in a diﬀerent tax position and didn't have the beneﬁt of that NOL position, we may have a diﬀerent approach to it.     And also as you can see the beneﬁt of our doing the repairs and maintenance in our cash ﬂow, it continues to grow stronger every year. And that is important to us as a company. It is important to our customers because it allows us to invest more in the infrastructure. It is important to our shareholders and customers in the sense of it is very low-cost ﬁnancing.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Well, that is what keeps us from having to issue other instruments that would be dilutive to your earnings.     That's correct."
"Added. Thank you.  Operator  Leslie Rich, JPMorgan.",
I wondered if you could go into a bit more detail on the New Jersey DSIC spending. I think you said it was $220 million of spending and I am just wondering over what period of time and how that actually rolled through the -- your rates in terms of [multiple speakers].,"Yes, let me ask Walter to --"
-- the timing of the true-up and things.,"Yes. We, in our foundational ﬁling, we said we would spend up to $220 million. That gets us to the 5% of revenue cap that we have and that is over and above the $20 million each year of base spending. So that $220 million [inaudible] every six months we will do a ﬁling and then the Commission will have 60 days to look at it and then allow us to put it on the bills. [multiple speakers].     And that's over three years, that's [multiple speakers]."
Okay.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Now we will tell you we are looking at whether some of that is -- should be advanced into a tighter period, but it will be $220 million over no more than three years."
"And then, you -- I am sorry. Could you go through the timing of how that actually rolls through rates?","Sure. Well, what happens is you ﬁle a ﬁling with the Commission so similar to New Jersey to Pennsylvania where you have a surcharge on the bill. You would have a surcharge on the bill for every six months for your ﬁling and what you are authorized to spend and approve to spend and then when you ﬁle your rate case that surcharge rolls up into the normal rate."
"Got you. Thank you.  Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.",
"Subbing in for Neil a little bit right now. Real quick, just question on the dividend. How are you thinking --? I know you kind of talked about the dividend increase, but how are you thinking about long-term dividend payout ratio policies and can you put that in conjunction with your view on credit metrics, target credit ratings and how you are thinking about managing capital overall over a multiyear period?","Let me address the dividends and have Ellen address that relative to the credit metrics. From the dividend side, our philosophy and belief is that because it is always a trade-oﬀ between what do you -- how you can invest that cash and how you can return that cash and the balance between the two is we have targeted the payout ratio in the 50% to 60% range and to have the dividend grow at something close to what our rate of increase in earnings per share is.  If you look at the early years after the Company came back into the public markets, the dividend probably lagged a little bit and so we took a step of an additional increase last year. We are now, frankly, a little below the 50% payout ratio and the yield has gone down as our stock has been bid up. We view that positively, but we also will look at that long-term philosophy of paying 50% to 60% relative to how we go about dividend decisions in 2013 and forward.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      A couple of things to note. Our cash ﬂow continues to get much stronger. That has helped contribute to covering our capital and also our dividends. Our shareholder base looks at a combination of both growth in the stock and growth in the dividend and we will continue to look at dividend growth in terms of the right balance for our shareholder, as well as for the Company so that we can reinvest that money back into the business.  I would also like to add that because of the strong cash ﬂow that we have had and our known dividend policy, both rating agencies have put us on positive outlook. So we continue to see the beneﬁt of our focus around this area.     And just to reinforce what Ellen said, our focus there is on cash. Not cap structure. It is not that we don't look at cap structure, we do. But it used to be that you had to really focus on cap structure and think about getting to a 50-50 or what have you to be at the BBB plus or to move up into the A category.  I think the rating agencies in one sense are more focused and smarter about what they really ought to be looking at is the cash ﬂow and the security of that cash ﬂow, while you have boundaries around the cap structure that probably aren't as tight as they were before. So we are not focused on thickening the equity ratio for the sole purpose of getting an increase in rating. It is just that there's just not value there. But all the things we are doing to drive cash ﬂow improvement, those will have the same impact, we believe, with the rating agencies.     And if I could also add to, our equity ratio continues to strengthen based upon the strength of our earnings. So as of year end we are a little bit above 44% equity where we started much lower three years ago.     Yes. I think there used to be some analysts who were always nervous that, well, we are going to issue equity to thicken [ph] the equity ratio and that's just not we see no need to do that."
"Got it. Thanks. Much appreciated.  Operator  [Operator Instructions] Gerry Sweeney, Boenning.",
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   -- on the retirement. Quick question for you, Jeﬀ. Obviously with the hiring of Susan Story she has got a lot of services experience and you have talked about in the past always looking for some regulated-like programs. Are we going to see a little bit more additional focus in coming years on this and maybe to rephrase it or to put it a diﬀerent way, what is your vision and strategy for this, the market-based opportunities? How is that going to develop and I sense there's stuﬀ percolating under the surface, but I wanted to see what your thoughts were.","Relative to our market-based businesses it is a small but important and growing part of our business. We demonstrated 16% increase year over year to '12 and I think it was higher than that in '11 to '12. Let me adjust that. '10 to '11. So it is an important part of the business, but it is not going to grow to be 30% of the business. It would have to grow exceptionally rapidly to just double its impact on our bottom line.  We are focused on reg-like kinds of things so certainly the businesses that we are in which include the military services, the homeowner services, a revamped Contract Services group because we have talked about how we are not going to participate in the old traditional kinds of short-term-based Contract Services groups. Plus doing more frankly on the waste management side. As we expand in wastewater we see more opportunities in solid waste management -- and I don't mean trash, I mean the solid waste, the solids that come from wastewater as well as reuse. Which is eﬀectively using the liquids that come from wastewater. So those we view, I think about it in terms of logical business line extensions.  At the same time, one of the things that we went out and said very early on was we are going to make sure that we get very good inside before we ever try to take anything outside. Because, otherwise, it is a great recipe to get bad bigger -- bigger bad and not get better. And so as we increase, for example, our supply chain capabilities, is that something that we could also bring to the beneﬁt of customers that are utilities, municipal utilities that don't have access to the things we do. Does it open other doors for us?  Those are things that we will explore, but I wouldn't -- I don't expect there to be dramatic change in our risk proﬁle in the way that we think about the balance of our regulated business versus our competitive business. But do expect that that focus on excellence will give us -- will open doors for what I'll call business line extensions where you have adjacent opportunities rather than completely new opportunities."
"And any comments on the revamped contract business? Obviously there is always talk about the 50,000 plus water systems in the US. There's pension issues, there's healthcare issues in terms of payment of liabilities.  Another thing that is sort of percolating under the surface, you see it now in TAM [ph]. Thoughts on how that is developing.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   You know, I think from day one, at least when I came I kind of expressed the sentiment that a number of my senior level cohorts here had which is, this is a slow market to develop. It reminded me of the old fuel cell issue that fuel cells will be here in ﬁve years, but it is always another ﬁve years. But I do believe that it has changed some because of the persistency, the persistence of the ﬁnancial issue. And whether it is driven by pension, whether it is just remember the lack of revolving fund access from the Federal government, the shrinking of that pod, the almost complete dearth of grants from the Federal government and states being in the same situation, I think communities are having to face a diﬀerent set of challenges.  And if they are interested in having someone like us operate their systems and be a part of their community, we are going to be very interested in doing that. Whether we do that under an acquisition which is generally a preference on our side because it ﬁts with what we do well or it is done under a longer-term contract, we are willing to look at that.  So I think there are more cracks [ph]. I mean we even in last year we acquired some municipal systems. I expect that that will happen this year. And so I think we will see more instead of the private tuck-ins we will see a little more on the municipal side, but it is just -- it is still not going to be, barn gates get opened."
"Sure, I mean, from my perspective I would look it as an incremental growth avenue one [multiple speakers] in a good year, something like that.",Absolutely.
"All right. Thank you, very much.  Operator  Jonathan Reeder, Wells Fargo.",
"Good morning. Hey, Ellen, congrats on the upcoming retirement. I am truly jealous, but you have done some great work and it is bringing native EK [ph] back to the public market in 2008. So it is well-deserved.","Well, thank you and I also want to thank you and everyone on the phone for their continued support for American Water. It's a great company.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      And, Jonathan, I want to understand if you actually wore what you're supposed to wear the week about a week ago after the football game."
"Yes I am still paying oﬀ that bet unfortunately. Most of my questions have been asked already this morning, but Jeﬀ, are you targeting any sort of improvement in the O&M ratio in 2013? I know you have the 2015 goal that you said you may even hit two years early which would be by the end of this year, but you have any sort of internal target that we might want to build into the model?","Well, there's -- until you said the last phrase it was a one word answer. So there's two. The answer is yes, but, no, I am not going to tell you. .  I don't mean to be funny or ﬂip about it, but we do have obviously have a number of targets that we focus on internally they're not -- they have caveats and they have got ties and so it gets too complicated to try to explain all of those to the external market. So, but rest assured, we do have targets and I feel good about the progress we will continue to make on that front and that we will beat the 40% by the end of 2015 by one or two years."
Okay and then I don't know if you can talk about the usage that you saw in 2012 absent the weather. Was it similar to what you're forecasting going into the year which I think was a client of 7 -- or 0.7% to 0.8% on the residential side?,"Historically what we have seen in terms of decline is about 1.5% to 2.5%. It is diﬃcult to pull that out in any time frame, but in the oﬀ months we do continue to see some decline.     Although it is less -- it does -- we may see some leveling of that."
So your expectation for 2013 --,It builds into [multiple speakers].   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      It builds into the 2013 number.
"Okay. All right, thank you very much.  Operator  I show no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks.","Let me just thank you all for joining us today. I want to thank Ellen again for everything that she has done for the Company and I am going to give her the last word.     All right. With that, this is a ﬁrst. I just, again, I want to thank each and every one of you for listening to this call, for your continued support of American Water, for your in-depth questions. They have kept us on our toes and you are continuing to push us and as we become each year a better and better company. So thank you.
