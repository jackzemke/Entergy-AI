Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning team. Let me just pile on here. Congratulations truly. It's been a pleasure and more importantly, I wish you all the best in the adventures that come.",Thank you Julian.
"Absolutely, and perhaps just to turn it back to our regularly tuned program here. I appreciate the commentary. If we can talk about PFAS in brief and I want to break this into a couple of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   diﬀerent pieces. First, with respect to military sites, I know you guys have been obviously very involved for a while. This PFAS start to change the opportunity set for your existing sites and secondly, does it change the opportunity set for incremental sites and/or accelerate those opportunities in terms of bases that may or may not be looking at opportunities including yourself.  And then separately, coming back to PFAS more holistically, I know EPA is looking at setting perhaps updated targets and to what extent could either a state and more importantly federal level eﬀorts and I know a lot of the speciﬁc states you guys operate in already, have been looking at or have already instituted more speciﬁc and stringent targets, does that change the name of the game, and I know we talked about this a few months ago at your Analyst Day, but again, even in that short period of time, it seems like the conversation has evolved.","Julien, that's a great question and I will start and then Walter can pick up after this. So you're right. Let me take the ﬁrst one about the military bases, because as we know that a majority of the source of PFAS our ﬁreﬁghting foam and many military installations through the years of course doing exercises and those type of things, tend to have a concentration, the Department of Defense is actively working at its bases to determine if and whether they have issues. We have, as you noted, already done work on two of our military bases. We have been working on PFAS for well over a decade, we are able to treat it successfully. We've done so at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey, for example, so we're working with the bases that we serve in order to help look at what do they have and then we feel certain that we're able to treat those, and remember that with military bases that we can with the newer bases actually every year, instead of every two years, go in, look at the assets, look at something above and beyond what we bid on to begin with and we have the ability to change those O&M contracts to recover those costs. So from that standpoint, we'll be working on that over the next several months to work with those bases to do that.  The second thing about the EPA and updated target, so keep in mind that EPA has two classiﬁcations, one's called maximum contaminant level and there is close to 100 contaminants that they basically say, this is a regulation you must meet these. Then, they have something called a health advisory, that actually doesn't have the weight of required adherence to that. Believe it or not, PFAS is actually not an MCL or maximum contaminant level, it's a health advisory and right now, they're looking at 70 parts per trillion, that's what they have. What they're looking at doing is quantifying that, making it an MCL, so that they do have the weight of required compliance behind it.  There is a lot of questions as you said about levels and we're seeing the diﬀerent states: New Jersey, for example, has 13 or 14 parts per trillion based on the type of PFA it is; we're seeing New York look at it; California is looking at it; several states are; we at American Water are working closely with the EPA very closely, we think it's better to have one for the entire country, we can treat to whatever level is needed, it is an expense issue as we go through there, plus some capital investment and how we treat that.  So it is a growing ﬁeld, it is a ﬁeld in which we believe we have tremendous expertise, we are an advisor to the EPA on this issue and we will be as we go down this road and we look at what the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   ﬁnalization of these targets are, we can look at what impact that would have to our investment levels as well as what would have to O&M.     And just to add a little bit to that Susan, we treat in each of our states to the health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, unless the state has a more stringent requirement and then we treat to that, so it's just California and New Jersey and New York. So that's how we address it, but as Susan said, we are working with the EPA to make sure that we put our views in there about what we think the MCL should be and it's going to take, I think, some time for the EPA to go through the testing protocols to determine the MCL, but we're going to continue again to treat at 70 parts per trillion or less if the state as a more stringent requirement."
"Got it. And just a quick follow-up, does that change the municipal acquisition opportunity as best you see it with that triggering, sort of the follow-up, I know it's a lot of question.","Yeah, I think that's going to be just part of the pie as far as opportunities for us to provide solutions for communities. If they have issues with PFAS, I mean they are looking at the cost to treat that or other options and may be shutting down the facility and tying in ours, I think it does provide opportunities for us. Yes."
"I'll leave it there. Thank you again and again, Best of luck.","Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning team.",Hi Durgesh.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Susan, I will miss you a lot and it's been an absolute pleasure. Congrats again.",Thank you.
"Just going back, can I follow up on Julien's questions on the PFAS. Can you just remind us what level of capex do we have in the current, I guess your 5-year outlook or 10-year outlook as it relates to PFAS.","It's considered to be part of the kind of normal capex we do. When you look at the chart, for example, and you look at Water Quality, it falls into that the piece of the pie for water quality, so as we go forward and we look at the magnitude of what the requirements could be, it could either take a bigger piece of the pie, or we could move to make the pie bigger just depends on the magnitude."
"Okay, thanks. And then just can I go back, real quickly, maybe this is for Susan Hardwick. The (inaudible), other number for $0.13 to $0.12 increase quarter-over-quarter, it seems very large, is that all interest expense driven or are there other items in there?","It's primarily interest and just to recall that during the year we issued about $1 billion worth of long-term debt. That's the primary driver.     And when you see the employee-related expense, actually this is something that we are very positive about, if you remember we reached an agreement with our unions last year and we include all of our union represented employees, which is about 47%-48% of our employees into our annual performance plan with bonuses based on the performance of the company, 2019 was the ﬁrst year, the ﬁrst full year that we actually had that accrual for all of the union represented employees, so the majority of those employee-related costs are based on that. So that's why year-over-year it looks higher because that's an additional call."
"Okay, perfect. And then just real quick one. In the New York American sale, that's still scheduled to sort of close second half of this year.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hey Durgesh, Walter. Yeah, we're progressing as expected on that and we said we'll probably close at the end of this year or the beginning of 2021, but it is progressing as expected."
Okay. Thanks again.  Operator  Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,
"Hey, guys. Once again, Susan. I don't mean to sound like or repeat myself from comments made at the Analyst Day, but congratulations you've done an excellent job in running this company over the years.",Thank you Michael.
"I do have one question, where do you think, across your system, you have the greatest challenges to earn authorized ROEs and what are the steps over the next two to three years, Walter do you plan to do either from a regulatory construct or cost management eﬀort or something else to improve the earned returns in those jurisdictions.","Hey, Michael, Walter. We're happy in each of the states where we're operating and as far as being treated fairly, I think we're being treated fairly in the states where we operate, so not going to really comment on the authorized ROEs or the earned ROEs in any of the states, but we're very happy where we're operating. I think going forward, it's part of our culture to look at every dollar in our business and that's I think what sets us apart. If you look at the O&M eﬃciency, improvements that we've had, every dollar that we spend our teams are out challenging do we need to spend that dollar, is there a beneﬁt to our customers and so it's that culture I think is driving our O&M eﬃciency in the right way. I think we're going to continue to leverage technology and technology has been a key enabler for us and will continue to be a key enabler going forward, making our employees more eﬃcient, providing better service for our customers, so we're going to continue to leverage that as we move forward as well.     You know, one thing that was interesting. I was reading our supply chain report from year-end 2019 and they track something called total cost of ownership that looks at from negotiations, has been able to use volume procurement, they call it a total cost of ownership, we actually last year almost saved $80 million just in supply chain, from that area called total cost of ownership   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   and I think that is a good representative of what Walter is talking about, in addition to our folks in the technology, just leveraging our size, scope and scale and being smart on supply chain."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.  Operator  Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning. Susan and team, just want to echo everyone else's remarks congrats, deﬁnitely going to miss you and hopefully the Tigers treat you well in your retirement.","Well, I'll send you my personal email, so we have to do college football season between Notre Dame and Auburn."
"Deﬁnitely, you might come out on top on most of that. Two questions from me. First of all, Walter, maybe this one is for you, tell us when it comes to capital update, as the public advocates oﬃce weighed oﬃcially with the CPUC in regard to your request or have you had any (Technical Diﬃculty) application here in the next few months.","Actually having a hard time hearing you. I think it was on the cost of capital and we're going to be ﬁling, the proposed plan is to ﬁle in May of 2021 for 2022, so we're going to be at the current cost of capital this year and next year. What was another part of the question?"
"So are you saying, did you get the one-year extension then, was it accepted?","No, we just ﬁled for it, but the expectation would be that the cost of capital would be in place for this year and next year, if we get it approved."
"Right, I was wondering if the public advocates oﬃce, have they weighed in on your request or have you been having active settlement discussions with them to try to get them on board of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   the request and how should we think about the timing of the CPUC decision in that request.","Yeah, there has not been any oﬃcial decision on it, so it's just our ﬁling in the hopes that we can delay it for a year."
"Okay, but the consumer advocate, have they weighed in at all or are you actively trying to get them on board with that request, like what's kind of going on behind the scenes?","Yeah, that's part of the ﬁling is working with them and putting our views out there, but they have not oﬃcially made a decision on."
"Okay. And then the other question, I know you had the $0.03 legacy investment sale, but just to be clear 2019s $3.61, that reﬂects a $0.04 headwind from below normal weather for the full year. That's correct. Right.","Yeah, Jonathan. That's correct."
"Okay, great. Thanks so much and again, Susan enjoy the oﬀ time and deﬁnitely look forward to staying in touch.","Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session.
