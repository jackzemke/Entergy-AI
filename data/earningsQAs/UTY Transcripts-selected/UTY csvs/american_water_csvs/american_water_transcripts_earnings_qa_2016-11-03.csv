Question,Answer
"Hey, Susan. How are you?","Hi, Steve. Good. How are you doing today?"
"Doing great. So, just one question, this just maybe a technicality, but I didn't see your kind of 7% to 10% growth slide that you normally have in the slide deck. So, just wanted to clarify. Is the 7% to 10% growth still the growth rate through 2020?","Yes. 7% to 10%, 2020 and our long-term growth at 7% to 10%, and on December 15, we'll rollout what we're looking at over the next ﬁve years."
"Okay. Great. And I'm just curious, the upcoming election kind of from the water sector standpoint. Is there any real diﬀerence in your view in terms of policy on who wins in the election and anything that we should be kind of watching?","Steve, really not. Both candidates have expressed support for infrastructure investment. I think both candidates have expressed support for public-private partnership. So, speciﬁcally in the water industry where there are a number of governmental entities. I, co-chaired with Doug Peterson, the CEO of S&P Global, earlier in the year for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a template. And we had an advisory council of political ﬁgures, former mayors and political ﬁgures, Democrats and Republicans, who are all advocating for public-private partnerships, because there simply won't be enough federal monies to do the infrastructure investment we need in this country for water and wastewater transportation.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   The Clinton's campaign has come out and talked about a water innovation center. The Trump campaign has talked about infrastructure investment. So, we believe that whoever wins the election, the focus will remain on infrastructure and the role of private industry to be part of that renaissance of infrastructure investment for the country."
"And then just ﬁnally, in all your kind of key states, is there any kind of election or kind of issues or proposals or things like that, that we should be watching?","No. Actually, the opposite. In our states, we have states with lots of representation from Democrats, Republicans, and we have – they're all great states. So, what we are – when we look actually, and Walter can comment on this, what we're actually seeing are positive legislative eﬀorts, given the attention that's given to infrastructure investment. We're actually seeing the opposite. We're really seeing support from both sides of the aisle on solutions that can help us solve some of the water and wastewater infrastructures issues.  Walter, do you want to comment?     Yes, Susan. All across our footprint, we're seeing positive legislation from Indiana and Illinois to New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But really all the states are encouraging us to invest in our infrastructure and making sure that we have enablers to acquire systems as well. So, we're seeing very positive movement in each of our states."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. So, I wanted to ask about the municipal acquisitions that you have announced. Is there any rule of thumb about the earnings in fact, per se the 1,000 accounts acquired, and also how does it track versus your prior expectations on an annual basis, how many accounts you're adding? Because it feels to us like you've more than doubled the prior goals in additions of customer accounts.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","So, Angie, let me start – this is Linda. Let me start, the way that this works is that once we acquire a system, it goes through regulatory approvals by the PSC in that state. Once that approval is obtained, then we would include the acquisition in our next rate case. And so, there is a bit of regulatory lag from the time that we get the approval to the time that it's included in a rate case proceeding. That rate case proceeding then will determine the amount of rate base that we are authorized to earn a return on. And so, that's really the process that it goes through.     And Angie, it's Walter, speaking to the acquisition pipeline and some of the deals we've announced, what we're doing is providing solutions for communities. And when communities have issues and they're looking for somebody to come in and buy their systems, we are the natural acquirer. I think the legislation in each of the states are key enablers for us to do this, and we're seeing that play out across our footprint. But particularly in Pennsylvania as I noted, with two large acquisitions, Scranton Sewer Authority and then the Authority of McKeesport, we're providing solutions for these communities and they're turning to us, because we have the expertise and the ﬁnancial wherewithal to be able to buy the systems and operate them properly and make sure they're protected for years going forward."
But do you feel like it's the beginning of a real consolidation of the water sector that we've been waiting for many number of decades now?,"Well, I think you've seen a pretty big increase in the number of deals that we've announced and we're – I mean, we're in discussions with the number of communities as we've said, and we're here to provide solutions and we're conﬁdent that we can do that."
"But is this, I mean – okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Angie, this is Susan. I thank your question. So, to your point, we've been talking about this – people have been talking about this for years, and that's one reason, I know we can get questions about, is this – the 1% to 2% still good on the triangle, those types of things. We're going to watch and see. We've had an extraordinary year, we think the pipeline looks very healthy, and we want to look and see what happens and we monitor it very carefully in all of our states. We are seeing more interest than we've seen, but whether that translates into X-percent more growth, that's what we're looking at and really putting our pencil to the paper to see what we'll see. I think when we see what happens in 2017 that will inform us more, is this suddenly the ﬂoodgate starting to have a little more ﬂow. Hopefully it is, the indications are positive, but we'll just have to see.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"And is it just – I mean, it sounds like most of the acquisitions are happening in the Pennsylvania, and then this one in New Jersey. Is this trend for now limited to these two states?","No. Not limited to the two, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. We are in discussions with others in other states, but these are just the ones that we've been able to announce here recently. But our teams are working in each of the states, looking for solutions to provide for these municipalities. And again..."
"I'm sorry. But you are staying only – but you're only seeking municipal acquisitions in the states where you already operate, right? So, there is no venturing into other states?","Well, what we have always said, Angie, is that we're very interested in our states growing, we are constantly looking at the landscape, and we have three hurdles when we look at whether we would enter a new state; the ﬁrst one is, what is the regulatory climate; the second one is, what is the business climate and are they open to private water; and the third is, do we see a line of sight to get to at least 50,00 customers within ﬁve years. So, those are our gates and we're constantly looking across the country. We write every state based on those three. So, we would not disclose if we had any activity until there was signed agreements, but we are always looking beyond our states. But right now, our focus – we're seeing a lot of opportunity.  To your point about, it only seems – it seems mostly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Pennsylvania is where we have the most mature laws that are favorable for this. Act 11, which was passed the 2012, maybe 2013, and then of course Act 12, which we are seeing more on the fair value legislation across the country. But I think you're seeing a state that has been more mature in some of the enabling legislative eﬀorts that have been translated into regulatory policies. And so, we are looking towards seeing more activity in other states as their legislation, enabling legislation becomes more mature."
Perfect. Thank you.,"Thanks, Angie.  Operator  Our next question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
Hi. Good morning.,"Hi, Brian."
"Just a question on the acquisitions again. On slide 12 you broke out agreements reached, approvals granted and acquisitions closed. Given that Scranton was reached – an agreement was reached last year, could you just deﬁne a little bit more clearly, when we say 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers, is that agreements reached, is that approvals granted, is that acquisitions – because the three categories can startle over a year. So, can you just be a little bit more speciﬁc in terms of what you're including in that 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers?","Right. That 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers translates into the approximate customer amount to reach our 1% to 2% earnings per share growth in that regulated acquisition portion of our growth triangle. So, what that means is, as I mentioned earlier, there is a process that we go through with the acquisition which starts with the regulatory approval and other types of environmental approvals, if necessary. We then go through the regulatory rate case process to include this in our earnings, and it's really when it gets to the 1% to 2% of earnings that it would count."
So -,"So Brian, I think how are we classifying these. So, a city or a municipality does an RFP. Okay. We're the successful bidder. We don't put it into that pending at that point, only after we've negotiated, done our due diligence, negotiated an agreement from the time we get a signed agreement is when we put it into that pending. Then, once we sign the agreement, you get regulatory approval, and then typically you close. Sometimes like Scranton, there is another step, because they were under a consent decree from the EPA, additionally we're having to get a couple of environmental permit. So, the quick answer is, when we put something in the pending, it's because we have a signed agreement. We've gone through the RFP, we've done due diligence, we've signed to the terms. There, all we're waiting on typically from that point on is regulatory approval which can typically take six months. Does that help?"
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. So, if I think about it properly, what you're basically saying is, don't focus necessarily on which transaction gets included in which year by customer count. It's just that the loose 30,000 customers to 60,000 customers should translate to roughly 1% to 2% customer growth, even if the deﬁnition of agreements reached or approvals granted or acquisitions closed might be a little bit in ﬂux from year-to-year. Is that the right way to think about that?","That's exactly right. And again, that's why we do ﬁve years with a triangle. The 1% to 2%, you need to average it. But again, we want it, we're trying to be more clear, which is why we put this slide in here, so you could see what exactly does this mean. What is really closed, what you're waiting on, what is it mean when you put in that bucket. We don't want to included as pending until we have pretty strong assurance it's going to go through, which is why we don't include anything until we have a signed agreement on the terms with the municipality."
"Great. And then one last question. I know you touched on this a little bit earlier, but in terms of just your conﬁdence with regards to the acquisition and overall regulated growth outlook, I know we're going to get more detail at the conference coming up, but do you feel more conﬁdent in terms of the possibilities that are out there versus, say, a year ago when you did the last analyst conference?","Yes. I mean, it all ties back as we're talking here, the 1% to 2%, we're conﬁdent that we're going to be able to deliver 1% to 2% customer growth through acquisitions."
Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Brian.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Real quickly on the Market-Based segments. This has been a tough year in terms of growth. Can you talk about whether that business you think still is able to ﬁt the growth target overall or do you see the utility business is growing at faster than 7% to 10%, but the Market-Based Businesses maybe grows a little bit slower than 7% to 10%?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Michael, you always ask such good questions. The answer is, we are – as I said talking earlier, we're very committed to the Market-Based Businesses that we're in. Speciﬁcally for American Water Enterprises, predominantly you have Homeowner Services and you have the Military. The capital upgrades business that Linda talked about is a big part of that. But the big diﬀerence is that in Military, while some of those infrastructure budgets may continue to be under some pressure, the pipeline for new bases that are issuing RFPs or who have RFPs out there, they're signiﬁcant. We have seen army pretty much, pretty active in the past several years. The Air Force over the past couple of three years has gotten even more active. So, there is a robust pipeline in the Military for new bases to win. So, that's why we remain bullish on the Military Services.  Homeowner Services is doing well. There are more municipalities who are interested in partnership opportunities for these home warranties that we oﬀer. So, we feel really good about it. And then on the Keystone Clearwater, everybody – and gosh, Goldman, you guys are really doing a great job of monitoring the natural gas and oil markets. So, you know that things are picking up. We're very proud that through the worst of it that our organization, our business was able to stay EPS neutral. That is a huge deal and it shows a lot about how they kept going in some of the services they were able to provide during the downturn. So, yes, the Market-Based Businesses we're in, we are committed to.  Now, we have always said that at our core, we are a regulated utility, period. We will stay that way. Currently, anywhere from 9% to 10% of our revenue, net income comes from Market- Based, little less this year. So, we will not see that grow beyond 15% to 20% and probably closer to the – up to 15%, unless there is something extremely regulated-like, if we win every new military base, for example, and that helps us and it's more regulated-like. But right now, we are committed that the Market-Based Businesses have a limited role in the overall growth of our company and the majority of our growth will always come from our capital investment in our Regulated Business as well as regulated acquisition that then turns into more capital investment into our business."
"Susan, that was super helpful. I want to make sure I can summarize that back.",Okay. Go.
"It was a lot. I'm just trying to digest. I'm going back to the transcript, if it were out already. Market-Based Business grows faster than the overall total EPS growth rate for the company, albeit, maybe not as fast as what you've seen prior to this year.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   I think that's a nice summary. Wow. I could have saved a lot of time, if I have just said that, right?"
"One follow-up. How are you thinking? Company has gotten bigger. Your regulated rate base, your regulated earnings power has improved signiﬁcantly with rate increases, cost management, et cetera. How are you thinking about dividend and dividend policy, especially, if you remain in that kind of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion a year in capital deployed? It would imply that with higher earnings, you'd have kind of a little better cash ﬂow, both with similar CapEx levels. Are you thinking there is potential for dividend growth, maybe do exceed earnings growth or for an upgrade or uptick in the dividend payout ratio policy?","Well, I'll start and then let Linda contribute. So, on the positive side, we're already really high in the top-quartile of dividend growers in utility space. We have said that we have a 50% to 60% payout ratio target and we remain at the lower end of that. So, we have room within our current payout ratio target to grow, the answer to your last question that you asked.  We look at every dollar and the best way to use that dollar. Reinvesting in our capital programs for the beneﬁt of our customers will always be ﬁrst and dividends, of course, are right up there. So, we also look at other investments. Are there other ways to grow? Do we look at things like – I mean, the very bottom of our list by the way is buybacks. We think that we should have plenty of opportunities to invest in our business.  We look at dividends. We look at reﬁnancing debt. All of those things we think have far more value to our shareholders than the latter. So, we right now see ourselves continuing to have our dividend growth commensurate with our EPS growth. However, we also are very happy that over the past four years, we've had double-digit dividend increase and still remain at the bottom of our payout range."
Got it.,"And, Michael, I would add to that that we continue to look at our cash ﬂow from operations, which is strong and which in our ﬁve-year plan is expected to exceed our capital expenditures in 2018."
"Got it. Thank you. Much appreciate it, guys.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thanks, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from David Carter (49:12) of Baird. Please go ahead.  Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could provide a little commentary on what you're seeing in terms of fair value legislation. Do you see a catching on more broadly across your service area and – yeah, what are your expectations there?     Yeah. This is Walter. We have that fair market legislation, fair value legislation in six of our states now. And we do see a catching on, because it's just another enabler for us to go out and acquire systems and pay the fair market value which gives the mayors, the communities' options if they're looking to monetize assets. So, we do think it's got momentum and you can see just in the last couple of years, how it's expanded across United States and so many of our acquisitions are tied to that fair market legislation. So, it is working as well.     Yeah. And one thing too – this is Susan, David. (50:05). This is really a diﬀerentiator for the water utility sector compared to other utilities, because these fair market legislation initiatives really only cover water and wastewater and they tend to be also for distressed water systems, which is back to the whole infrastructure issue nationally that we have with municipalities."
Excellent. Thank you guys very much.,Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats, Susan. Auburn is surprising a little bit this year. So, I'm sure you're happy there.","Jonathan, I won't talk about Notre Dame.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Yeah. Please don't. At least, a lot of those fans are Cubs fans too, so they have a little solace there. But I wanted to follow just a bit on Angie's – your response to Angie's question. So, for the Scranton and the McKeesport deal, from a modeling perspective, we shouldn't really be expecting any earnings impact until the next Pennsylvania rate case. Is that the way to kind of think about that?","So what happens is, once we receive regulatory approval and we close on the deals, then we begin collecting the existing rates under this system. And so, we look at that for the interim period, and generally what we do in the interim period before a rate case is we will ﬁnance that acquisition with shorter-term debt. Then we will go through the regulatory process and that will determine the amount that gets on rate – gets into rate base upon which we would earn our return or have the opportunity to earn our return."
"Okay. So, maybe you're not earning the same ROE as the rest of the business, but you are earning a return and you kind of help enhance that a little bit by doing the short-term ﬁnancing in the meantime. Is that accurate?","Yeah. And John, part of – that's right. And part of what we go through is we look at speciﬁc metrics that each of these acquisitions need to meet those ﬁnancial hurdles and generally accretion is one of those metrics."
"Okay. And then, can you remind us what would be the timing of the next Pennsylvania rate case?","So, we do not make that public."
"When was your last, I guess, rate case ﬁled, how about that, for Pennsylvania? I don't think, it's been in the last 12 months.",Yeah. It's been two years.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)
"It's been two years, so kind of coming out and – I mean, is it fair to say, getting those two large systems into rate base might be a catalyst as well?","So, we look at a multitude of factors to determine the timing of our rate cases, and we take all of that into consideration when we look at timing, Jonathan. But you are an excellent questioner, Jonathan."
"All right. Thanks for that. And then, the other question I had just – the $10 million of O&M expense for Q4 is – did you say that's being pulled forward from 2017?","No. That's actually timing diﬀerences between primarily the third quarter, but also ﬁrst quarter and second quarter, and has moved into the fourth quarter."
Okay. All right. Thanks for the clarity. I appreciate it.,"Absolutely.     Thanks, Jonathan.  Operator  Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, everyone.","Hi, Shar.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"So, just one question. Can you remind us if the regulated acquisition, the trajectory of 1% to 2%, includes any stormwater? And if not, is that sort of an opportunity that can move the needle and where is that opportunity set?","Shar, no, it doesn't. First of all, the stormwater is an interesting area nationally that's been looked at, and really for us, the ﬁrst place we're looking at that is on military bases. We've had a couple of our bases where we serve water and wastewater, who have indicated an interest. So, we're working through the Department of Defense as to whether that can fall under the preview that they got to their privatization language and legislation, which we believe it does, the senate and – the senators and the congressmen believe it does, but I think they're going through the lawyers and the Department of Defense to get comfortable with it.  So I think what you would ﬁnd is, stormwater is part of the water cycle. We are looking at how that would look. So, for us, we're continuing to look at stormwater, but our foray into that would most probably come through our military bases, and it's our ability to take that part over along with water and wastewater."
Okay. Got it. So little bit ways oﬀ?,Yes.
Excellent. Thanks. That was it.,"Wow. Thank you, Shar.  Operator  Our next question comes from Tim Winter of Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead."
Good morning and congratulations on the quarter and year-to-date results.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thanks, Tim."
I wanted to follow up on the fair value legislation and the process. At what point does the fair value assessment take place and is that made public?,"Every state is a little bit diﬀerent, Tim, but typically after an asset purchase agreement is signed and then there are appraisers that are hired by the city and by us, and then there is an – typically an averaging of those appraisals, and it is public at some point. Yes, but that's typically the process, the average of a couple of appraisals."
"So, in the instance of McKeesport, when will that take place or has it?","We're actually hiring our appraisers now. So, we're doing it and then the city is doing it as well. That's where we are in the process."
"Okay. And as we consider the accretion process for these acquisitions, I mean, how would you characterize the level of synergies that you can achieve as you go into the next Pennsylvania rate case?","Lot of factors involved, and it's all based on local operations and the synergies that we can get from those, but there obviously are synergies, particularly when we're buying wastewater systems in areas where we serve water systems. And that's really key to our strategy is to be able to take advantages of those synergies to beneﬁt our customers.     And Tim, I'd add to that. As we look at the way that we're structured overall from the American Water perspective, we really leverage the size and scale of our company to be able to provide synergies across the business in terms of back oﬃce support, ﬁnance, HR, legal, as well as our supply chain.     We see that as a big diﬀerentiator of supply chain and the purchasing power that we have. And I'd like to highlight the examples on these calls and in individuals meetings, but it's a huge   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   advantage that we have I think in this business."
Okay.  Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.,"Thank you. First of all, thank you all for participating today and your excellent questions. This was a great discussion. If you have any further questions, please call Ed or Melissa, and they'll be happy to help you. We really hope to see all of you on December 15 at our Investor Conference. We will – as you all know, we have a new Head of Keystone, Dan Dalton, who has been the President and COO for several years. We also have a new Head of our Market-Based Business, Deb Degillio. You'll get to meet them.  So I think – and of course, what's old is new again, which is Ed Vallejo back in his role as VP of Investor Relations as well as Financial Planning and Analysis. So, we look forward to seeing all of you and we appreciate all your support. And if there is anything we can do to help you understand our story better, please let us know. Thank you.
