Question,Answer
"Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the infrastructure surcharge and the new rates coming on to the P&L. And if I read the slides correctly, you've got more than $40 million worth of DSIC and other surcharges that are coming on to the P&L in the ﬁrst half, which puts that DSIC revenue, if my calculations are right, upwards somewhere around 1.5% of total consolidated sales, which is a pretty high number relative to the historical average.  So can you just talk a little bit about transitioning those rates across your system from DSIC and surcharges over to base rates? And whether that's – as this becomes a bigger and bigger part of the business, DSIC and surcharges, is that a seamless process, or will that create complications that were not there in the traditional setup of a regular general rate case cycle?","Ryan, this is Linda. Thank you for the question. Great question. This is actually a pretty smooth transition from the DSIC mechanisms to the general rate cases. Because, generally, these types of mechanisms are really set up for the purpose that we will be able to continue to make these   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   investments in an ongoing basis in our much needed infrastructure upgrades. And so, that's really the purpose of it, and then they roll into the general rate cases.  It also allows us to spread out the time between general rate cases and smoothe the impact of our capital investments on our customer rates."
"Okay. And then, I know that most of these DSIC-type mechanisms actually have a return on equity component to them. Is that typically equal to what you expect to receive in a given state when you move from a surcharge over to a base rate?","Typically, it is. I mean, every state is a little bit diﬀerent, but typically it's the same."
"Okay. And then my other question was a little bigger picture in terms of the new fair value legislation. Obviously, you have the Act 12 in Pennsylvania, and Walter, you mentioned ﬁve diﬀerent states now.  I'm just wondering whether this is really catching on more broadly. I know we've just had the NARUC Summer Meetings. I believe, Walter, you were there. And curious whether that's something that's getting a lot of play in the hallways and whatnot, and whether we might see other states move in a similar direction or whether this will maintain – stay pretty niche- oriented?","Yeah. Ryan, thanks for that question. We are seeing us catching on in many of the states, and you can see that by each of the states adopting it. And what it really does is providing a center for municipalities to look to monetize their assets to be able to provide a fair market through the systems.  And before this, we could pretty much only pay original cost minus depreciation. And then anything above that, we got a risk for us getting in rate base. So this just works for everybody. And it is getting a lot of traction in each of the states where we operate. And you can see that from the slide that we had up there, ﬁve of our big states have fair market legislation.     And, Ryan, so the driver for this, just like Walter and Linda said, the reason that this is for water is because there is a recognition that, with ever-increasing infrastructure need, ever-increasing retirement, smaller systems increasing water quality standards, there's a general concern, do we have the ability to meet the need of water and wastewater systems? And Public Service Commission also are residents of the states they're in. So, even if in many states municipalities   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   aren't regulated by the PSC, the recognition of water and wastewater challenges is shared by everyone.  So we do ﬁnd that, in many of our states, the Commission are concerned about water quality, water issues, along with their governmental entities. And the whole point here is to oﬀer optionality to municipalities, so that whatever works for them and their citizens, they have the options to do. And fair market legislation just helps out that whole situation."
"That's very helpful color. Thank you. And then one just last quick one is, Walter, you mentioned the Scranton acquisition. You wanted to close by the end of September. Is that pretty much buttoned up now or are there any lingering issues that could actually complicate that regulatory approval?","Well, Ryan, we're working towards closing by September 30. And we'll continue to work with the city on that."
Okay. Thanks for your time.,"Thanks, Ryan.  Operator  Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
Good morning.,"Hi, Shar."
"Apologize if this was asked already. I only kind of got to hop on a little bit late. So, on the fair value legislation, Susan, is there sort of any other states you're thinking about where we could see some sort of passage? And I'm thinking more like Illinois or New York? Is there any opportunities there?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Well, actually, Illinois was the ﬁrst. When you look at the fair market legislation, at least in our service area, it started with Illinois legislation. They were among the ﬁrst to do that. The general question, though, is I think that as you continue to see water and wastewater systems under distress across the country, this is a very viable solution that enables municipalities to beneﬁt from water utilities like us and others to beneﬁt. And the main thing is to solve the problem for the citizens out there who are depending on the best water quality.  But also, you have communities around the country who are doing an amazing job, ﬁrst of all, but they have all of these diﬀerent priorities, they have to provide for schools and for roads and for parks. And the responsibilities that these municipalities have is so long.  And as we know, a lot of the federal funds aren't there anymore that were there during the 1970s and 1980s and even 1990s. And so they are trying the very best they can to serve the citizens of their communities. So, where it makes sense, and this is an option for them when they choose to put their systems up for sale, having this type of legislation takes an obstacle away from that.  In the past, we've had situations where a municipality or governmental entity willing to sell its system, we wanted to buy it. But because of the way things worked between the book value and what we were able to put in a rate base that wasn't considered premium, it stopped a lot of deals before they ever took place.  So, I think, this is an eﬀort by states to have a win-win situation. But at the end of the day, the people in those communities need to be better oﬀ and the municipalities are able then to provide the critical services that they're responsible for."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then just around – obviously, there hasn't been any issues growing and you've got organic opportunities, you've got acquisition opportunities. But when you think about the next leg of growth, is there sort of – where are we at with stormwater? And is that something we can as a potential driver of that growth maybe next year or the year after?","I think that is a big open question right now, Shar. I think one of the things we know is that on some of the military installations where we serve water and wastewater, a question has come up about stormwater so that we provide services for the whole water cycle. So, that's really the immediate issue that we're looking at and clarifying in Washington in terms of the role of stormwater in the privatization legislation, which by the way is actually there.  So I think it's one of those that, as the entire country looks at water supply changes and we look at the entire water cycle, it's not – in the past, we tend to say it's the drinking water, it's stormwater, it's sewer water. Where you have drought situations, where you have the need and   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we need to promote water recycling reuse, you're going to start everyone looking at the whole cycle.  So I think it's very early in the stage to do that, but it's something, because it's part of the water cycle, that we have to look at."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then, just lastly, on Keystone, obviously you reiterated the earnings neutral, and I think I would assume cash ﬂow positive up until the second quarter. But, obviously, you highlighted that drilling activities picked up a little bit and you sounded a little bit more constructive. So, if we kind of continue with the fundamentals we're seeing right now on drilling activity, is it something that – is there an opportunity to look at that earnings proﬁle this year? Or are we too late in the year to revisit that neutral status?","Well, Shar, what we know – so we like to base our guidance on what we know. So market conditions have stabilized. We know that. And they've got bigger and slightly improved. So we've seen some increases in rig count, commodity pricing, as you all know. Some customers have resumed completion and drilling activities. But we're looking at capital spending, how much of it we'll hit at the end of this year versus 2017.  So I think it's really a timing issue that we're looking at. So what we want to do is look over the next few months to look at how that has stabilized, what that means for 2016 versus 2017. But the good news, as you said, is that we are starting to see activity. It is widespread. We're starting to see our growth in market share. The last we had shared with you before this call was about 30%. We're now seeing about 35% as some of the smaller players have fallen by the waste side during the really tough times.  So, our customers are steady. We're not seeing any further deferrals of completion activities. We're picking up some new customers. But we just need to monitor over the next few months and see what we've got."
Excellent. Thanks. Congrats.,Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from Richard Verdi with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hi. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on another nice quarter, and thank you for taking my call.","Thanks, Rich."
"Thanks, Susan. My ﬁrst question kind of is a follow-up on Ryan's question about the DSIC. I'd asked this to Aqua on their Q1 call. And so, in early Q2, I had a conversation with one of the more prominent members in the (37:24). He told me that the consumer advocates are basically looking conveniently to push back on the DSIC and similar surcharges in other states, because the group kind of feels that DSIC is being abused with one ﬁling after the next.  And so, I'm wondering if American Waters is hearing this, expecting it, and if so, I'm wondering how it could impact the company's strategy?","Well, Rich, I'm not going to comment on this because they need to speak for themselves. But I will tell you from our standpoint, the fact – here's what we know. There is a recognition by the EPA throughout the country about the infrastructure needs that we have in the United States.  Our plans are very open in our state in our DSIC. In any of our infrastructure surcharge, we present plans. We also go in when we have either quarterly, sometimes semi-annually ﬁling where there is a close monitoring of the projects we're working on, what we're spending, in addition to our O&M eﬃciency at least for American Water.  We also have several eﬀorts in terms of capital eﬃciency. What do we do not only to spend every O&M dollar, but what are we doing to show that we're actually even improving how we spend every capital dollar? Because for us, at this situation, we are faced with years of investment. We want to be as eﬃcient with every dollar as we can possibly be, because that means we can put more in the ground, not impact the customer bills, and to be able to get the infrastructure replaced more quickly, which still is a decade-long issue. So, that's one thing we know.  I will also tell you, with the recent, I'll say, attention to water quality issues in a time when you have infrastructure but you also have emerging water quality issues, and we've seen what happened in diﬀerent parts of the country when you don't invest in infrastructure, I'm not sure that that is a risk that we are willing to take."
"Great. Thank you, Susan. That's perfect. And then, another question I have, I want to focus most of my questions on the non-reg segment. This kind of follows up also on the last caller's inquiry.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   I mean, you kind of laid it out to him. I just kind of wanted to get some clarity, though, about the call it cautiously optimistic Q3 and Q4 for Keystone.  I mean, oil is expected to pull back because of seasonality in late Q3 and into Q4. I mean, a lot of these guys go on vacation because of weather around Thanksgiving time and drilling activity drives up. So I'm assuming you're optimistic because Q2 was probably strong and Q3 probably followed that strength. But what keeps you cautious? Is that seasonality potential for an oil pullback keeping you cautious or are you now seeing customer indications where they're keeping you cautious on Q3? I'm just looking for a little more clarity in there.","Sure. Sure. So, ﬁrst of all, understand that our Keystone executives and management spend a lot of time with our customers. We do have a lot of – we share with them and they share with us some of their drilling plans. So the cautiousness is not really related to timing of holidays or vacations. It's more of you're talking about an E&P industry that's extremely cautious because of what they've gone through the past 18 months.  So you don't have people that have gone from being so far down to saying, we're going to pull out all the stops and ramp everything up immediately. They have a cautiousness, so we have a cautiousness. And it is a testing of the waters. The foundations are becoming stronger. We're seeing natural gas prices. I think NYMEX closed yesterday at $2.84. For example, just in April, it was $1.90 per million Btus. You're starting to see better pricing as the supply is being drawn down because of the heat across the country this summer. We're starting to see some activities where people had not been doing drilling, and now they are. We're starting to see some more drilling rigs come up.  So our cautiousness is the timing. It is the spacing. It is how quickly will we see this come up? How quickly will we see the supply that basically is being drawn down and being replenished? What are the forecasts for the winter months? How cold will the winter be? So we try to base looking at objective third-party data like price projections, like drilling projections. We look at all of that, then we also look at our internal discussions we have with our customers and what their drilling plans are.  So the cautiousness is – what you don't want is for people to ﬂip back and forth and say, it's not good, it's great, it's not – we just want to be very cautious as we look at the ramp-up and the continuing strength of the natural gas drilling market and make sure that we're very careful in how we look at that emergence."
"Great. That's excellent color. Thank you, Susan. And then, staying on the Keystone here, it's in the Appalachian footprint, it's in the Marcellus, and it's in the Utica. So, I'm curious, given the market shares that you – the 35% market share you shared, which I'm very thankful for, what basin did they focus on more over the other, is it the Marcellus or is it the Utica?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Really, it's both. And let me – so they're so close. I mean, basically, it's three states: it's Pennsylvania, it's Ohio, and it's West Virginia. And of course, the formations are beside each other. And also, importantly, as we mentioned on the ﬁrst quarter call, Shell has announced that they're going to build the cracker plant there, south of Pittsburgh, which is right in the heart of where the Marcellus and Utica and some of the formations are very close together.  So we're very excited about that because what that will do is, if they start construction, as they have said, in 2018 and ﬁnish in 2020, you're talking about even more valuable natural gas drilling where you can get the NGLs along with the natural gas. So we just see that area and the intersection between Utica and Marcellus being very rich in terms of – the fact is we know that it is the cheapest to drill for the drillers, and it also requires a good bit of water because of the depth of the formation.  So we think that's the right place to be, and we've been asking it. Also, at this point, we're not interested in going into other formations because we think that the Utica and Marcellus is where we have the most key areas for production growth in the future."
"Okay. Okay. That actually helped answer my next question then. And then, of that 35%, does Keystone work with Antero Resources?","We do – we work with a lot – we have right now, I believe, in this somewhere between 22 and 27 diﬀerent customers."
"Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And, I guess, the last question is this. I mean, when I think of the Marcellus, there are 10 rigs there. Six of them are Antero Resources, which then means that their midstream arm who has a water business – that water business is going to the midstream arm. And so, then there is the four other guys there. And then the Utica, there's only one Antero Resource rig there. And of the 13 remaining, they're all other players. And so, of these other players – I understand that oil prices are supposed to decline because of seasonality, but they're also expected to decline following that.  And in addition to that, if you look any upstream players, they're all touting about how they're expecting to use – I think they were using something like 1,500 pounds of sand per lateral or somewhere around there, and it's expected to go to 2,000 pounds. And so, I'm wondering if there's a potential to expand and capture more business in the Utica because it's kind of open there.  And then, two, that increased sand means increased needs for water there. So are you guys factoring that into your ﬁgures? And if so, are you expecting – how much of a positive impact, because a year ago that was 1,000 pounds, and now we're talking doubling that. So, I mean, that could be really meaningful for American Water.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Well, a couple of things. So, Rich, in recent weeks the drill count's been about 36 in Appalachian Basin and..."
Okay.,"And we're all natural gas, by the way. So we do very little to no support for oil. Actually for us, it's mostly natural gas. So, that's one.  Second thing, you're exactly right. What we are ﬁnding is that, in order to more eﬃciently utilize wells that have already been drilled, they are looking at higher pressure more sand, which does require more water, you're exactly right. But those changes in the market and the eﬃciency are things that our folks at Keystone work closely with customers in terms of estimates of how much water we need.  So, you're right, there's changes. That's one of the reasons that the wells have become so much more eﬃcient is they're doing the second and third frac, and they're also putting a lot more sand and lot more pressure with the sand when they go to those second and third fracs. So, you're exactly right.  I'd tell you there's a couple of other things we're involved in, and one of them is we're working with a couple of customers on some automated pumping that really is not pretty standard right now. So we consistently look at working with the E&Ps on how to make the production more eﬃcient, how to get the most they can out of each individual well, and to make sure that we are a solutions provider on everything around water and water services."
"Fantastic. Thank you for that, Susan. That's great color. And then, the very last question and then I'll jump out. I'm taking up a lot of time. Last quarter I had asked, Susan, and I think this is a great move on American Water's part, I had asked if American Water with your smart metering initiative, you were trying to team up with the electric companies to use your infrastructure. And you'd given some great color. I was just wondering if there is any sort of update on that, if there's been any more progress, what have you? Just some color to see if there's an update.","Yeah. Well, we actually have an AMI team that we're working throughout the company to come up with a rollout. Unlike electric, the water bills are so much less expensive. Of course, we're looking at the ability to be able to justify them economically. One of the good things is we're seeing a lot better technology with the meters that will allow us to actually put in AMR meters that we can then do software upgrades to actually make them AMI meters, which is good.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We continue to work with some electric utilities on utilizing some of the same backhaul infrastructures, so that our customers don't have to double the cost of those investments. We're working with Commonwealth Edison, ComEd, in Chicago area, as well as there's a couple of other utilities that have expressed an interest, and we're very excited about that because it really is a win-win for our customers where we put in a water meter.  But the one reason that does push us to do AMI is, interestingly, still a lot of water meters across our footprint are in people's homes. So, the ability to put in AMI that we don't have to actually send people out to people's homes instead of times to go into their homes, is the real not just eﬃciency improvement but also a customer satisfaction improvement.  So we're taking all of those factors. We've got a plan in place to roll out AMI over the next few years. And where we can partner with electric utilities to oﬀset some of that cost for our customers, we're all for it."
"That's great. Thank you, Susan, and congrats again on the success this quarter and moving forward. I appreciate the time. It's great color.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Good morning, you all. I'll try to be quick since this call's been extended a little bit recently. Could you give us an update on the military base RFP process? Obviously, your main competitor was awarded a pretty large base here recently. And if you could just kind of say maybe what happened there on your end, and do you get the sense that any new bases are on the verge of being awarded?","Okay. That's a great question, Jonathan. Thanks. As we look at the military bases, there are several RFPs that are outstanding. From the time we do an initial bid, it can be anywhere from three years to ﬁve years before bases are awarded. And we do have several outstanding bids. Again, we only bid on those bases that the 50-year contract value is from $250 million and above, because for us the smaller bases with the cost of bidding and all that.  So you are correct. The last one that was awarded was Eglin, and we did bid on it. And American States Water did win that one. And we are taking our lessons learned and seeing what we could do better next time. We do think that – we know that there are others in the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   process of several we've already bid on, others that we think will come out for bid. It's an ongoing process. And so we are just looking to get better every time we make a bid."
"Okay. So, no anticipation necessarily of any announcements in the second half of the year at this point?","We don't foresee any announcement in the second half of the year. With that said, however, one never knows. So, when you've got a bid out there that's been out there for a couple years or three years, depending on the particular installation and where the Department of Defense is, so it's very diﬃcult to predict. But at this point, we don't foresee any further award this year, but we could be wrong."
"Okay. Great. And then, Walter, did you say the Illinois infrastructure surcharge changes removes, like, the total cap in terms of how much revenues can increase under the program between rate cases?",Yeah. That's right. It removes the cap of 5% between rate cases and allows us to increase rate no more than 3.5% a year.
Okay. So...,"And it also a number of other things that we can invest in and get recovery, not just pipes. So, it was very favorable for the industry."
"Okay. So, 3.5% annual cap. How does that impact the frequency of rate cases in the state for you now?","Well, we're just going to..."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   You'll kind of stretch it out a couple more years, given the broader application and the 3.5% annual cap?","It could lead to that. I mean we're going to continue work on our capital program to invest wisely within our systems. And if that extends the rate cases, that's great. But we're going to continue to invest per our capital management program."
"Okay. Do you think it expands kind of the overall CapEx budget in the state where it'd kind of move the needle at all on the consolidated budget going forward, or too soon to say?",Yeah. It's really too soon to say. But it is favorable for us to continue to invest to get a timely recovery. So we'll consider that as we're working through our capital plan for the next ﬁve years.
"Okay. And then, last question, and I think I already know the answer, but I guess, year-to-date, weather hasn't really had a meaningful impact, is that correct?","Jonathan, that is correct. We've looked at the weather impacts through July across all of our states. And although we did see more heat in those states and hot weather, it was oﬀset by also having rainfall in those areas as well."
Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the time this morning.,"Thanks, Jonathan.     Thanks.     Thank you.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Operator, I think that concludes our question-and-answer session for this morning.  Operator  Yes.
