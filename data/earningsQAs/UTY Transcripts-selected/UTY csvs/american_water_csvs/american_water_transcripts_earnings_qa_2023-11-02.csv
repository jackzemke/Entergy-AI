Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. Am I coming through clearly?","You are, Rich. Good morning."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Great. Thank you. I appreciate the details around the uptake here. I wanted to start with the CapEx revision and the bill outlook. Looking back to 2021 when you ﬁrst outlined the accelerated investment plan, you gave some details on the -- the customer aﬀordability angle. But I'm curious kind of bridging not back to last year, but back to '21, is there anything diﬀerent in that outlook now, obviously CapEx is up signiﬁcantly. Also curious if the 2% customer additions target in the language around there for M&A has factored into how you've crafted this new capital plan around the customer aﬀordability angle as well.","Okay, Rich. Yeah, there's a lot in there. Let me start and then Cheryl and John can add to it. I would say our focus has sharpened over the last number of years related to customer aﬀordability. And that sharpened focus I think has really been around this sort of wallet share concept that Cheryl talked about. I think it's important for us to understand the communities that we operate in and the demographics of those communities and what are the challenges of customers in those communities.  And we've been able to do a lot of analysis at a very detailed level around aﬀordability around household income, around, you know, just economic impacts in the various communities that we serve and our focus has been I think very clearly deﬁned around our wallet share as a percentage of that household income and we've been developing this concept here now for a number of years and I think that our ability to conﬁdently say this plan as we've continued to grow it will -- will continue to maintain our position of roughly 1% or less of customer's bill in the communities that we serve speciﬁcally.  And I think that focus has allowed us to really think about, you know, how to build this plan, how to continue to grow it, how to continue to grow rate base while not overburdening customers with our growth expectations. I think this plan ﬁts very nicely in that concept.  Cheryl, you want to add anything?     Yeah. I would just add, Rich, that as Susan said, we look at all the communities that we serve, we look at the demographics and yet the capital investments are not that diﬀerent from community to community and we need to make sure that we are investing at the right level in all of those communities. New regulations like PFAS but also the Lead and Copper Rule, that is driving a lot of capital investment across the board. And so we have to continue to do that and we need to do that in all the communities.  So these -- these aﬀordability calculations, the risk priority model that we use, we think it's really the best balance to getting the right amount of infrastructure investment in all of the communities that we serve. And as we grow the number of communities that we're serving, that will continue to increase. But we think we're getting the right balance there because we have to treat all of our customers in a fair way. They all deserve clean, safe drinking water.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And Cheryl, I might just add one additional comment. From a regulatory perspective, you know, this is also a concept that we've been sharing very transparently with regulators, this aﬀordability analysis that we've done and as we lay out in every jurisdiction, the plan and the investments that we have made, we're right alongside, we're talking about impacts to customers and how we've thought about the plan and -- and how it aﬀects aﬀordability for the customers in the service territories. So again it's a -- it's a -- it's a concept and a view that we've taken that we think is diﬀerentiating here and I think regulators just as one party are certainly recognizing that.     And Rich, I'll pick-up on the 2% part of your question. As Susan mentioned in her commentary, you know, 2% is a metric that we think is good to think about as as long-term metric given just the short-term variability around acquisitions. But you're right to point it out in this context, as you know that 8% to 9% rate base growth is what drives the 7% to 9% earnings growth, but being able to spread that 8% to 9% rate base growth over a larger customer base is a healthy element of our growth."
"Great, that was very helpful color there. Thanks for laying all of that out. And then separately, turning to the ﬁnancing plan here, you were clear on -- on the drivers around the equity relative to the CapEx. I'm curious on the operating cash ﬂow side, it looks like a signiﬁcant step up, '24 to 20 -- versus '22 through '27, is that just normal course kind of rate recovery, any discrete items in there, just how to think about prior versus new?","Yeah, it's a good question, Rich. Really there is a big step up. If you think about the increase in our capital plan as we go back from 2021, '22, '23 and forward, it's such a signiﬁcant step up that when you drop '23 out of the plan and you bring '28 into the plan, the accumulation of the capital spend through that period, it accounts for a very signiﬁcant portion of -- of that operating cash ﬂow step-up. And then as you -- as you would also intuitively think, the -- there is increased cash ﬂow in the interim years as well, just given the increase in capital plan."
"Got it, got it. Well, thank you for the time today.","Thanks, Rich.     Thanks, Rich.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Our next question is from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please proceed."
"Hi, good morning, team.",Good morning.
"And just to clarify that last line conﬁrm my understanding, so there is eﬀectively no change in the kind of the growth triangle as you call it, it's just kind of a representation?","Yeah, I think that's fair. You know, we want to continue to emphasize that rate base growth is the driver. Rate base investment, which includes acquisitions is the driver. What we're trying to do here, I think, is just give some clarity around or maybe a better view as to how you can measure our progress toward growth through acquisition by giving you that sort of metric around customer additions. The -- the investment that we will continue to make in acquisitions just rolls into rate base, which it always has. So no real change in that. I just think it's a better view potentially for investors to be able to see progress we're making around the acquisition strategy."
"Okay. Understood. That's what I thought. And then shifting to the ﬁnancing plan, so if I understand it right, and correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't assume any kind of litigation proceeds, state funding, federal funding for PFAS, just -- is there any sense of what that kind of oﬀset could be to help out on customer bills?","Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, the numbers that we have laid out here, Cheryl outlined, continue to be our best estimates of the cost necessary to meet the current proposed rule. Obviously, we don't have a rule yet. So, you know, ﬁnalizing those numbers will -- will occur once we have a ﬁnal rule. And we do participate in the -- the ongoing litigation around this whole issue, we've laid all that out in the Q. So you can look at that there and probably we won't talk much more about it than that since it is ongoing litigation. I think it is fair to say that our estimates today are the costs we would expect to incur. We have to see how the litigation ultimately works out to see what impact that may have.  And I think Cheryl covered this well. You know, we do believe by virtue of our participation in the litigation that polluters, you know, should be our ﬁrst line here of -- of responsibility. So we are -- we are quite involved in that to make sure that that is properly executed.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. To make sure I understood, it does have an assumption around kind of getting external funding or it does not?","It does not at this point, no, it's just the cost estimates that we have developed so far."
"Okay, that's what I thought. Okay, great, thank you very much.",Sure.  Operator  The next question comes from Will Grainger with Mizuho. Please proceed.
"Hi, good morning, everybody.",Good morning.
"Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask, on the PFAS $1 billion that you've outlined today, how should we be thinking about the makeup of that over year service territories, is it pretty ratable or -- yeah, if you could unpack the underlying assumptions there that would be helpful.","Yeah, I'll as Cheryl to comment on that. We hit on it I think pretty high level, but Cheryl, you might want to just reemphasize that.     Yeah, we -- as we've looked at this, our -- as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we expect the bulk of the spend to be in our states where we have a larger footprint of customers, New Jersey for example. And the reason for that driver of that being the largest amount of spend is that   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   there's more contamination there in general, but also these are large surface water plants that are very costly to add treatment to. You know, we have Pennsylvania as a larger state, numerous locations there, but -- but we really haven't outlined everywhere that -- that we're going to add treatment, but anywhere that it's a surface water plant as opposed to a groundwater source, it's going to be a lot more costly to add that treatment. And so, New Jersey is our biggest dollar state for sure."
"Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just on the equity four-year plan, is that -- the incremental equity is just $700 million, if I've got my math right, the $300 million that you've still -- you're planning to issue now and then an incremental $700 million or is it an incremental $1 billion?","You've got it right, Will. It's an incremental $700 million."
Okay. And we -- and we should expect the timing of that to come in towards the back half of your plan or would that be issued like as an ATM and just kind of a pretty radical?,"What we've said is, we'll issue it in the middle of our new 2024 to 2028 plan, subject to market conditions obviously."
Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much for the time.  Operator  Our next question is from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.,
"Hey, good morning team. Just kind of following up a little bit on that last question, you know, despite the higher operating cash ﬂows it looks like, you know, the external capital needs increased more than the $2 billion CapEx increase, you get the $700 million equity and then I think it's $1.7 billion of debt. Anything unique going on there?","No, Jonathan. You know, we really lead this analysis by -- by looking at our credit metrics. And so a lot of it just goes back to what we've said in the past where incremental CapEx, we will fund it 50-50 debt and equity. And as we think about equity there, it's internally generated funds as   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   well as -- as well as new issuance. So it's -- it, you know, I think -- we think of it is lining up in that regard."
"Okay, no, I was just thinking the debt portion was a little higher than I would have thought.","Yeah, that's just a function of the capital spend as well as the maturity schedule."
"Okay. Okay, you have maybe the maturity schedule. Okay. So Cheryl, I know you said that California ﬁled on 10/16 to increase the 2024 allowed ROE. Has there been any opposition ﬁled to this request. I think there like a 30 day comment period which probably ended maybe yesterday.","Yes, there is a 30-day period. And Jonathan, I'm unaware of any kind of intervention or any kind of concern over that."
"Okay,","It's pretty formulaic, Jonathan. I mean, it -- yeah, we don't expect there to be any issue with that. It really just follows a formula."
"Yeah, I know. I mean I think investor concern is more on the electric side whether you see some intervention than the water, but monitor both. I think the 10-year CapEx plan, you bumped up the M&A placeholder by $1 billion. Is there anything speciﬁc driving that or is that just kind of passage of time more than anything?","I'd say, Jonathan, it's certainly passage of time as part of it. We are investing in our capability across the system, starting with originations and as well as due-diligence and integrations. As we look at what happens when we make acquisitions and just our -- our standards as a best-in- class operator relative to the -- to the -- to the systems that we acquire, we just continue to think that there is a lot of momentum there and a lot of strength in us continuing this program.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So it is a capability that we're investing signiﬁcantly in. And yes, as you pointed out, as we move forward in time we expect those numbers to -- to become bigger to -- to maintain that relative level of contribution."
"Okay. And then lastly, you mentioned the pension costs for '24 and you know, ﬁguring that out. But do you have much exposure on that or do most of your key states now have tracking mechanisms for pension?","We have trackers and deferral accounts in certain states, Jonathan. And we can go through that with you in detail. So, there is a mix there of what we up already and what would need to be picked up in the future."
Got you. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.,Thanks.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed.
"Yeah. Hi, thank you.","Good morning, Gregg."
"Good morning. I think you mentioned you're working on an acquisition in Pennsylvania of $104 million to close in late '24, '25. How do you -- how do you think about, you know, when you go into acquisitions sort of the reasonable timeline for getting approvals? How do you think about that?","John, do do you want to comment on that? I think the one you're referring to in particular, it's a little more complicated. I wouldn't say it's sort of a traditional process, the Towamencin   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   acquisition. And recall we -- we stepped into that arrangement when NextEra decided to exit the opportunity. So that was just a little more complicated. But, John, you want to talk sort of typically how we think about the process around?     Yeah. And Gregg, it varies state to state. But since you mentioned Pennsylvania, you know, there's a process you go through to ﬁle an application. The application has to be deemed complete and then that starts a statutory clock. And so in the case of Pennsylvania, there is a six- month statutory clock that -- that runs through and then either you're settling your approval or you're litigating approval, but all within that six-month statutory timetable."
And so what's diﬀerent about this situation?,"Well, Towamencin is one where there is -- there is opportunity based on precedent in Pennsylvania. We'll see how the post-PUC approval plays out, but we're just allowing a little bit of latitude in the event that there is any follow-up to the PUC approval from interveners."
Okay. Thanks.  Operator  The next question comes from Aditya Gandhi with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.,
"Good morning, Susan, Cheryl, and John. Can you -- can you hear me?",We can. Good morning.     Good morning.
"Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start on PFAS and curious to hear your latest thoughts around two speciﬁc topics. How are you thinking about the protection of water systems from any PFAS-related ﬁnancial liability under Socla? Do you see risk if a ﬁnal   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   rule is released and it doesn't contain any protections? And then the second topic is, can you maybe give some color on what portion of the $50 million additional annual O&M sort of qualiﬁes for -- for trackers or expense mechanisms?","I can take those questions. This is Cheryl. As far as protections around the circular -- circular, we have been really engaged in that process and we have been pushing really hard to ensure that water and wastewater utilities are protected in that -- in that space. And so we're going to continue to ﬁght that battle. Right now, you're right, there is a little bit of vulnerability out there, but we feel pretty conﬁdent that we're going to be able to manage through that and then we're gonna be able to impact how we're treated in that space.  So, more to come on that, but rest assured we're going to ﬁght like crazy to make sure that we are protected there. And as far as the $50 million, I don't have an exact breakdown and we haven't talked about an exact breakdown from state to state, but whether or not that would be recovered through mechanisms just depends on the type of mechanisms that a state would have.  So, if they have a mechanism that would allow them to recover their production costs, any kind of tracker in that space would be really helpful in those costs. In some cases we have environmental riders that include capital improvements, some of them include capital and operating improvements. So, that would allow them to recover those costs as well. So, there's going to be a portion that we're gonna be able to recover right upfront, but the rest of them, we will just recover through a general rate case with very little lag I would anticipate as far as those costs are concerned.     Yeah, and the only thing I would add to that is where we don't have an existing mechanism or an approach to ensure timely recovery, we're going to work to design one. Our view here is that these are federally mandated costs and we are taking care of a problem created by someone else. And because of that federal mandate and the federal rule behind it, we think we'll have a great argument to make around recovery and timely recovery.  So, we'll be looking for where we don't have existing solutions, we will be looking to create new opportunity to do that. So, you know, there'll be a lot on the regulatory front here to do once we have a ﬁnal rule and know how this plays out.     Yeah, Susan, I would just add that that three-year implementation period that we have to put treatment in place gives us time to do those kinds of things and make those regulatory improvements.     Right.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Got it. That's super helpful color. Thank you. And one -- just one question for John. On the equity needs, you've mentioned it's in the middle of your new '24 through '28 plan. So, sort of in the '26 timeframe, you're also -- you're also going to have proceeds from the HOS note come in. I believe they are due at the end of 2026.  Just can you add a little bit more color on timing and the form of equity? Is this just going to be like a -- like a straight block or is this going to be some sort of forward where you will maybe draw down on the forward over a couple of years? How should we think about that?","Yeah, I would say that we haven't -- we're not close enough yet in terms of time to have made the decision on the -- on the exact form of equity. You're right on the timing of the HOS, no proceeds. But as we approach the more immediate timing, then we'll develop our thinking closer to that point, but certainly we're -- we will look and do what's best for shareholders there. You know, I'd say that, you've seen us issue the straight equity as we did this year with the $1.7 billion. We issued the convert this year for $1 billion. And so we're willing to look at everything, but I'd say that's a decision we'll make as that time approaches."
"Okay. Got it. And just one follow-up. Can you just clarify -- can you just clarify your -- the point you made on your cash taxpayer status? And I just wanted to conﬁrm, is there a base for your 7% to 9% EPS CAGR at all? I can't ﬁnd that in the slides or the earnings release.","Yeah, so -- and let me just clarify that on the equity that we've talked about. To be clear, it will be equity, not another instrument to replace the equity. With regards to our cash taxpayer status, with the Inﬂation Reduction Act, we do expect that we will become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years. Those regulations are not ﬁnalized at this point. And there are certain elements that are in play that will dictate the precise timing for when we would become subject to the AMT. But we are expecting that to be the case for us.  With regards to the -- to the 7% to 9% and a base year, I'd say on that, this is a target that we think of as a long-term target. You're aware that over the last few years, we reset the capital plan with the sale of HOS and the sale of New York and we needed time to redeploy those proceeds and which was the case in '22 and in '23. And as Susan pointed out, our '24 guidance reﬂects an 8% EPS CAGR at the midpoint. So, we really think of 7% to 9% is a long-term target driven by the long-term 8% to 9% rate base growth CAGR."
"Got it. Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks for -- thanks for taking all my questions.
