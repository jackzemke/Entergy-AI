Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Just curious on two things, one on your Regulated Businesses. You've got some pretty big rate cases outstanding, right? I mean, Pennsylvania, for example, I think Missouri the other, both in the $85 million to $100 million range. Just curious, what's embedded in the multi- year growth rate for outcomes in those? And how much of those rate increases are tied to costs that you're not incurring today that you could pull back on if you get outcomes in those cases that turn out to be a good bit less than what you're seeking?","So Michael, as you know, when we put together our ﬁve-year ﬁnancial plan, we look at what do we believe are going to be successful outcomes for us to continue to invest in our systems and make those rates aﬀordable for our customers. So embedded in our 7% to 10% EPS growth range are those judgments that we use on an ongoing basis."
Got it. One other question. Can you talk a little bit about what you think the returns on invested capital are for your Market-based Businesses these days? Are you earning utility-like returns or something that are dramatically above or below that level?,"Yes, Michael. We look at that from the standpoint of risk adjusted returns. And so when we look at each of the businesses in our Market-based Business, we can think of it a little bit diﬀerently based on the risk return proﬁle of each of those businesses. So we've consistently said when we look at our Military business, it's kind of regulated like in risk proﬁle. So you'd expect the returns to be somewhat commensurate with that. And then we look at homeowner services and Keystone based on their risk-adjusted returns.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And also remember, Michael, these are very much a margin business. I mean, we invest very, very little capital, actual capital, to the same point, it's not taking capital away from the Regulated Business because we do very little capital investments. And in fact, when we talk about the capital projects, or the ﬁxed capital upgrades on our military bases, that's working capital only because the way the Department of Defense operates is typically they like to own the assets. So we basically get recovery, plus a margin on that working capital. So another way to look at is, it's more of a margin business."
"Got it. One follow up on that. Just curious, how is, given results for the ﬁrst half of the year, the earnings growth expectations for the marked-based businesses relative to what you laid out at the Analyst Day six or seven months ago.","Okay. Thank you, Michael, for that question. This quarter it's down. We've talked about it this year. When we do our ﬁnancial plan, we look at a ﬁve-year time period. We also talked today earlier about the fact that our growth triangle is intact. So we do planning on a ﬁve-year cycle. If we ever saw a point at which we did not think that the Market-based Business over the longer term would be able to deliver what we've outlined, we would change it. That is not the case right now."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Thanks, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead."
"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. One quick one from me, perhaps, Linda. I know we have two kind of discrete tax items to discuss this morning, both in New York and Illinois. And my question is, if you're seeing any other measures in other states you operate in that could lead to some more of this type of item, or if it really is just kind of a random event that we have a couple of these to discuss this morning.","So we have seen these two from a legislative tax change position. We have also seen, in Missouri, several of our counties are looking at changing the way that they calculate some of the property taxes in those areas. So we are seeing that across three of our states this year. We   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   continue to believe that these items on the Regulated Business will be recovered through our customer rates. And so, we're monitoring this very carefully so that we can continue to drive down our customer rates as best we can."
Okay. And thank you for the clarity there on potentially getting that in rates. That's all I had. Thanks.,"Thank you, Spencer.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Good morning, Susan, Linda and Walter. How are you all?","Good, Jonathan. How are you?"
"I'm doing pretty good, all things considered. Just wondering, Walter, what's the remaining process for the McKeesport approval? I know you said you thought it could close later this year or early 2018.","Jonathan, there are hearings actually today and tomorrow on McKeesport, and they have a six- month requirement. So we're looking sometime in December to be able to get an order, and then we've got to work through just some issues with the DEP before we take ownership. So that's really the process. Six months, we're a good deal through that, and hopefully we're going to take ownership at the end of this year or beginning of 2018."
"Okay. Have the third-party evaluations or valuation of the systems, have those come in already?","Yes. They've come in, and the Commission is actually working through those. It's part of the evaluation.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. But from your end, I mean, no issues there?","Well, we just continue to work through the Commission and any questions they have, and it's just part of the process, Jonathan."
"Okay. Just wondering, Susan, are there any other states considering bills similar to the New Jersey Water Quality Accountability Act? Is that kind of model legislation that you're going to be pursuing in other states, where you think it kind of opens up the door further for M&A opportunity?","I will start, and then Walter can jump in. So we absolutely believe that it should be model legislation for all the states across the country, ﬁrst and foremost, because of the fact that the ability to ensure the safety and quality of water is something that every citizen should be able to expect, and it shouldn't matter who is running their water system in terms of the quality of that water. So we think it is good model legislation. The fact, as Walter mentioned, that it was unanimously passed in the Assembly, the Senate, is just really extraordinary in this day and age. So we're very encouraged by that. We do believe it's model, and Walter can talk about any eﬀorts that we've got going across the rest of our states.     Yeah. Just to emphasize, it is model legislation. And I think Senator Sweeney and Governor Christie did a great job just promoting the beneﬁts for the residents in New Jersey. We know that other states are looking at similar legislation, primarily in the Midwest. And so, we'll be working with them as we can in each of our states to make sure that we give our view as to the beneﬁts of that legislation and how, again, the purpose is to make the water safe in the communities that are in the states."
"Right. And then last, I don't know if you guys have any thoughts – California isn't the biggest subsidiary for you guys, but the cost of capital proceeding there, ORA came out with their recommendation. What's kind of your reaction to that? Do you think a settlement on reasonable terms will be achievable from your end?","Yeah, Jonathan. I think the ORA testimony was not unexpected. As you know, they put in there a lower ROE compared to our 10.8% ROE request. They did come in also with a lower cost of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   equity just north of 54% where we requested 55%. So not unexpected on all of this. We will be ﬁling rebuttal testimony later this month. And then we would expect a ﬁnal decision in the normal course by year-end."
Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.,"Thanks, Jonathan.  Operator  Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. So I wanted to ask about your shale water business. It's broke even last year. It seems like we had some increased drilling activity in the Appalachian region, and yet, we haven't yet seen the pickup of earnings. Why, I mean, is there basically a lag between when those activities pick up and when you record additional revenues?","Thanks, Angie. This is Susan. So you're absolutely right on all accounts. But what we are seeing in the Appalachian is that we're seeing more active rigs. There's a timing issue there. And one of the comments I made, is that we plan projects and schedule projects, and we have a backlog scheduled for the second half of the year. What we found in the Appalachian is that it did pick up, but it's not picked up as quickly. And the interesting thing that's happening in the Appalachian now because things have been quite busy in the Permian that a lot of the EMPs have actually had trouble keeping groups, keeping the crews on the rig side. So now they're trying to get more people up here. So it's been a little slower than they thought. So that's one of the things that we're hearing from our Keystone Clearwater.  They are now trying to make sure that we're able to recruit enough people. I mean, we have hired 75 people just this year, and are trying to hire even more to staﬀ our crew. So it's pretty competitive to get crews. Now, with what's happening in the oil markets now, don't know if that's going to slow down in the Permian and release more for work in the Appalachian, we certainly hope so, but we do have active projects planned. And interesting, just from a statistics standpoint, as of July 28, there were 192 active rigs in the U.S. and 75 were in the Appalachian Basin, and just last year that was 86. So we do see an increase in the number of rigs, the number of completions. And hopefully some of the labor shortage issues will be taken care of so we can see more of a buildup in Appalachian work more quickly."
