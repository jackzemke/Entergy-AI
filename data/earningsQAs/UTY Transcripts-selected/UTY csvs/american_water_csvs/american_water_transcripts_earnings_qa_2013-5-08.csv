Question,Answer
"One sort of tactical question and two bigger picture items. Just in the short term, obviously 1Q is a seasonally slow quarter, and then now we move into 2Q, 3Q and more of a stronger seasonal demand period, and last year was a real strong year. So can you kind of update us with your perspective on obviously the challenging comparisons and how we should be looking at year-over-year growth potential and you know maybe even any early perspective a little over a month into Second Quarter on how that issue of tough comparisons is playing out?","Yes, Ryan, let me just touch on that brieﬂy. Remember, this is the reason why last year we provided a sense of what the impact on earnings from continuing operations was from the unseasonable weather. We indicated it was about $0.13 to $0.16 so that you could kind of normalize out the impact last year.  So our suggestion is to kind of look at that from a trending side to look at the performance as we go through this year. We're not going to give you much -- say much about what's going on in any quarter until the end of the quarter. But I'll just say that certainly April, it didn't give us any cause for concern on the sales side at all. We'll have to see what happens to weather.  You know, the thing that's -- this is one of the things that we are really starting to focus on. Regardless of what your views on climate change are and whether you believe in anthropogenic causes or not, the reality is, we're going to face signiﬁcantly more volatile and   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   variable weather patterns. They will be extreme. So we will see signiﬁcant changes. And so one of our real focuses is building resiliency into our system, both physically and ﬁnancially so that we can manage these kinds of swings while maintaining the same kind of ﬁnancial risk proﬁle and ensuring that we have systems that will allow us to meet those customers' needs.  So we'll just have to wait and see what happens in the second and Third Quarters, but at this stage, we're very comfortable with the earnings guidance we've given."
"Okay. That's great. Thanks, Jeﬀ. And then can you just update us on your assessment of the regulatory climate broadly as it relates to awarded ROEs? Obviously interest rates remain low. That puts downward pressure on cost of capital calculations. Economic backdrop is mixed. And so how do you see commissions responding to that environment here as you gear up for a few fairly signiﬁcant rate cases in the pipeline as you talked about?","Well, let me put in a few words, and then I'd like Susan to add her thoughts coming out of the same kind of regulated marketplace.  You know, clearly it's been down downward pressure on returns. You know, one of the things we remind regulators is, look, you have to be very careful about looking at what the -- what an artiﬁcially held down risk-free rate is and use that as the basis for calculating what a cost of equity capital is because it's being artiﬁcially held down through monetary policy for speciﬁc broad-based governmental reasons.  But, that said, the other thing that we share with our regulators is the notion that more than probably any other company in the utility industry, we have a capital allocation decision. And it's not that we're not going to do what is essential, but in terms of the variable capital, which is a big chunk of capital, it will move where there is the opportunity to earn our full returns in a timely manner.  I think the clearest example is the additional commitment that we made into New Jersey once the DSIC was put into place, the incremental capital that we committed into Missouri, and where, frankly, some capital has been extracted. Again, we're going to make sure we provide service to customer, but it's an issue of investment in the longer term.  Okay. That must be someone's phone ringing. Anyway. So, we certainly see returns coming down a bit, and we've factored that in in our game plan going forward. But we think we can without -- certainly not in a threatening way help people understand that we've only got so much capital spend, and it's got to be allocated where it's going to get the greatest return.     Absolutely. I agree with Jeﬀ. And I think also remember that when you look at the rate cases that we have ﬁled, we are holding the line on O&M expenses. We're trying to be good stewards of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   going into the Public Service Commissions and Public Utilities Commissions so that when we go into these, it's for infrastructure improvement. We know from several reports from the Society of civil Engineers, the water infrastructure is struggling nationally, we believe, and we have continued to make investments in that. We know that utility commissions recognize management eﬃciency, which we think that we are showing by how we are controlling our O&M costs so that we are going in for recovery basically for the investment that we're making to improve reliability, safety, and making sure that the water is available when it needs to be available.     Susan raises something that we're going to start helping make sure our regulators understand more fully. If you look how far this Company has come in a pretty short period of time about improving its cost structure and really getting focused on how we serve customers in diﬀerent ways, the kinds of things that we do that others don't do about helping ensure continuation of service where we have had very little lost service during these weather events and have been lauded in virtually every state where we've had those events because of the way we manage our ﬁeld force and what we do relative to the loss of electric power. So, that's something that we think can help move up for a little bit of the lower natural returns to regulators."
"That's great perspective. Thank you. And then one last question for me. Pretty big privatization opportunity in Allentown, Pennsylvania that did not go to either yourselves or any of your investor-owned peers. Can you just talk a little bit to us about that process and what you learned from it as regards to both the appetite for privatization and then also how you will approach that type of opportunity in the future?","Sure. You know, I would tell you that I am exceptionally proud of the team that we had working on that project, the way they conducted themselves, the development of the proposal, and I'm very comfortable with what we did. We would not have paid what someone else is saying they will pay.  So, in terms of the process, that's ﬁne.  I guess a couple editorial comments. I think from a public policy side, there is a real issue to be had about an entity being able to use subsidized tax-exempt ﬁnancing. It is being subsidized by all tax payers to buy assets or enter into an agreement where you're paying for lease assets at above cost -- above the original costs. The notion of using tax-exempt debt to enhance a public system that already exists is one thing. But to acquire a system and to eﬀectively compete by using something that is subsidized by other taxpayers I think is a public policy issue that's going to end up being addressed in Congress.  You know, in the kind of economic conditions that this country is in, to continue to allow those kinds of subsidizations I think are the things that the policymakers ought to look at. And I think we also have to recognize that they are paying whatever the price is. $220 million, I guess, was   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   the price. You know, it's a heck of a lot more debt that they don't have to issue, the $220 million, because of the bond reserve funds and everything else. They don't have any equity capital associated with that.  So I hope it works for them. They made a decision. We'll see what happens. I'm very comfortable with how we conducted ourselves and the price that we put forward. It does not dissuade us from pursuing the right kinds of opportunities for the future, approaching it with the same care and deliberation that we did this with."
"So it will be interesting -- we will watch to see how it plays out. Thanks for your time this morning.  Operator  Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs.",
"In California, one of the things we've seen with some of the electric utilities are general cases are taking a lot longer to resolve. You just ﬁled in California. How should we think about the timing of ﬁnal resolution, and do you think there is any readover from the timeline in California for some of the electric needs to how we should think about water case resolution?","We have Walter to answer that.     Yes, Neil, it's Walter. In California there is a three-year cycle. So we ﬁle on that on that timing. We ﬁled in May. The rates are going to be eﬀective in January 1 of 2015 based on that three-year cycle. So we expect to take a good portion of it and have the rate case ﬁnalized before January 1, 2015. So it's on a regular cycle, and all the water companies are on those cycles.     You know, Neil, if you look at the ﬂat rate base, the decision was about what, ﬁve or six months late? But there is the risk because you are right. They are running behind. There is the risk that case could slip, but it's -- the rates are retroactive. That's what gives us a little comfort is that it's not an issue where we won't make that revenue. And it may be delayed where the actual ﬂow comes a little bit late, but it will be retroactive to that date."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it. All right. And then on your comments on dividends, obviously you had a nice dividend bump a couple of days ago. To get to the midpoint of your 50% to 60% payout, you'd likely have to grow your dividend by faster than EPS growth. So just to get back to your dividend philosophy, is it possible that you grow your dividend in excess of that 7% to 10% to get closer to the midpoint of your payout range?","You know, I just love it when a 12% dividend increases -- a nice dividend increase. You know, there is a balance, as I know you understand, between the rate of growth that we have in that, and we're going to always be a little conservative on this because -- and looking forward, it's -- we had balanced that issue of the what the opportunities we have for investment.  And I guess the short answer to your question is, certainly there is the potential that it will grow at a rate faster than earnings maybe in any one year. But, remember, that we talk about 7% to 10% as a long-term growth rate. Not every year on year. So a year in which we have, let's say, 7% growth or 7.5%, the dividend rate will be higher than that. In a year in which we have 15% growth as we had for the last three years, it probably wouldn't be or probably likely wouldn't be above that.  So, as we go forward, we'll keep looking at that. I think the key for us is to provide a predictable, stable level of growth in the dividend. We've increased it by $0.01 in each of the last three years because it was appropriate to do so. Whether we're now at a $0.03 per quarter level increase, so that is 12%. Whether we go above that, we'll wait and see how our future continues to unfold."
"Got it. Okay. Thank you, very much.  Operator  Kevin Cole, Credit Suisse.",
"I guess with the shale development, can you, I guess, help me think how the earnings levels will work when you invest in the business, and is it purely a rate-based business, or do you get some volume kicker from it as well? Then also with the XTO agreement and similar agreements, how much CapEx will you be thinking that you're investing?","Yes, let's take that in two parts. First, let me do the second part ﬁrst. In most of these agreements, frankly, what we've got is the driller investing a good chunk of the capital or providing a good chunk of the capital as a contribution today. And then the whole investment is rolled into our rates, and the property is deeded to us. So they then end up paying for treated water. That's what we've done on the regulated side.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So, in between rate cases, we get a bump from those additional revenues and sales. We also have the opportunity to then serve the retail growth that can prop up around that pipeline or for, in many of those areas, customers that are having well water diﬃculties, to have them come onto the line so that is additional revenue. And then, if the drillers end up leaving, then we don't have any risk associated with those investments that are rolled into rates, and we'll stay in there for the long term.  So that's how the ones that have happened so far are being treated, and I think that the value of that, remember, is twofold. First, we're getting the revenues from that driller today. In the longer term, we are getting additional certiﬁcated territories. So when we make those extensions, the Pennsylvania commission actually certiﬁcates additional territories for us. And that will put us in the position if, for example, this cracker is built to be able to serve what the people estimate from anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 new jobs in that area.  So, now, as I said and we've said for at least the last year or so, while we focus on regulated investments to serve drillers, we will also consider market-based investments if the risk reward proﬁle is right and it meets what the customer needs and wants. So far, that hasn't been what the customers have preferred. It hasn't been necessary or appropriate. But those things can change, and that obviously has to have the right risk reward relationships."
"So, this is a zero-like business then given the contribution you made?","We've put in some capital, but I've got to tell you, we haven't put in -- I don't know what the number is, Kevin. I couldn't tell you what the speciﬁc is, but it's not much. It may be $1 million or a couple of million dollars. It's probably a couple of million dollars so far. Because a big chunk of it is put up by the driller, and then they deed the property to us at no cost. They don't get a deduction in their rates. So they pay for the pipeline, and then they pay the regular price for the water."
Have you provided the rate base growth opportunity for this?,I am sorry. Can you speak up?
"Have you provided the rate base growth opportunity for, I guess, the shale development shift?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   No, no, we have not."
"And then, Susan, with your comments on the non-reg side, I'm sorry if I missed this, but was the revenue and the net income decrease a function of a slowdown in ability to get new businesses, or was it -- this kind of more of a contract issue, and then also how do you expect to backﬁll later on this year?","Yes, thanks for that question, Kevin. Actually the military services group -- just for a little background, these contracts are O&M contracts, but they are actually full scale -- we're the EPC contractor, and we provide the O&M services with 50-year contracts.  So we're the ones who get the permit. We actually also get a bill of sale for the asset, but because it's on the government installations and we can't make any decisions that the government doesn't approve, we don't carry those on the American Water book.  So, what happens is, we have projects that are already awarded. These are not projects we're hoping will happen. They've been budgeted. They've been awarded. We're in process. There was small delay in terms of getting some construction permits on the majority of these sites.  So we fully expect these projects to continue for this year. It will probably be more toward the third or Fourth Quarter and also understanding how this works because we are EPC, we have an agreement that we actually book revenue during certain percentages of the completion of the project. So once we start the project, based on where we are in the design ﬁeld, we are able to bring revenues in. So it's merely a matter of the timing, and most of that is due to the construction permit."
Great. Thank you. That is helpful. Appreciate it.,"Let me add one thing to that, Kevin. I think as people are ﬁnding out, there is an impact of sequestration that is kind of the hidden impact, and it is that even if there aren't -- people aren't being furloughed or anything, or even if they are, you're losing some eﬀectiveness there. But what really happens is everyone in the government talks about what's going on, and that produces eﬀectiveness eﬃciency. And so stuﬀ has just gotten slower, and that's a natural thing to happen. But it isn't going to stop moving forward at this time.     Yes, I mean the sequestration should not aﬀect the projects that we've got, and also, even going forward, because we are doing water and wastewater infrastructure, these are critical elements.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So as long as there are military bases, the work will be done. The question is, who's going to do it, and we're going to compete most eﬀectively for those projects."
"Great. Thank you. And Jeﬀ, I like the slide seven. So now I can end the call with, may your cup runneth over.","I like that! I like that!  Operator  Angie Storozynski, Macquarie."
"I just wanted to clarify comments, Susan, about the timing of rate cases and the revenue contributions and how it ties into your guidance. So, is this just purely about the quarterly allocation of revenue increases, or that's -- I mean the timing of those rate case resolutions, together with the delay in the military contracts, should weigh on your results in 2013 versus your guidance?","Angie, that's exactly correct. Last year, the three rate cases were ﬁnalized, and we received the orders in the Second Quarter. When you look, for example, at Kentucky and West Virginia, the water and wastewater in West Virginia and the case in Kentucky, of course, we don't know. We would hope that by the third and Fourth Quarter, we would get a ﬁnal order on those. With Pennsylvania it could be through the First Quarter of 2014, but there's a chance it could be the latter part of this year and Iowa probably 2014. So a lot of it is due to the timing from last year compared to this year."
"But you already knew about it, and it is embedded in your guidance, right?","Yes, for the year guidance. That's why we reaﬃrmed our guidance, the annual guidance we reaﬃrmed our guidance."
Okay. Now how much of a help did you guys have in the realized ROE over the last 12 months from the weather? So if I were to look at the weather normalized realized ROE?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Yes, I'm trying to remember the number. Something like about 40 basis points?     Yes. It was around 30 basis points, and Angie, I can give that to you after the call."
"Okay. And then when we think about your earnings drivers going forward, how big of an ROE lag we should assume, and especially as it ties into potential reﬁnancings of debts and further bridging of the gap between allowed and realized ROEs from -- through rate cases?","Well, if we look at the regulated return, which I think it was on a weather adjusted basis, was somewhere just at or under 9.0%, right around 9%. We are seeing -- we've got a regulatory lag, but it has shrunk considerably. Our goal is to drive it to 0. We think that's appropriate.  As we go forward, what helps us get us there? Well, expansion of DSIC. If you look at the 39% of our CapEx that qualiﬁes for DSIC, remember that of the $950 million we've got this year, a chunk of that is for BT. BT doesn't qualify for DSIC. As we go forward next year, at this stage, into 2014, we are subject to further decisions. But we don't see backing away from the total level of investment, so probably a greater amount of investment will be eligible for DSICs.  We've got more future test year rate cases moving forward. So we're doing the things that will help close that gap. I certainly don't expect it to increase from what we've got right now, which just looks to be about 80% -- 80 basis points."
Okay. And that's on the regulated side. How about on the corporate level?,"Well, on the corporate level, Angie, the major piece, as we've talked about before, is the parental level debt. Its impact is declining just because our earnings are becoming much bigger, not that the total hit associated with that interest is shrinking. It's really not.  Remember, we did hedge oﬀ a piece of that. There's no -- through a swap. Not really an ability to do much more of that today, but -- and remember that the biggest chunk of that, I think, is about $750 million is subject to -- comes up in 2017.  So we will always look for opportunities to manage that debt in a better way. We did a lot of reﬁnancings about $500 million or so last year of other debt, which has helped reduce our   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   overall cost of debt. But the substitutes at the parent we have limited capacity to do anything before we face the issue of it coming up in 2017."
"Okay. So and then the last question, so you keep showing us the 7% to 10% earnings growth, and when I look at your drivers of earnings and the level of CapEx that you keep deploying, I kind of struggle with the 7% growth. What would be -- how can I get comfortable with that low case of earnings growth? Because it's hard to imagine, is this more a function of -- are you basically giving yourself a cushion, and that's why it's a 7% the low end of the range? Or is there something long-term that I'm missing that could actually weigh on your earnings growth?","Well, Angie, since we're talking long-term, I think it's appropriate to think about a range. And obviously we're going to drive as long as it's based on long-term decision-making, we are going to drive to be on the higher end, but there's a lot of things that can happen. You know, if we get in a period of as some people think will happen where we've got an inﬂationary period monetarily driven, then, for entities like us, that forces interest costs, as well as other costs up at a higher rate. So it exacerbates whatever regulatory lag you have.  So there's a lot of things that can happen on the Regulatory side and as well as on the Market- Based side. So I think it's appropriate to think about a range, and that's where you all get to kind of make your own judgments and decide where within that range we may fall long-term. Because we'll run a bunch of sensitivities that can drive us -- remember, the tornado chart that we've used with you all before that can show how things can aﬀect us, and a number of them can drive us inside or outside of that range very, very quickly whether it's on the sales side or particularly on the level of sales side. So, I think we are comfortable with the 7% to 10% range."
"Okay. Thank you, very much.  Operator  Heike Doerr, Robert W. Baird.",
I wanted to return to this topic of military-based business for a moment. Can you perhaps comment on how the sequestration impacts the trend towards further privatization of military bases?,"You know, it's interesting because in looking and talking with the people that we've got working on that, the issue of sequestration has a lot of questions, ﬁrst of all. So we don't want to speculate. We know that there were talks of furloughs that did not happen. What we do know is   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   that originally -- and I think we have reported in early earlier earnings calls -- the Department of Defense was planning about $11 billion worth of water and wastewater project privatization from 2012 to 2016. We have not gotten information that says that has signiﬁcantly changed. Again, when you look at a lot of spaces, many were built around post-World War II diﬀerent areas. Water, wastewater infrastructure -- if you're going to have bases, you're going to need those services.  So, anything we talk about is speculation. However, in some respects, the military I know, for example, on renewables and diﬀerent things has actually said that because of things like sequestration and budget cuts, they would prefer to privatize because they take that risk oﬀ, and that's not their core competency. We don't know that for sure. We are monitoring closely. We work with the Department of Defense frequently. We have a team that does that, and at this point the projects that we have, we don't see an impact from sequestration but from what Jeﬀ mentioned, which is if things happen a little more slowly because the discussion and talks about sequestration.  Looking forward, if we need to revise our forecast, we will. But at this point, we still see projects on the table that will be awarded to someone.     Let me add one other piece of color. I think the probability of a BRAC -- another BRAC is very high, probably in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe. Those are very diﬃcult and exhaustive processes. And consolidation and eﬃciency of overall deployment is one of the keys.  So I think you can think about the likelihood that we will see some baseloads.  Now, when they do consolidation, there is always an issue about one of the big bases going by the wayside. Frankly, what typically happens is you see consolidation of smaller bases. A lot of the smaller outposts, frankly, we don't even bid on because they are just not big enough for us to mess with. We tend to focus on the larger scale bases, and there are some large scale bases that are on the blocks for this privatization today. You never know when a BRAC process goes through what the outcome might be. But I think you know two things. A], it takes a while because it's a political process and that they're going to be driving for eﬃciency gains. I don't think anyone can prejudge today whether that means we could lose one of our bases or we could have a greater opportunity to serve a new base that's bigger than it otherwise would be. I don't -- I agree with Susan. I don't think that sequestration in and of itself is going to impact the privatization, except it may just slow down because of the process and people being distracted because of just the general notion of sequestration. But they will come back after a period a couple of months or whatever of settling down and get back on stride.     And tagging onto what Jeﬀ said, not only the issue that we serve the larger bases but because of our size and scale and the fact that we have a national marketplace, it would provide us more opportunities because we are not constrained by regional lines. So it actually could provide us even more opportunities.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"And can you remind us what that process is? If tomorrow they opened up these projects -- forbid -- what's the process, what's the quote-unquote normal timing of that process?","Well, the timing that the federal government will talk about is an 18-month period. We haven't seen one get done in 18 months. So, there is always something that slips. But it is a very structured process that's multistage. [multiple speakers]"
So it would be a 2015 earnings event at the earliest?,"Yes. Except that there are some that are in process now. So, there is already some that are on the table, and we're started in 2012.  So, when will they come to a conclusion? Well, it really depends. Do we see 18 months, or do we see 24 or 26 months? So we don't talk about which ones that we bid on that are currently in process, but they are some very attractive faces."
"And then as a ﬁnal question, can you, Jeﬀ, provide us with an update on the New York City contract services contract?","Yes, as I mentioned earlier, we started the market marketing process in early to mid-January. So through the ﬁrst round of mailings to about 650,000 people, we've got 80,000 customers. So that's over about a 12% penetration rate, and almost all of them are taking two products. So we've got about 160,000 contracts out of it.  So, it's going well. It's certainly exceeding what we expected."
Can you share with us what the target is for that by the end of the year or --?,"No. We won't give speciﬁcs on targets and stuﬀ like that. But I'll just tell you that we are pleased with how it's going. But there's also shakedowns that occur -- maybe that's not the best choice   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   of words -- shakeouts that occur when you go into a new territory because, remember, that our key -- the two key things that make that business work are contractor management and customer care.  And so, on the customer care side, we had to signiﬁcantly expand our capacity to take on New York City, and on the contractor management side, these are a bunch of new contractors because we didn't really serve in New York City before. So we've got to go through the process that you always will have a little shakeout as we bring new people onto the customer care side, and we have new contractors that we are serving.  So we are pleased with how it's going, and there probably isn't much more to say about that.  Operator  [Operator Instructions] And I show no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks.     Well, let me again thank you for joining us this morning.
