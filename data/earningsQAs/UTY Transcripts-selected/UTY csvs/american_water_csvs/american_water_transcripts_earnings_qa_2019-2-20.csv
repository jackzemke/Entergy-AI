Question,Answer
"Thank you very much. Great results as always. I have a question about your Market-Based businesses. How is the Pivotal acquisition or its integration into your business going on? How I mean versus your original growth plans for this platform and what are you seeing now? And secondly, how should we think about Keystone's earnings contributions embedded in your 2019 guidance? Thank you.","Well, I will start Angie and then Linda can pick up. So the Pivotal integration has really gone exceedingly well, better than actually we thought it would. Culturally a great ﬁt as you saw from the numbers that Linda presented. A very, very good year for the entire Homeowner Services organization and Pivotal was part of that as well as the legacy Homeowner Services, which actually won ﬁve key partnerships, which has a tremendous impact on the future proﬁtability and cash that we get from that business. And before I turn it over to Linda to talk about the ﬁnancials, just quickly on Keystone. So, as we mentioned on the third quarter call. So we had shut down the trucking of water business and the construction business and we're focusing on water transfer only. And as we pointed out, it was the most predictable and proﬁtable. One thing to date, even this year, we are seeing that hypothesis prove out with a very strong year in water transfer thus far in '19 and as Linda said you saw a little bit at the end of '14 impact ﬁnancially as we're taking ﬁnally, closing out the entire construction business.     Yeah, I can add to that Angie. In terms of the Pivotal integration, as Susan said it's going very well, and in terms of our ﬁnancial projections, they are coming in as expected . And so we stand by our original projections that are included in the 5-year plan, from a Keystone perspective, again as Susan mentioned we are -- you know we closed out the construction business in the fourth quarter. And so the bulk of that was impacted fourth quarter. We are seeing early this year the results as we anticipated, and so we're excited about that and we'll update you more in the ﬁrst quarter.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Great. And my follow-up question, maybe a little bit unfair and I admit it. So your another large water company is about to have a very big equity issuance granted that is to ﬁnance a gas acquisition but do you think that will have a negative impact on on your stock or your valuation? Do you think that just purely from the funds ﬂow perspective this money would be coming in from your stock or you think that this diversiﬁcation into the gas utility sector is actually going to attract diﬀerent source of money?","Well Angie, as always we don't comment on other companies, but I will tell you in terms of American Water, the space for water is very scarce as you know and also for us we are seeing a signiﬁcant growing focus on ESG. And being a water utility, positions us very strategically in that space. We're seeing a lot of interest as you probably noticed globally, not just with utility funds but global infrastructure, global environment fund. So there is a lot of money looking for good places to go. We think we're the best place for that money to go. And so we're just going to continue telling our story and we think there's a lot of interest given the story that we've got and the proven execution on the strategies and the fundamentals that we try to exhibit every year, every quarter, every day."
Very good. Thank you.  Operator  Okay. The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,
"Hey team, good morning.",Good morning.
"So just to start oﬀ. I have two questions. First in the quarter, Linda, is it fair to assume that when I look at the parent other segment quarter-over-quarter, majority of that $0.04 lower earnings contribution is tax reform related to that sort of a one-time event and as we're looking to do our 2019 models, we should -- that should pretty much go away?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah, absolutely $0.02 in the quarter was associated with tax reform and then when you move into 2019, that will be comparable year-over-year and the other $0.02 was associated with the tax return true-ups that we had in the fourth quarter. Generally, we true-up either in the third of fourth quarter of each year."
"Perfect, thanks. And then just going back to Walter, any color on the acquisition adjustment hearings, anymore color. I don't know if you can provide maybe perhaps what rate base that is. And then just, what are we assuming in 2019 guidance as it relates to what might be the outcome of those hearings?","Yeah, Durgesh, just brieﬂy on the adjustments we submitted briefs. We're going to continue to work with the Board of Public Utilities to provide our side of the story as to why there should be recovery on those acquisitions. And as I said, we're looking at the end of the ﬁrst quarter, second quarter for the decision to come up from the BPU and can add whole lot more guidance on that at this point."
"Yeah, that's fair. Thank you, guys.",Thanks Durgesh.  Operator  The next question comes from Richard Verdi with Coker & Palmer. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my call and great quarter.",Thanks Rich.
"I wanted to follow up actually on your ﬁrst caller. I think we are at a very similar question, but I want to bring it back to the fourth quarter was reported in kind of just give a little bit of an explanation for so, on a consolidated basis, the company beat our top line estimate, but when I break it down and I look at the regulated revenue, American reported $717 million that's exactly what we have and the $30 million outperformance came on the non-regulated side. And my   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   thinking is, well, maybe I didn't capture -- maybe there were sales in there from the the Keystone trucking and construction sale that maybe I should have picked up or it could have come from added strength from Pivotal that it just came in better than expected. So I'm wondering if you could just share and give a little bit more detail. How much of that non- regulated sales for the quarter, how much of that was from the Keystone construction and trucking? Did we just pick it up for October and then how much of it was really from that Pivotal strength because you know modeling -- going forward modeling, I don't want to underestimate Pivotal obviously. And I don't want to add in trucking and construction when it's no longer going to be there.","Yeah. Richard, this is Linda. And if you look in the appendix to the slides we -- on Slide 13, we included additional detail on revenue because of all of the moving parts in the fourth quarter. And you can see on that slide that HOS from a revenue perspective was up $76 million in revenue and that was due to the better results at HOS as well as the integration of Pivotal. Keystone was up $6 million year-over-year or from a quarter perspective, I'm sorry this is the full year, $6 million Keystone was up and that's primarily from the increase in the water transfer business and then we had lower revenue results from Military Services. This is from lower capital upgrades as well as our Contract Services Group from the sale of that group this year. So that is included in the breakdown for revenue on page 30 and I think that will help you.     For clariﬁcation, Rich, we did not sale Keystone's construction business or trucking. We shut it down. So there was no revenue that was related to that and in our non-GAAP earnings we did not include the beneﬁts from the sale of CSG. We simply did not include that nor we include a positive outcome from an insurance sales, so what Linda said, as you look at that chart, this is truly from ongoing operations. This does not include any revenues from one-time sales."
"Got it, okay. I'm sorry, did I say -- I meant to say shut it down. I'm sorry, I misspoke. I'm trying to think.",That's okay.
"Got it, thank you for that, and then the second question is for the regulated acquisition front. I'm just wondering if there are any states where the company is more heavily focused the next ﬁve years. And the reason why I asked that is because I noticed just the other day that the New Jersey Assembly and the Senate approved a bill where local governments are going to be allowed to tax homeowners and companies that have very large paid service surfaces because the pollutants from those surfaces are seeping into the water systems and so the tax, the extra tax revenue is going to be used for upgrading water systems and what have you but thinking about it. I mean, no one wants -- no one wants extra taxes, right, higher taxes? So that's going to   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   be very supportive of privatization and then when you think about -- so you think about that New Jersey, you think about WIFIA. You think the Water Accountability Act. You think that American Water is headquartered in New Jersey. You would think logically, wow, this is very supportive on the regulated acquisition front for American to really dive deeper into New Jersey. But at the same time, the company also wants to remain diversiﬁed. So just wondering if you could give us just some sort of color on that regulated acquisition front, if maybe you are leaning more towards New Jersey or if there are any other states, maybe you're more heavily focused on the next ﬁve years?","Great question, Rich. Thanks for that. We're focused on growing really across our footprint. And I think as I said, we closed 23 acquisitions in 10 states which shows that we're focused on growing across our footprint. Our state teams are leading this charge and they're focused on again providing solutions for communities in need and that's really what we're focused on. Yes, there are some great states New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri , Indiana, Illinois that really have advance, I think the notion of private water companies providing solutions and you look at all the fair market value legislation out there. That's encouraging us to do these kind of acquisition. So we're really excited about the growth opportunities. As we said before, we have over 500,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline and that's because we're providing solutions. And our communities recognize that and it's just something we're all very, very proud of.     And Rich, you bring up a really good point that I think is going to be an ongoing policy move throughout the United States, which is the actions that New Jersey is taking with all the concerns about contaminants and with all of the focus on the perﬂuorochemicals especially. We think that with the Water Quality Accountability Act, with the things that are happening, you are correct. This does position us, not just in New Jersey, but in all of our states, because for example on the perﬂuorochemicals and that's a general name for whether you're talking about PFOAs or PFNAs or name any of these type of chemicals. And why that's interesting is that while there was a lot of of discussion around the EPA's position to not immediately form a maximum contaminant level but most people may not understand is EPA does currently have a non-enforceable health advisory, a 70 parts per trillion. At American Water, we don't wait for maximum contaminant levels. When the EPA has health advisories, we actually ensure that our systems are consistent with that. So we're already meeting the existing EPA health advisory. We test for it, we check for it before it even becomes an MCL. I don't know what that number is for municipalities. I don't know what that number is for the companies. But I think your broader point which is, as we see this in New Jersey and you see this as we think that will become an issue everywhere. In all of our states, we're starting to see a lot of concern about these contaminants.  And, as Walter said, when we talk a bit about being a solutions provider. It's not just buying assets and providing hopefully better service when we go in, but this is all we do, water and wastewater, but it is also providing critical health solution for things like emerging contaminants. And also as Walter said in his comments, in state -- some of our states, we're actually seeing the ability for us to go in and replace customer lead service lines, even if the lead is not in our pipe, because we can do it more cheaply as we're replacing our pipes. So that's the broader story around us being a solutions provider. And I think you're, what you mentioned is going to be an   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   increasing theme across this country and there is more and more concerns in all the states about these contaminants."
