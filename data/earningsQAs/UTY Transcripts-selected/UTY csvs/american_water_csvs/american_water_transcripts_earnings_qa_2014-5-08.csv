Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys. And Jeﬀ and team, congrats on a wonderful quarter. I'm ﬁlling in for Neil Mehta here. Had a quick question here on your long-term dividend growth, especially after the recent dividend raise. What factors do you guys look at and consider when you are thinking of increasing or decreasing this?  And then the next thing is, on the many tuck-in acquisitions you guys have announced in several states recently, how material are these and what cost saving opportunities should we be thinking about when we review these?","Why don't you take the ﬁrst one?     Okay, on the dividend question, Adam, we have a dividend practice that we want to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth and we target a payout ratio of 50% to 60%, very important for us also to have predictable, stable earnings growth.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And on the acquisition side, it depends is the simple answer. And this is one of the reasons why we have a signiﬁcant focus in the wastewater area, because when we are already providing water in a community and then take over the wastewater system, there are signiﬁcant cost savings opportunities because we will be using the same rolling stock, a lot of the same equipment and the same people. Obviously, it's diﬀerent pipe and some of the equipment is diﬀerent, but there's a lot of similarities and so there is the opportunity for lowering the cost per customer or per mile of pipe or however you want you look at it.  Other than that, it will just vary based on the size of the acquisition, its proximity to existing territory. Most of them are tuck-ins to basically adjacencies, so we're able to integrate it fairly eﬀectively. But obviously, they also vary in size from 100 customers to 20,000 customers. So it kind of depends on the speciﬁcs of the acquisition, but we – as we've said before, we are more encouraged with the ability to do these kinds of acquisitions. With the success we had last year and so far this year, we've got eight.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Good morning, guys. I guess, Jeﬀ, congratulations. Maybe this is the second retirement where we've said good-bye to you on I suppose?","Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You want to say thank God, it's going to be the last one, isn't it?"
"Well, I will withhold comment. How does that sound? Could we talk a little bit about the kind of non-regulated, the services side of the business, what you're seeing as far as kind of backlog development is concerned and where that business if you look at kind of what's in queue or what you guys are talking about? How much business is sitting there and kind of conﬁdence in the rate of growth on that side?","Well, let me start with a few comments and ask Susan to chime in. You kind of look at it in its diﬀerent pieces, take Military Services. We're pretty bullish about the opportunities that are present in the Military Services side. There has been a hiatus, as we've talked about before, of about three years when no awards were made, or at least none of signiﬁcance because we're really only focused on the larger bases. And now we're starting to see that shake loose.  We're very pleased with the amount of additional capital awards that were made last September-October to us. That's about $142 million, and that's in fact what's driving a lot of the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   revenue growth in the Military side ﬁrst quarter of this year. In fact, it would have even been higher but the cold weather impaired the ability to do some of the construction. So we think that there remains good growth opportunity within the Military Services side. You've got – the Air Force has now become much more engaged in the process. The Army has a number of bases that still will go forward. So we can see 40 to 50 facilities out for bid in the next, say, four years or so. Now obviously not all of them will we bid on because a lot of them will be smaller outposts that we're just not – that's not going to attract our attention.  Homeowner Services, on the heels of New York and now Nashville, the opportunities that we see in partnering with some large municipalities to provide services on bill is very positive. I mean we've seen very signiﬁcant growth in that business. The keys will be managing the cost side and the customer service side as it grows so that we maintain good proﬁtable margins.  And in the balance of the Contract Services business, we've gone through a very speciﬁc process of weeding out what I'll just call frankly bad contracts. And it drove our revenues down out of that business, but our margins went up substantively. And we've now got that business positioned where it is taking on some new contracts for the ﬁrst time that are adding to that margin and adding to revenue, but we had to, what I'll call clean up the system ﬁrst.     Right. And Jeﬀ is exactly right. In the two growing areas that we have disclosed to you all before in terms Military Services and Homeowner Services, we're continuing to see great opportunity for growth. Additionally, we're looking at adjacencies where, for example, we serve military bases, other federal facilities.  We're looking at the Homeowner Services Group, as Jeﬀ said, has been very successful and we're repeating success because we have people who know what we're doing. We understand how to serve customers and we're seeing that area grow and we're looking at adjacencies. He mentioned for example the in-house plumbing. We previously said we were looking at things like HVAC. So we see growth in the areas we deﬁned and we also – our Group is consistently and constantly looking for new opportunities that leverage the core competencies we already have and provide opportunities for us to provide a great service for customers.     And just keep in mind Dan, as we've talked about before, we're going to – that business will grow at a higher rate than the regulated business, but we're going to do it in a way that does not substantively change the overall risk proﬁle of the company. That's where the Military Services piece is important. The duration of the contracts that we enter into and the cost recovery mechanisms in the Contract Services side, those things that help make sure that these are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in their risk proﬁle."
"I know it's a simple process, but if you look at the increasing revenues on that business and an increase in cost in the quarter, looks like about a 42%, 43% incremental margin on the revenue   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   dollars brought in. Is that a reasonable rule of thumb or do you think there's too much clutter this quarter to kind of use that as an operating assumption?","The answer is yes, Dan. There's too much clutter, and that's the same answer you'll get every quarter, only because it's ﬂuid. It moves around. And we're not going to give insight into speciﬁc margins for those businesses because it's that they're very competitive. But you'll be able to see in toto I think strong margins, because of the way that we're growing that business."
"Okay. And I guess just you know one more question with the drought conditions ongoing in the West, how should we be thinking about the eﬀect on results this year. And are you – you get into more conversations of other water resource alternatives that could spur growth for you guys as people maybe get a little less comfortable with traditional water resources?","Yeah, I guess a couple of things. You remember in California we have the RAM mechanism, so usage is decoupled from revenues. The revenues are decoupled from usage. The one area that was not that way was Sacramento. However, we have ﬁled because of the restrictions and are in position of voluntary conservation measures in Sacramento. We have ﬁled and gotten approval to initiate a memorandum account to track the reduction in revenues in Sacramento so it can be rolled into the RAM also. So we feel really good about that.  In terms of the new technology opportunities, obviously we've got our desal project moving forward, and I've got to tell you it's picking up more steam particularly on the political front, because we've got a group of mayors in the Monterey Peninsula who truly understands this is the last best opportunity for that area to have water security, and that's very important. We're seeing more interest in what I'll call smaller scale desal opportunities that were – we've got some ongoing discussions regarding. And the notion of reuse is going to be really be price- driven. And so I think for in California reuse is getting more and more economic.  In other parts it needs a push because it just doesn't – with the molecule being eﬀectively free, it just doesn't have enough oomph, except in places like in certain parts of New York City where they're subsidizing it or in California where the prices are getting to a point. Walter?     Yeah, just one more thing back to California is I just want to say that we do have adequate water supplies in all of our districts throughout California, and we're monitoring that very closely, our ground water and the purchased water. But we're also working with the ﬁre department to make sure they have adequate ﬁre ﬂows to ﬁght the wildﬁres that are ongoing out in California."
"Okay. Thank you, guys.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Thanks, Dan.  Operator  Thank you, and our next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Citigroup. Please go ahead."
Good morning everyone.,Good morning.
"Give the tenor of the market-based operation contracts, the cash ﬂow certainty, as well as price certainty, have you looked at alternative ﬁnancing vehicles as a way to lower your cost of capital as you bid on further projects?","Shar, thank you for the question. One of the things as we look at our market-based businesses, they're extremely capital light. We have very little capital investment in that part of the business. It's more revenue, O&M, those type of things. In the Military, even though we build these projects, as we've said before, predominately we just deploy working capital and then we get reimbursed at certain stages. So with that said as we look at the future, we're looking at everything, but right now it's not as big of an issue because of that.     And if we end up with a greater ﬂow of concessions and things like that, we're going to remain open to whatever structures will help us lower cost of ﬁnancing without fundamentally changing risks. And that's one of the – that's why for example we're so aggressively pursuing the defeasance issues on municipal bonds so that we can retain and maintain against the low cost stuﬀ that may have been put in place on our facility. So we'll continue to look at that, but Susan's right. So far it is very capital light."
"Terriﬁc, terriﬁc, and then just one last question. As you look at your market-based operations and the viewpoint that you will – the mix will remain at a level where it doesn't increase the risk proﬁle of the company, where does I guess shale opportunities ﬁt into that outlook?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","A very good question and the answer is both. So far it has virtually all been on our regulated side of the business. We have a very good framework and model that we've been deploying with fairly rapid growth in southwestern Pennsylvania, mostly in the Marcellus, a little bit of Utica. But we do continue to have discussions with drillers on scenarios where a market-based solution may be more appropriate. But as we've said, if it's a market-based solution, we are willing to take risk on returns. We are not willing to take risk on return of. So the return on the capital that's business. But we're not going to place the return of capital at risk. So whether it's through take-or-pay contracts or some other mechanisms or commitment of acreage, we will manage the risk that way. So far it's been on the regulated side."
"Got it. Terriﬁc and congrats, Jeﬀ, on the retirement again.","Thanks, Shar, appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you and our next question is from the line of Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.     Now, Jonathan?"
Yes?,"No, you don't get to go ﬁrst. All of us in this room rooted for Notre Dame women in the basketball, and it still didn't do any good."
"No. No, it didn't. UConn just has our number in the tournament. We have them in the regular season, but I don't know what else to say. Hey, Jeﬀ, congrats on a job well done and hopefully retirement does last a little longer for you this time.  Susan, I'm just trying to understand the usage a little better during the quarter and kind of wanted to sure that I understood it correctly. The 8.9% billed sales growth is attributable to the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   diﬀerence between billed versus unbilled and just kind of timing-wise, right?","Well, we roughly estimate that 75% of that billed volume is attributable to the billed-unbilled situation. The other 25% to 30% we attribute to two things. One I mentioned earlier, what we call the drip theory or the drip eﬀect which we typically every year see in for example West Virginia, but it was so cold this year we saw it in other states. And the second piece of the volume increase we believe is due to the acquisitions. So yes, primarily it is the billed-unbilled because we don't report unbilled volume, but that's about three-quarters of it. But the rest we attribute to actual consumption increase."
"Okay. So that other 25% or 30% is that I guess what attributes to that 2% increase that you said, or the $0.02 increase quarter-over-quarter?","Yes, that we call the demand, because remember on revenue we report billed and unbilled revenue. So the revenue is pretty clear. It's the volume that we only report billed."
Right. So the 25% to 30% translates into that $0.02.,"Yes, that's correct."
"Okay. Would you say – I mean, I guess from an economic standpoint things have been improving in your service territories. I mean does that have any play or is it just kind of too early to see in terms of natural customer growth and higher usage?","We look at some – we consider some very small organic growth. It's a little too early, Jonathan, you're correct. It's very early in the ﬁrst quarter, but we have in our projection seen a very small organic growth."
"Okay. And then on the military base businesses, do you expect I guess the elevated pace of construction to continue for the remainder of the year? I think Jeﬀ you alluded that had Q1 not been so cold there actually would have been more?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah. In fact we expect that it will not go not just this year, but next year, because typically the awards that they usually made at end of the ﬁscal year that's where the $142 million of new awards came through. A lot of them are one, no more than two-year construction projects. They may bleed into year three. So that really will aﬀect the next couple of years. And then again when we hit September-October this year, we should see another round of awards, but we are also optimistic and hopeful that we'll see some additional base awards following on the heels on the last one we got."
"Yeah, that kind of leads to my next question. So I know you were talking about a pretty high number of RFPs or bases that you think are going to come up over the next four years or so. Any in the near term that you think will be decided on that you guys are participating in? And then the kind of second part, when will the new Utah base start impacting results?","So we'll take the second question ﬁrst. Utah, frankly, this is a very quick transition. Our folks are really already on the ground. We're going through the hiring process of the employees, et cetera, and I can't remember the speciﬁc date. Is it September? September we will be operating the facility.  On the others, in terms of new, I think we have said that there are about six or so that we are – that are in various stages. We're very leery about saying when the awards comes, because it is a process that has ebbs and ﬂows and so it's supposed to be an 18-month process, but quite frankly it's usually three or more years. So they are in various states.  We do think that there will hopefully be some within the next 12 months that will come forward. And when I talked about the roughly 40 or so bases that will be out in the RFPs, remember we're not going after all those. For us they really need to be in the $250 million range or higher or have some strategic positioning value where it may be a smaller contract, but it's got a lot more potential for growth or it's tied to one of the other bases that we're already on. So we will only go bid on a percentage of those."
"Got you. All right, thanks for the additional clarity and congrats on a great quarter.",Thanks Jonathan.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Leslie Rich with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
"Hi, just a couple quick questions. In your earnings release, you talk about Rex Energy and XTO Energy. Could you give a little more detail about what you did during the quarter with them?","Yeah. Both of these are entities that we have done a fair amount of work with. These are line extensions where we're building a pipeline a distance, and they'll vary on the distance, but to an area where they have got drill sites. And then what happens is they will contribute capital into that pipeline construction. We've put capital into it. It then gets rolled automatically into rates and then the revenues ﬂow as they purchase retail water.  Then any other customers that want to be served oﬀ that pipe, we have the right to serve. And so we eﬀectively end up with a certiﬁcated service territory awarded by the Commission for the right to serve everywhere around that pipeline. So most of these are going into areas that don't have water supplies today. It gives us that longer-term growth potential through both commercial and retail applications of water."
I'm sorry. How long did you say the pipelines were? Like how many customers around there could you potentially hook up?,"We've done half a mile to 10-mile line extensions. I don't think we've done any that I can think of, Susan, that are bigger than 10 miles yet. But we've done – well, I don't want to give you a number because I don't remember the exact number, but more than a handful of these."
"Okay. And then just on the expense side, you said that lower pension expense was a beneﬁt in terms of the lower employee-related costs. What do you expect for the full year on that front?","Leslie, we disclosed at Investor Day last December that we thought that pension and other post- retirement employee beneﬁts would have about a $0.06 to $0.08 impact this year."
So most of that was in the ﬁrst quarter?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"No, it's evenly spread throughout the year. It is – annually it is a long-term impact. 2014 has a larger impact than the succeeding years."
"Okay. And then ﬁnally, there was an item that you called 2013 tax beneﬁt from market-based reorganization?",Yes.
What is that?,"Last year in the ﬁrst quarter we reorganized American Water Resources, which was technically part of the market-based business, structurally legally into AWE and that allowed us to utilize state NOLs that we might otherwise have not been able to utilize. And that was a one-time occurrence the ﬁrst quarter of 2013 that we did not replicate this year."
"Got you. Okay, great. Thank you, and Jeﬀ, good luck.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you and our next question is from the line of Spencer Joyce with Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, folks. First things ﬁrst. Congrats on a good quarter, and Jeﬀ, congrats on retirement. You will be missed.","Thanks, Spencer. I appreciate it.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Yeah. We're getting kind of long here, so I'll try to keep it brief. I was just wondering if you all could give us a little bit of color on the additional $0.01 to $0.02 in West Virginia that are expected to be incurred over the balance of the year? Is that some quantiﬁable legal liability that you have or is it potentially are you still seeing some demand destruction there? Just what's behind that $0.01 to $0.02?","It is a combination of things. Yeah, there is a little bit of demand destruction, but it is getting smaller and smaller. But as you know, I think we now, we have 58 suits that we've been named in. They're largely against Freedom Chemical, but they are in bankruptcy, so we're thrown in there. We have had some good success so far in the cases where we moved them into the federal court and the federal judge to which one of them was assigned has taken the action – has taken a very key interest in this and has taken the steps to consolidate all of the cases into one case, which is good thing for the remand purposes. Right.  And so there's – but these things can play out for a while, so it's an allowance for legal costs. It's an allowance for there's still – we may – we're going to continue to do a heightened level of testing for a while, so there's those types of costs that are built into it and little bit of demand destruction."
Okay. So it...,Yeah. There's no liability in there.
Okay.,"We don't believe there is any liability. Kellye, our General Counsel, is making sure that we say it, because it is absolute correct that there is no liability expectation and we have not build that into any of our projections."
"Okay. So at this point, most of it would be more ongoing, as you said, testing, paying the lawyers, things of that nature, but no speciﬁc liability?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)",Yeah. We tried to see if we could pay the lawyers in-kind through water and they didn't – that didn't work so well.
"Yeah. That would be nice. One ﬁnal real quick one, you all went into great detail on the Rex Energy and the XTO process there, how you're getting the pipe in and how you're recovering that investment. Is it safe to say – and this can be just kind of a quick one or two-word answer, the regulatory framework there is still pretty favorable. You're not getting any kind of pushback from either local governments or the state regulators relative to what you expected in getting these types of ventures oﬀ the ground.",Just the opposite.
"Okay, fantastic. Good quarter. Thanks guys.",Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Shivangi Tipnis with Global Hunter Securities. Please go ahead.
"Thank you guys. Congratulations on a good quarter, and congratulations, Jeﬀ.",Thanks.
"My ﬁrst question is on, like, you had a very strong ﬁrst quarter. So wondering what makes you keep the guidance and not really raise it. We would have really liked to see some improvement in the low end of the guidance range. So are you being a little conservative or there are some pieces missing and we would like to know.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","The thing that you ﬁnd in the water business is the summer makes or breaks the year. And so until, from our perspective, it would take something signiﬁcant before you change guidance before you get through or at least largely through the summer, because it just can have a signiﬁcant impact.     And also remember that we give annual guidance. We don't give quarterly guidance because of diﬀerences in the quarter. We don't reveal our budget, and we don't give quarterly guidance. So for us it's an annual play."
"Okay, thank you for the color. Okay. I'm looking at your slide presentation on slide 23. It looks like your water sales in gallons for industrials, commercial and public is on the rise year-over- year compared to the residential sales. Can you provide some color on exactly what's going on there? Is it kind of a new trend developing or just like lower residential sales due to the weather impact?","Actually in my earlier comments, it's about 70% to 75% of this, especially given industrial and commercial, is due to the fact that we report only billed volume while we report billed and unbilled revenue. So at the end of 2013 we held some bills back because of our new system to ensure they were correct for our industrial customers and some of our large commercial. So we actually were able to ﬁx that in the ﬁrst quarter, so we had a lot more revenue go from unbilled to billed. So when it went to billed revenue we also reported billed volume. So you saw a marked increase. About three-quarters of that increase is due to the fact that we were making up the billings that we had in industrial and commercial especially and some residential."
"Okay. Got it. Thank you. And one question on the market-based operation, so what is the duration of your Homeowner Services business warranty contracts, and how does the pricing and cost recovery mechanism work there?",The duration is typically a year. It can be – we can either choose to continue it or the customer can. We have about an 85% renewal rate or higher especially in areas where we currently serve or we have partnerships.
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. And are you able to get – expand this customer base out of these cities where you actually provide your regulated services?,"Well, when we have exclusive partnership, for example in our Homeowner Services we oﬀer it to our existing customers in several of our states, most of our states and of course they know us and we put it on our bill. Where we have exclusive partnerships speciﬁcally New York City and Nashville and we're able to actually put it on bill with the water bill, we tend to see higher take rates."
Okay. Thank you for the color.,And renewal.
And one last quick – I'm sorry. Go ahead.,"And renewal, both take rates and renewal rates."
Okay. Thank you for the color. One last quick question in continuation of the information on the Rex and XTO Energy contracts. Where exactly do you report them? Is that in the industrials or the commercials?,It's actually in our regulated segment and it's in industrial.
Okay. And how big are these contracts and what's the scope of increasing your energy exposure?,"I think we have reported that last year I believe we sold about $3 million or $3.2 million, $4 million, $3.2 million I think in revenues last year at the regulated on the shale.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Yeah, and this year it's growing strongly. But from a risk perspective keep in mind that the capital that we spend and the investments when it's done on the regulatory side, they're automatically rolled in the rates. So we're not really taking what I would call a capital risk. And the Commission is willing to do that because we're bringing water to areas that don't currently have it and so they view as a very positive development, economic development opportunity for those communities."
"Okay, great. Thank you for the color and congratulations guys.  Operator  Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I'll turn the call back to management.","Okay. Well, I wanted to thank you all again. And I know that you will give Susan and the team the same kind of sharp look and opportunities that you have over the last four years, and I thank you very much.     Wait. Before you're oﬀ the line, Jeﬀ – given that this is Jeﬀ's last call, I just want to take a few minutes to recognize him. Now Jeﬀ does not know that I am doing so I'm glad that you can't see the look that he's giving me right now as he sits to my right. I do want to just mention we have a slide we want to pull up.  American Water has achieved some extraordinary things during Jeﬀ's tenure as President and CEO. In terms of ﬁnancial performance, American Water has grown its market capitalization from less $4 billion to more than $8 billion without an equity issuance. We've strengthened our balance sheet with increases in revenue, net margin and cash ﬂow. We've garnered credit ratings increases from both agencies. We achieved our stretch O&M eﬃciency ratio goal two years early, and both our regulated and market-based businesses have seen impressive growth.  In fact if you have been a shareholder, which you should have, since Jeﬀ joined us back in 2007, you have enjoyed an almost 130% total shareholder return. That has led to a dividend increase year-over-year and today we are one of the leaders in dividend growth. Not too shabby for less than four years' work.  But that's just part of what Jeﬀ is done here at the company from taking the lead in raising the value of water idea on a national basis to shepherding American Water to become the ﬁrst U.S. water provider on the Dow Jones sustainability index, to creating a culture of continuous improvement. There just aren't many CEOs who have accomplished so much and especially in   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   such a short time. And he's done it in a way that leaves a lasting legacy for us to continue to build upon.  Some of you know Jeﬀ hates to wear a coat and tie. He is much more comfortable in blue jeans riding horses, so right now we tip our hats to him, our leader, our mentor and our friend. And we wish him the best as he rides oﬀ to enjoy the new challenges his future brings. And now we're done.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference.
