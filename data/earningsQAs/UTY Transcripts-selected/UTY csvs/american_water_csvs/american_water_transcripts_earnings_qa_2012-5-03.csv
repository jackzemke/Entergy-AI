Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Jeﬀ, I guess on your last comment, so I guess how should we think about the natural regulatory lag now with both Pennsylvania and New Jersey oﬀering DSIC [ph] like structures. As I know traditionally, we've always thought of it as, so we have like a target [inaudible] minus 100 basis points to 125 basis points from [inaudible] and then 100 basis points to 150 basis points for regulatory lag. Where do you see that migrating towards?","Yes, I think the 150 basis points of regulatory lag is declining as we get DSICs in place and as we get declining usage built into place. Now, obviously the best approach is when you have an automatic adjustment mechanism, but in other states like was done in New Jersey, we have a future test year and then have forecasted a year forward in terms of consumption. And then, that's what's being put in. So by the time rates go into eﬀect they're recovering costs. You go two years and you start to still have some more lag.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   But -- so I think that 150 basis points is what we're trying to shrink, do we ever get it to zero. Well, probably not. But if we can squeeze it down to 50 basis points, so that's a 100 basis point pick up, plus in some of our jurisdictions, and I'll use New York as an example, we have a dead band where we're allowed to earn above our allowed return for a little bit and then we start sharing access, if there are any additional returns. So, our goal is to drive it to zero and we're not going to be satisﬁed till we get there. But you'll always have a little bit of correction.  And on the rental [ph] gap, obviously that presented, when I ﬁrst came it was about 125 basis points, it's already shrunk down to about a 100 basis points just because it's static and our total business is growing and so that will continue to happen. But obviously until something is done with that, that it won't go to zero. It will slowly migrate down to 75 basis points and lower."
"Okay. And [inaudible]. I notice in some recent presentations you've put in a new area chart that kind of depicts your 7% to 10% EPS growth, like the sources of that. And I guess can you kind of talk about where you think we are in like when I look at the X axis because at over the short- term, it depicts like half of the EPS growth comes from ROE improvement, but I think we've achieved a good chunk of that, right?",Yes.
"[multiple speakers] going towards the right, it leans more into new services and then acquisitions?","Yes, we started using this frankly at the Analyst Day a year ago, a little over a year ago February of 2011. And its purpose is to just kind of -- is to conceptually present. And there is no speciﬁc timeline, because frankly, we're in diﬀerent parts of that curve or diﬀerent parts of each of these curves today. So for example on the ROE improvement frankly, we're making more progress than -- we're making faster progress.  Here's the way I think about it long-term, we are investing $800,000 to $1 billion of CapEx a year, call it a midpoint of $900 million. That $900 million is oﬀset by depreciation of about $300 million, so that's a net rate base addition of about $600 million. As you add that into our existing rate base, we're driving 6% to 7% growth in earnings, just oﬀ that fundamental driver. And that does not include, for example, acquisitions, new services, the value of eﬃciencies that we build in, because we think about the eﬃciencies as really creating head room to add this capital.  So that's where we're comfortable with a 7% to 10% growth rate as it's basically given the baseline of that comes from the investment strategy. Now the key is obviously can we recover that. And that's why the focus on eﬃciency, because it gives us that head room. Remember   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   though one of the kind of rules of thumb that we talked about is $1 of O&M has the same impact on rates as $6 of capital. But that $6 of capital generates $0.30 of earnings for you. So that's the way we think and work on how do we drive operational eﬃciency to create headroom for capital growth."
"Okay. So -- and one follow-up question for that. So with regards to the DRIP and equity needs, how big has the DRIP got and would you agree that through use of the DRIP and through the NOL, it looks like you could be equity free for a long time?","Let me ﬁrst address the DRIP and employee stock purchases. Last year they provided about $5 million worth of cash for the company, so they are not huge providers of cash and year-to-date, we've seen about $700,000 that's come in for the First Quarter. So, again, we're not seeing them as large inputs. As we've said, there won't be an equity oﬀering, we don't foresee one in 2012 because we had around $450 million come in as it relates to Arizona and New Mexico, and another $60 million that came in as a result of our acquisition of New York and divestiture of Ohio on May 1. So we have suﬃcient cash to get through this year and we've not yet talked about the future years. But again, we're continuing to see our equity ratio improve and I should note that for the First Quarter, actually we moved up to 43% equity, we're at 42% as of year-end."
"Okay. Thank you, very much. Appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs.",
"Hi, guys.","Hi.     How are you, Neil."
"Doing well. So a couple of questions here. First is, Jeﬀ, if you could talk about the way you're thinking about a potential dividend raise and your dividend pay out as you think about the cash   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   that's coming in from some of these asset sales?","Okay. Obviously, we think about dividend as a eﬃcient use of capital decision in terms of what can we invest to continue to build the business and what's an appropriate cash return. As you know, our payout ratio has now drifted below 50% because of our strong earnings growth. And what we're seeing obviously is our dividend growth has been about 5% but our earnings growth has been substantively higher than that. That's something we're taking a hard look at as to what's that appropriate mix on a go-forward basis.  I think it used -- when the company ﬁrst came public, I think we used the payout ratio were 50% to 70% of the guideline, frankly, that's fairly broad, we're obviously now even a little bit below that. So we're taking a look at what's appropriate going forward. I think you'll see from us a little more speciﬁc conversation relative to the dividend and what our policy is going forward, as we move forward through a little more time this year."
"Got it. And the second question relates to volumes here, at some point you got to think the diminishing marginal returns of eﬃciency and changes in customer behavior where all the easy games have been won and the volume decrease associated with it will start to fade a little bit. How are you thinking about that or do you think that 1.5% that we saw in the First Quarter is sustainable for a long period of time?","What we're seeing is it's been sustainable for a long period time. We would expect it to continue as a lot of the areas that we serve are older areas. And so over time, there are homes continues to take out the older appliances, and put in the newer appliances. We have seen it start to ﬂatten only in a very, very few places. And again as you talk about more water eﬃcient devices we've now seen that move through the outdoors. So more watering devices have become more eﬃcient as well. So I would expect that to continue for a while.     Yes, Id' agree, Neil. The big thing that Ellen hit on and this is one of the things that I think you'll see is on the irrigation side. More people have not just gone to drip irrigation, but now they're starting to use sensors. And so I think we'll continue to see. I think it would be in-house stuﬀ. Yes, you hit a point of diminishing [inaudible] we probably see more potential for that. And that's why we're focused on making sure that we get appropriate mechanisms in place. At some point there's a level out. Yes, I would agree with you, but I don't think it's in the next -- we personally aren't expecting it in the next three to ﬁve years let's say."
"Thank you. And then the last question is on -- a quick update on the New Jersey rate case. As when I looked at the ﬁnal outcome here, the little bit of a lower hit rate than we historically see   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   versus your ask [ph]. Can you help us understand some of the components of the delta between the request and the ﬁnal outcome?","Yes. I'll let Walter to take that.     Yes, thanks Jeﬀ. Yes, there are two real reasons, the ﬁnal revenue requirement in the rate case showed a decrease in expenses from the original ﬁling and it was in our press release that we issued couple of days ago that there's about $10 million less expenses in the ﬁnal revenue requirement than when the original ﬁling occurred. And also we have taken a more aggressive approach in our declining usage mechanism. In the original ﬁling, we ﬁled for a two year look ahead to get the revenue recognition for that. And in the settlement, in the $30 million, we got about one year of that. So that really explains some of the gap.     When you take a hard look through it, there is no capital that was disallowed on -- or costs were allowed, all of our operating costs. We got a one-year forward look on use on declining usage. So I -- and since [ph] I think making some people will look just at the -- at the $90 million [ph] and the $30 million say you only got a third [ph]. Well that's not really the appropriate comparison, because of the O&M change that which is really a savings. And you bet, we're going to pass that on to customers as well as the way that we approached the declining usage caused the size of the increase to look much larger than, for example, it hasn't in prior years."
"Okay. Thank you, very much Jeﬀ, Ellen.","Thanks Neil.  Operator  Thank you. Ryan Connors, Janney Montgomery Scott."
"Hi. This is actually Tim Feron ﬁlling in for Ryan who is on the road. I just had another question on the New Jersey case, we obviously have the numbers. But I'm -- was just curious if it was -- if the whole process was more or less contentious than in the past. And do you think the fact that the DSIC was attached to the case could have had some aﬀect on the ultimate award?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   I don't think the DSIC really had much eﬀect on it. I think this is one of the reasons why we are being much more active in communicating with our customers on issues around value of water. New Jersey has had a series of rate increases and it's because we haven't done what needed to be done there for a while.  And so, I think that attracted a bit more attention and particularly in -- there is a couple of individuals who took the mantle up about just no rate increases. We understand that I think the notion that this was a settled case with all of the major parties continues to speak well for a stable regulatory environment in the state of New Jersey.  And it's, obviously, it's a settlement we believe we not only live with but we think is fair and reasonable. I think the media coverage because of some of the, the stir up if you will, from a couple of folks in the political world, yes, it created more attention, if you will. Well that's ﬁne, we understand the concerns and we're going to continue to work with those folks to help them better understand why you have to invest and what that means to rate long term.     Tim, can I also add the DSIC was actually a separate ﬁlings from the rate case and it just so happened they were on the same agenda. But until now the comments we've had are very favorable around the DSIC. So I want to separate -- don't believe the DSIC was in way driving reaction to the rate case."
"Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And thanks for taking my call.  Operator  [Operator Instructions] David Paz, Bank of America.",
Good morning.,"Good morning, David.     Good morning, Dave."
"Just on New Jersey, on the DSIC speciﬁcally, can you just walk me through how that will be implemented, if we look hopefully next year. And then just any expected earnings impact, but   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   more speciﬁcally maybe capital deployment impact? Thank you.","Yes. Dave, this is Walter. I'll take that question. The Board of Public Utilities approved the DSIC program on May 1, but it's not eﬀective until it's published in New Jersey register. We expect that to occur in early June and then American Water and New Jersey American Water will ﬁle the foundational ﬁling shortly thereafter. BPU had 90 days to review that ﬁling and when it is reviewed [technical diﬃculty] start investing and we'll invest for a six month period and then we'll make our ﬁrst ﬁling the Board of Public Utilities will then have 60 days to review that ﬁling and approve it and then rates will go in eﬀect at that point. We expect the impact to be sometime in the Third Quarter 2013."
"And in terms of just how you allocate capital, should we expect higher percentage going in New Jersey versus other states versus historically?","Yes. I mean with this mechanism, it's [technical diﬃculty] in New Jersey. We're going to increase our investment there.     Yes, you've seen Dave, I think a ﬂow of capital into Pennsylvania into Missouri and now into New Jersey because that's what these mechanisms incent."
"Great. Okay. And then on declining usage, can you say which states that you believe you have the mechanisms in place that address decline in usage?",I'm sorry. Which states we've mechanisms in place that address the decline in usage?
Yes.,"Clearly, California, which had a balancing account for declining usage.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   New York.     New York also has a similar account that takes into eﬀect, declining usage as well as costs. And then in New Jersey, we now have a one-year forward look on it. Illinois has always been a -- it has been a future test year for us, so that has a one year look in it. Missouri, has recognized some of it as well.     Pennsylvania.     And Pennsylvania deﬁnitely as time through [ph] has recognized a one-year future on declining usage. And I'm sure I missed one state --     Well, Kentucky is also --     Iowa and Kentucky, yes.     Kentucky is also a future test year. So that has built in now. A future test year in and of itself it does not fully meet what we believe is necessary, but if you do a future test year plus a roll forward, we're getting pretty close. And that's what happened in New Jersey."
"Got it. Okay. And then just last to clarify, Jeﬀ, I think you said that you ﬁled two cases year-to- date and Ellen you said one. How -- just to clarify how many cases have been ﬁled year-to-date?","We have ﬁled two, one of which has already been resolved. And so it's kind of odd, but it's a very small operation and we ﬁled and it has already been accepted and approved. So that's why we only have one outstanding.     We have this internal debate whether Michigan is really a ﬁling or not since we have the ability to put in rates after we have submitted our letter notifying them.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Actually got it. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Heike Doerr, Robert W. Baird.",
Thank you. Good morning.,"Hi, Heike.     Good morning."
"Not to believe are this New Jersey rate case, but I wondered if we could talk a little bit about the ROE, I believe you calculated it via --.",We'd like to talk about your twins Heike.
"They are still inside, eight weeks to go.",Hang in there.
"That's a nice way to distract from my ROE question, Jeﬀ.","Heike, I would never do that to you.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Walter, you mentioned that there was $10 million that was related to O&M if we look at that 95.5 [ph] as our starting base, maybe it makes more sense to think about it as 85.5 [ph]. I know the ROE is a little bit below what the going rate has been in New Jersey. Is there anything you can comment on that?",We believe Heike our ROE is in line with what [inaudible] and United and others have perceived as well.
"Okay. I thought that those companies had during their last rate proceedings, the most recent being completed in February, had been at a 10.3 [ph]?","Now they are at 10.15 [ph], I think is what [inaudible]."
"Okay. And as we look ahead, Ellen, I believed you mentioned, we were expecting four rate cases in 2012, does that include the Michigan and the Virginia case that's already been ﬁled or is that four more from here on out?",It does include the Virginia case that has been ﬁled.
Okay. And can you share with us what states those are?,No. Heike it is our philosophy to believe that really the ﬁrst person we show that with is the regulator and their staﬀ.
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   [Operator Instructions] Kevin Cole, Credit Suisse.",
"Hi Jeﬀ. Can I just ask a quick follow-up question on the dividend. As I believe you have been doing some I guess a grassroots like conversations with your investors to see what they want from a yield and a part [ph] perspective. I guess like how do that shape up and were you able to get an indication from your investors if they want to keep doing a stay and then I guess in a sub 3.5% water, I guess normal payout ratio or be elevated to more like an electric in the mid-4% range?","You know what you're applying to in those conversations which I have found very helpful and interesting is people obviously are -- have a little diﬀerent perspectives on the basis of what kind of a fund they run et cetera. But the fundamentals were predictable, stable and growing, and those are the three components that I think were common in all of the folks that we've talked to. And so that eﬀective, that is what we'll be guiding us going forward.  When I say stable that doesn't mean that you don't change at all, but it means that it's -- that [inaudible] risk of it being -- having to be caught obviously. And the predictable really goes to the -- the more of the notion of the dividend policy as opposed to what the speciﬁc dividend is. We had good conversations with diﬀerent approaches that have been used by diﬀerent ﬁrms. And I think you'll see from us an approach going forward that will be predictable, stable and growing."
"I guess the -- I guess in the recent years, the dividend increases have not tracked the EPS growth?",That's correct.
And so should we think of there's going to be like a I guess a one-time true up in the payout or in the -- sorry?,"Kevin, as you know, the dividend decision is a subject matter for the Board and their action. I think what you'll see is something that ﬁts those criteria of predictable, stable and growing. I'll tell you that I have a personal bias against things where you do one times, whether it's big jumps or ex dividends, those are rare times when I think those kinds of approaches are appropriate.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
Okay. That's fair. And then did you -- did you say earlier when the Board is deciding the dividend?,"Well, we meet often on and all throughout the year. So no, we have not said when a speciﬁc decision, our next declaration, I can't remember when the date is scheduled, yes."
"Okay. But your investor meeting is next week, is that right?",Our annual meeting is next week.
"Okay. All right. Thank you, sir. Appreciated it.","You bet. Thank you.  Operator  Spencer Joyce, Hilliard Lyons."
"Hey, Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.",Hi.
"I had to hop on here, kind of like so I apologize in advance if may have already covered this, but just a couple of quick questions. The $1.90 to $2 guidance range that is continuing operations, correct?",American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Correct.
"Okay. And just the other one regards the expense side, it looks like we had a real nice quarter, bringing down some employee-related costs. I'm just wondering if you all can provide a little color on maybe how close you all are to sort of a terminal destination there, or should we expect some signiﬁcant improvement in some future quarters?","Well, we've given -- we've made public a goal of having an operating eﬃciency ratio of at least no greater than 40% by 2015. We're certainly on target, I think to hit that kind of a goal maybe even to be able to beat it a little bit. It's not just what our absolute level of operating costs are, because we have re-run two very diﬀerent businesses, our regulated business is capital- intensive, our market-based business is operating cost intensive. So we really look at the two as separate pieces.  You also keep in mind that one of the major things we've got going on now is our business transformation project which is bringing to the table, new platform IT systems that we have not had. Over time, we expect that to be able to help reduce operating cost because we will not have to do as much as we're doing today manually. Now that doesn't happen on day one that the systems get implemented and those systems start being implemented in August of this year through about the same time probably next year in three diﬀerent phases.  But it takes a little bit of time to get people comfortable to these systems and then we can use attrition and the like to help continue to reduce the employee side expenses of running the basic business. Ellen, anything you'd add?     All right. I think that's it. And again when you look at our operating expenses, the total transformation we are going through with our systems will impact all lines of our expenses, including things like today we can't do an electronic bill, so we will be able to do that in the future. So we will expect to see less printing costs, less mailing costs. So again, we're looking at all lines that will be impacted as we put new and much more customer friendly systems in."
"Okay. Yes, so it looks like, we do have some ongoing things here?",Yes.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yes.
Okay. Thanks a lot. That's all I had. Nice quarter.,"Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.     Well, I'll just thank you for your continued interest and support of what we're doing at American Water and again invite you to participate in our Annual Meeting and we look forward to seeing you down the road.
