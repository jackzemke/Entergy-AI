Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.",Good morning Shar.     Hey Shar.
"So just a couple questions here. So, ﬁrst starting with the sale of the New York utility Walter, where are we in the process versus kind of your expectations and guidance and what does the potential creation of these kind of water authorities mean for the process assuming the Governor signs them?","Well, we continue to work with Liberty cooperatively to get to the end point of selling the systems and we do believe that this sale will happen. We're working with the commission staﬀ, with the commission, with the Governor's oﬃce to advance this sale. It's just a lot there as far as the North Shore Water Authority, the South Shore Water Authority. There was legislation passed   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   waiting Governor's approval that's just all part, I think of how they're looking at this on Long Island to get this deal done. So again, we continue to work in a cooperative way with everybody to get to the end point. We're conﬁdent that this will happen."
"Got it. Got it. And then, the infrastructure bill and D.C. authorizes almost I think $15 billion for EPA water funding, and millions annually for like programs, like leak reduction, and leak reduction, and see overﬂows.  Do you sort of see this as a crowding out of sort of the private capital like yours, i.e., slowing potential muni acquisition growth or is it kind of a drop in the bucket for from a national perspective?","Yeah, thanks for that Shar and we welcome the attention to the water and wastewater industry. You know, the signiﬁcant investment that's needed over the next 20 years and we've talked many times about $1 trillion needed. So while this is good money to be put to good causes there's still a lot to go and again we're just happy to be in the discussion with the administration as far as the in the infrastructure plan.  We do think the money set aside for the lead service line replacement and also the PFAS treatment is good and it will help many communities out there. But again, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the overall spending that's necessary and we don't see it impacting in any way our investment or our growth in the water and wastewater sector through acquisitions."
Got it. Got it. And then just lastly it's sounds like Monterey County is getting closer to ﬁling for eminent domain for the local system assets from Cal Am. There is a third party study that's I think forthcoming based on the June 28 vote. Can we just get an overview of sort of what this process could look like from a timing and valuation perspective?,"Well, as we know this is a multi-year process and right now, they're working through getting approval from the local agency formation commission. And then once they get that approval they've got to go through a series of diﬀerent trials the right to take trial, and then evaluation trial. And so again, it will take years to work through that, but the ﬁrst step is getting through the what's called LafCo I mean getting their approval before they can move forward with the condemnation."
Got it. Fantastic. Thanks guys that's all I had.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),Thanks Shar.     Thanks Shar.  Operator  Our next question will come from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Good morning everyone.,Hey Ryan.     Hey Ryan.
Any additional color you can oﬀer at this point around the grand jury subpoena whether it be timeline for resolution or potential implications as the process plays out?,Yeah Ryan really is nothing more we can say it's ongoing our disclosure is everything that we can say about it at this point.
Got it. And then you guys highlighted a couple of new State Legislative items and then obviously the in for built the federal level. Any key states that you're watching from here just in terms of other constructive legislation that could come up but might be in earlier days still?,"Well in Pennsylvania there's a Senate Bill that's right in line with the water accountability act -- water quality accountability act so we're tracking that that's working its way through in the Senate and then, it'll be introduced into the house over there. So, we're expecting that to progress this year in 2021. So keep an eye out for that, that would be the fourth state. As you   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   know, we were working with Missouri and Indiana to get theirs, and also start here in New Jersey. So, we're thrilled at Pennsylvania's moving forward with that."
"Great. And then maybe just lastly, in terms of the New York American Water sale piggybacking oﬀ the earlier question is the expectation that the whole New York American Water operations would ultimately get sold to Liberty or do you expect the carve out with the new authorities?",Yeah. We're working through that. We do expect the sale to go to Liberty in its entirety and then they would work through whatever comes after that.
Great. Appreciate the time.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning team, thanks for taking my question.",Hey Durgesh.
Hey Walter. Just quick clariﬁcation on the New York American just Susan I think you mentioned in the last call that the sale doesn't impact -- whether New York ends up being sold or not doesn't impact the amount of equity and timing of the equity is that still the case?,Yeah. That's still the case Durgesh.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, perfect. And then maybe just two quick things on 2021. Susan just market base earnings continue to be down this is the second consecutive quarter and you mentioned claims expense. Can you maybe just elaborate on that a little bit? Is this still sort of the Texas event from Q1 dragging on to Q2 or what's or other claims in certain parts of the -- of your service territory there that are more adverse than others?","Yeah. Let me make just a couple comments and Walter can certainly weigh in. I think, the weather event that we saw in the ﬁrst quarter in Texas and Illinois, that was really isolated to the ﬁrst quarter. But we have seen a continuation of sort of higher claims experience.  I think really largely driven by more at home activities. We've got more folks at home and there's more pressure on systems and so, we're seeing more failures and more work being done by the HOS team. And so that, that claims experience has been a bit higher than we would have expected. And I think, you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the business.  We've seen more of that occur and there's also a little bit of higher marketing expense. We didn't call that out speciﬁcally, but a bit more marketing expense as we continue to introduce new products throughout the HOS territory. So, it really is a factor I think of sort of the pandemic itself and just a bit higher experience than we would have anticipated."
Got it. That's super helpful. And then just one last for me can you just share the July sort of weather experience across your service territories?,"Well, again, we beneﬁt from having diversity across geographic diversity across our system so we have seen some weather than normal conditions in some areas but oﬀset by dryer and others but, overall, I'd say again, some additional precipitation in some areas and others not so, but all we can say at this point Durgesh."
"Yeah, it sounds like more like neutral. Okay. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time.  Operator  Our next question will come from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.",
"Thank you. The ﬁrst question is on the pace of M&A, the tuck-in acquisitions, it seems like you guys still have a pretty healthy going there. What's a, what's a good annualized customer   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   addition rate that we should be embedding maybe in the ﬁve year plan and that might be embedded in your plan as well?","Yeah. Well 1.5% to 2.5% were around 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 customers a year is what we you should think in that term. And again, we continue to build our pipeline -- we continue to build our pipeline , Insoon. we've increased therefore $1.23 million to $1.3 million we continue to have discussions with communities across our footprint because we can provide solutions and that's what they're looking for.  So, we're really proud of our eﬀorts there and we just continue to build that pipeline and we're really proud to have 37 diﬀerent deals signed up waiting to get regulatory approval across 8 diﬀerent states. So the growth is not just happening in two or three or four states, it's happening across our footprint."
"Understood. And then just a little bit more broadly, as we see just continue to increase focus on whether it's at the federal level or state level on water infrastructure, water quality whatnot. And you guys always provide the breakout of the diﬀerent investments you make on an annual basis, whether it's pipes, sourcing, IT, others, where do you think the most upside opportunity exists as we go through time and if there's just to address some of these increased focus on these items. Is it more technological advancements that we might not be baking in just curious on your proper thoughts.","You know it's a real combination I would say looking at the categories that water quality and resiliency are going to continue to get a good size of our investment and maybe even increasing over time just because with all the storms and the weather variability out there we need to continue to make sure that our systems are resilient and we need to continue to address the emerging contaminants like, PFAS and others so it's going to require signiﬁcant investment. Hopefully answers your question.  Operator  Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning Walter and Susan. Couple for you. Start with Missouri. Walter, the revised infrastructure shortage program is that going to allow you to extend the time between rate cases or the fact that it kind of encompasses a wider range of eligible spend that the kind of keep you on that three-year cadence still.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We'll continue to evaluate that Jonathan, we're just really thrilled that we're able to expand the program outside of St. Louis County and our teams worked hard to provide the input to the commission to see how important that is that we invest across our footprint in Missouri.  So, we're excited about that and also increasing the cap. So, we can make more investment before we have to go into a rate case. So it may contribute in some way to the timing between rate cases."
"Okay. And then shifting closer to you. Pennsylvania, what is the latest on the commissioner appointments to ﬁll the open seat, plus commissioner sweeps. I know, Governor was with through his one nominee back in May. Is there any updates along those lines?","No, none here. Well, when Pennsylvania commissions always been great to work with and reasonable in their treatment towards us and we expect that going forward."
Okay. Are you a super maybe what do you anticipate in terms of the timing of the close of the York Wastewater deal? Is that assumed by the end of this year in order to get to that $300 million M&A capital deployed?,"Yeah. We're assuming at this point, the ﬁrst half of 2022, we submit our application on July 1st. The commission is looking at it once they deem it complete, then they'll start processing. And we again, we think ﬁrst half of 2022."
"Okay. So without it I guess I just kind of struggled to get to that $300 million based on what's in the hoppers is there something I'm missing or do you just have enough pending deals that close? You know, excluding the York one to get you to that $300 million or is that something that might fall a little short this year but then next year is going to more than oﬀset it with the York deal.","Yeah, let me say we're conﬁdent in the $1.9 billion number and that's from in the obviously the investment our systems and the acquisitions that we are making."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. And then maybe Susan going back to, to Durgesh's questions along homeowner services. If the claims I guess were year-to-date if there are more in line with historic levels how would the market based businesses year-to-date EPS compared to last year would it make up the entire $0.05 lower delta?","Yeah. I think that's a fair way to look at it again we've just seen a much higher claims experience than we have in the prior periods and we really think again much of it is related to more at home activities . The business continues to grow, we continue to execute on our partnership arrangements, we continue to look for new products and roll out new products in that business.  So I think the business is just is fundamentally doing what we have set out for it to do . This claims experience issue is one that I think again is directly related to just activity and we'll hopefully see that mitigate some as we head into the latter part of this year and into next as we hopefully although it's diﬃcult to sort of imagine that on a day-to-day basis these days we'd return to some sort of a normal environment where people are sort of out of the homes and back in work environments but that really is the primary driver I'd say the rest of the business is operating as we'd expect it to."
"Yeah. Amen to get back to that normalcy. Okay. So, it sounds like everything other than that going well whether it's I guess you get the reprise the kind of the claims level for some reason that doesn't I guess the overall trajectory of market based business to that 7% to 10% is still very much I guess kind of where you would expect it to be absent just kind of temporary hip belt?","Yeah, I think that's right. That's way to look at it."
