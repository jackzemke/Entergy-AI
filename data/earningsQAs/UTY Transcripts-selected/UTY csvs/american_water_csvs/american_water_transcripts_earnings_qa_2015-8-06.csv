Question,Answer
"Hey. Good morning, guys.","Hi, Dan."
"Susan, you kind of talked a bit about Keystone. Obviously, it's an interesting opportunity. But the trailing earnings contribution that you guys showed when you bought it wasn't particularly all that large. Is that number or earnings contribution – has that changed since 2014 in some appreciable way? And then, you kind of look out over forward, what's going to drive that business with or without an improvement in drilling activity in the region?","Dan, thank you for the question. We're going – on December the 15, at our Analyst Day, we're going to be providing a deeper look forward in all parts of our growth triangle, including Keystone and the shale area."
So is that southern for you're not going to answer the question?,Yes. It is.
"Okay. Very good. On the growth triangle, you guys said that Non-Reg is not going to get to be more than 15% to 20% of contribution from roughly 10%-ish today. Is that the correct messaging?","That's correct. And, currently, over the past three years, our earnings from the Market-Based business has been around 9%, so that puts it in context. In the past, Dan, we've talked mainly just from revenue numbers. So we've actually added more transparency and talking about earnings from that segment as opposed to just revenues."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. And, I guess, we didn't really get into what else is going on with the core of that business these days, but just can you give an update on government contract in the home businesses and kind of where you're seeing the opportunities right now or where the actions have been this year so far?","Sure. One thing, because we won the two military bases last year, we're starting to see the revenues, as well as some of the working capital we're putting into some of the projects on those bases. There are currently several outstanding RFPs. As we've mentioned before, when they will be awarded is we never can predict with a tremendous amount of accuracy. There's a chance maybe one can be awarded this year, maybe two to three next year that we're involved with.  But what's important on military – and I think it's important – and you asked that in your question. Military – it's not just the new bases but the continuing projects that are on the existing bases beyond just the O&M contracts that we have – the money we get paid each year for running the water and wastewater systems. So, I will tell you that we currently have on the books, I believe, another $200 million of backlog of existing projects to do on the basis that we already have. So, the Military Services, we continue to ensure that we're providing the best water and wastewater services for those military men and women who serve our country.  On the homeowner services, as we said, we had mentioned about Orlando. We have launched it this year. So, we're starting to get customers signing up in Orlando. Orlando also presents for us the ﬁrst place that we have a much deeper service oﬀering beyond just water and sewer line, but also HVAC and in-home plumbing. So, that's another opportunity there.  And, as I mentioned in my comments, we were awarded an exclusive contract that has been signed for Rialto, California which is about 55,000 potential customers. And then we won the bid for exclusive contract with Wilmington, Delaware, but the city council still needs to approve that. And we're hoping to launch both of those by the end of the year. So, in those two areas, that's what we're seeing from that Market-Based business."
"I guess just one last one, Susan. When you think about moving into these new cities, is there a start-up cost associated with trying to recruit customers and acquisition-wise where you have more expense on the front-end as you push into these towns to get people and then it pays oﬀ over time. Or are you guys amortizing that expense over a longer period?","Dan, we love that you listen to us when we talk to you. Yes. The answer is yes. We have the upfront marketing expenses, and because we have to let people know that we're there. And one thing that's important. We put a lot of emphasis on these exclusive partnerships. That's important because, in an exclusive partnership, our billing is typically on the city or the municipality or whatever the governmental entity or the entity is, it's on their water and/or wastewater bill. So, for us, that tends to be a higher take rate. And that's why those are so   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   important for us as opposed to just – we do have areas where we just generally market and we provide separate billing. But the exclusive contracts are really much more eﬀective for us ﬁnancially."
Got it. Thank you.,"Thanks, Dan.  Operator  The next question comes from Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead."
"Great. Thank you. A few questions this morning, if I might. First, just on the guidance. It seemed like – I noticed weather is still a $0.07 plus or minus swing point in the guidance, even here kind of mid way through the third quarter I guess. So, just wanted to get some color on that. That seemed like it was a little large in terms of a swing factor there at this point in the year. So, I just want to get some ﬂavor on why that's such a large wildcard at this point.","Ryan, the chart that we have in there shows the major variability as of February 25. So, that's the full year variability. In terms of the impact of weather that we've seen thus far in July, it's about $4 million net income. And it's due to wet weather across our system."
"Okay. I see. So, it's safe to say that that gap has closed then at this point and we're largely – that gap has tightened up?",That's right. And this variability chart is the one that we provided to you at the December 15 call.
Got it. Got it. Okay.,"One thing, as we look at this too. The reason we put multiple items up there is, as we establish a range, we understand there is going to be variability. Some of the variability oﬀset each other.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So, you don't take each one in isolation. But, as you remember, we started in 2013 saying, so why do we have a $0.10 range, why do we have the range we do? Here are some factors up or down, puts or takes. So, it's important to look at it all in context as a whole."
"Right. Now, wanted to talk a little bit, just get some color on this WRAM application for the extension there. Now you mentioned, Walter, that the decision there is expected mid to late 2016. Seems like a pretty straightforward ﬁling and a pretty good deal for the ratepayers. So, I'm just wondering what the key points of debate are on that ﬁling and where the pushback is, if any, on the way that that's structured.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ryan. I think two things. One is the length of time over which we're going to be able to recover it. And the other is the return that we're asking for. It will take time to work through that. And that's why we say it will take to mid-2016 to get the decision."
"Okay. And it's my understanding that the application seeks to establish the WRAM balance as a – itself as a Regulatory asset. Is that correct? And if so, can you kind of give us a very brief CliﬀsNotes version of how that works?","Yes. It is essentially setting it up as an accounts receivable from the customer, which would be a regulatory asset."
"Okay. Okay. And then, Susan, you mentioned that at the NARUC Summer Meetings some of your sustainability initiatives were highlighted. And that's great. Could you also kind of give us any takeaways from those meetings in terms of what's around the corner, just looking ahead at the big regulatory developments? Any big topics there about what might be next in terms of policy developments or regulatory evolution in the water space?","Sure. Well, I'll start and I know Walter may have a couple things since he was at the meetings also. One of the things that we're very excited about that was launched at the Summer NARUC Meeting is a step forward in terms of, not just water-energy nexus, but the look at – in most state utility commissions, they look separately at electric, gas and water. One of the things that President Edgar rolled out was an eﬀort at NARUC to start looking at where all utilities could come together on common items such as, for example, critical infrastructure, cyber security, looking at how we could work together, looking at the fact that things like the mechanisms for infrastructure replacement.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   There are a lot of issues at state utility commissions that really cross the boundaries of electricity, gas and water. And so, there is an eﬀort to create this project or this task force at NARUC to look at what those are and where commission can work with utilities in a state to ﬁnd the areas that we can ﬁnd some common ground and some common eﬀorts. An example for us in California is the Monterey pilot, the AMI pilot, that Walter mentioned.  What that is, is that we actually partnered with Paciﬁc Gas & Electric and we're using some of their backbone to put the water meters there, so that we can send alert to those customers. They have a very steep tiered pricing structure for water in Monterey. So, we can actually send as part of the customers on the pilot signals when they're about to enter a new tier of pricing or they set a budget and we can send them messages when they're getting close to the budget.  That's just one example. Also, we're very involved and, actually, in American Water, we adopt the electric utility industries' NIST standards for cyber security. We're very involved with the Department of Homeland Security and DoD on those things. So, there's a lot of eﬀorts like that and we're very excited at NARUC where we're looking at cross-utility type projects that can beneﬁt all of us.     I think Susan did a great job recapping the meeting. I mean, the four areas, again, as she mentioned: water-energy nexus and opportunities for us to work with the electric and gases, cyber security in the same way, regulatory mechanisms that are going to be continued to incentivize us to invest and upgrade our water and wastewater systems, and then where can we partner with electrics and gases to drive better customer service. Those are the key themes that I saw coming out of NARUC."
"Great. Well, as usual, that's very comprehensive and helpful. Thanks for your time.","Thanks, Ryan.  Operator  The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Hey, Susan, Linda. Michael subbing in for Mike Dandurand today.","Hi, Michael.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Hey, guys. One question on the Clearwater acquisition – Keystone Clearwater acquisition. Keeping in a separate legal structure, how do you think about the optionality that creates if this business continues to grow in terms of potential revisions to the corporate structure? In terms of whether this is a business that – and I don't know if legally it could. Is this a business that could eventually wind up in an MLP structure? And if you don't mind into answering that ﬁrst and then I may do one follow-up.","Okay. Sure. We did look at that. And I will tell you that just a little more color around the legal structure. So, there is a separate holding company that – Water Solutions Holdings that actually is the holding company for Keystone Clearwater. And that holding company is 95% owned by American Industrial Water which is also a separate LLC and 5% from Sand Hills Management, which is the founding members, which includes the current CEO and President and COO. So we're glad they not only are staying to run the business, they continue to have an equity ownership. So, that's how it's structured legally.  We did actually, Michael, get – we took a look at MLPs. A few things, just to let you know that we are constantly monitoring it. The EBITDA last year of Keystone Clearwater was around $15 million. Even some of the smaller MLPs are between $50 million and $70 million EBITDA. So, scale-wise, it's just not quite large enough. Number two, we've just purchased Keystone. You have to have a predictability of the cash distributions. We're continually looking at that as we get into looking at this business. And, of course, the big thing, you've got to have really pretty clear visibility into the future growth potential. Kind of people talk about the save the bees issue. So in terms of the future, we're always open to all options that make sense to our shareholder interest. And we're looking at those variety of things. At this point, it doesn't make sense to do an MLP."
"Got it. One follow-up actually on the core Regulated business and really an M&A question. You all have been excellent over the years in terms of doing kind of small bolt-on acquisitions. What's your thought process around or what's the market dynamic and opportunity set around kind of more larger-scale M&A? I mean, there are not ton – it's obviously a far more fragmented business than the electric and gas, but just kind of curious when you look at the landscape of publicly-traded or kind of larger or private or municipal owned ones.","Well, I will start and then I want Walter to ﬁll in because he and his team have done a lot of work on this. In terms of looking at other IOUs, you're always looking at the marketplace, but the fact is it's a pretty well-valued space out there. But we're always looking at all options. Where I think our sweet spot is though, something that Walter and his team had put a priority on. So, Walter, do you want to talk about kind of the focus going forward on the Regulated piece?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Yeah. We still pursue the smaller acquisitions, but our focus is really on the 5,000 to 25,000 customer systems. And we see a number of opportunities. I've been in this business many years, two decades. And this is the best environment for acquisition that I've seen, I think, because municipalities are looking for options. And we, as the largest water and wastewater company in United States, have tremendous expertise that we can share with these municipalities. So, the opportunities are huge. There are also with some of the ﬁscal issues that they're facing. It's a tough environment for some of these municipalities.  I think the other thing is we work very closely with the legislators to provide enabling legislation that allows us to pay a fair market value and really reduce the bureaucracy in some of these acquisitions. So, that's our focus. We have great people out in our states that are focused primarily on growing the business from the state leadership teams to the growth teams. And, I think, we've been doing a very good job and more to come."
Got it. Thanks you all. I appreciate you taking my questions.,"Thanks.  Operator  The next question comes from Spencer Joyce with Hilliard, Lyons. Please go ahead."
Good morning. Nice quarter. Thanks for taking my question.,"Thank you, Spencer."
"Yeah. Just one real quick one here from me and I want to jump back to Keystone. Correct me if I misheard, but I believe the purchase may have been qualiﬁed as asset-light earlier in the call. And when we think about water service, I mean, trucks, pipes, tanks, asset-light is not what comes to my mind. And then to kind of follow-up, if it really were an asset-light business, why would you all have looked at an MLP structure? Can you speak to any of those points?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Absolutely, Spencer. Let me start and then I'll ask Susan if she has anything to add. In terms of the asset-light, you're right. The things that are owned by Keystone are really the pumps, the pipes, the valves, and temporary storage tanks. We also see vehicles as part of the asset as well. And so, the current model includes both permanent pipelines, as well as temporary pipelines that are owned by Keystone.  So, that's one element of it today. The assets are – their – the business is very asset-light. The audited ﬁnancials were about $36 million in assets at the end of December. So, that gives you a feel for the size of it. As Susan mentioned on the MLP structure – I mean this is one of the things that we look at, is what are the future growth potential and can you continuously have a transparent pipeline for growth in the business. And that's one of the key elements to look at from an MLP structure.     And, Spencer, to add to that, when we talk about asset-light, we do it in terms of our business overall, which we're so capital-intensive in utilities. In some spaces, that may not seem as capital-light. For us, it does. However, one of the things we are looking at is the potential. Remember that as part of – with Rex as a 60% owner, there were capital constraints. One of the things we are looking at strategically is the possibility or potential of actually deploying more capital to build longer term pipelines as opposed to having the E&Ps fund them. What if we now have the capital? Keystone has the capital to actually fund some of those constructions and entertain things like take-or-pay contracts or those type things.  So, the good news is you've got Keystone, which is an outstanding company. And I will tell you, just to add to this. I spent a day with those folks out there before we closed and after we announced the acquisition. And, culturally, they are – it's been such an easy transition. They are from Pennsylvania. They grew up there. The CEO actually has a background in water, environmental remediation compliance. It's just an outstanding group of people, but they've had a certain suite of services that now, with the purchase by American Water, we make and broaden some of those suite of services, which could include more capital."
"Okay. Perfect. That was helpful. Just to kind of recap here. So, when we think kind of asset-light in air quotes, we're maybe drawing a comparison versus the utility which would be perhaps more capital-intensive. And then, also from the standpoint of the business, maybe a little bit lighter on assets versus what it could be given some of the constraints that Rex had previously.","You know what, I could not have said it better myself."
"Great. Well, I was listening too.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thank you, Spencer."
All right. You all take care.,You too.  Operator  The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Good morning, everybody. I'll start out with an easy point of clarity question. The $4 million net income headwind from weather that you mentioned, does that include July's impact as well? I must have missed that.","That is the impact in July. And it's across all of our regions.     Yeah. Jonathan, one thing we try to do. Typically, we don't talk about the month outside the quarter. But because we were able to get the information we wanted to go ahead and share that. That was not from the second quarter."
"Okay. So, for the – I guess, the ﬁrst half of the year, what was the weather impact?","In the ﬁrst half of the year, we had an increase in demand – or in the second quarter, we had an increase in demand of about $2.7 million. Over half of that was associated with an increase in our commercial customers. And then the remainder of it was weather-related. And what we saw was, on the residential side, we had hotter or drier weather in the Northeast. And given our geographic diversity, that was oﬀset somewhat by the wet weather that was in the Central Region."
"Okay. So, pretty much if we go through July, I mean, you're kind of breakeven or so from a weather impact and everything. Nothing too major.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","So, we are negative all the way through July from a weather standpoint because we had that $4 million approximate net income impact in the month of July.     But, yes – but January through June, you could say it was breakeven."
Yeah. Okay. And then -,One could even oﬀset the other. Right.
"Yeah. Okay. Then the military bases that you mentioned you might get awards for this year – they might announce, are these just the ones that you're involved with or is that kind of encompassing the whole RFP space?","We're only tracking the ones we're involved with, Jonathan. And we only – the ones that we're involved with typically are medium to larger size. We don't get involved with the smaller ones, so there could be."
Okay. And then do you expect a pick-up in the pace of RFP awards going forward? Or maybe you can talk about how many are open right now that you're actively bidding on?,"There are numerous ones that are open. Pretty much – probably high single-digits that are open. They're in varying stages. We have best guesses. And they're pretty spread out over the next two years or three years. But you never know. It depends on what's going on in Washington, what they're going through. I will tell you that we have this year seen more interest from the Air Force. In the past, the Army has been the service that has been most interested. And we still are seeing some RFPs from the Army. But we're really seeing a lot of interest in the Air Force.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And, Jonathan, what we have disclosed previously is that we are active in several RFPs today, with a gross revenue value of $1.5 billion to the extent that we would be successful in all of them."
You said $1.5 billion gross revenue and that's for the 50 years?,Correct.
"Okay. And then, Walter, I didn't know if you could give any kind of update on the New Jersey and West Virginia rate cases. How they're kind of progressing and maybe how you would handicap the prospects for reaching settlements?","Let me start by saying they're both progressing on schedule. So, typically, New Jersey is nine months to 12 months to get a rate order; we ﬁled in early January. That's going according to plan. In West Virginia, there's an 11-month rate case process. And, again, it's moving according to schedule, so nothing to be concerned about for both of those."
"Okay. How about on West Virginia? I mean, it's been a bit of a challenge your past few cases there. You obviously had the challenges last year that weren't necessarily your fault, but you needed to respond to them. How is the outlook there? It was a pretty large ask, in part because you haven't gotten what you've needed in the past. But what's kind of been the response in West Virginia?","Well, our team is doing a great job working through the rate case process and talking about the value that we provide to our customers. And we're conﬁdent that we're going to continue to make that case. And we're hopeful to get a fair outcome."
Okay. And then what would be the timing on the outcome? 11 months would put us into – is it early 2016?,"Yeah. So, around April 1 of 2016.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
Okay. All right. Great. Thanks so much.  Operator  The next question comes from Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.,
Hi. Good morning.,"Hi, Brian."
"Just piggybacking on the last question. I know it's really early on here, but for the Missouri rate case, just thoughts on possibility of a settlement there. That'd be great.","So we have just ﬁled the rate case in Missouri on July 31. And so we are going to be working through the process as we normally do in this case.     Yeah. And, typically, in Missouri, it takes 11 months. And we're working through that process and it's right on schedule, even though we just ﬁled."
"Can you remind me, again, historically, have you guys gotten settlements in Missouri or not?","Yes, we have."
Great. And roughly at what point in the process does most of the legwork on that settlement and an agreement typically get reached?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It really depends rate case by rate case, company by company. It's really hard to predict. But you go through the process and it can happen as we work together."
Okay. And then one last question from me because most of my other questions were asked and answered. Any update on sort of the corporate headquarters move? I would love to get an update there.,"So, we're in the beginning stages of that. The latest information is that we have received approval of the tax credits in New Jersey, which, if we determine that we would move to the Camden location, we would be able to eﬀectuate those tax credits. We are currently in the process of looking for a location. And so we are working through that. And to the extent that we can ﬁnd a location in the Camden area, we are very excited about being part of the revitalization in that city."
And is there a sense of timing as to when you guys will make a decision on what you want to do there?,"The credits are for a three-year period where the clock started in June. And then we have the opportunity to have an extension of six months automatically and a request of an additional six months that would be met with approval requirement, so a three-year to four-year period."
Great. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Brian.  Operator  The next question comes from Barry Klein with Macquarie. Please go ahead."
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This might be a little bit in-depth. But in the pyramid that you always put on to the slides in the presentation, it looks like you added a new area entitled Other. And I was just wondering if you could please explain what is meant for that portion of the pyramid.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Okay. Well, Barry, that's a great question. We have actually included Other in the past couple of years. But we have not – you're correct. We have not talked about it a lot. We put that in there because one of the things – one of the advantages we have at American Water with our size and scale, we have our own R&D group and we have 20 scientists. And most of their work is dedicated to ﬁnding better ways to do our business, bring eﬃciencies, water quality. We work a lot with EPA. We work with foundations actually all over the world, including Israel, diﬀerent parts of Europe on new technologies in the water industry.  What happens when we do that? While the focus is making our business more eﬃcient, we also at times have opportunities with partnering up with start-up companies where part of our deployment and testing we're able to get small interest in some of these businesses. So, not a big thing but it's called our – and we have an innovation development process. We actually came up with a process called NPXpress that is used in wastewater plants that reduces energy of aeration by 50% and carbon additions by up to 100%. And we actually did an international license agreement with Abengoa on that, which last year maybe was $0.5 million, not a lot of money.  So, this other is almost this holding category for lots of smaller things like that that may or may not be something down the road. There's no – in the long-term triangle, we don't assign any weight to it in terms of how much of the growth it's going to provide, but we put it up there because there could be some things like that that come up. And, again, this is not big investments into things for the purpose of creating new business. It's investment into opportunities that help our base business be better, but potentially could result in some income."
Okay. Thanks. That was helpful.  Operator  The next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.,
Hey. Good morning.,"Hey, David."
Just on the Regulated acquisition strategy. I know there have been some companies saying they want to expand their water business and they're seeking to buy small water companies. Have   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   you seen competition pick up or noticeably pick up for your Regulated acquisitions?,"We operate in 16 states, so we have varying levels of competition in each of the states where we operate. But, by far, we're the biggest and we have the biggest footprint. It gives us an opportunity to expand out, get to know diﬀerent municipal leaders. And so, I think, we have a competitive advantage there.  I think the other huge competitive advantage we have is that we've worked on legislation that allows us to buy wastewater systems and share those costs with our water customers. And, for example, in New Jersey, we have 650,000 customers. So when we buy a system, we can spread the cost across that huge customer base and minimize the impact on those customers that we just acquired. So, we use that to our advantage. We use that to advantage of our customers and providing great customer service for them."
Got you. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.,"Well, thank you so much, Gary, and thanks for everybody for joining us today. We had a good quarter. And I just want to remind you that all of this happens because of the 6,700 employees that we have out there every day. We talk about the fact. We talk about the numbers. But these are our employees out there serving one customer at a time every day.  And I tell you we're very fortunate in our industry to have some of the best people anywhere, making sure that we're able to be up here today talking about the numbers that we're able to accomplish. So, I want to give a shout out to them and thank them for all of their hard work. And thank you for all of your questions and for supporting our company.  Operator  The conference is now concluded.
