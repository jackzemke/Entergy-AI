Question,Answer
"Great, good morning. Good morning, Susan. I had a question on the rate case in New Jersey. You've got $22 million in new rates there, which is about – I guess about a third of the $66 million you requested. Obviously, that's a very crude metric that I guess maybe gets too much   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   attention sometimes. But that does seem to continue a trend where the gap between asked and received rates has been kind of growing. Can you just talk about why that's happening and what the ramiﬁcations of that are for the business?","Good morning, Ryan.     Yes, Ryan, Walter here. Thanks for the question. Just to put a little clariﬁcation on it, the last time we ﬁled a rate case in New Jersey, we didn't have a DISC mechanism. So in this case, the DISC mechanism is included, but you have to look to the revenue that was generated from it. If you do that and include the $22 million we came in, in excess of 50% of our ﬁling. So that's the diﬀerence. We invested, as Susan said, a signiﬁcant amount of money in New Jersey and in our infrastructure, and when you include that, with the outcome of the rate case, again we're in excess of 50%. So it's right in line where we've been historically."
I see. So the national trend then would be a function of the fact that DSICs are becoming more and more prevalent.,Absolutely.
"Okay. Interesting. My other question was there were some fairly notable development yesterday with one of your peers in California basically saying that they're going to have to defer revenue recognition in the fourth quarter because their WRAM balances are increasing. I know you've had your own issues having to extend the collection period on your own WRAM balance. Can you talk about the situation in California related to the WRAM and the outlook and also maybe give us your take not only on how that impacts your business, but where you see the regulatory evolution going there, whether the drought creates any change in the regulatory situation in California?","Ryan, this is Linda. Let me start and talk ﬁrst about the accounting issues around revenue recognition. So the accounting rules require that if revenue is extended – collection of revenue is extended beyond two years that you need to defer the equity component or the equity return of that revenue. And so this is really an accounting timing issue versus a collection issue. We did experience something similar in the third quarter when we requested and ﬁled our application with the CPC to defer recovery in Monterey over a 20-year period and including a return. We have recorded that impact in our third quarter results and it was about a $5 million pre-tax impact.  Now in terms of the regulatory environment, I'll start and ask Susan if she would like to add to it, but really decoupling mechanisms were put into place in California to deal with situations like the severe drought that California is going through now so that you can align the customer   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   conservation with the goals of the company, and so these decoupling mechanisms really align those goals and allow us to help our customers conserve in the long term.     Right, and I think Linda's exactly right. The only thing I would add is this is an extraordinary situation in California, and we all know that and we believe – we know that the Utility Commission, the companies, we're all trying to work together to ﬁnd a way forward that's in the best interest of our customers and the companies and everyone involved."
"And then while we're on California, one last one if I might sneak it in, is that in terms of return on equity you're at 9.99% in California. Most of your peers are at 9.47%, that's because you stewarded the automatic downward adjustment due to your credit rating situation there, but the credit standing continues to improve. So is there any chance that you could be re-trued up or trued down, I guess, to that level and talk about how that mechanism works and the ROE outlook for California. Thanks.","Absolutely, we're at 9.99% in that mechanism in its current formal extent through the end of 2016, and then we would go through the next cost of capital process in California to reset rates going forward."
Got it. Okay. Thanks for your time.  Operator  And our next question comes from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead sir.,
"Good morning, everyone and nice quarter and thanks for taking my call here.","Hi, Richard."
"Just a quick, so just a quick follow-up question to Ryan's before I get into my question. The Pence or the New Jersey rate case outcome in combination with the DSIC, Walter you had mentioned it's in excess of 50%. We have that around 54.6%, does that sound about right?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yes, that sounds about right Rich. Pretty precise."
"Okay, perfect. Okay and then Susan, a quick question for you surrounding the acquisition strategy. Somewhat recently you were quoted as saying American is going to ramp up its focus on the wastewater acquisition front. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about how you see this beneﬁting American Water?","Sure. I'll start and then Walter may want to add something to it. So one of the things that's interesting, and I know the national numbers are about 84% of Waters provided by public entities and about 98% of wastewater is, and what we ﬁnd Rich is that of the 3.3 million metered customers we have that only about 150,000 of those are wastewater customers. So we know that we've got several communities around the country where we already serve water and someone else serves wastewater. So that's one piece. Then you add to that the fact that there is growing number of EPA consent decrees, you got an issue where a lot of the wastewater infrastructure is aging and needs investment and you have some communities who would prioritize other needed critical investments above their wastewater.  So far us the real value is in many of these places we already serve water. So to serve wastewater we know the communities. They know us. There are eﬃciencies we can gain because we already have oﬃces there even though you would have diﬀerent people doing some of the work. So we think it's just a natural progression. Then on top of that you add the fact that – and we just talked about California. When you look at water, it really is a single one- cycle for water. And in the past, where we separated potable water with stormwater and wastewater, those days are – they're starting to merge. So we believe that as the leading water utility in the country, we want to take a leadership role in looking at water as one water from start to ﬁnish, and especially given our strength and our research and development eﬀorts that we got on the whole water cycle.     Yes, Walter here. Just to emphasize the operational synergies. We already have oﬃces. We have relationships. We have employees that are proving service to our customers. To us it makes too much sense not to engage on the wastewater side and that's what we've been doing and we're getting really positive feedback in those communities where we do provide both services."
"Excellent. Okay. And next, thinking about the Water Infrastructure Protection Act recently implemented in New Jersey, clearly that's a great outcome for American and American's performed well from that Act, and now Chairman Powelson (27:04) in Pennsylvania is seeking to implement something similar. So if and when he does, when considering that both New Jersey and Pennsylvania in this situation will have attractive legislation, do you think that it may   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   eventually result in American Water Mid-Atlantic region representing more than 50% of its current, where it's at currently or do you think you would try to exploit that Pennsylvania move, but then grow in other state to maintain that diversiﬁed geographic footprint?","I'll start and Walter may want to add. So number one, we value very much our geographical diversity and while we do look to grow in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, we're also looking to grow in the Midwest for example where we have a signiﬁcant presence. So we do think this legislation and Walter and his folks have been key at providing research and information for those policymakers who were looking at diﬀerent options to improve the economy in their areas. We think that it's important to have good legislation everywhere and we think it's good for the citizens and the people who are consumers of water and wastewater.     Yes, and WIPA is deﬁnitely a huge plus to accelerate acquisitions in New Jersey. If we get that in Pennsylvania, it will provide the same beneﬁt, but we also have enabling legislation in many of our other states including many Midwestern states and some of this was tailored after the legislation we had in our Midwest states. So it looks very, very favorable in the Northeast, but we have the same favorable regulation in the Midwest."
"Okay. Great. Thank you for that color guys and last one for me, looking at the non-regulated side, in our view we see that Keystone acquisition is just a super move. That's a great move from our view. Is there anything else like that in the pipeline or, maybe better put, can you give us – just give us an update on the non-regulated acquisition – acquisitive activity strategy there?","Sure. So ﬁrst of all, fundamentally, there is two things I want to say is that when we go into the Market-Based Businesses, we ensure that it leverages the core competencies that we have as a company. We're not going to be going out two and three steps beyond what our core competencies are, which is water, wastewater, stormwater, those type of eﬀorts. I just want to make sure people understand that clearly.  The second thing is, as we said in our last earnings call, the Market-Based Businesses, which include all of the American Water enterprises lines of business and Keystone, we will not – we don't see that growing beyond 15% to 20% of earnings, and only toward the high end of that if it's regulated like in the military services. So I just want to say that upfront.  So in terms of opportunities, again, we're going to stick to our knitting, stay close to our core competencies. Where there are opportunities to, number one, leverage the expertise we have in water, wastewater, water treatment, infrastructure investment, those type of things, we will look at, but we also look at the risk proﬁle of anything we do because we are extremely cognizant and dedicated to, at our core, we are a regulated utility and we want to ensure that any growth we have is smart growth.

"Okay. Great. Thank you, Susan. I appreciate it, guys, and great quarter once again.",Thank you.  Operator  Next question comes from Michael Gaugler from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Mike."
"Just a couple of things. I would appreciate an update on the potential headquarter move and the timing implications in terms of the tax breaks, and then also your thoughts on Keystone Clearwater now that you've been in that business for a bit.","Mike, this is Linda. Let me start with the move to Camden. We are currently in the site selection process and we are continuing through that process. We are working to make sure that we have all of the tax issues handled appropriately with the City of Camden and we are very excited to be part of the revitalization of Camden.     On Keystone, so everyone, of course, on the call is aware that there are market conditions on oil and gas and, of course, from the negative side from the market is that the activity in the capital spending has been reduced somewhat. The number of rigs are down. And again, in the Marcellus and Utica, interestingly while we have the cheapest cost for natural gas drillers that also require more water, we know that there is an issue where the supply had seemed to take away capacity. So from the market issues that everyone is familiar with, we also are tracking this. We're tracking it with the business.  We also are very encouraged and we're following very closely the progression of the construction of the Takeaway Pipes, because we believe that whenever the Takeaway Pipelines   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   are completed, that that is where – and I know that all of you know this, where we will see a resurgence in that particular area of the country for natural gas.  Now with that said, since we have bought Keystone and since we closed in July, there are some positives that are going on for us. Number one, it's interesting that as several of the E&P are looking at the current situation, they're also looking at water infrastructure that will be needed for the resurgence that is expected at the end of 2016 and into 2017. So we are in conversations looking at future activity, because there is a time period that we need to develop water infrastructure, which is critical for most of these wells.  Another thing that we see is that there are some near-term opportunities. With the E&Ps continuing to prioritize their capital for their core business, there is more of an interest of us taking a role into water infrastructure and water pipeline, including owning it, which would be a little longer term than some of the contracts they currently have; looking at construction ownership of storage and exchange facilities, and not just pipeline. And we're seeing that there is a renewed interest as the E&Ps have a goal of 100% water reuse and recycling. So we do the transport. So we're seeing really a pretty robust business on the transport to the recycling facilities to ensure extremely high levels of reuse and recycling.  And then, another positive that we've seen in the almost six months we've owned Keystone is that they are increasing their customer base signiﬁcantly with the addition of several new large customers and we calculated that our market share of the water services in the Utica, Marcellus has increased from about 20% to 25%. So yes it's a diﬃcult environment as we know, but being a water-focused subsidiary of ours, looking at solutions for that area we're seeing some bright spots for us. And we continue to, we said earlier when we purchased Keystone, we expect it to be EPS neutral in 2015 and to be accretive next year as Linda mentioned."
All right. Thanks.  Operator  Follow-up question from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.,
"Hi guys, thanks for letting me back in. Just a quick question on – just a follow-up to Michael's inquiry surrounding Keystone. And this might be a tough question right, I am just curious to see what the take is. When you look at the frac sand guys or the oilﬁeld services players, it's up in the air when that energy space is going to recover. Some say it's going to be 2016, we might see a bottom in Q1 and then improvement the back of 2016. Some others say it won't even be until 2017, where there is improvement. But it sound like what you just said you expect it to be accretive in 2015.  So I'm kind of wondering, one, what maybe your outlook is there for, what may be Keystone's outlook is for that energy space and maybe what you guys are doing diﬀerently to ensure that that's going to be – that's accretive in 2016.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah, Rich, thank you for this and so on December the 15th at our Analyst Day, the CEO of Keystone, Ned Wehler who has been in the business for years, and he is actually going to be part of our Investor day presentation and he is going to oﬀer his insights that will give an additional map to see where everything is playing out. Again I think we can say some things now, but I think it would be better to wait till Investor Day and really talk to the expert. We're looking at a lot of diﬀerent options. We're trying to be very practical and realistic, which is why in answer to Mike's question, I wanted to give both the positives but also the things we're very cautionary about. And so it will be interesting. We do have some thoughts at this time, but on December 15th, we fully expect that question to be asked and for Ned to give his thoughts about that."
"Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you, Susan.  Operator  And our next question comes from Ryan Connors from Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.",
"Great. Thanks also for letting me in and again to ﬁgure out, come in with one more I have since there's time. So rising interest rate environment that we're likely to enter into here, as the Fed gets to raise rates, obviously the various commissions look at benchmark rates as a proxy for risk-free and there is interest in theory, that's a positive tailwind for ROEs. How does that impact what you do when you're asking – when you're ﬁling rate cases and what you're asking for an ROE? Do you start to reﬂect that into higher requests for ROE as the Fed is getting ready to raise rates or talk to us about that dynamic?","Yes Ryan, this is Linda and generally what we have seen with regard to past trends, is that as interest rate rise that over time that it's correlated with increases in the return on equity and so I would expect that moving forward to the extent that interest rates improve that we would see similar trends."
"Okay. But to you speciﬁc, is it typical to actually – when do you start building that into what you're asking for? Does that come later or is that something you started to do right here as we're sort of getting ready to enter into rising rate environment?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Right Ryan and really what we will do, typically most of our states have the cost of capital as part of the general rate case process. And so we would be looking across our states and determining the optimal time to go in for general rate case. We also have some states that have a separate cost of capital mechanism like California which has a set schedule, which we would be – which is set through 2016 and then we would be setting new rates for 2017. So it will depend on the jurisdiction and it will also depend on a multitude of factors that we look at in terms of the timing of our general rate case ﬁlings."
"Interesting, well thanks for that.","Absolutely.     Thanks Ryan.     Operator, do we have any more questions? Operator, are you there?     Maybe experiencing some technical diﬃculty.     Yeah, we can't hear anything. If you can hear us, we can't hear you.  Operator  Pardon me. The next person to ask a question is David Paz of Wolfe Research.     Okay. Great. Hi, David."
Good morning.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   David, that's quite a dramatic kind of intro to your question."
"Yeah, can't take credit for that one. But you may have actually addressed one of my questions on California, but just can you remind me when the cost of capital proceeding is like ended?",The cost of capital proceedings will be ﬁled in the beginning of 2016. So about March of 2016.
"Okay. And if you – it was extended once before, correct?",That's correct and it's extended through the end of 2016. We actually begin the ﬁling in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016 for cost of capital aﬀected in 2017.
"Right and just remind me, were there any changes to the mechanism when you extended it this last time versus the original I guess agreement?","No, it was extended in its current form."
"Okay. And is there any chance for you guys to extend that another year, given that not much has changed on the rate side?",We're always looking at opportunities so that – and working with the Commission on these types of things as well as the other investor owned utilities in California.
"Okay. Separately this year have you announced any new large regulated projects like water treatment plants or the like that, that were incremental to the plan you gave last year?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   This is Walter, no, no, it's has been in line with what we've said last year. We just continue to upgrade our plants as part of our normal capital investment but no new plants in line."
"Okay. And you'll give a 2016, 2020 capital plan in December.",That's correct.
Great. Thank you so much.,"Thanks David.  Operator  And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.     Thank you, Frank. We would like to thank everyone for participating in our call today. And as always if you have any questions, please call Greg or Durgesh and they'll be happy to help.  Before I let you go, I've mentioned it during the Q&A, I would like to remind you all that we're hosting our Investor Day at the Western Times Square in New York on December the 15 from 9 AM until noon. We will have a light breakfast beforehand and lunch available for afterwards. So if it's not the program that attracts you, hopefully the food will.  We will be discussing our plan for 2016 to 2020. We'll have added color around 2016. You'll hear updates and projections for our regulated business from Walter as he has already said, an update from Sharon Cameron on her plans for the American Water Enterprise's lines of business, homeowner services, military services and contract services. And as I mentioned before, you'll hear from the CEO of Keystone, Ned Wehler, who is going to oﬀer his insight into that business and the market, and of course Linda will provide updates on our ﬁnancial plans.  We hope all of you can attend. The session will be webcast and thanks again to everyone for listening and we'll see you in December.
