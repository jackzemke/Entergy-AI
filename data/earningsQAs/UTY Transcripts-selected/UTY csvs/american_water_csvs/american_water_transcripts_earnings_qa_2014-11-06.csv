Question,Answer
Great. Thanks. Hello. How are you?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hi, Ryan.     Good."
"Great. So a couple questions. First oﬀ, I wanted to just talk about this New Jersey CTA issue a little bit and you gave a really nice discussion of it, Walter. But could you kind of talk to us a little more about the ﬁnancial impact of that on the P&L and the timing of that in terms of how we quantify that and go about translating that into an actual earnings contribution?","Ryan, this is Linda. And this is a step in the right direction, we believe, for New Jersey. This decision will impact us when we ﬁle our next rate case in New Jersey. That is when it would become eﬀective for us. And, as you know, we ﬁled our last rate case in New Jersey in 2011. And that rate case was a black box settlement. So we cannot disclose the ﬁnancial impact of this. But when we look at the timing of our rate case and the ﬂexibility that we have in terms of timing around our infrastructure mechanisms in New Jersey, we take all of those things into consideration to help determine when we will ﬁle that next rate case and be able to implement this new change."
Okay. But really no estimate or guidance on kind of the magnitude of the impact?,"Because it was a black box settlement, last rate case, we really can't disclose that."
"Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then just the other question I had was just more kind of tactical, but – and I guess we'll get more detail on this on December 15, but just talking about the weather from a big picture perspective. So we had the cool temperatures in the Midwest, but, as you mentioned on the call, last year's third quarter was also negatively impacted by weather. So, as we look into 2015, is it safe to say we've got a very easy comparison, so to speak, as we sort of think about growth next year in demand?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So what we do from an earnings guidance perspective is we'll give you weather normalized earnings guidance for 2015, which, as we indicated earlier, will occur on December 15."
Okay.,"Ryan, as Linda mentioned, just as the electrics do also, we put a range for guidance, because while we look at budgets and everything weather normalized, we understand that there are going to be variabilities. We disclosed at Investor Day last year – a set of those variabilities. And, for us, just like the electrics, the largest potential variable is weather. In a typical year, we account for some of that variability in our range, unless there is extreme weather. And, for example, back in 2012, the positive uplift was between $0.13 and $0.16 for American Water. That's a little beyond what you would have as normal variability. So when we look at weather, you don't want to start having a lot of guidance ranges that are weather aﬀected and this type of thing. So we try to keep it as clean as we can."
"Okay. Great. And then one last one before I hop out, is just on your payout ratio. Can you talk to us about where you're running right now and how you feel about where you're at and whether you would up that payout ratio a bit going forward, depending on your equity capital needs and so forth? Thanks.",Our payout ratio is currently at 2.5% and the way that we look at – I'm sorry that's the – I'm sorry. Let me correct that. Our payout ratio is just over 50%. We have a target range for our payout ratio of 50% to 60%. And we plan to – our goal is to grow our dividend commensurate with our EPS growth.
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Ryan.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Gaugler from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hi, Mike."
"Good morning, everyone. I've actually got a follow-up on the CTA to Ryan's question. Just wondering given the changes and how you think holistically about where you're going to deploy future investment. Is that enough to put New Jersey at the top of your list?","When we look at the prioritization of our capital, ROE is one of the key items that we look at in the prioritization of capital in addition to what are the needs for the investment in the states. And – so, that is a factor that we will look at, as we move forward and ﬁle a rate case in New Jersey. So, all of those factors come into play when we look at the capital prioritization. This is something that is moving in the right direction. So, although, externally we have seen lower ROEs being authorized in New Jersey, we see that this will oﬀset those lower ROEs moving forward.     And, Mike, this is Walter. Given the DISC program that was approved a few years ago, as you know, we've invested a lot more in New Jersey than we have in prior years. So it is one of our top states and we'll continue to do so, because of the DISC mechanism and the needed investment that we have to make in New Jersey.     And, Mike, as you know, and you've heard us say over and over, in our capital program, we will invest what we need in every state to meet our customer needs. We will make sure that our water is safe and clean and reliable. So you also know that that we do have some discretion. After we have committed those funds, we have discretion with other funds. And, as Linda and Walter both said, we look at a variety of factors, including ROE, and, as Walter said too, where you have mechanisms, you can get the return in a more productive and reduced regulatory lag. So, all of those factors come into play. So we look at our capital very carefully. We make sure that every single state has what they need to deliver services to customers than that which is discretionary. We look at these other factors."
"All right. Then I have just one other question, probably for Walter, just kind of wondering how you're feeling about water supply in California. It seems like some of your peers are getting just a tad bit nervous looking out into 2015.","Well, right now, Michael, we're still okay with water supply. But, again, we've asked for voluntary conservation of all of our districts. We put mandatory conservation in, in one of the districts.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We're obviously participating as a partner in the state to reduce water usage and we'll continue to monitor it."
Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.,"Thanks, Mike.  Operator  Our next question is from Richard Verdi from Ladenburg. Please go ahead.     Hi, Rich."
"Hi. Good morning, everybody. Great quarter and thanks for taking my call. I just have one quick question which pertains to the eﬃciency ratio. At the Analyst Day last year, the company had highlighted the goal of achieving a 35% eﬃciency ratio by 2018. And, obviously, that's been the objective since it's shown on slide 15 today. Let's hypothetically fast forward to 2018 and say the target has been reached. Would a new target be set? And if so, what would it be? How long could it maybe take to achieve? And what would the driving force behind the reduction be? Because I would think there is probably going to be more room to go.","So let me start with just an overview of the progress that we've made. So we've made signiﬁcant progress on the metrics. And we continue to make progress. Yeah. As we move through times, the progress will tighten a little bit. As we work through and we ﬁle additional rate cases, our revenue will be trued-up as we return these savings that we have recognized back to our customers. And so the improvement will begin to tighten as we get closer to the 35% target for 2018.  And we will continue to look at are there other ways that we can continue to improve the metrics. Are there technologies that we can deploy or other operational eﬃciencies that we can drive in the business? Because, really, this is about how do we operate the business from an overall perspective. We know we have more infrastructure investment to make. And to continue to make that aﬀordable for our customers, we need to make sure that we're managing every dollar on the operating eﬃciency side."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. Great. I'm thinking. Is there any chance that smart metering could be used? Any chatter about potentially creating some sort of smart grid, like the electricity side did, for the water side?","Rich, I'm so glad you asked that question. So the answer is yes. And I will tell you that, we actually have some information on our website. And we'll be happy to send it to you. We're actually pioneering a lot of work on the smart meter grid. We have our own R&D group. And we have an innovation development process. So what we're looking at on the smart grid, we're 85% AMR and AMI right now on the American Water system.  We also are doing a lot of research on water sensors near meters that can monitor ﬂow and pressures. And we're working with an Israeli company to look at how to look at dynamic ﬂow monitoring, so that we can reduce pressure at night at times of low demand, which will also reduce leaks. So, we're actually looking at the whole system from the customer meters to the pipes, smart sensors on the pipes looking at ﬂows in valves and ﬁnding ways that we can do more predictability, more predicted maintenance that reduces costs, as well as provide more information to our customers.  The water industry, as you know, is behind the electricity industry on this, mainly because of costs. Water bills aren't as expensive as electricity. And you also have a very fragmented industry. So, you don't have a lot of entities like American Water, with the size, scope and scale to actually embark a partner on a lot of these research opportunities. We're very excited about it. And I would tell you that the eﬃciencies we're looking for going forward are much more heavily weighted, as you mentioned, to technology and automation and better ways to do the business."
"That's super. Thank you, Susan, and great quarter all the way around. Thank you, again.","Thanks, Rich.  Operator  And the next question is from Jonathan Reeder at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.     Hey, Jonathan."
"Good morning, all. I hope everyone is well. Congrats on a big win last weekend, Susan.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah. But in the SEC, it's one game at a time, Jonathan."
"So, it's a tough road ahead still. So, just have a couple questions here if you don't mind. The $0.03 discontinued loss on the sale of Terratec, how much of that was due to the sales price versus operations? Or perhaps maybe a better way of asking it, how much of the loss from Terratec operations was assumed in your previous guidance range?","So there's a couple of questions there. Let me – for the second quarter, what we have included the loss on sale is $3.8 million and the remainder of that is associated with the loss from operations, both the second quarter as well as the year-to-date. Included in that loss is a book write-oﬀ of taxes of $1.5 million, which, as I mentioned earlier, we were able, through the structure of this transaction, to monetize about $4 million in tax beneﬁts that we otherwise wouldn't be able to monetize. In terms of the guidance in going forward, in our earnings guidance for 2014, we had a very small loss included in our guidance for Terratec. So, it doesn't have a real material impact either this year or going forward.     When you look at AWE, Jonathan, it's about 10% of our revenues and even less of operating income. Terratec is even a really small part of AWE."
"Okay. Okay. So I mean just the way to view it is, have we had normal weather, your revised range would have been, I guess, what, the $2.43 to $2.49?","No. In our earnings guidance, for 2014, we had a very small loss from the operations of Terratec included in that guidance. We did not project the loss on the sale in that guidance. And so it really rounded out in the beginning of the year when we set forth our guidance."
"Right, right. I'm just saying have you had normal weather in Q3, the revised guidance range, essentially we could just bump it up $0.05 if we wanted to compared to apples-to-apples to your original range?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   No, Jonathan. Because, remember, we build in some variability to our range. So, we – and this is interesting. From weather normal, it's always an art, not a science, right? So, what happens is when we do our range, part of having a range for us is including some weather variability.  So – and we showed last year, at the Investor Day, that weather could be plus or minus $0.07. So, we build in variability to the weather. So the range that we're guiding to now is what we would have, again, non-weather normalized just assuming that you have some variability built in. And most companies do that."
"Okay. I got you there. And then going back to New Jersey, could you remind us what the revenue increased cap is on their infrastructure mechanism? And I guess how much have you increased rates under that mechanism thus far?",Yeah. The revenue cap is 7.5%. And we continue to invest within that cap. And we'll be able to do so. So -
How close are you to the 7.5% at this juncture?,"We're making progress -     We still have some room on that, Jonathan.     Making progress to the 7.5%.     And, remember, Jonathan, we had two infrastructure increases this year, 10.1% in January and then the recent one of 7.4%."
"Okay. And then, you've done a good job lately on the M&A front. Congrats on that. I know you gave us the customer count. Is there any way you can describe it in terms of either the purchase price or kind of the rate base that those deals represent?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah. And back – so the customers, as Susan said, and we talked about, we're going to be adding 19,000 customers. The rate base varies obviously and tied back to our acquisition price there, but anywhere from $20 million to $25 million per -     And also to clarify, because some people report it diﬀerently. When we say 19,000 customers, that's actually customer connections.     Right.     Those are meters, not the number of people. So – and also, interestingly, of those 19,000, 13,500 are wastewater, very consistent with our target of going after wastewater. In Arnold, Missouri, we already serve water to those residents.     And back to Haddonﬁeld, what I meant by that was $28 million was our purchase price for Haddonﬁeld for those 9,000 customers, 4,500 water, 4,500 wastewater?     And remember, these were approved -"
Could you – purchase price for the sale -,"These were approved through the referendum, but we have not yet closed on those transactions.     That's right. We've got to get Board of Public Utilities approval on that. And, again, as I said, that'll take about six months to eight months to typically – that's typical and we're looking at mid 2015 before we get that approval."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Right. Do you have the Arnold and Russiaville purchase price in here? Were those disclosed?,We don't but we can get – whatever is disclosed we will get to you.
"Okay. And then last question and I'll hop oﬀ. Any idea when that government might act on another military privatization? I mean you've got the last two, including one recently. Do you expect more in the near future to be announced?","Well, predicting the Department of Defense with the federal government is an art that we have not perfected yet. We do have outstanding RFPs that actually go back all the way to 2010. And understanding who is going to award win is something that we continually monitor. And it depends on the service and it depends on the base, quite honestly. A lot of times it depends on the situation they've got with infrastructure. We do have outstanding RFPs. We are hearing that the Air Force may also have addition wins that they bid out. So, again, it's hard to predict. But let me go back to something else.  There's three ways that we make money in military. Awarding new awards is something that because it's so diﬃcult to predict that we work hard on the other two, which is our O&M contracts. But also, once we have a base, they engage us to look at what the infrastructure needs are on that base. And each year within their budget, we bring them potential projects and they choose from those projects, which also increases the amount of work we do on bases. So, we don't just wait for a big award and say great, it was success. For us, success are all three components."
Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the time this morning.,"Thanks, Jonathan.     And, Jonathan, one thing – one correction. On the desk (50:07) in New Jersey, the cap is 5% of revenues, not 7.5%. I want to correct that for the record here."
Okay. Thanks.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  The next question is from Spencer Joyce of Hilliard Lyons. Please go ahead.,"Hi, Spencer."
"Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my call. Just wanted to touch very brieﬂy on the ballot initiatives that were approved. I think from my standpoint, it was very positive to see a New Jersey, Missouri and Indiana, kind of, across the footprint approvals there. And my question is did you all go three for three on these initiatives or were there a handful that maybe weren't approved?","No. I'd like to – we're batting 1.000, three for three. Really I think the recipe for success here was to make sure that our employees and the community leaders were hand-in-hand talking about the value that American Water can provide to the communities. That's really what, I think, was driver of success on all three of these.     And, Spencer, what was even more exciting, we didn't just win the ballot initiatives. We were two to one or greater on all of them. In favor of."
Okay.,And that's what we were very proud of.
"Yeah. And I thought you all may have insinuated this a little bit, but these weren't areas where perhaps the American Water brand was already somewhat of a household name. Is that correct?","Well, I'll tell you in Haddonﬁeld, New Jersey, we surround the system. So we have a big presence in this area. So the brand is out there. And that's right. And also, in Arnold, we bought   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   the wastewater system, but we have the water customers. So our brand has been out there. And I think that's helped us."
Okay.,"But the key to this has been our passionate employees, going door-to-door and talking about, again, the value that American Water can bring to the communities."
Okay. Great. Thanks. That's all I had. Nice quarter.,"Thanks, Spencer.  Operator  And our next question comes from Shivangi Tipnis from Guggenheim (sic) [Global Hunter Securities] (52:18). Please go ahead."
"Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm a little under the weather, I hope I'm audible enough on the call. I just wanted to ask you about your CapEx for Q4. Your earlier guidance in Q2 said it was about $1.1 billion. And year-to-date, it's about $700 million. And you expect it to be now $1 billion for the full year. So I was wondering if the Q3 CapEx was less than what you earlier anticipated or are you expecting a little lower CapEx, about $100 million lower, in Q4?","Yeah. This is Linda. Let me answer that. The CapEx for the third quarter was what we expected. That was related to the regulated investments. What we are seeing this year is lower than planned investment on the acquisition side. And so that has enabled us to deploy more capital in certain areas on the regulated side. And that's really a timing issue associated when we deploy the capital. So, yes, we're still on plan for $1 billion. And, as a result of the timing issues associated with the acquisition, we have been able to deploy more capital on the regulated side.     And that's why, Shivangi, we started looking at a ﬁve-year capital plan. Prior to 2014, we reported capital year-to-year. We know that by separately disclosing last year's strategic and   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   regulated acquisition capital apart from regulated investment capital that there would be some years that because of delays in being able to close on a deal, for example, if you have to have a referendum, et cetera. So what we saw is, just as Linda said, that you're going to have some timing issues. So that's why we disclosed now our ﬁve-year capital plans."
Okay. Sounds good.,And – I'm sorry.
Go ahead.,"No, no. Go ahead. After you're concluded."
"Okay. My next question is actually on the gallon usage on your slide 23 based on the customer class. The weather impacts are primarily related, I guess, to your residential usage of water, especially on the outdoor activities. However, your commercial and public gallon usage appears to have declined about 4% and 3%. How do you understand these declines and can you just provide some color on that?","Absolutely. There's actually quite a bit of noise that's included in these numbers, because we implemented our customer information system last year in two ways. And so the third quarter of 2013 includes a time period in the ﬁrst wave of the implementation to where we were looking at our bills in more detail to make sure that they were appropriate before we sent them out. And so, in the industrial class mainly, we have lower billed water sales volume, because we were holding those bills. And so, there is some timing issues there as well. If we were to kind of normalize that, we would expect our industrial usage to be more in line with what we have seen historically.     Yeah. And one more point on the Arnold acquisition. The total purchase price is $13 million and that's got to be trued-up as we work through the approval process. We're buying the collection system, not the treatment plant. And that's why it's a little bit on the low end as far as total purchase price for that number of customers. I'd just wanted to provide that clariﬁcation to everyone.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Susan Story for any closing remarks.     Thank you so much. I appreciate all of you on the call. I know that we typically are at the tail end of a very long quarterly earnings call season and that you all are very tired. And we appreciate the time and eﬀort. I just want to close with just a couple of sentences.  And I just had to tell you. Walter mentioned it and so did Linda. We had a really good ﬁnancial quarter. We are poised for long-term growth and a healthy company. And it's because of the employees we've got. I cannot tell you enough going around looking at the expertise, but, as Walter said, the passion that our employees have for our customers and for growth and ﬁnding ways not just to grow the numbers for ﬁnancials, but to bring new customers in on our system, so that they can enjoy the beneﬁts that our current customers do.  So it's a great time to be in the water business. We look forward to a great year. And we hope that everything goes well for you all. And if Jonathan Reeder is still on the call, I just want to tell you War Eagle. See you all next quarter.  Operator  The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
