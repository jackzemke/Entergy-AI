Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, Walter and Susan.",Good morning.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Morning Durgesh.
"Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Just I have a couple here. First Walter, just to clarify the New York American sale process I know a lot of moving pieces, but are we still targeting at this year close, is that the current plan?  Operator  Yes, that's right, Durgesh. We're still working through what with as I said in prepared remarks, still working through with staﬀ and others and we are hoping to be -- and expecting this year.",
"Understood, thank you. And then just on the subpoena, can I just clarify that this is related to speciﬁcally homeowner services within American Water Resources business? And the information that you might be sharing is that just New York speciﬁc or their other states involved in the subpoena.  Operator  Yes, it's speciﬁc to our New York City Metropolitan operations in HOS. That's exactly right, Durgesh.",
"Got it. And obviously there's no set timeline here as to how this matter gets resolved.  Operator  No, not at this point, again we continue to work in cooperating investigation.",
"Okay, understood. Just one big picture then Walter just your thoughts on the Biden sort of the America jobs plan. They talked about several hundred billion of investment on lead and then Water and Wastewater assets. What are the implications to your existing business, and then just your regulated acquisition growth strategy?  Operator  Yeah, Durgesh. We're going to start with -- we're really happy that the administration is focusing on Water and Wastewater this part of the infrastructure plan. So we like the attention that the industry's getting and we think that the plan will beneﬁt our customers primarily by having access to low-interest ﬁnancing, that's part of the plan. And so we want to -- we access our right now on the water side. We want to get access in the wastewater side, that's a growing segment   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   of our business. And we want our customers to beneﬁt like others from the low interest loans. So, overall we're very excited about the program and we want to participate like the municipalities doing the wastewater side.",
"Perfect. And just does it -- how does -- I mean does it increase your sort of footprint on the regulated acquisition side or does it sort of since there'd be a lot of aid given to sort of systems across the country? Does it derail your regulated acquisition growth strategy? How would you sort of characterize that?  Operator  Well, there's as we've said and I've said in my remarks, there's signiﬁcant needs out there in the water and wastewater side. For us, it's not going to change our plan, our pipeline continues to grow, we're going to continue to provide meaningful solutions for communities. And we're committed to our plan and we don't see any change to our plan going forward.",
Understood perfect. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time.  Operator  Thanks Durgesh.,"Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity. Maybe to kick things oﬀ right after Durgesh's question here. Can I follow up and ask you guys about your latest thinking on the administration just around the PFAS regulations, hazardous determinations there, and just obviously there's a lot of diﬀerent pieces that could move here? And any at least preliminary thoughts on where things could go and more speciﬁcally, how that could impact your business?  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah, Julien. Thanks for the question. We think there's going to be a lot more focus on PFAS in this Administration. I know they formed a task force, we believe it was last week to look at what are the next steps to establish an MCL. Right now, there's a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion, and we think there is going to be a lot more focus on it. So we'll have to wait and see but the EPA is really science driven and we want to make sure it's based on science. And I think there's going to be a coming together of the science and the need to establish an MCL and we look forward to participating and working with the administration to establish that.",
"Got it. And hazardous determination, that's just part of the broader context here, right?  Operator  That's right. That's all part of this. This work is going to be going on.",
"Got it. All right. Excellent. And then I suppose a little bit more nuanced here. As you think about the impacts here in the quarter on the non of -- the market based business here, you're probably still broadly within plan on the year and have some oﬀset. Just can you speak to that obviously, the payouts and the warranties et cetera still elevated here. Just if you can speak to that a little bit on the oﬀsets et cetera and how you're tracking. Maybe after the (Multiple Speakers).  Operator  Yes. With the HOS business, we're seeing higher claims on the wastewater side. Now, people are spending more time in their homes and that's causing apparently additional breaks that we're having to repair. And then on the partnership side, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those partnerships yet we still have a really good pipeline of opportunities, but those are the two areas. I think that have been somewhat impacted by the pandemic and our business going forward.","Julien. I might just add on that point in addition to what Walter said, we did see a little bit higher claims in the quarter from these weather-related events. We did see some water claims particularly in Texas, Illinois and a few other parts of the country really driven by the extreme weather that occurred and we would expect of course that to now sort of be over. Some of the wastewater claims that Walter is talking about, as long as we continue this bit more of stay at home, we may see elevated claims there, but I think the exposure to the weather related we've isolated in this quarter."
"Got it. So how do you think about that relative to the full-year? I mean obviously the wastewater continues a little bit elevated just oﬀsets, et cetra, probably not too material, right?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","It's really not too material. No, I mean, we saw roughly a penny or so of that impact related to the stay-at-home activities in this quarter and as you can see across the country, states are starting to loosen up. So there'll be some return. So I certainly think we'll see this start to mitigate and in any event we don't see it as material for the year."
Excellent guys. Thank you all very much. Have a nice day.  Operator  Thanks Julien.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. And the next question is from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. Just couple for me. The ﬁrst one with the -- the recently announced Pennsylvania and New Jersey transactions, how do you think about potential cadence and magnitude of the equity guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day. Just thinking through 21, 22, if it's going to be split up or are we still assuming kind of a bulk number in one year?  Operator  Well ﬁrst, let me talk about the growth. And we're really excited for these two acquisitions in our two biggest states. It's all part of what we're doing and providing solutions for communities with the City of York in the Wastewater side, and then Egg Harbor City. In the ﬁrst WIPA, that's really important to ﬁrst WIPA acquisition. And we're hopeful many other communities are going to see the beneﬁts of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about providing meaningful solutions. And again, as we talked about having consolidated tariﬀs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impacts. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure that these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment. I wanted to spotlight the follow-on investment, and how signiﬁcant that is to our growth and to providing solutions for community. So we're really excited about these two acquisitions and how they're going to play in the future growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Insoo maybe let me just comment on the equity needs because that was a follow-on part of your question I think. When we built our plan and laid out our ﬁnancing plan over the ﬁve years, we anticipated an increase in our growth from acquisition and we reﬂected that at Analyst Day. Now whether or not we identify these speciﬁc transactions, it's a diﬀerent question but we had anticipated a step up and growth and built our plan accordingly. So long answer to your question, I don't see any change from these speciﬁc acquisitions that we've now highlighted any change to our equity ﬁnancing timing or any of other our ﬁnancing plans over the course of the ﬁve years."
"Got it. Just from a timing perspective, is there a possibility that we could see some of that equity in the '21 timeframe or is it more beyond '21?","No, it's beyond 21. At Analyst Day, I think we indicated that it still -- it is about 700 million of equity in the ﬁve years and it's still roughly in sort of the middle of that ﬁve-year timeframe. So no, I would not anticipate anything in 2021."
"Got it. And then my second question, I guess maybe for Walter. Obviously these two acquisitions in States that have favorable systems in place for such growth with the pending New York sale and then the recently announced Michigan, divesture charge while when you just look across your footprint in the diﬀerent states, you don't have to name any, but are there opportunities to potentially monetize some of the other states to concentrate more on the jurisdictions that oﬀer the better systems for organic and inorganic growth.  Operator  Yes, we do a constant assessment of where we're operating, then where can we provide the best value for customers and where can we grow our systems and we'll continue to evaluate our footprint. But we're really happy where we are right now and we continue to grow. If you look at our pipeline, we're growing; we have eight states where we have 32 agreements. So it's not just in one or two or three states, it's really across our footprint, and we will continue to provide Solutions again for communities across our footprint.",
"Understood. Thank you, both.  Operator  Thank you. Next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.",
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Hey, good morning.",Hey Steve.
"So just a question on the -- Hey Walter -- on the disclosure of this subpoena, in homeowner services? I guess it doesn't say, I think in your release just if the company has done its own investigation and if they determined anything was done wrong, do you have any color or information on that?  Operator  Yeah, Steven and given that, it's an ongoing investigation, we really can't comment any more on it other than what we have in the disclosure.",
"Okay, all right and then Walter on your year-end call, you had kind of hinted at a larger acquisition or more growth coming and in your tuck in acquisitions and the like. I -- should I assume that was the York deal that ended up oﬃcially getting announced or is that still kind of relevant for something else?  Operator  Let me approach it from this. We continue to build our pipeline. We continue to again provide solutions for communities and if you look over the last year, we've almost doubled our pipeline. We've done the biggest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. So we're going to keep doing much of the same, Steve.",
"Okay, great. And just on the New York American sale. It's if I understood you correctly, it sounds like neither your forecast, nor your equity timing should be impacted at all by whatever happens with the outcome of the sale.  Operator  Yes. That's correct, Steve.",
"Great. That was very clear.  Operator   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay, Steve. Thank you.  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Next question comes from Richard Sunderland, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.",
"Hi. Good morning. Maybe following up on that last point real quick the sale timing, would it impact I guess where you land within the range of your '21 guidance or phrase diﬀerently, you have some timing assumption associated with close presumably baked in. Can you disclose what that assumption is and what a quarter two diﬀerence may do to where you landed the range?","Hey, Rich its Susan. Probably not going to add much more detail to that, I would just echo what Walter said in his prepared remarks and then his answer a minute ago we just don't see having any impact on 2021."
"Fair enough. Thank you. And then just separately curious at a high level in terms of your O&M eﬃciency ratio, what impacts you've seen on your eﬀorts there over the past year under the pandemic and what that may mean for sort of progress and eﬃciencies going forward as we reopen.  Operator  Yeah, it's been a big focus for us as you know Rich, and we're going to continue to focus on every area of our business where we can drive eﬃciencies. We've improved it from 34.5 to 34.1 as I said in my remarks. And we're conﬁdent that we can hit our goal in 2025 of 30.4. So we're going to continue to do the things that we've been doing, focusing on technology, leveraging our supply chain and really leveraging our culture of looking for every dollar that we can save and continue to provide the service that our customers expect. So that's the journey we're on. We're going to continue to execute on that and we're conﬁdent in our goal in 2025.",
Great. Thanks for taking my question.  Operator  Thank you.,Thanks Rich.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  Thank you. The next question comes from Verity Mitchell of HSBC. Please go ahead.
"Hi, good morning everyone. And I've just got another couple of high-level questions about geography, which is something I'm always interested in. And when I look at your coverage across so many states. Does the Biden Proposal change the view of your opportunities across states? I mean you've already said that it's not going to change your growth trajectory. But any nuance there. And also in terms of what's missing it in terms of major regulatory mechanisms in states now that you would like to see? Thank you.  Operator  Yes. Hello Verity, Walter here. Yes, the administration's proposed plan does not change our outlook at all. On acquisitions again we continue to build our pipeline of opportunities. We're providing meaningful solutions. And really, when you look at the size of our business, how long we've been in business since 1886 and the expertise that we have and the ability to share costs across our customer base, we bring tremendous value to communities and they realize that and that's why they're talking to us about potentially selling their water and wastewater systems.",
"Yes, so I just want to know whether the state -- the states in which you are active, the Biden Proposal create new opportunities in particular states.  Operator  I'm not sure it will create new opportunities, it just -- the great thing is that it really talks about water and wastewater where before we were always left out. And I think there's a realization in this country that there's so much fragmentation and so many improvements that need to be made that the private sector American water can play a really integral role in moving that forward and that's where we're excited about.",
"Right. And so what's missing in this -- what would you like to see that's missing in terms of fair value, or if structure -- surcharge is? What's missing and --  Operator  Yes. We continue to work with States. Yes, and we continue to work with States on fair market value legislation. As I said, Kentucky is now the 11th State within our footprint to have fair market value legislation. It's really an aﬃrmation of the value that we provide in the -- I think the recognition of the legislature and the governors that they want us to play a role in consolidating the market and adding our expertise to many of these small systems that don't quite have the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   expertise. So we do have in the appendix an overview of fair market value by State, and the speciﬁc parts of it that -- the fair market value. So refer to that, you can you can see again 11 out of our of our 16 states have fair market value legislation and we're going to continue to work with states that don't have it and continue to work to tell our story about the value we can provide.",
"Great. Thanks.  Operator  Yes. Thank you, Verity.  This concludes our question-and-answer session. I now would like to turn the conference back over to Mr.Walter Lynch for closing remarks.
