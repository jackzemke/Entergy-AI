Question,Answer
"First, congratulations on your continuous O&M improvement program eﬀectiveness. It's very impressive.  So I guess, Ellen, my ﬁrst question is for you with the equity. Can you help put some more color or some duration around your ability to stay out of issuing block equity, as it does appear that your internally generated cash, plus maintaining your measured dividend payout ratio and use of NOL and DRIP, that you can stay out for a long time? Is that an accurate description of the possible time frame?","The way I would look at it is a couple of things. Our NOL carried forward has probably another 10 years, give or take, so you look at it in terms of the ability to get the beneﬁt of ﬁrm -- the NOLs, that's another 10 years. Our DRIP is only providing a small amount. We'd love to see it increase and encourage all to utilize it, but it's just a little bit happening with the equity. But really, to look at it over the long term is to look at -- as long as we have and continue to grow net income the way we're growing, and to continue with cash the way we're going, we really don't see a need to do an equity oﬀering."
"Okay. And then now with New Jersey having the DSIC program, what percentage of your CapEx program do you think ﬁts under earning real-time returns?","About 25% of our CapEx is being recovered through DSIC-like mechanisms, and that's going to increase. But, remember that for New Jersey, we won't see that take eﬀect until -- what, Walter? - - what, Third Quarter?     Third quarter.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So it will start, and that $140 million will -- that investment will start after we get approval of the program -- of the foundational ﬁling."
"Great, thank you, guys. Have a good day.  Operator  Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.",
"Jeﬀ and Ellen -- so your 7% to 10% EPS growth that you aﬃrmed this morning in guidance -- is that oﬀ the weather-normalized 2012 base? So if I was to strip out the pumpage, that's $206 million to $209 million?","Yes, Neil -- the way to think about it is the 7% to 10% is not a year-over-year number. It is a long- term projected growth rate, and it assumes the things that we don't control, like weather, are normal. So it does -- you should think of it in terms of normalizing that amount out."
"Got it. And even if we were to strip out the pumpage beneﬁt, you still would have raised guidance here, so what speciﬁcally contributed to the balance of the guidance raise relative to the base case plans?","Well, you're right. We were in the 7% to 11% in the original guidance and the midpoint -- so a midpoint of say, 9%. And we're now in the 14% range, at the midpoint of the new guidance, if you take out weather. Fundamentally, is what I talked about, Neil, in terms of execution -- it's execution of the strategy, both in terms of building a culture based on continuous process improvement and operational excellence. It's having multiple avenues for growth, and one of the things that -- if you just think about water utilities in general, well, you think, okay, it's a function of the regulatory rate relief and maybe a little bit of weather.  For us, if we do four tuck-ins like we did this past quarter, that's an element of growth. When you sign a deal to be able to extend line protection to 600,000 customers, that's like adding a New Jersey to that business. A multiple of diﬀerent avenues of growth, so it's really all of those combined."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Great. My last question is around weather normalization and the rate case process. How many of your jurisdictions weather-normalized? So if you were to ﬁle in 2013, as you're going to do in multiple jurisdictions with the '12 test year, will the commissions strip out the beneﬁt of this hot and dry weather?","Generally, when we ﬁle for rate cases, Neil, we use what I'll call the oﬀ months, the more normal months -- November through, let's say, March -- to show the trend in usage. And generally what we've also found, because some years -- if you'll remember about three years ago, we saw the exact opposite impact, where usage was way down because of weather. And this year, we see it's up because of weather. So I think both the regulatory side and our side tries to take the impact out."
"Perfect. Thank you, so much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Roomberg with Ladenburg Thalmann & Company. Please go ahead.",
"A question on the economics of the New York City contract -- maybe if you can provide an estimation of what the premiums are per year, per customer? And then also maybe talk more broadly about the other jurisdictions where you have this ability to put this on the bill itself, what your penetration rates are in those territories?","Yes. Great question, Michael, but I'm not going to answer We just won't go into that much detail, as you can probably understand. That's a competitive market. So that kind of detail is quite protected. I would just say that, where you have access to customer lists and you have the ability to utilize the local utility's bill, you get substantively higher penetration rates than in those areas where you don't.  We already today operate outside of our footprint -- our regulated footprint -- in providing this competitive service. We have it both with a couple of communities through the same relationship with New York City, as well as just in other communities where we've done direct mail. It's a full competitive business. New York is unique in that it's the largest one of this kind that's ever been issued. And we're very pleased with that, but this is -- it's not a spigot that you turn on. It takes a while to build. And since it hasn't been oﬀered in the past, it will be a new product for a lot of the folks in New York, but we're very excited about the opportunity.      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   If I can also add one thing from a customer perspective -- being able to add the cost onto their water bill, we ﬁnd the customers are much more satisﬁed with that than having to get a separate bill, separate and distinct. So we get higher customer satisfaction.     That's right."
Got it. And then just one follow-up for Ellen -- the reduction in uncollectible account expense of about $2 million in the quarter -- is that going to recur over the next 12 months? I think that was the ﬁrst time that it had shown up in a quarterly result.,"We are seeing a reduction in our uncollectibles. We will see what happens in the Third Quarter, since there are some very large bills that will be going out -- larger bills. I wouldn't say large versus other utilities, but larger bills. But we are seeing better on the collections, and I give credit to many of those in Operations and our customers' response."
Got it. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Sweeney with Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead.,
"Looking at the O&M side, volumes were up about 6.6%. And then actually on the, I think on the regulated side, the expenses were down 1.4%. These are obviously great results, but is there any more detail you can give into how this accelerated so quickly? It seems like a very large improvement in a short period of time. Understanding there is a weather component, but that's -- volumes go up, there's some costs associate with that, and on a year-on-year basis, the actual ﬁgures stayed, in real terms, stayed almost stagnant.","Maybe just a couple of things, and I'll let Walter and Ellen to add in anything they want.  I wouldn't say that this is some cliﬀ thing that's happened. Obviously you don't see the month- to-month-to-month, just the quarterlies; but this is the building of a trend. And there's no single component. It's exercising of our supply chain more aggressively and eﬀectively. It's some labor, a couple of reductions that we've had. In fact, you'll recall that we expensed some   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   charges in the First Quarter for severance for some downsizing, fairly small downsizing that we did.  If you look at the breakout of our costs, our production costs actually went up, which you would expect. But they didn't go up nearly as much, because of the things that we have done relative to acquisition -- chemicals, power -- to help drive down the variable costs associated with production. Walter?     Right on, Jeﬀ. It's really due to favorable pricing in chemicals and the continued execution of driving the cost down, primarily on the power side. We executed some contracts that were much more favorable. Some are large states, and we're seeing the beneﬁt of that.     And one other thing to add -- because of the lack of rain, we have had lower turbidity in our water so that we did not have to do quite as much treatment as you would expect."
"Was this above your -- or below, however you want to look at it -- of your plan at the beginning of the year?","Our plan was baked into our $1.90 to $2 a share guidance, and there's a lot of moving parts. I don't think we'll get into a point of starting doing the pluses and minuses of each individual part. We're doing, obviously, quite well relative to that entire plan."
"So, we'll look at this as a permanent change in terms of the costs associated on this.","Well, remember --"
"All things being equal. There's -- understanding the weather, and everything else but there's --","Well, think about power costs for a second, Gerry. There are two things that aﬀect power costs for us. One is, what is happening in that overall power market? So, obviously when natural gas prices are low, power prices are going to be lower, unless there's some fundamental demand-   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   supply imbalance that shifts prices up dramatically. But the other piece of it is, how eﬀective are we in acquiring that power? So there's two diﬀerent pieces to it.  I can't tell you how much is which piece. Obviously, we're going to continue to do everything we can to improve our acquisition prowess and the tools that we use to do that. But at the same time, we can't control what happens to natural gas prices. So you can't say it's permanent, unless you are going to say, well, it's normalized out what happens to power prices, chemical prices, all those kinds of things."
"Okay, understood. I appreciate it. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Citigroup. Please go ahead.",
"Question for Ellen -- when you talked about not needing equity for the current time frame, how far out does that go? Does that comment apply to '13 and '14 as well?","The way I would look at it, Brian, is in terms of, again, what would drive our need to equity. And as we have said, we have had the beneﬁt in the past -- the higher your net income, the more ROs, the less you need equity. The stronger your cash ﬂow, the less we need equity. And again, I would add, with those NOLs that we're able to carry forward, those give us more cash. So what we're saying is, right now, we don't see a need; and as long as those things continue and we continue to see the balance sheet strengthen, we don't see a need for going forth with an equity oﬀering."
"Okay. And then one more question -- really more, Jeﬀ, for you. When you talk about the long- term 7% to 10% EPS growth rate, in your mind, how much of that comes from things like acquisitions and tuck-ins versus pure, organic growth at the Businesses that you currently already own?","Well, I think the way to think about that, Brian, is we've said that investing $800 million to $1 billion, midpoint of $900 million a year, basically provides the engine to fund about 6% growth. And it could be a little higher, maybe a little lower, but it's right in that range, 6%, 6.5%. The key for us, obviously, is being able to put that in and getting the value of that through the rate- making process. And so that is where we really focus on our cost control so that our rate cases are really capital-based and we keep the size of the increase at a manageable level.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So going beyond that, that means whether it's tuck-ins, acquisitions, new products and services, and new markets. So new markets, for example, moving into New York City; new products and services, for example, moving into -- and I'm just using homeowner services in this case -- is moving into the indoor plumbing business. Or on in our existing service territories, it's moving more into wastewater instead of just potable water. So those are extensions, what I will call logical, organic extensions, that can add in addition to acquisitions.  So, you remember that -- what we sometimes euphemistically refer to as the sandbox chart, that's got the four colors, and it shows how, over time, the weight of those components will change as our eﬀorts and success in improving our ROE on existing assets gets to a point where we're earning our full cost of capital."
"Got it, thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Banc of America. Please go ahead.",
"This question was asked, but maybe in a diﬀerent way. When you look at the eﬃciency targets, obviously, since it's a cost% of revenue, the revenue has been a little beneﬁted by the strong weather. So if we're trying to think about, is there a way to weather-normalize where you really are on this eﬃciency ratio --or to put it another way, should we expect that to pull back a little next year, if it's a normal weather year before you get there?","Yes, Steve -- remember, we're doing a 12-month rolling average. It's not a quarter-over-quarter. If you looked at the quarter-over-quarter, it would clearly have a big dip for this quarter, and you should expect it to come back up a little bit. Given that we're -- and that is why we think quarterly measures for something like this don't make a lot of sense. So you look at it on a 12- month rolling average, which normalizes out some of that. It still -- this quarter has a signiﬁcant impact because of how good it was, but it won't have nearly as dramatic an impact. When we report the Third Quarter earnings, we'll have to see if it's sticking in the same range, creeping up a little bit; but our long-term goal is below 40 by 2015. And I'd say we're well on target to hit that."
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. [Operator Instructions]   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Our next question come from the line of Kevin Cole with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.,
"Yes, just one quick follow-up question. Given your footprint in the Marcellus and the likely EPA regulation coming next year on frac water recycling, do you see this as a meaningful growth opportunity for your non-regulated Businesses?","It is a business opportunity that we're taking a hard look at. There's a lot that goes into what kind of systems will be used. And by that I mean centralized versus decentralized, what we may want to take on, and the kinds of technologies that will aﬀord the lowest costs for doing this. But I come from a part of the world in the West where water reinjection is done all the time. But the diﬀerence is, in the western formations, there's almost a giant sucking sound trying to pull that water back down into the ground.  In the East, given the geology, they have to put it under such high pressure, and I think that is creating a lot of concerns around the reinjection of water in the Marcellus area, because it is just a diﬀerent geology. And that puts more pressure, maybe, on going into the water treatment side. So we'll look at that as a business opportunity. Obviously if we do it, we're going to do it in as good and safe and appropriate a way as possible."
How big do you think this opportunity could be?,"I think this is one of these markets that's got so many diﬀerent vectors it could go, it's hard to say. It could be very large. One of the things that you've got to remember is that these wells -- these are not long-lived wells. You go into the West and you'll see a lot of wells that will produce for 10, 15 years. And then you put a pumper on it. But these wells are shorter-lived. So in order to keep the gas ﬂowing, they've got to keep drilling. I think both -- obviously that industry is very focused on how do we reduce the amount of water that we need to frac each well, because now it's about 5 million gallons. So they're trying to ﬁgure out how can they reduce the amount of water. That will reduce the amount of ﬂow-back and what's going to be the drill rate.  If you look in Pennsylvania, you have seen about a 25% reduction in drilling rigs operating just this year. It's stabilized and maybe it will come back a little bit as natural gas prices have ﬁrmed up, but it's -- frankly, there's been a signiﬁcant downturn. One of the things about our approach into this business is, we're fundamentally leveraging our infrastructure by which we serve retail customers throughout Pennsylvania. And what we're ﬁnding is that a lot of extensions that we make, we will serve some drillers. This Rex Pipeline is a classic example. But it really opens up the path for expansion of our territory and to serve new residential customers. And our regulators are comfortable with this approach.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   From a business perspective, one of the things that means is we take on less risk, because we don't really have commodity or volumetric risk, and we are going to recover those costs over a reasonable period of time. But there may be other situations that will appropriately be done on the other side, where you have a dedicated line that will only serve one set of customers. I think that model is what will hold true if the water treatment, the ﬂow-back water treatment market develops, because those treatment facilities have to be diﬀerent just because of some of the compounds and the level of TBS that you're having to remove."
"Great. Thank you, very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.",
"First of all, thanks so much for ﬁnally breaking out the weather impact I know we have asked for that for quite some time.",It's our preliminary and best guess.
That's all we ever asked for.,"We had to lease a quarter of the supercomputer in California to calculate this, I want you to know."
"No, it is very helpful to just try to see the magnitude of that. But, Ellen, just a follow-up on your equity comments -- is there any change to your 45% to 50% target equity ratio? Or you are just saying, even without any external raises, you naturally grow into that over the next few years?","We're talking about naturally growing into our environment on equity. I should also add one other point on this. It does assume, as we're talking about this, the continuation of $800 million to $1 billion of investment in our infrastructure."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It looks like --,Ellen just mentioned the S&P. That's really what it's based on.     Right.
"Right, it looks like even with those CapEx levels and everything, that in the next ﬁve years, you're getting close to almost being self-funding. Is that where you see yourself being?",Could you say that again? We had a little disconnect.
"I was just saying, assuming the $900 million of annual CapEx, its looks like over the next ﬁve years, given NOLs, and the growing cash ﬂows and everything, it looks like you're almost getting close to being self funding. Is that where you see yourself from a net-debt perspective?","By self-funding, you're talking about also no new debt issuances?"
"Yes. Right, not quite there but getting pretty close.","Yes. Again, as long as the cash ﬂow continues to grow, the answer will be yes to that, but again, - -     With some debt.     -- with some debt, there will be some debt.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      That debt, Jonathan, obviously is because our net income is growing, increases our earnings. So we have the ability to issue some debt and maintain the same Cap structure.     Right."
"Okay. And then, Jeﬀ, you mentioned, with the New Jersey DSIC, assuming that goes through, I think it was $140 million -- is it $140 million of additional CapEx above your $800 million to $1 billion?","No. What it really does is, it will -- it may keep us a little more the middle or upper part of that. Because, remember, for example, this year, our total CapEx will be over $900 million, largely because of BT [ph]. So, in fact, it may keep us up in that range. And that $140 million is over two years."
Okay.,"So it's roughly $70 million a year, you can look at it that way."
"A little of it will be allocating your current budget more to New Jersey, given the more constructive recovery mechanism?","Right.     That's exactly right, Jonathan. It's where the opportunities provide, we've got scarce capital, we'll allocate it where it's encouraged to be invested."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And then, ﬁnally -- how should we be thinking about the dividend payout ratio and growth? With the strengthening balance sheet, do you continue to target the lower end of that 50% to 70% range to strengthen that equity ratio? Or might you get a little more aggressive with the dividend increases?","Well, I guess two things. When we announced in May, we narrowed that to really 50% to 60%. We talked about the comfort that we had relative to the growth, and we said that we would expect the dividend to grow more in line with the growth rate in our net income, or in our earnings per share, I'm sorry. So you would expect to see it grow in that kind of a range, where on the low end -- and certainly with what we're now projecting for this year we're on the low end. But if earnings are growing at a more rapid rate, we're going to have it grow more in line with what that earnings per share is.     As we've said in the past, Jonathan, we'll always continue to have that balance between what is right for the shareholder and the cash ﬂow needs of the Company."
Okay. Great. Thanks for the additional details.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Tim Winter with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.,
"Congratulations, guys, on a great quarter.","Thanks, Tim."
"I wanted to ask a big picture question, and it's on that map on page 7. I really don't mean for this to be a softball question, but given the drought conditions and the weather and the regional impact it's having on the economy, the municipal budget situation, what have you -- are you seeing any material change in movement towards larger regional water projects or desalination? Or are you being called in for helping with anything? Or is it just too early that this quarter's impact is having on that movement?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Tim, in terms of regional water development or people going, oh, my gosh, we've got to create more supply -- I think it's causing people to think. If you're of the belief that the weather patterns will become more volatile and droughts and precipitation will become more extreme, it does cause you to have to think about water supplies diﬀerently.  And for us, one of the key elements is to start really thinking about one water as opposed to these diﬀerent streams of potable water, waste water, and storm water. But think of it a lot more holistically so you can get the right resource to the right use. And that's where we think reuse will become more than a tickling fancy in some constrained areas. It will become more mainline, mainstream, if you will. I wouldn't say that we're seeing a major awakening or aha, but I do believe that you are seeing people become -- going, oh, gee, this could get serious. And I think that helps put a focal point on both the infrastructure as well as the opportunity to advance technologies like reuse.  The other push, which is raising more opportunities, questions, doors, but we'll wait to see what it really translates into, is the realization by municipalities that Uncle Sam is not going to bail them out of dire capital requirements or pension obligations that are taking away from their ability to invest on infrastructure and things like that. So I think there's a lot of churn, which I would not jump to the conclusion is results-based, yet."
