Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Good morning, Rich."
"Maybe starting with the equity update. I know you reiterated a similar language to 3Q, but just now that we're getting into 2023, I just wanted to see if there's anything else you could share on kind of timing or message as we're into the calendar year now.","Yes. Hey, Rich. Thanks for the question. I'll ask John to comment on that.     Rich, no update in terms of timing. We'll issue the bulk of the $2 billion in 2023. And then whatever we don't issue in '23, we'll issue in the back-end of our 2023 to 2027 plan period."
"Okay. Got it. Very clear. Thank you. And then you noted the stabilizing chemical costs, and I see the diﬀerences in the '23 walk from 3Q and then the current tech. But just, is that really the -- looking at, I think, is a $0.01 revision there on the total range. Is that really the change you're seeing versus the initial assumptions? I guess, what I'm really getting at is across that and pension, any kind of movement within the guidance range now that you have ﬁnal marks and more line of sight on the chemicals front relative to your initial outlook?","Yes. Rich, I'd say, no change from what we've previously discussed, both in terms of our results in '22 and expectations for '23. As we talked last quarter, pretty successful in the regulatory arena to really mitigate most of that exposure going into '23. And now that we ﬁnished our pension remeasurement, as John commented on, certainly anticipate no change to our guidance relative to that issue."
Got it. Very clear as well. Thank you for the time today.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Thanks, Rich.  Operator  Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS."
"Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Hey, to follow-up on the equity, just how does that position you for incremental acquisitions? Is there sort of a -- any element of prefunding there? And then if there's -- and a follow-up, just on the rate base, how did that come in for 2022 versus your expectation? And how does that -- if it's diﬀerent, how does that impact your guidance going forward?","Let me take the ﬁrst -- or the second part of that ﬁrst. No surprises relative to rate base as we ended the year. And again, as we look out really into this ﬁve-year period, we don't expect any changes from what we've previously shown you around rate base.  And John, you want to comment on the equity question?     Sure. Gregg, I would just say that the amount of equity that we're raising and the cadence of the equity does capture the various scenarios that we've run around regulated acquisitions."
