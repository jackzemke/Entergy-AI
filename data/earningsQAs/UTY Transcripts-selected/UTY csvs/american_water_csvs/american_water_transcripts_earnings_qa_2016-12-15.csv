Question,Answer
The question is on the returns for each of the market-based businesses. If you could just give me an idea relative to your regulated businesses the returns and the volatility of the returns for each of these?,"Deb, we have been talking about the headwinds in the Military Services Group all year. What is your outlook for the Military Services Group? Do you expect these headwinds to continue into 2017 and beyond? How do you think about growth in the Military Services Group? And also with the change in presidential administration, can you tell us about how you think about that for the military services?     Sure, Linda. Looking at MSG, we talked about earlier how we have, really, two diﬀerent ways that we earn money. For us, the core O&M of operating and maintaining the bases; that's pretty stable. We operate at 50-year contract. We get regular price redeterminations, or economic increases and so that is very stable. No risk -- I mean, I shouldn't say no risk. Low risk and again, I don't see any softness in that space because we've got 50-year contracts.  Where we did some headwinds in 2017 -- 2016 and continuing into 2017 is on the infrastructure projects. It's not around demand for capital investments. When you look across our bases, in 2016, we identiﬁed needs of over $500 million of projects at 12 existing basis. This -- like walter talked about balancing the impact on customers, we identiﬁed a lot of projects. The challenge is the government hasn't been spending as much money.  When you think the Department of Defense. And looking at how they spend their money, we are not only competing with other infrastructure projects at all of the domestic bases, we're also competing with any other investments in planes, tanks, you name it. So that's really what has been causing the headwinds for us in the Military Services Group.  We do see that continuing in 2017; however, to answer your second question with the change of administration, Susan talked about it earlier. We are optimistic. We don't have it baked into our   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   forecast any recovery in 2017; however, there is a possibility that there is some loosening in terms of Department of Defense spend and we're poised to take advantage of that.  When will that translate into net income for us? It depends on when actually the loosening is and where the government -- where the DoD decides to spend that investment. But we're ready with those shovel-ready product -- projects so that if and when the loosening occurs, we will be ready to do the investments and do the capital work.     Thank you, Deb. And Dan, for Keystone? We also faced headwinds in 2016. You talked a bit about the market picking up in 2017. What gives you the conﬁdence that 2017 is going to look diﬀerent? And how do you think that the potential impact for the change of administration could impact your business?     Sure, sure. I'm glad you're asking me that question now instead of six months ago  Like I had stated, the rig count has increased in the Appalachian Basin to about 50 rigs; natural gas price is around $3.50. The completion activity that our Company has seen in the Fourth Quarter and the projections going to 2017 are improved from this year. That gives us great conﬁdence in market recovery.  Energy Information Administration has recently forecasted that natural gas, average natural gas market production in 2016 would be around 77.5 billion cubic feet per day. That's 1.3 billion cubic feet Bcf down from 2015; however, they are projecting an increase of about 2.5 Bcf going into 2017. So that's very positive.  Along with that, domestic consumption is increasing. Exports to Mexico as well as LNG exports are increasing and that is helping drive and contribute to the Henry Hub price average in 2016 which was about $2.47 -- $2.49 to about $3.27 in 2017. So that's very positive.  Along with that, OPEC has recently announced they're going to decrease production which should be positive for pricing in the United States as well as domestic drilling and completion activities. Along those lines, in the Appalachian Basin speciﬁcally, we have seen a number of drilled but uncompleted wells that have been sitting in inventory. That number has been drastically reduced in 2016. So that's a positive sign for increased drilling moving forward.  Along with that, what gives us a lot of conﬁdence is our diversiﬁcation initiative into the municipal services market supporting, like I said, American Water and other municipalities in the Northeast United States. We believe that leverages our core competencies and we are well- situated to diversify our business in that fashion. So those things give us great conﬁdence that the market is recovering and allowing us to forecast Keystone to be accretive to earnings in 2017. As far as the election, it's a little too early to tell but we're very positive about the election here in Keystone.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It should be a positive for the energy sector as well as Keystone. They have called for more increased drilling and completion activity, less restriction on pipelines and other regulations that should promote and facilitate a friendlier environment for the exploration and production companies in the United States. We believe it will very positive for the energy sector and for Keystone as a whole.     Thank you, Dan. Deb, switching to Homeowner Services. Homeowner Services has had a signiﬁcant amount of growth since its inception. Do you see that growth continuing and what are the key risks in that business and what are you worried about in that business?     Sure. So I see huge growth in HOS potential. When you look, there's -- if you -- based on the census, there is 67 billion households across -- million households across the US, single-family homes. We only -- we estimate that only 5% of those homes have water line and sewer line protection plans. So that says the market is really untapped in terms of buying warranties, programs for water lines and sewer lines. So really, we see a lot of runway in terms of market, which is great.  We also see a lot of opportunity for partnerships. We closed on or started new deals with partnerships that represent 260,000 connections in 2016 and we see a lot of pipeline for new partnerships with municipalities and with other utilities into 2017 and beyond. So those two things really give me a lot of conﬁdence in terms of our future growth in Homeowner Services.  Switching gears to the risk. The biggest risk in terms of ﬁnancials for Homeowner Services is claims expense. For claims, it is absolutely the largest expense line item for Homeowner Services and how we manage claims really boils down to its frequency, meaning how many claims you have. And severity, meaning how expensive that claim is.  Frequency, we look at our terms and conditions so we don't cover things like natural disasters. We also look at pre-existing conditions not covering that and then in terms of severity, we have like in New York, we have actually two master plumbers that go around and spot-check claims to make sure that our plumber network is being fair. So that they are not saying a claim requires this amount of replacement at this dollar.  We're watching them if that makes sense. We also have a very robust pipeline of contractors across the US that provide our services to us that allows us to get good pricing with our contractor network and they do a great job for us across the US.     Thank you, Deb. So Dan, you've been part of the American Water family for almost a year-and-a- half now. Can you talk a little bit about how that has impacted your business, both good and bad?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Sure. No bad  It's been very positive for Keystone Clearwater in 2016. It's helped us. The name recognition alone has helped us open new doors with exploration and production companies that we had not worked for; that's been very positive. They have been essential in helping us increase our market share to about 35% for our core service in 2016.  They've been inﬂuential in helping us, having the opportunity to bid work in our Municipal Services Group diversiﬁcation initiative, where we have competitively bid and won work for Deb's Military Services Group, among others, which we're very proud of and we believe that we have a solid platform for growth there. We've adopted many of the processes that American Water has that makes them a great company into Keystone Clearwater and it has truly made us a stronger company in 2016. So yes, the ownership of American Water has been very positive to Keystone Clearwater this year.     Thank you, Dan. Let me open it up to questions from all of you. There's microphones in the back if you could stand.     Absolutely. That's a great question. We get that question, really, all of the time. The way that these are extremely competitive businesses. The way that we look at the returns on these businesses are, really, risk-adjusted returns. When you look at, for example, our Military Services Group, these -- the risk proﬁle of the military services contracts, 50-year contracts backed by the US government, capital-light contracts.  These are really regulated like in their risk proﬁle and we would expect that the returns would be commensurate with that type of risk. And we do the same type of analysis for our Homeowner Services Group and Keystone.     So we don't disclose the actual numbers but that's how we think about it. Good try."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   A question for Dan. I wondered if you could speak more slowly and tell me what municipal services and asset ownership, what those are? I think I heard you say that you're actually buying water pipelines from E&P companies. Then what you do with it? Because it's not regulated.  What do you do with it after you purchase it? Is there -- how do you contract that? How -- what do the cash ﬂows look like from that asset purchase and how much do you spend on that kind of thing? Then Municipal Services, I don't understand what that is.","Sure. I'll start with Municipal Services. So we are, like I said, leveraging our core competencies of water transfer pumping piping to support municipal markets. Building pipelines, water pipelines, temporary pump bypass, emergency response services, water storage solutions. And we've done even some water treatment solutions for American Water. As far as the --"
So those are unregulated infrastructure?,Everything has been on the market-based side as far as the bidding at this time. But we are working on aﬃliated state agreements for the regulated side. We have the ability to support them in emergency.
So how do you -- do you sign contracts with municipalities? I'm just wondering what the revenue stream and return proﬁle looks like?,There are contracts we bidded just like any other service contractor that they currently hire to do the work. Then we do it at a projected return.
Then the asset ownership?,"So the asset ownership. So these are long-term contracts, typically about ﬁve years where we -- essentially, it's a rental. We have a -- we get paid rent for about ﬁve years on the agreements that we have closed in 2016 and we have the ability to operate and maintain the systems where we charge our normal water transfer rates to the exploration and production companies to operate them.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"So when they stop producing in that region or at that particular well, then are you left with a stranded asset?",Well we realize the full return in the time of the contract of ﬁve years. That's how we structure them.
Okay. Thank you.,"Leslie, what we do is make sure that we have contracts that are backing up these pipelines so that we're not having those stranded assets.     I will also add that there's -- most of the contracts may only have a ﬁve-year life but the runway in that basin or in that developmental area is 15 to 20 years. So there's a useful life even after that."
"A question for Dan. It involves the policies and practices on water procurement and treatment of produced and ﬂowback water afterward. I'm aware of the coalition forces sustainable shale development. I believe your company has been involved in American Water from inception. It has very strict standards for operating wells, including, I believe, a total recycling of the water.  This all looks good on paper but what is actually happening? Is there penetration of those standards that the coalition has set up or other standards higher than federal and the three states involved? And is that playing into a larger opportunity for you?","Keystone currently is not involved with any of the treatment or disposal of the ﬂowback or the production water. So the process that we witness every day in the course of our normal business is the primary method right now for dealing with production and ﬂowback water is recycling. They are taking water from one well -- or one producing well and recycling and reusing it down the next hole. That is the number one approach.  Companies have begun to share their ﬂuids between one another where one time they would take it to a disposal facility, maybe even a deep well injection disposal well and today, they are   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   actually storing it and sharing to others when they don't have an active completion program. So that activity is what is predominant in the Appalachian Basin. I can't speak to other plays throughout the United States. But that's what we are seeing every day. Keystone does not take ownership of the water. We transport it, we pipe it, we pump it and we work it back to the energy company. Does that answer your question?     Excellent. Thank you for -- we can take one more."
(inaudible),"I'm sorry. I didn't hear your question.     I can answer that  His question was how much do you have invested in pipelines?     We have really just begun to look at this business with design, build, own and operate. We have very little invested in capital right now in Keystone. We are looking at additional opportunities. Dan can talk a little bit more about it but we still consider, when you look at the portfolio of our market base businesses, that they will continue to be capital-light.     And just to add to that, I wasn't sure if I was clear on the infra-structure projects in the military base. That's actually working capital for us but the actual asset, it's not an investment that we make. It doesn't sit on our balance sheet."
(multiple speakers) My question is just on the military bases. So the current ministration has been in for a long time. But it seems like this slowdown just occurred in the last year or so. So could you just clarify what changed more recently than before and what we should be speciﬁcally watching from the new administration that would indicate that we're back on track?,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's a good question. So for us, in Military Services, we actually had a lot of factors. The capital infrastructure projects that we do the government, some of them actually are in the initial RFP so when we take over operating a base, sometimes we'll have a suite of capital projects that we're looking to do and that's typically in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of operating a base. So we had some larger capital investments that we were making in some of our bases that we started operating ﬁve years ago and they stopped.  Or at least they tapered oﬀ of what was in the initial RFP when we got the base period. Then we also had a very large project down at Fort Polk. We installed two water -- wastewater treatment plants. That was a signiﬁcant amount of investment and that project has been completed in 2016. So really, we have all three things which is we have some -- we had some of the initial capital that was in the bid when we won the base that we've completed.  We had the one large project that's completed and we have the sequestration which is limiting the Department of Defense spent. So for me, looking forward, you should look at, when we get a new base, did it have a large capital program that was included in the RFP?  Then also if there is a loosening of Department of Defense budgets, then you can -- we should expect to see some loosening in some capital dollars ﬂowing our way. No guarantee it depends on the mission, which base the Department of Defense is going to invest in and what are the -- all the other needs across that base in terms of where they are going to invest. But if you see loosening of Department of Defense spending and sequestration, then we should -- that should translate into more opportunities for us."
Thank you.,"Thank you, all for your questions. Wonderful questions. In summary, we look at our market- based businesses as being complementary businesses that leverage our core competencies. These are businesses that have signiﬁcant growth potential yet are capital light. And we also look at them as ways to really attract and retain signiﬁcant talent like you've seen here today on this panel.     Thank you very much. Thanks Deb and Dan. Our next section, what we're going to talk about is corporate business development. We get a lot of questions from all of you about how do you think about growing the business in other ways? And how do you think about expanding into other regulated states?  And so we have with us today, Mark Strauss, who is our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development. He's going to walk us through this process. And Mark is one of the smartest and wittiest people I have ever met in my career. He has been with American Water company for 29 years -- almost 30 years and he has been in a variety of roles.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   He started with our American Water Enterprises Group. He actually came in as General Counsel in one of the companies there. We won't hold that against him. He's a recovering General Counsel. But he's been a Chief Operating Oﬃcer of those companies, CEO of those companies.  He was the President of AWE before becoming the Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Business Development in 2010. He has a real solid view and knowledge of the water and wastewater industry. So without further ado, please let me introduce Mark Strauss.     Thank you. The only thing worse than having a bad picture of me up here is the realization that it's actually a good picture  All right. So it's, what, 10 after 3:00 PM. You've been here for two hours. I'm up here following really impactful and excellent presentations by some fantastic people from American Water.  And I'm just before Linda is going to come up and give the ﬁnancial plan and you're going to hear the closing from Susan. I feel a little bit like the kids they sometimes bring out in the seventh inning of the All-Star game to run around bases before while they are doing the groundskeeping. I will do my best to both inform and entertain you. They have limited my slides to try and limit the damage and you can't even see the shock collar that I have on.  In our function -- I'm privileged to lead a small team at the corporate level. And this is in recognition of the fact that the actual growth activity -- most of it is, as you have seen from the prior presentations, done at the business level. The state operations and the reg side all have growth objectives and as you might know from having been familiar with Walter, he is not lackadaisical about them delivering on those goals.  The same goes for AWE, where each business has its own embedded business development. But there are certain things that are more eﬃciently done at the corporate level. Within our small team, we -- some of the things we perform and I'll walk through on the slides. Some of the things we do are to lead in certain respects.  A lot of we do is to support and then we have a bit of governance that we do for the Company as well. So internal controls support. So when you think about it, doing primary research, looking at industry trends and what our competitors are doing, that's something most eﬃciently done at the center. And even in that, we work cooperatively with the business.  What are they seeing out there. And we try to collect that information and it's almost -- it's fascinating, because it's like almost like being in the Military Industrial Business -- I mean, -- excuse me, the Military Intelligence Business, in that you're collecting bits from all diﬀerent places and you're trying to assemble this mosaic and what's it telling you about where the market is going and what are the other competitors in that market thinking how are they performing.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Another aspect of what we do at the center is to take a look at the other IOUs, whether they be publicly held or privately held. And obviously, as you all know, there's not a huge universe of those. But we -- it gives the opportunity to do pretty much in-depth examination and so it's not just looking at them as competitor. But it's to position ourselves because if something comes to market, do we want to make a run at it? And if so, we get -- try to pre-position the thinking so that we're not saying, well, we didn't even know about the company or we don't know a lot about who they are or how they perform.  We are ready to be able to take advantage of opportunities. So we call it being strategically opportunistic. There are no hostile takeovers in this industry. So we're not going out there, making tender oﬀers. It's just being prepared and being ready. Then we also on -- in American Water, we do have an annual strategic planning cycle and what we try to do is run it slightly ahead on the calendar, slightly ahead of the business planning cycle and it's across the business.  At the corporate level, what we do is try to create the matrix. We try to create templates. We try to create the structure. And work with the businesses as they walk through that. So in an individual state, we'll have the opportunity to look at what their markets looks like, what are the drivers of the industry in their state? What is the -- what are wastewater cycle needs going to be create opportunities or threats?  Then we collate all of the information and bring it back to the ELT, again, presentations by the states and lines of business and the functions to the ELT and from that, the ELT can then say, okay, look, we have seen a lot of information here and from those, we think these certain smaller subset are the things that should be baked into the business plan for the coming year, or the coming years.  That is how we develop our shell strategy and we're working on some others in that regard, too. So I just want to emphasize, a lot of the new ideas are bubbling up from the business. We are not so arrogant to think that because we sit at the center of the business, from a structural standpoint, that we've got all the wisdom in the world.  It's a lot of what you learn is to listen to what goes on in the business. You've seen folks like Kevin and others. There are smart people out there; they know what they're doing and they know what's going on out there and they know what the customer needs are. So that's a huge, huge advantage for us.  There's a -- one of the things on the slide says we provide leadership and modeling on major transactions. Now unless you decide you want to short the stock because you think I'm modeling the transactions, what we do is we work with ﬁnance and we -- a model is only as good as the inputs. So what we do is we work with the business and we try to assemble as much information as we can in the early stage and provide that to ﬁnance, the Corporate Finance Group that Jen leads to try and make sure that our models are sound.  And we also do some testing, whether it's reverse balance sheet, reverse P&L, to test things and see how we can best position ourselves as we look at diﬀerent opportunities. On major M&A,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   whether it be an acquisition of a company like Keystone or it's Scranton or McKeesport, some of the larger reg acquisitions, we support the states.  If they have -- we're ﬁnding more and more, some of these principalities are actually seeking out bankers, ibankers as advisory ﬁrms and we are more used to interacting with them and the business so the business can focus on the operational aspects, the state regulatory aspects and we can manage some of the other components of putting together a winning strategy, winning the bid and then implementing the ﬁnal due diligence through to closing.  And that then gets over to the support the state subsidiaries with guidance and expertise. One thing that is hidden. But you don't really think about is when you acquire a major system, whether -- and I guess I should say whether it's a system, a business or whatever, you have to integrate it into your business.  And it's something that we've come to appreciate. As Walter showed you that slide, we've gone from 6,000 customers a year in acquisition -- by the way, 2012 was the year after I got this job. So I keep reminding Walter that those spike in numbers is because I happen to be here. It's a complete lie but why not take advantage of it?  But the successful acquisition and integration is huge and we deﬁne success, does the customer have any adverse results from our acquisition, okay? The customer should actually have a better day because American Water is there and that is a -- one of the things as we approach potential deals, one of the real serious things -- one of our primary considerations is, if we own this asset,, if we own this system, if we have these folks as customers, are they going to have a better day with us than they would from where they are now or with something else?  That base -- two things positions us best to be competitive and number two, that we want those customers to be happy they came to us, all right? So as we think about how we integrate, we work very hard behind the scenes with the Company, the state or the operating company will be focused on the operational aspects, the local regulations. We're trying to -- we are -- we have a team in our function that works across the back-oﬃce functions in American Water to make sure that the billing will go out on time and be accurate.  That the other aspects are down the website will now show them as part of American Water, all those little details that you might think, well, billing, obviously, is huge issue but all those details that customer should be able to say, yes, I feel like I'm one of the family from the day that the closing takes place. That is our objective. We have metrics that we're measured against on that and again, as you might think Walter and Susan, Linda and others pay close attention to those. We stick to that knitting very closely.  Then ﬁnally, our governance function is we have a deliberate process where projects are reviewed through a, what we call, the CDC process -- the Commercial and Development Committee. What happens is depending on the size of the project, it either goes to a state CDC for certain projects or business lines but the larger ones all come up to a national committee.  And no acquisition or disposition, no major contract is to be made without those projects being reviewed and one of our missions is to make sure they are reviewed, that the information   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   provided is accurate and that we keep a record of that. So that we have a -- we can track that through and make sure everybody understands it and we also provide guidance. We don't want to be a guessing game. We keep businesses informed about how -- and we listen to them. Some of the requirements that used to be in the CDC process were not real value-added. We stripped those out.  We have changed some formats. We've added some information so that they can be more eﬀective. We work with the business so that we can demonstrate that we have a rigorous process but it's not like we make it a torture chamber where you have to pass through this to get a deal done. Now, one thing that we do as part of our larger leadership is to look out and say, where are we not now that American Water regulated operations might want to be?  I personally have advocated for the (Caribbean) and committed to going down there personally for long-term due diligence; it was not accepted by the ELT. So we have a matrix that we screen states against on the ongoing basis. I'm not going to stand up here and tell you which state or states we are currently taking a hard look at.  But I want you to know that we have a very disciplined process for doing that. We understand that our shareholder is buying a utility stock. They have a certain risk-reward expectation and it is better for us to not do certain transactions or enter a given state then to be able to say, I did a deal.  That is not something that our shareholder would appreciate. As we look at diﬀerent factors in the state. And I should probably advance the slide. We look at the regulatory climate. What are the policies and practices and procedures that, that given state might have for recovery? Did they have districts? Do they have forward-looking test years? That also includes what are their environmental regulations like?  And this might be a little counterintuitive but we don't look for really lax environmental regulations. Because our expertise is being able to meet strict standards. So that is something that we keep an eye on. Is there a need for our expertise in that given jurisdiction?  The other -- next thing is the business climate. Is it a state that is well -- friendly disposed in a friendly way towards private ownership of assets like this? Is it generally one with a thriving business climate so that we can look towards growth, both in population and in the business community itself? We don't want to go plant our ﬂag in a state where it's going to be stagnant or going to a downward curve.  Finally, even if we clear those other bars, we have to say, okay, we see a way to enter this state so that we can get to 50,000 customers within ﬁve years? The reason for that is, I could probably get us into a number of states, buying 500 or 1,000 customer systems. And then what have you done? You've created all of the overhead of getting rates done. And running an operation of keeping your people supported with not much of a customer base and you have all the disadvantages of small-scale.  Any bump in the road in terms of having to make a repair or investment is going to drive your rates way up. So we set the bar at 50,000 customers ﬁgure and that gives you a strategic depth   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   in that given jurisdiction so that your customers will beneﬁt from our presence and that we don't burden too much overhead on the small number of customers. I think without doing any damage, I am completed. Thank you very much.     Thank you, Mark. You have heard a lot so far today. You have heard Susan talk about our success cycle. You've heard the customer panel where our goal is to where if customers could -- have a choice, they would choose us. You heard also Walter talk about our multi-decade-long need for infrastructure investment in the water and wastewater industry and the highly fragmented market in which we operate which provides us additional growth opportunities.  You've heard the panel on our market-based businesses that provide signiﬁcant growth opportunity and complementary businesses that are capital-light and leverage our core competencies. Then you just heard Mark talk about how we think about new strategic opportunities in the disciplined process that we go through when we look at those opportunities.  When I'm going to now is talk about how that all wraps up into our ﬁnancial plan. What you are going to hear me say during this section of the presentation is really what is on this slide, in that, we are one of the fastest-growing utilities in the nation. If you look at us in terms of our long- term earnings per share compound annual growth of 7% to 10%; that is based upon an anchor of 2015 earnings.  We are primarily regulated risk proﬁle. Over this period through 2021, we look at our regulated businesses contributing 85% to 90% of our earnings. We have decades of investments. And as I mentioned and as Walter talked about, we also have the opportunity for additional growth because of the fragmentation of our market.  We have a strong balance sheet and cash ﬂow that will allow us to ﬁnance our long-term plan without the need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. We have been a top leader in dividend growth. And looking forward, we look to continue to grow our dividend, in line with our earnings-per-share growth 7% to 10%.  And we have a target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. And you put all that together. And you look at the performance that we've had at American Water from the time that we went to our IPO in 2008 through November of this year, we have provided superior total shareholder return when you compare us to the Dow Jones Utility average, the S&P 500 and our water utility peers.  So let me walk through each of these items one at a time. First of all, when we look at our earnings, as Susan mentioned, we are aﬃrming our 2016 earnings guidance. You may recall that in the Third Quarter earnings call, we narrowed our earnings guidance into the top end of our prior guidance range plus $0.01. And this non-GAAP guidance is $2.81 to $2.86 per share.  That excludes the $0.22 charge that we took in the Third Quarter related to the Freedom Industries Global Agreement in principle. Including that $0.22, we would have revised guidance of $2.59 to $2.64 on a GAAP basis for 2016.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Looking forward to 2017, we're setting forth earnings guidance today in the range of $2.98 to $3.08 per share. When you look at that compared to the midpoint of last year, it -- that represents an 8% growth rate over the midpoint of our original 2016 guidance and about a 7% growth over the midpoint of our 2016 revised non-GAAP guidance.  Now included in our range of earnings for 2017, our normal ﬂuctuations and variances that I've included in the appendix of your materials today. But the biggest item that is included in our earnings guidance range that could vary is with regard to weather. We consider plus or minus $0.07 per share to be normal weather ﬂuctuations that are included in our earnings guidance range.  We've also laid out other normal variations by business segment. Earnings outside of those ranges or variants outside of those ranges could cause our results to diﬀer. Looking forward, we continue to see EPS compound annual growth rate of 7% to 10% over the next ﬁve years through 2021.  And we have moved our anchor from our 2014 adjusted earnings which was $2.43 per share to our 2015 anchor of $2.64 per share. So we continue to raise the bar upon which we calculate our 7% to 10% compound annual growth rate. That's really why we have the conﬁdence to say we're one of the fast-growing utilities in the nation when it comes to compound annual growth of our earnings per share.  We will continue to predominantly be a regulated risk proﬁle. When you look at where we think we're going to end the year in 2016, our regulated business will represent about 90% of our earnings when you exclude the parent costs. When you roll that forward and even with the signiﬁcant growth opportunities that we have in our market-based businesses, we continue to see the regulated business representing 85% of our earnings in 2021.  So we continue to be predominantly a regulated risk proﬁle. And within that regulated risk proﬁle, we also have some unique characteristics from a risk perspective. We have geographic - - we operate in 16 regulated states. So we have geographic and regulatory diversity. And Walter talked about over the last couple years, we have also seen weather diversity.  We have decades of capital investment needs. And we have mechanisms that allow us to continue to collect on a more accelerated basis, our infrastructure investment. We have a smooth deployment of capital in the water industry. When you look at the -- at our portfolio of infrastructure investments, a $25 million project in the water industry is considered a big project.  And it comes to Walter and I for ﬁnal approval if it exceeds $25 million and we get about 10 of those a year. Very smooth deployment of capital. We have also seen now in six of our states that we have fair market value type legislation for acquisitions. This brings from a risk proﬁle, an independent valuation methodology to the business.  On the market-based business side, we also see some unique risk characteristics. We have a portfolio now of four businesses that operate in diverse markets. I've mentioned several times   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   these are capital-light businesses and even with the future capital upgrades that we make on the military bases, these are working capital only.  And the design build and operate for the Keystone business, these are under contracts; shorter- term contracts but longer-term in terms of the Keystone contracts. We have signiﬁcant opportunities for growth, again, leveraging our core competencies in these businesses. And they also provide us the ability to attract and retain talent.  Three of the individuals that spoke today were -- started in our American Water Enterprises Company. Doug Brand, who is on our customer panel, started at American Water Enterprises. Mark Strauss, who you just heard from on our corporate strategy and business development side, really ran American Water Enterprises. And Walter Lynch came from our American Water Enterprise Company.  Let me now switch to our capital plan. Over the next ﬁve years, we have a capital plan in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.3 billion. For our regulated and system investments. And I'll walk through each of the items on the waterfall. For our regulated system investment, we are looking at $5.9 billion of investment over the next ﬁve years. And Walter talked a lot about this.  These are the investments that we are making to ensure that we provide safe, clean, reliable and aﬀordable services water and wastewater services to our customers. This represents a $400 million increase from our last ﬁve-year capital plan. And that increase is primarily to address some of the critical infrastructure needs that we see such as the lead service lines that Walter talked about and also, because we are able to accelerate some capital associated with bonus depreciation. That $5.9 billion of capital translates into the bottom part of our growth triangle of 4% to 6% compound annual growth rate in our earnings per share.  The next category of capital is our regulated acquisitions, which we look at that being $600 million to $1.2 billion over this period. In the past, we have put capital here as a placeholder for regulated acquisitions. And now we have included a range of potential spend so that we can increase the transparency of the potential opportunity related to regulated acquisitions.  When we think about regulated acquisitions at American Water, we are uniquely potentially for these opportunities. We can provide economies of scale when we tuck-in these acquisitions. When we look at our drinking water quality, last year, our drinking water quality was 13 times better than the industry average. And so if we have a municipality that wants to sell, with that type of record, they know they can trust us.  We also have the ﬁnancial strength and the access to capital to be able to make these acquisitions happen. And in fact, we have additional debt capacity under our current credit ratings to do even more and I'm going to talk about that in a few pages.  When we -- and I'm also going to talk a little bit about the ﬁnancial overlay of the process and timeline that Walter set forth for these regulated acquisitions on the next page. The regulated acquisitions translate into 1% to 2% of our growth triangle of the compound annual growth rate on our growth triangle. And we've seen some momentum in 2016 with regard to these regulated acquisitions.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And so many of you may be sitting there and asking yourselves, well, why don't you increase the 1% to 2% on your compound annual growth rate? I would tell you, we certainly hope that the momentum that we have seen in 2016 continues onto the future but these acquisitions can be lumpy in nature and so right now, we believe it's just too soon to tell but we will continue to be transparent in providing you glimpses into how we see the pipeline coming through for these potential opportunities.  The next section of our capital is our strategic capital which is over $200 million. This really represents the types of activities that Mark Strauss talked about that we set aside the goes through a disciplined ﬁnancial process for approval. They also represent our corporate headquarters building which we plan to break ground soon. And we would have complete by the end of 2018.  The corporate headquarters will be located in Camden. We're eligible for up to $164 million of tax credits associated with the building. From a cash perspective, those tax credits would ﬂow in over a 10-year period once we take up occupancy and as long as we meet certain metrics. From a book perspective, we will recognize those beneﬁts over the life of the asset under grant accounting, which really matches the economics of what we're trying to do with that building, which is to make it revenue neutral for our regulated customers and earnings neutral for our Company. In 2017, our capital plan is estimated to be $1.5 billion.  So now let me talk a little bit more about the ﬁnancial overlay of our regulated acquisitions and the process. So Walter talked about we get to all of the local approvals are done and we have a signed agreement ; that's when we begin to disclose it to you as a pending acquisition.  Currently, we have 37,500 customers pending with the Scranton close by year end. We then go through the regulatory approval process. This is the process where we get approval from the public service commission, the public utility commission. And this is approval of acquisition itself, not the economics of the deal that goes through the rate case. Once we receive that -- the regulatory approval, we then go through the ﬁnancial close.  When an acquisition is closed, it's at that time that we pay the purchase price to the seller and typically, what we do is we ﬁnance that purchase price through shorter-term debt at that particular time. We begin to take on the operations. We bring on the customers. We begin to leverage our best -- our back-oﬃce systems and then we begin to collect revenue at either the existing rates or one of our existing tariﬀs depending on the deal.  We then go through the regulatory rate case process for that particular state and when we come out of the rate case process, that is when rate base is authorized. It is when we would then ﬁnance the acquisition in accordance with the authorized capital structure within that state and then we would begin to collect revenues at the new authorized rates.  So this varies a little bit depending on each acquisition, both from a process perspective as well as a timeline perspective but what really stays constant through this entire process is the disciplined ﬁnancial process and the metrics that we use to evaluate these acquisitions to help us ensure that we're providing value for our customers and for our shareholders.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   On the next page, I want to talk a little bit about the excess debt capacity or the additional debt capacity that we have under our current credit ratings, that I mentioned on the capital slide. So Walter talked about how we think about regulated acquisitions, how we think about regulated capital and he talked about how we prioritize that capital.  How we drive capital eﬃciencies so that we can continue to do more with the same amount of dollars. And he talked about how we balance that with the customer rates and that's really how we come up with our capital plan. But if we were to step back and look at this at this from a pure ﬁnancial standpoint and I've utilized here the (inaudible) to debt metrics that put out by S&P.  From a pure ﬁnancial standpoint, under our current credit ratings, we could do $1.4 billion more than the top end of our capital range and $2 million more than the low-end of our capital range under our current credit ratings. So to the extent that we see a pick-up in acquisitions -- in regulated acquisitions, we have the ﬁnancial ability to be able to execute on that and to the extent we get that recovered in rate base, this is really the area to where we can see the biggest impact on rate base and earnings growth.  So that's really a look at our ﬁnancial plan from a high level. What I want to do now is shift gears a little bit to some of the sensitivities to that ﬁnancial plan. You heard Susan talk a bit earlier about some of the changes with the new administration. What I want to talk about in terms of those potential changes or actual changes are interest and taxes.  So what we've put together here is a look at how in a rising interest rate environment and under certain assumptions, what that would look like for American Water. What's really important is for me to outline the assumptions that we have used in this model. What we have assumed is that we have a 50 basis point increase in interest rate each year for the next three years.  So 50 basis point increase in 2017, another in 2018, another in 2019 and then it levelizes. We have assumed that we also see O&M costs having an inﬂation factor of about half that distance, or 25 basis point over that period. We've also assumed that we would recover our interest cost or increase in interest cost in our next rate case and on average, we've assumed that to be about two years.  We've also assumed that our pension discount rate would move by about half the distance of the increase in the interest rates, or 25 basis points. And I've just left the return on assets the same. We've also included in here the key assumption that the allowed ROE would increase by half of the interest rate change and that it would true-up on average in the next rate case which is two years, which is on average two years.  With all of those assumptions, when we look at this chart, this is really the impact that we would see on American Water. And so the zero line is our long-term ﬁnancial plan. You can see in 2017, we really wouldn't expect much of an impact and there's a couple of things driving that. One is that we would see higher interest rate expense on our new debt but that higher interest expense would be oﬀset by the beneﬁt that we see by a higher discount rate in our pension.  We have also with our debt maturities in 2017, we have over $500 million of debt maturity, about $300 million of that is hedged at about a 4% rate. So not a lot of impact in 2017. But we   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   do see is that the short-term interest drag in a higher interest rate environment or rising interest rate environment will eventually the oﬀset by the recovery of interest cost through our regulatory process and then having the higher ROEs being applied to our full-rate base balance.  Let me now move to taxes. So you'll hear a lot of disclaimers from me. This is an illustrative example of the potential impact of tax reform of which we cannot know what is going to happen with tax reform. But we want to do is really give you a directional view of some of the potential impacts on our business. With all of those disclaimers, what we have been consistently hearing is that if there is tax reform, we've consistently hearing it would be -- could be a decrease in the corporate income tax rate. It could be we have 100% expensing of capital investment or 100% bonus depreciation.  Then we also hear potential loss of certain deductions like the interest deduction. Let me walk through each of those items in isolation and talk about how that could impact our business. On the lower corporate tax rate, in the regulated business, it's pretty clear if you have a lower corporate tax rate, you have lower tax expense and under cost of service rate making and the history, we would expect that to beneﬁt our customers.  That beneﬁt to our customers could provide us a potential opportunity with our multi-decade long need for infrastructure investment to invest even more in our infrastructure and it could also help to make our lower rates competitive we look at our rates compared to others in the industry and municipalities. The ﬂip side of that is with lower tax rates, you get lower cash tax ﬂow coming in the door and we are in a net operating loss position, both federal and state.  Over time and I'm assuming that taxes are normalized in the utility industry and we continue to be but over time, what you would expect is that your rate base would increase because you have a lower tax rate so you have lower deferred tax liabilities that oﬀset rate base. On the market base side and the parent side, the impact is a little bit diﬀerent. So for the market-based businesses, if you have a lower tax rate, then you have higher earnings.  However, in our Military Services business, we would expect that, that would true-up in the next price redetermination and that true-up would be retroactive to the change in tax law. On the parent side, where the parent is the cost center. If we have a lower tax rate, that means we'd have higher expenses at the parent.  If we just take our non-regulated businesses, as long as the earnings in our market-based businesses outpace the costs at our parent company, it would be a beneﬁt to us and vice versa. For all of our companies, we would remeasure our deferred tax assets and our deferred tax liabilities that are on our balance sheet. So we take them from the current federal tax rate of 35% to whatever the new rate is. For non-regulated companies that ﬂows through your bottom line.  For regulated companies to the extent that normalization continues, you would ﬂow that back to your customers over the life of the asset, or the remaining life of the asset. So normalization will be a very large policy issue for the utility industry to the extent that we see tax reform.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Moving to 100% bonus depreciation. We would expect and this is really the regulated business only because the other businesses are capital-light. We expect that it would grow our federal net operating loss position and the growth in that net operating loss position would likely push out the time until we become a cash tax payer for federal purposes. Then the rate base impact is -- it gets really complicated very quickly.  And it's based on state-by-state analysis and it depends on the net operating losses and the amount of net operating loss by state. So if you have a net operating loss in a state, you've pretty much maxed out your deferred tax liabilities in that state. So you don't have an immediate impact on your rate base. It will impact rate base but this is really about the timing of when it will impact rate base.  Moving on to our loss of tax deductions. For the regulated business, if we have a loss of any type of tax deduction, that would increase tax expense for our regulated customers under cost of service rate making. And what's really interesting is when you start looking at this in combination with a lower corporate tax rate, where if we have a loss of deduction, it could oﬀset any beneﬁt that our customers get from a lower corporate tax rate.  We would expect to have lower earnings at the market base businesses and again, the military contracts would true-up in the next price redetermination and to the extent that we have a loss of parent, it's a cost center. And so we would expect to have an increased loss at the parent. There's a lot of variables here.  Hopefully, this is helped you directionally how this would impact the business. I know many of you have done some excellent write-ups on the utility industry and how potential tax reform could impact us. And hopefully, this is helpful for you.  Let me switch back to our ﬁnancial plan and the ﬁnancial strength, both the balance sheet strength and the cash ﬂow that sits behind that ﬁnancial plan. We have a very strong balance sheet at American Water. We are A-rated by S&P and if you look at all of the utilities in the S&P 500, there's only two that are A-rated. And we are one of them.  Our debt maturity schedule is over the next ﬁve years is manageable. The $574 million in 2017, $428 million of that is associated with the higher cost debt that was left over at the parent company from the RWE days. And we've hedged about $300 million of that at about 4%. The remainder of that debt maturity is manageable for us from a business perspective.  Our total debt to capital at the end of 2015 was 56% and looking through our long-term plan at the end of 2021, at the max of our capital plan, we would expect it to be 58% and this -- I should note, this includes both long-term and short-term debt. We also have strong cash ﬂows. When we look forward over this plan, we expect cash ﬂow from operations to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 7% anchored oﬀ of our 2015 cash ﬂow from operations.  I've also included here our federal net operating loss and how that works down over this plan period. Right now, 2015, the end of 2015, we had $1.1 million of net operating losses on the federal side. We expect at the end of 2016, that, that will grow a little bit when we get to the end   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   of the year and then that will begin to be utilized and we would become a cash tax payer in 2021.  When I look at the strong balance sheet and strong cash ﬂow, that is really what has enabled us to ﬁnance our capital plan without the need to issue additional equity under normal operating conditions. Those of you who have followed us for a long time know that we have been a top leader in dividend growth and in fact, since 2011, we have grown our dividend on a compound annual growth rate of 10.2%.  Looking forward, we target to grow our dividend in line with our earnings growth and we target our payout ratio of 50% to 60% of our earnings. We are currently in the lower end of that range so we have room for growth. So if I wrap all of this up, we continue to be one of the fastest growing utilities in the nation, with compound annual growth rate of 7% to 10% in earnings per share over the next ﬁve years.  We intend to maintain our predominantly regulated risk proﬁle with our market base businesses targeted to represent about 10% to 15% of our earnings. We target to grow our dividend in line with our earnings growth and the target payout ratio of 50% to 60%. We have a strong balance sheet and operating cash ﬂows underlying that plan and if we can do all of that right, we will deliver -- continue to deliver superior shareholder returns. With that, let me hand it back over to Susan.     We're wrapping up and we'll have time for Q&A at the end. Bottom line, I will tell you right now and of course, I can be totally objective saying this. I would rather be in our shoes at American Water than any other utility that I know. The reason is you've heard a lot of the story today. You've heard about our business. You've heard about our opportunities.  And we really like this chart a lot. When we talk about being a top leader in the utility sector, this is from 2013 to 2016. This doesn't go back to 2010 or 2011 or when we IPO'd. If you look from 2013 to 2016 and 2016 is estimated at consensus by the way. This is all from Bloomberg.  If you look at our EPS growth and how we compare to the UTY, our proxy companies that we have in our proxy, the Dow Jones Utility average or other water utilities, if you look at our dividend growth, we are top quartile, top of the top quartile, we are usually ﬁrst or second, based on which utilities are increasing their dividends at the time. Then you look at our total shareholder returns since 2013 through the end of 2016 with consensus and this is what you get.  Linda mentioned, too, though, the water quality issue. One of the things and I was talking to a couple of you at break and we were talking about the customer stuﬀ. And you said, sometimes it's hard for those of us in the business we do who do modeling and analysis to get excited about things like that. But I would tell you this.  That when you look at the companies who stumble, many of them have had a series of great quarters of ﬁnancial performance. What happens is something goes wrong with the culture. Something goes wrong with how they serve their customers. Something goes wrong with a product that is tainted.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   The fact of the matter is American Water, we're celebrating 130 years this year. 2016 is our 130th year anniversary. In fact, it was interesting. Tom Farley from the New York Stock Exchange spoke to us earlier. The New York Stock Exchange also began in 1886. And in 1887, American Water joined New York Stock Exchange.  We've been there that long. My point is this. We're not here to try to get great earnings for the four quarters of 2017. It would be nice and we hope that happens and we're working hard to do it. We're here to make sure we have strong, consistent predictable earnings for years. So that the people -- your clients, who have us in their portfolios, don't go to bed worried about what is happening with American Water stock or that you're going to see us on the headlines of a newspaper or that we're going to do something really stupid that doesn't ﬁt with who we are.  I thought about and our team said, every time you go to a meeting, there's -- everybody takes away diﬀerent things based on the things that are very important to you, or your clients. But we talked about if you can only take two or three things away from this meeting today. If you walk out of here. And you only remember a couple or three things, what we want those things to be?  Number one. And you've only heard it about 100 times in four hours. Industry-leading multi- decade growth. Walter talked about capital eﬃciency. We do have a couple of members here from the New Jersey BPU. And we would say in front of everybody. We are not out there searching for capital investment opportunities.  That diﬀerentiates us a bit from other utilities or other companies. We have lots and lots of investment we need to make for clean water, aﬀordable water, reliable water for years. It's in our best interest not just our customers. And our customers, regulators that every $1 we spend, not just O&Ms so we can put $7 dollars of capital for every O&M we save which is wonderful for customer bills.  But also that every $1 of capital we put in the ground, we saved as much money on that capital expenditure. We have regulators say what would incentivize you to do that? Well we have many, many years of investment we need to make. And we think the sooner the better on some of these failing infrastructure. Pipes, pumps, the things that we do to make sure that our water is the type of water that you don't mind your children, your babies, your grandparents drinking.  For us, this capital eﬃciency, being more eﬃcient with less is really a calling for us. Because we know we can keep this ﬁnancial strength, this ﬁnancial investment and still make sure that our customers are getting absolutely the best value of anybody they receive services from. It might sound pie-in-the-sky cheesy. But that's what we live by every day.  Because we know that our jobs in the water industry are bigger than jobs. If you don't believe that, remember Flint earlier in the year. The algae blooms in Lake Erie, or the Ohio River. The things that happen if you saw the USA, Mr. Fleischmann shared with me. I don't read USA Today everyday but yesterday, there was an incredible three-page article.  I think Steve said longest article he remembers being in the USA Today, about toxic water and small systems across the country because one of the things -- why is it important that you hear people like Radha or Kevin? Why is it important we talk about operations and what we're doing   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   for customers? Because here's the thing. While Flint did -- was about lead in pipes, it was also about the ability to be able to withstand and to be able to achieve higher water quality standards.  It means having the best trained people with the best tools to make sure that the water that goes to your home is safe. And that you have to worry about it. When we are here talking about technology tools and we're talking about training and development. And you're like, yes, yes, yes, get us to the ﬁnancial stuﬀ so we can run our models, which is really important.  You need to understand that for us, this is a long-term plan to make sure that you are able to have those ﬁnancials, not just for 2017 or 2018 or even 2021 but through 2025 and 2030. And that of all of the assets -- all of the investments that you have for your clients, that the one you worry about the least is American Water. That is what we want you to leave with.  Three takeaways: industry-leading growth; track record of executing our strategies, Walter mentioned that; and the diﬀerentiated strategy that I just talked about, which is the best people, trained the best with the best tools and innovation with customers that if the whole regulatory construct went away, they would say, I still want New Jersey American to be my provider of water because I trust them.  They are there when I need them. They give me what I need and I don't mind that my children are drinking their water every day. At the end of the day, that's who we are and that's what we stand for. With that, now is a time and by the way, how much -- how good is it that a company ﬁnishes early based on your agenda? Hardly ever happens. So what I like to do now is just open it up for questions for any of us. I will just direct the questions but any question you have about anything.  +++qanda"
"A couple of questions. First, just Scranton, I think I heard somebody say that it is expected to close by the end of the year. Is that still expectation? Just a facts check there.","Scranton is a very complex acquisition. It's one of our larger ones. A lot of series of issues.  You remember, it is -- it serves this -- Scranton Sewer Authority actually serves more than one city. There is those issues, it was under consent decree, there's a lot of issues. We're ﬁnalizing the last couple of issues. So hopefully could be by the end of the year, or early next year."
"Okay. Thanks. Bigger picture question. Susan, there's been a lot of talk lately about hybrid utility models. So talking about electrics buying water and water buying gas. And that sort of thing. You all seem like you would be in a really good position to do that, something like that, given   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   your scale and given your background. And so forth. Can you give us your view on the big picture on that model, whether or not it makes sense for American Water and why? And I'd also be interested to get Mark's opinion on this, especially if he's done any speciﬁc work on that topic with his team. Thanks.","I will start and then let Mark ﬁnish. Your point about background, for those that don't know, I spent 31 years in the electricity industry at Southern. Our CFO, Linda, spent 22 years at Southern California Edison, including ﬁve years as CFO. Our Senior VP of External Aﬀairs who is not here, actually grew up in the electricity industry.  And for us. And I don't speak for others. And others do what is best for their companies, for American Water our core competency is water, wastewater. And the one water cycle. People you heard like Kevin Kirwan, people like Walter, like Mark Strauss. So for us, we believe there's enough growth opportunity in water and wastewater. And we believe the things that we are good at are that. The growing core competency of customer care and our understanding of legislative regulatory priorities in the construct. So we, just like in our market-based businesses, we want to stay true to what we know our competencies are. And that is water. Mark, do you want to add to that?     I strongly disagree with Susan. No. For those of us who lived through the RWE days, as you might recall, RWE had the dream of being a multi-utility, remember their hand with the many ﬁngers. They were going to be in electricity and gas and water and wastewater. And how did that turn out? I'm expressing a personal opinion. As Susan said, other ﬁrms are left to their strategies.  We have so much to do in the water sector in the United States. I think our view, what we look at is, where are the other opportunities in the water sector. Geographic, the consolidation play that's needed, this country has huge needs in water. I mean water and wastewater, water sources, desal, reuse.  And this country is slowly awakening. Look, let's face it, friends. We have been a very blessed country on water supply. And we have taken it for granted. This country achieved things in last 100 years that, due to a lot of sacriﬁce by people for the last 150 years, we have taken it for granted.  Unless you have got a geyser in the middle of Main Street, people ignore deteriorating subterranean infrastructure. And those chickens are starting to come home to roost for us. As we look at this, yes we have taken a look at it. It just doesn't make any sense for our company. We see room to run, we see a lot of unmet need, we see a lot of customers that could beneﬁt from us participating in a better future for them. And that's where we're focused."
"Susan, Michael Lapides at Goldman. A bit on M&A as well. But staying within water.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Because I look at electric, if I look at gas over the last three to ﬁve years, there has actually been a bit of a heightened M&A trend. Companies using, especially those with strong balance sheets. Using those balance sheets debt as equity to make acquisitions of smaller players.  Among the public companies, water has not gotten involved in that. Across all of you, whether it's you, your peer that's somewhat similar in market cap, or many of the smaller publicly-traded water investor-owned utilities. I guess my question is one, how should we think about the multiples you are paying, when you are buying municipally-owned systems. And compare that to the current trading multiples of where some of the really small cap water utilities are? That's question one.  Question two is, given your balance sheet strength. And the thing that Linda didn't touch on is how much balance sheet capacity would you have, if you are willing to be BBB-plus or BBB? So you would still have a really strong balance sheet. And yet might free up even more capital. How do you think about whether that could give you an opportunity to roll up the sector even faster going forward. And maybe take on whether they're larger municipal acquisitions rather than the 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 customer ones, or even some of the publicly-traded comparables?","That's a great question, Michael. I will start. And Linda and Mark may want to jump in. We actually do look at if we had a major acquisition, how much our balance sheet could handle. What if it were stock, what if it were debt? Of course, if interest rates go up, it's a higher % of debt, it's not going to be quite as attractive. And I think you are already seeing a little bit of downward pressure on multiples.  We do look at everyone. But a couple of things. Number one, you have to have a willing seller. And a lot of times, when you have high multiples and you are only a willing seller if you have a multiple that is higher than the biggest multiple based thing for the past two years. And we have a really technical process -- Mark talked about, we actually have very disciplined ﬁnancials. But we have a last-ditch gut check. And it's called where is the stupid line?  Where is the line that if you think people are going to go, that was really stupid? We also want to have no regrets. In 5 to 10 years, are people going to look back and say, that was a strategic acquisition that looked expensive at the time. But wasn't? Or are they going to say, we're still paying for a bad decision?  We have very healthy debates among our executive team about all of that, at all times. Mark talked about our commercial development committee, that Mark and Linda and Walter are on. And our General Counsel, Michael Sgro, is on. And the states have those. And they come in and they debate. And they push each other and they stretch.  I say that to say, we're always open to look. But we don't think we have to do something that appears desperate, or that we overpay. And we also have models that look at long-term, not just at EPS accretion. You can get EPS accretion without value creation. We look at EPS, we look at ROEs in 5, 10, 15, 20 years.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We look at the impact, diluted or accretive on ROEs, not just on what it does for EPS. So we look at all of that. And at the end, we say, what is the level at which, if somebody was above this, we could say, good, they can have it. And I know that's not a speciﬁc answer. But Linda, do you or Mark want to add to that? Anything more detailed than what I said?     I think would add that in our corporate strategy and business development area. So what are the suite of opportunities that we have? How do we capitalize on those opportunities, in a way that ﬁts us from a strategic standpoint. And ﬁts us from a ﬁnancial standpoint. And which we would have no regrets. So those are the types of things that we look at. And we do that on a continuous basis, Michael."
"Maybe a bit of a follow-up. How should we think about what the multiples you are paying for municipal utilities. So the 10,000, 15,000, 20,000? Relative. And maybe that's at time of acquisition and then more normal run rate, relative to maybe where you trade?","It's hard to translate that directly across. But I will tell you that on balance for all of the vagaries of acquiring municipal systems, I think on balance, it's more value-add for our shareholder. And ultimately for the customer, because of the drivers. You're not looking -- we don't look at it as a multiple. We look at it as, think of a state where you have fair value legislation, right? You can get it all on rates.  You're basically, you can eliminate or really reduce what the premium is going to be. And you've got other mechanisms. Our primary measure is what is the rate of return going to be on the capital we are investing, not what's the multiple on the turn of the revenues type of a thing, because we are not -- typically, if you look upon it as buying a going concern, you're going to add in all those other factors. Municipalities don't think that way. And we usually tie it to bottoms-up modeling rather than take the revenue, give a multiple. And how much are we willing to pay?     And I don't think you've seen us think you've seen us pay $20,000 a customer either. Or $15,000. Some things you have to be careful about.  So take McKeesport, for example. Technically, when you look at retail connections, it looks like $10,000. But there's a lot of collection system with bulks, it's actually $22,000. So maybe sometimes when we do this, the calculation of how we get there. But we're actually extremely disciplined on that. And again, each system also it looks at. So what do you have to promise that you won't make rates go up more than, or is there a cap?  We put all of that in the systems. And I will tell you, the type of rigor we put into this. So about a month ago, we brought in one of the professors at Wharton who actually our modeling group   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   that works with Jim Gamble, came in and they are looking at new modeling techniques that they're going to be rolling out to Wall Street. And saying, we're ﬁnding that these are actually more predictive. So we're always looking at the modeling that we do. And actually working with Wharton and diﬀerent schools to say, how do we actually look at this diﬀerently, to make sure we're not -- that we're are looking at all the factors and that we can make smart decisions?  But to Mark's point, when you look at multiples and you start looking. And a lot of it depends on what's the balance sheet of the acquiree versus your balance sheet. We have a lot of opportunity. But then you look at who you are acquiring. And in the sector, there's a lot of space on a lot of those balance sheets. We also don't want to overpay. And even if you have fair market, overpaying even at fair market, you paying 40% above fair market, you still have to deal with those premiums that are leftover that you can't get in the rate base.  Growth for growth's sake is not what we are after. We are after disciplined growth that allows us to have this EPS growth. But also allows our ROEs to continue decreasing the lag between our allowed ROEs and what we are actually accomplishing. That we share with you. And again, the ability to say we're making smart decisions. You can call it a strategic acquisition, you can't do too many of those that are dilutive long-term."
Thank you.,"He asked us what time it was. And we told him how to build a watch. But that's what you get Michael, when you ask a question like that."
"Two questions. First, just on the long-term growth rate, the 7% to 10%. If you look at 2016 and 2017 guidance, you are around the lower end of that. And so, as we're thinking about this growth rate, are you thinking that you'll see an acceleration in the later period, to get back in the middle of that range as a midpoint? How should we think about using that growth rate?","When we say 7% to 10%, we believe that we will be in the middle of 7% to 10% long-term over the ﬁve years."
"Okay, is that maybe, that's the market-based businesses, with the headwinds maybe going away?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It's the puts and the takes. When you look at it, we are -- we do a ﬁnancial plan that is both stretch. But also a bit of conservatism. You heard Dan say, for example, we haven't built-in some of the things that he talked about. If there is a loosening of sequester, we didn't build that into some of the plan. Also on the reg side, we're staying 1% to 2% growth, in regulated acquisitions, which would be 30,000 to 60,000.  As you heard Walter and Linda say, we're monitoring. 2016 was a good year, the pipeline is very strong. If we go two or three years and see that there's almost a step change, you will see us come back next year, when we re-up the ﬁve-year and do an adjustment.  Right now, we're trying to do appropriate stretch. But also in conservatism. What we don't want to do is to overpromise. And right now, we are watching carefully what the market trends are. So if we do this, it could be each year, or if we see something mid-year that's a game changer, we would basically change and revise at that time."
"Okay. My other question is on the potential Trump infrastructure plan. You might have answered this, or talked about this at the beginning. But to the degree that they focus on water investments, have you had any discussions with the transition team about how they might look at investing? First of all, how focused are they on water infrastructure investment. And if they did it, how they would actually invest the money?","Yes. That's a really great question. In terms of working, earlier this year I actually co-chaired with Doug Peterson, the CEO of S&P Global, the Bipartisan Policy Center's infrastructure study, that actually had support from both Republicans and Democrats, that said it was transportation, water and wastewater were the focus areas. What was advocated was municipalities need to have the full optionality.  If they want to have private equity ﬁnancing and do it themselves, ﬁne. But for the ﬁrst time ever in P3s, we got into the report, or they can sell their assets in water and wastewater. That was because of the fact that American Water was part of the discussion.  So the Bipartisan Policy Center is working, some with the transition team. Also there are other avenues that we're working through. How the Trump, I think one of the most interesting things is they talk about the 82% tax credit. What they ﬁgured out is that, an example, the repatriation of proﬁts from overseas.  One of the things that actually was presented about three years ago as a bipartisan eﬀort, there were 25 Democrats and 25 Republicans in the House. And ﬁve Democrats and ﬁve Republicans in the Senate, that were looking at infrastructure fund, that what you would do were those companies who have proﬁts overseas could bring those back. And for example the 10% penalty that comes from repatriating proﬁts, if they brought $1 billion back, then the tax would be $100 million, that what the Trump administration has ﬁgured out that an 82% tax credit of that, that for $121 million invested in the infrastructure fund, that those companies could repatriate $1 billion worth of proﬁt. And rather than pay the taxes, actually have an investment in infrastructure fund.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   And through what we can gather from the administration is, that fund would not only be open for municipalities to leverage. But also with us. So an infrastructure fund that actually helped to get proﬁts back here. But then also would allow lower priced money for infrastructure, that will be open to all parties. And not just municipalities. We're very supportive of.  And I ﬁnd it fascinating, one thing that's interesting about the plan is, if you're doing tax credits for 82%, you're also, every time you put $1 into infrastructure, then labor is about 44% of every dollar that you spend. Those people making that money are also paying income taxes, at 28%. You're buying equipment and material that has sales taxes.  When you talk about a tax credit to actually spur an infrastructure fund, you're not only potentially getting the opportunity to repatriate proﬁts. But you're actually getting part of that back into the government in taxes through the taxes paid by labor and the sales taxes. If they're able. And again, this is one of very few areas in Washington that there is bipartisan support, if we can ﬁnd a model like that for infrastructure that gets bipartisan support, it wouldn't be quick, I don't think in the ﬁrst few months. But I think that could be something that can be very positive for all of us. Brian?"
"Following up on your comments. And Steve question. That ﬁrst slide where you talked about the impact of President Trump's administration, you referenced the possibility of American Water tapping into lower-cost ﬁnancing, as part of infrastructure opportunities. Can you go into a little more detail on how would that be realized mechanically over the next one or two years?","You can look at the state revolving funds in the states that allow, for example, Pennsylvania American, several of our subsidiaries are already in states where you have state revolving funds. Those funds. And it's a state decision, that the funding is from the federal government. But each state decides whether they will allow private utilities to be part of it. Most of our states do, some of them don't. I will tell you that we already, the way we look at it for the American Water Capital Corp, which is our ﬁnancing arm of American Water, we look at what those costs would be. And in some states where you see we do have some debt now that's actually at a state revolving fund.  So we see it operating probably pretty much like that, unless it's held at the federal level. And then we would see a process similar to that. But we would advocate for it to be state to state. So that the states could then determine how those monies are spent."
"Got you. One more follow-up question. On the same slide, you made reference to natural gas pipelines. And how some of the beneﬁts of the way the new administration might look at those pipelines could also aﬀect water. Clearly historically, there's been a tie between how those asset classes are treated. But could you spend a little more time talking about speciﬁcally what sort of mechanisms or adjustments might happen in the ﬁrst two years of the next administration?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","This is mainly for Keystone. So what I was saying is that one of the issues about -- the good news and the bad news about operating in the Appalachian basin, which is the only location that Keystone operates in is in the Utica and Marcellus as part of the Appalachian basin, is the big constraint with Appalachian basin is the takeaway capacity. It is the cheapest place to drill in the US for natural gas, they have a need for water. But what happened is they are very constrained with takeaway capacities. I think there's nine pipelines or takeaway pipelines that are under construction.     About 15 Bcf coming online of takeaway capacity in the Appalachian Basin to assist this problem. What I'm saying is that as there's more openness and support for building pipelines and takeaway capacities that opens up the Appalachian basin even further, that is very good for our Keystone subsidiary. Not necessarily in tax treatments, pipelines in general. It was more along those lines."
"My question is around the capital spending plan. So for the $5.9 billion for the regulated system investments, I was curious if you could give some color on how much is going for in-plant, how much is out of the plants, like in piping. And if you're investing in some technologies like smart metering. Can you touch on that?","Walter, do you want to answer that?     Pipelines, I'd say about 40% or 50% is in pipes and getting a quick recovery on that. The other is spread across all of the investment projects that we have, upgrading water and wastewater treatment plants. Typically the metering, we replace about 250,000 meters every year on average, on average costs $100, that can give you an idea of what our meter costs are."
"Then a follow-up, in terms of smart meters and just upgrading, does technological upgrades increase the life of these assets? We're saying they need to be replaced over time, would an investment in technology allow them to exist for a longer period of time?","We have diﬀerent replacement rates for meters in diﬀerent states. In New Jersey, it's 10 years, in some other states, it's 20 years. So what we're doing is making sure that as we move to AMI, we   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   have the right equipment on those meters. So we can naturally not have to replace them. But just leverage the AMI technologies."
Thank you.,"In fact, that's a great -- another diﬀerentiator in electric and water is this. On the electric side, we really didn't have states that say you have to change out your meters in X period of time, water we do. Because remember, in water meters, you have the physical water moving through the meters. So we actually are required state by state to replace them.  So with AMI, it probably will give us more ﬂexibility. And the interesting thing with Radha onboard is, okay, a lot of the electrics have already done AMI. \ A couple of diﬀerences with us, number one is, for water, we're at the point of technology where the costs have come down signiﬁcantly. And actually now there are meters that you can install as AMR. And then download over the airwave software that then they can be AMI compatible, at much cheaper prices than when the electrics were going through it. It's really phenomenal.  The other thing is, we, unlike electrics, aren't choosing one meter manufacturer. We started working with a company years ago to create what I call an international translator, that whether it's a Mueller meter or Neptune or Badger or whatever, that they can communicate with each other. And because we're the largest purchaser of water meters the country, people are playing along.  I'll tell you about two or three years ago, one of the big meter manufacturers said, you can't put the chip in our meter and we said, okay, we won't buy any meters from you anymore. And they changed their mind because we buy so many meters. So the ability to leverage those things with the new technology -- it's incredible since Radha came on is that we're looking at a lot of this technology investment. And still actually having the same or lower technology budget than we've had in the past.  So it's really very, very exciting where we are in that realm. And to have Radha who actually was behind and led the rollout of smart meters for SP&L. And a lot of their customer transformation, is exciting. And the artiﬁcial intelligence sounds way out there. But it's really just smart machines that reason, that can take this huge data. And basically give you value-added analytics. So we can be more responsive and more targeted. And not waste a lot of time.  Our goal is, every customer only has to talk to one person and it's ﬁrst call resolution. That is our goal. Because what frustrates people more than anything is getting transferred, having to call back, or having to wait. And somebody call you back. So we really think all of these tools will allow us to do that.  And also, if you've got problems with meters, or you've got leaks, it's not -- we don't make money oﬀ of water that is leaking into the ground. So the ability to stop these leaks. And you heard Walter, on average in this country, we lose 20% of treated water every day, at 20% a year,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   2 trillion gallons a year, that we've already gone to the expense of treating, that just leaks out. And that's non-revenue water.  So the ability to stop that, think about that, the impact of that. It's a far less, it's much more economical to do that than it is to invest in the technology. More economic to invest in the technology than it is to have those losses. What else? Yes, sir."
"I just had a follow-up to that question, actually. When you talk about leak detection sensors and the customer engagement platform spending, how much are you spending on programs like these annually? Are you working with third parties for the data analysis, or do you do that in- house? What's the thought process about that going forward? Then what's the ROI for spending on items like these?","So we don't actually calculate the ROI. What we're doing is looking at the eﬃciencies, the total technology. And what we're getting for it. We don't actually breakdown -- we might consider in the future, Linda, looking at the technology spend. We've just never really broken that down separately.  So but it is -- and it is lumpy. When we put the SAP system in 2012 and 2013, the big spend, now that we have got our back-oﬃce system in, I will tell you this. All the new technology spend that we're looking at in the future is customer facing. We have our SAP system in the background, we've got functionality there. Now we're looking at things like, how can you do those tools that help the front line folks be able to serve the customer better?  I will tell you. So I was up in North New Jersey with Kevin about two months ago. And there was a 63-year-old ﬁeld service rep. And we're rolling out smartphones that you can actually -- they can put in a new meter and immediately see if it's working on their smart phone. And he said this is one of the most -- I've worked here 31 years. And this is one of the most exciting things I've ever seen. So the ability to do that and to do it immediately. And to have the employees buy-in. And a smart phone, it's not that expensive when you buy it in bulk like we do.  So looking for applications that aren't new systems. So what's fascinating to me is, how we can get our technology budget to go down. And yet be so much higher tech. Also, I will tell you though, one thing we haven't talked about today that's really, really important.  The issue of water quality. The fact of the matter is, there are 50 million plus chemicals that are registered today. It took 33 years for the ﬁrst 30 million to ever be registered. 33 years. It took nine months for the last 10 million.  Every 2.6 seconds, a new substance is being synthesized from chemicals breaking down, including in waterways. So this issue of water quality -- and there are 1,400 microbes that can aﬀect drinking water. This issue around water and the thought that smaller systems with staﬀ of 10 or 15 or 20 people are going to be able to stay in front of this.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   That's why things like Kevin and Radha, they were talking about. And Doug, like having chips that measure water quality immediately, before you have a sample. And by the time you ﬁnd out, people have been drinking it for eight or nine hours. I think for us a big part of the technology investment that we're going to be making in the future doesn't look like it did in the past.  It's going to be things to ensure that the quality of water stays safe, because you talk about reliable and aﬀordable water, the way we look at, if the water is not -- if you don't have quality water and you have dangerous water, nothing else matters. It doesn't matter what other things we're doing, if the water we're serving isn't healthy for our customers.  So we have to make sure we remember those fundamentals. And we're making sure that we put those investments in things like that, that diﬀerentiate us. And ensure the water quality. I think that is going to be, personally, the biggest competitive advantage we have in acquiring systems in the future."
"Angie Storozynski, Macquarie. So I wanted to be a bit picky about 2017 guidance. So if you look at it, the guidance is in line -- largely in line with the range. But it's mostly market-based services that are growing. The growth on the regulated side is actually slow, about 4%, 4.5%.  Is it simply because those regulated acquisitions actually have an earnings drag, until you get a step up in rates? And if that's the case, are we expecting that the next, say two years, will have a subpar growth in regulated earnings? Because if you're showing that your rate base is actually growing at a 5% to 6% rate. And that seemingly the earnings growth on the regulated side actually lacks the rate base growth.","Linda, do you want to take that? That's a great question, that we've talked a lot about.     Thank you, Angie, for that question. When we look at the regulated acquisitions, we talked a bit today about the timeline, that it can take some time to get through the process, to where we have the full acquisition authorized in our rate base.  Well between the time that we close the deal and the time that it's authorized in rate base, we use ﬁnancial metrics, to where we would expect to have a positive contribution to earnings during that timeframe. Then you would hit the full hurdle rates, once you get through the full rate case process. And that's why we ﬁnance that during that period of time, with shorter-term debt, as well. But we would expect a positive contribution, not necessarily the full contribution from that asset right away.  We also -- when we look at the regulated business, depending on the timing of rate cases, things are going to move up and down on a year by year basis. And that's primarily why we get   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   a long-term compound annual growth rate. We are not saying earnings are going to grow 7% or 10% -- or 7% or in the middle of the range every single year, it's a range of 7% to 10% over that period, because of those types of issues.     And if you tend to have two or three of your bigger states have rate case outcomes in the same year, you're going to get a lump year outcome. And also, keep in mind that with the headwinds that we had this year in both military services as well as Keystone, that the market base did not grow at its normal rate this year. So you will see an acceleration, probably next year, especially given we think will be an increase in Keystone. And it will be accretive next year."
"I'd like to ask a couple questions. And I'll preface it by, I realize there's 1,000 variables. But you must have a way of thinking about this. The ﬁrst one, rather simplistically is, what does it cost to replace the water main the day before it breaks versus the day after it breaks?","It's 10 times more expensive to repair a pipe after it breaks, than to repair it before there is a break."
"The second one being, we know is that -- and this could -- you can even look back 10 years or out 10 years. But you must be -- how much faster are water mains breaking as the system gets older and older?","That's a great question, it depends on the pipe. Kevin, do you want to take that?     Sure (inaudible; microphone inaccessible)     This is not going to be a good weekend, by the way. Whenever you get freezing cold weather and then it's 60 degrees on Saturday, that is not good.     (inaudible; microphone inaccessible)      American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We actually have a chart we probably should start including in investor materials. We actually have a chart that's showing our investment. And shows that for the last two years we are on the downturn, in terms of main breaks, as we invested more money. It's a great chart."
"I appreciate that. But part of what I was asking is in the municipality that is not doing it as fast as you are doing it, how fast -- how much does is increase happening year-over-year, because presumably the more breaks they have, the more attractive the relationship with you becomes.","On average, in the United States, they are -- we say every 250 years. So it's really 0.4% of lines are being replaced nationally. And you heard Walter say our goal is 1%, which doesn't sound like a lot, one every 100 years. But it's 2.5 times better than the national average.  But to your point, one of the reasons the smaller and medium-sized systems, they get so distressed, because if your municipality -- and remember, these folks have so many priorities. There's schools, there's roads that need paving, there's community centers. And they've got pensions that are unfunded sometimes, pension liabilities.  They are sitting here and they say, okay, are we going to try to replace a pipe that's not really -- nobody is noticing, or wastewater pipes nobody's noticing, or am I going to build a park, or a school? Because -- or potholes, covering up potholes.  What is happening is a lot of this infrastructure was put in the ground before World War II and wastewater, a lot of the wastewater was right after World War II. It's now starting to fail. And it's a failure. And a huge amount of investment that's required. Add to that, typically as a private company, when we have -- for example, if we ever had a consent order, we might be given months to ﬁx it.  There are municipalities who have consent decrees, meaning they have violated wastewater discharges for 10, 15, 20 years. It's not been enforced as much in municipalities. When you see things like Flint and things happening, the EPA is really ramping up their enforcement of the regulations on everyone. And we think that could be a driver, that they are going to either have to invest as a municipality, or they need to ﬁnd other options."
"As just a quick follow-up to that, if the EPA is ramping that up, does it give you fodder for better conversations with the rate authorities?","We think that enforcement of regulations is good. We have a quality of water standard that is typically higher than even required in a lot of places. So increasing water standards, as you heard earlier today, are actually good for us.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"There was one reference in visuals to the combined sewer outﬂow, or outlet issue, which I think of Philadelphia. Enormously expensive. But hugely important to water quality. Are you dealing with, as it were, your fair share of CSO projects, or is that something, in view of the capital intensity, that you'd rather not be dealing with?","That is an interesting question. We've had a lot of discussions. I'll start. And then I think that Mr. Strauss may want to jump in.  For example, in Scranton, the CSO, which is combined, where you have combined stormwater and sewer, we're not looking at buying stormwater systems. Where you have combined, to the point and Pennsylvania just actually acknowledged this through regulation and legislation, also, that the moment wastewater touches stormwater, it's wastewater, which we think is an appropriate way to basically describe that.  We're looking at diﬀerent systems. We are not buying stormwater systems. Where however, there are systems that have the combined sewer and stormwater, we are looking entirely at the entire asset purchase, to determine if that's what we want to be involved with. Mark, do you want to add anything?     The CSOs and American Water's portfolio, wastewater systems, pre-Scranton, is a very limited amount of CSO. Most of it is segregated systems, where we have the wastewater, the storm sewer system is owned by the municipality.  However, to your question, CSOs, that has been an area of focus for enforcement by the EPA. And I think irregardless to the change of administration, that's going to be an issue that's going to continue, because you get these ﬂushes into rivers and waterways where you get a storm, they are typically areas that --older developed areas. And a lot of times, they have ﬁnancial stress as well.  And as you pointed out, it's enormously expensive, especially in a more urbanized area, to go around digging up streets. You're not out in the countryside. It is something that we are focused on. I think it has to do with our ability to deliver capital eﬃciently.  You remember Walter's discussion about capital eﬃciency. There's no pixie dust about this. It's not like anybody's going to come along and say, I can wave a wand and they're going to be separated. It's very intensive work. But there are strategies you can adopt, whether it's retention chambers and then metering to the plant, separating the lines is pretty expensive.  But there are things that can be done. But I guess for us, we do view it as an opportunity. But we're going to be very disciplined about it. We will only go after those opportunities where we think we can make a positive diﬀerence for the rate payer. If we're engaged, if we bought that   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   system, would that rate payer be better oﬀ 10 years down the road than if they were left on their own, or if somebody else acquires them? We're pretty rigorous about that testing.     And one small way we're going to pilot it too, is that our military bases, some of the commanding oﬃcers have said, you have water and wastewater for the military base, we'd like for you to take over stormwater. We believe that the legislation enabling privatization legislation allows us to do that. There's been some disagreements with some DoD lawyers. But that would be a great opportunity for us to test that, from a stormwater standpoint, on a much smaller scale. So we're very interested in doing that."
"And a not unrelated question, is there any happy takeaway from the debacle in West Virginia, in terms of your getting regulatory support for forensic work upstream of your intakes. And just trying to head oﬀ something like that?","Absolutely. The thing with West Virginia is that it's more, it's not as much regulatory as it was legislative. The fact is in West Virginia, there were no requirements for reporting for Freedom Industries, to report even to the state, DEP, what was stored in the facilities. That was remedied through legislation that now requires anyone who keeps chemicals, they have to report to the DEP. And we have access to those reports.  Another thing that happened, of course, is that Freedom Industries went bankrupt. I will tell you that another thing the state has done, is in 2015, they have passed more stringent tort reform, that unfortunately the lawsuits against us after the bankruptcy of Freedom Industries were ﬁled before the tort reform. And there is a regulatory issue in West Virginia that only aﬀects West Virginia American Water, that's not present in any of our other states, nor are the electrics and gas held to it, which is ambiguous to the point of being responsible for any interruption of service.  And we think that is an issue in West Virginia. It's very limited, it's not in any of our other states and it's only for private water in West Virginia. Those are some of the lessons learned that we need to deal with.  Anything else? Well you have our numbers, Mr. Vallejo and Melissa Schwarzell can get anything to us. I just want to close, ﬁrst of all, thank you for being here. I know this is a big commitment close to the holidays.

And it's more than a job, because what we do matters in communities and the people we serve.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We also understand that we're here because of the owners of our Company, who are shareholders. We don't want them to be surprised, we don't want them to worry in retirement. And we look at it to say, again, to the end of the day, we want to be the stock that you worry about the least, that's most predictable. And that you know where we're coming from. And that we stay true to our knitting.  If we ever have bad news, we will tell you, good news we will tell you. We want to make sure, we'll be measured in how we do it. And somewhat conservative. But we want to make sure that we are the Company that you can be proud to own. And that your clients can be proud to own.

I just wish you could get to know more of them and what they do everyday. And the dedication and commitment that they have to our customers. And we have story upon story of the things that they do for our customers that are extraordinary and out of the ordinary, because they just take their jobs not as working for the water company. But providing a critical health service. Thank you for being here, happy holidays. And be safe going home.
