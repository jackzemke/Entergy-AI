Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, team.","Hi, Durgesh."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So two questions for me. First, high level strategy question for you, Susan. So, obviously, your peer water utility announced merging with a gas utility in Pittsburgh. And I know historically you've said it and you sort of reiterated today that your plan is 1% to 2% growth coming from acquisition of small water and wastewater systems. I understand it. So I mean, I guess in light of the announcement from (inaudible) what I'm really asking you, simply put is, if there is a water -- there's a electric an gas system in your footprint, would you consider merging with a system like that? Where would that fall in your M&A strategy?","Thank you, Durgesh. And just the short answer is, no. We are -- at our core, we are a water and wastewater utility. Even though we have several executives who have a deep background in electric and gas, we know that, as a company, our core competencies, what we know best, what our employees know best, what is kind of second nature to us is water and wastewater and we believe that there are signiﬁcant opportunities in the US, not just -- we're not interested overseas either. We believe that the United States, the market for water and wastewater is where we should focus and we believe that we will have plenty of opportunities there."
"Excellent. Thank you. Then just going back to the quarter real quick, Linda, the $0.04 one-time charges, the settlement and the West Virginia, the tax reform charge, I appreciate that these are one-time items, not excluded from your adjusted EPS numbers. I guess, would it be fair to say that if you were to exclude those items, you'd be guiding to the top end of the $3 -- your EPS guidance range now, which is what like $3.27, $3.32?","Yeah, Durgesh, we are guiding to $3.27 to $3.32, and as you know, there's a lot of puts and takes every quarter and so we are comfortable guiding to that range, which is the upper portion of our prior range."
"Okay, awesome. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.","Thank you, Durgesh.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thank you. So I have actually two questions. So, I mean, you have had great results year-to-date, but if you look at some of the regulatory updates that you guys have provided us with, they should have been seemingly a drag against your original guidance, right? So, for instance, you had a delay in the implementation of conservation revenues in New York The New Jersey rate case, I mean, you told me how it compares versus what was embedded in guidance, but given that there is a refund of interim rates, I would argue that it was also slightly below expectations. The weather wasn't helpful. So what is the -- I know that there are lots of puts and takes, but what is -- what are the oﬀsets to all of the things that I've just mentioned?","Yeah. So, Angie, let me start with the New Jersey rate case. So we were authorized $40 million. We had interim rates of $75 million that we put into place. From an accounting perspective, what we do, we will put in interim rates is we continually assess our best estimate of the outcome and that's what we record on our books. And so we do not expect any material change in the fourth quarter associated with the New Jersey rate case. The diﬀerence between what we requested in that case and what the outcome was, was primarily driven by the change in ROE. We had requested 10.8% ROE and, as you know, we have 9.6%. We also requested the 54% equity ratio. And then the other changes were associated with changes in depreciation expense and O&M expense, which is typical.  And also, Angie, in terms of -- so we had a few headwinds, but if you look and some of the things we mentioned, we had some really positive this year. Linda mentioned that year-over- year on adjusted, we were $0.06 up in Regulated, we were $0.05 up in Market-Based, almost predominantly Homeowner Services, which is doing really well. So it was -- and then the parent was up $0.01 because of we've done some signiﬁcant reﬁnancing. So I look at it as just running our business well. I mean, we're trying to look at every lever and how can we be most eﬃcient in our operations and make every part of our business count.  So we do have the takes, but we also had several puts and those add up and to Linda's point, that's one reason that we're very conservative about what we do for non-GAAP is that, there is normal business puts and takes and sometimes they're up and sometimes they're down. And one of the beneﬁts we have with the diversity of state and our size and our geographic footprint is they tend to oﬀset each other, or they have at least today. So going through and we try to and hopefully what you all see is, we try to be very granular and transparent in these items in our slides and in our discussions, so you can see what oﬀset those items that you brought up."
"Okay, just one follow-up and that's on the Homeowner Services. So two things. You mentioned that the integration of Pivotal is actually favorable to your original plan. If you could actually provide a little bit more color here. And the additional partnerships with cities, this is more the traditional Homeowner Services, i.e., wastewater line warranty service, whatever you call it, we're not going into those additional businesses that Pivotal has delivered along with the acquisition?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. And I'll take the latter question and then Linda can answer the ﬁrst one. You're exactly right, though, these four partnerships were actually responses to RFPs that our legacy Homeowner Services organization has been working on for several months before we ever actually bought Pivotal. So these are predominantly the water and wastewater lines, the sewer lines. You're exactly correct.     Yeah. And on the integration, it is going very well. We had guided, as part of the acquisition, that we were tracking to be near breakeven this year with Pivotal and as a reminder, our EPS neutral comments incorporated consideration of the modest share dilution. So we are on track there. What we are seeing is that we're a bit favorable in the third quarter associated with our integration costs and that's primarily due to some timing as well as some items that we had originally thought were going to be expensed are being capitalized. And so there's a little bit of positive there as well."
"Great. Thank you, ladies. Thanks.","Thank you, Angie.  Operator  And the next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question."
"Hey, good morning you all. How are you doing?","Hey, Jonathan."
"Hey. So just wanted to clarify, in the remarks, you said that I guess despite whittling down I guess Keystone to just one business, you're still potentially evaluating the sale of water transfer. Is that correct?","What I mentioned was that, we are -- we believe water transfer is a good ongoing business and will allow us to decide whether in the future Keystone should remain part of our portfolio of   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Market-Based Businesses or not. Jonathan, whether you are going to keep a business longer term or whether you are considering other options for the business, it's always best to have that business operating very eﬀectively and that's what our focus has been right now."
"Okay. And then, I guess, can you just kind of describe what when Linda -- I mean, I guess, were your hands kind of tied from the accounting perspective that you had to take that writedown as opposed to maybe just exploring the entire sale of Keystone prior to taking an impairment charge that that was maybe the best and the most eﬃcient route?","Yeah. And, Jonathan, this is Linda. In terms of the impairment, we generally do our impairment testing in the November timeframe, but because of the operational issues and the negative earnings results in the third quarter, combined with our decision to narrow the scope of the business going forward, that triggered us to look at the long-term valuation and triggered the impairment analysis.     And that's regardless of what the strategic options are for the business. We would have to do that anyway."
"Okay. And then you mentioned about Q4 expense timing. Are you pulling forward expenses from '19, getting [ph] kind of a strong year-to-date results or is this like the shift of some expenses from earlier in '18 just into the fourth quarter instead?",It is the shift of expenses from the ﬁrst nine months of the year into the fourth quarter and we saw some of that shifts come in in the third quarter from the prior two quarters and then we have about $12 million that we expect has shifted from the beginning of the year into the fourth quarter.
"Okay. And then lastly, Walter, can you expand on the DSIC mechanism change in West Virginia, did the cap increase or just the type of qualifying CapEx change? What exactly is it there?","Yeah. What happened in New Jersey -- or in West Virginia was they expanded what was qualiﬁed to go into the DSIC program there in West Virginia, everything else remain the same. But it is going to start over again once the rate case is eﬀective in February of 2019.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Okay. And what's the cap in West Virginia, I don't recall? Do you know oﬀhand?","Yeah. Not oﬀhand. We will get back to you, Jonathan."
"Okay. I mean, I did see I guess that you can't ﬁle another West Virginia case until I think it's like May 2021. So I guess suﬃce it to say that capital allows for kind of a roughly three-year rate case cycle in the state. Is that fair?","Yeah, that's fair.     Hey, Jonathan, it's Ed. We'll get back to you shortly on that one, okay."
"Yeah. No, big deal. I mean, Walter's answer kind of covers what I need to know there, so. I appreciate it. A good quarter and let's (inaudible) and keep swinging, right, Susan.","Jonathan, I'd say what, the number four right. Undefeated. Good job. I'm not going to talk about (inaudible)"
