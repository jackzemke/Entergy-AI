Question,Answer
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thank you. So, ﬁrst, on '23 guidance I mean It's-- I guess it's a relief to all of us to see that your messaging to get to consensus expectations even with the increased basically equity needs that you're addressing in 2023. So, I mean is it basically that your front-end loading equity to ﬁnance CapEx that will materialize in the latter part of that Five Year plan, and as such It's not only that CapEx is backend loaded but it's also that there is some incremental dilution that sort of ways on those '23 results?","Well, good morning, Angie. A lot in your question there, and let me maybe just comment high- level, and then I'll have John jump in and talk a little bit more around our thinking around equity and the plan there. But recall from our, I guess really the last few years as we've talked about our equity needs and our expectation around that we've been signaling sort of mid-plan and we released that guidance probably two plus years ago. So, I think this '23 timing now that we're giving a little bit more insight into is consistent with our prior messaging.  The increase in the size of the equity that we now have in this plan. I think as we've highlighted, really has to do with the increased capital over the course of the ﬁve years. And Cheryl indicated that we're kind of stepping up to roughly a $2.9 billion investment per year over that ﬁve-year period. So there is more capital coming in throughout the entire ﬁve-year focus of the plan. And then we've also added a little bit of additional equity expectation here just to create some additional balance sheet capacity as we think about that going forward. The other important thing I would comment on around your opening comment around hitting expectations for '23.  I just want to underscore again, what we said in our prepared remarks around our regulatory approach to these inﬂationary costs, we have been very proactive in trying to get our hands around what we thought those impacts might be and we have worked very closely with regulators to try to build-in, in these existing cases, we're working on the coverage for those costs. And I think we've said something well over 75% of those expected costs in the near-term we have built-in these cases that were ramping up now. So, I think -- I'd say again just in summary, the equity plan is pretty much on-track with what we've said historically.  And the increasing capital is driving the bulk of that need of additional equity in the plan and then our proactive approach on regulatory is absolutely part of our ability to be conﬁdent about our expectations for '23. So John, anything to add on the equity piece?     Good morning, Angie. I would just add that, as we think about how we delineating the equity. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll issue or we expect to issue a signiﬁcant portion of the equity in 2023. As we think about the consequences of that based on how we trade, I would characterize the dilution associated with that is relatively modest. And then also we pointed out in our remarks whatever we don't Issue in 2023, we would expect to issue in the back end of our plan."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Good, okay. And then changing topics a little bit and I know it's not your core competence, but you are now a cash taxpayer. So you do have cash appetite I mean tax appetite I'm sorry. So why not developed or at least own some of those renewable power plants that you currently contract under the PPAs again as tax strategy as opposed to-- like a sure growth driver?","Yeah, I think it's a good question, Angie, but I think Cheryl hit on it and you did even in your remarks there we just don't view it as our core competency. There are folks, that are sort of in that business and we believe we have the opportunity to work closely with them to develop solutions and take advantage of those renewable sources that are out there without owning them. We've got enough to do and you even acknowledge it's not really a growth driver. We've got plenty to do on just our investment side to continue the growth. So we don't need it from that standpoint. Your observation around tax. I think it's also a good one but I would tell you we think we have the right strategy here to ﬁnance this plan and manage all of the elements of the requirements in that plan with what we've laid out here.  So while we are always interested in and it's been a quite a bit of time on tax planning and tax strategy, it just does not -- It just doesn't ﬁt our proﬁle."
"Okay. And last one really quickly. So you have had some big mini deals announced since the second quarter earnings call. I think we've all been concerned about some of those high proﬁle privatizations of wastewater system sort of falling through. So, are you seeing that there is any sort of systemic change to how municipalities look at sales of their water and wastewater systems or is it just, very much -- kind of system speciﬁc?","Yeah, Angie, let me just turn it to John and have him sort of weigh in on that question.     Yeah, Angie. I would say I'm glad you asked the question because our answer is, no. We haven't really seen a fundamental change in the landscape for making acquisitions. So, there's certainly been some noise out there around particular deals, but really nothing has changed. There is a huge number of systems out there many of which are under invested in our ripe for potential acquisition. And when we think about the footprint that we have, and the focus that we have, we continue to very much like our relative position there and regulated acquisitions will continue to be a key focus area for us.     Yeah, and I just would add to that simply that we work very hard In cultivating these opportunities to make sure we're developing the right solution for these communities. And, I think that's a big advantage for us.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
"Hey guys, good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
Couple quick ones here. If I recall correctly the HOS sale aid up a lot of your I think NOL carry forwards and you've been a cash taxpayer this year. Is it your expectation that you'll be subject to the minimum tax going-forward does this latest ﬁnancing plan kind of embed in ongoing assumption for that?,"Well the ﬁrst part of your statement is correct, yeah, the gain on the HOS transaction sort of advanced us to being a cash taxpayer. Still evaluating what the IRA means and you know the alternative minimum tax and ﬁnancial income greater in $1 billion are still lots to be sorted out in terms of what the ﬁnal rules are in the ﬁnal interpretation of those. So we're monitoring it closely. We've obviously modeled a variety of scenarios around it and I would just say In all those scenarios this plan adequately covers any exposure we think we might have there."
"Got it. Okay, perfect. And then, I think John may have touched on this a little bit but it looks like the amount of CapEx dollars allocated for regulated acquisitions the same as the prior plan. So slightly smaller overall proportion. Anything to sort of read into here is the opportunity set fairly ﬁxed, are you getting more selective just maybe a little bit of an elaboration on John's comments, please?","John, you want to take that?     Sure, Shar. I'd say the smaller proportionality is really just a function of the increase in the regulated our organic CapEx. I'd say the which has more visibility attached to it as you know than regulated acquisitions. So in no way are we kind of decreasing our thoughts around putting dollars to work on it regulated acquisitions. We continue to feel very good about that.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)      Yeah. I don't think we highlighted it really much on this call, but our pipeline remains in excess of $1.3 million connection opportunity. So still very very strong. There are lots of good work in that area."
"Got it. And then just last one from me is just the shape of that 7% to 9%. I mean obviously you guys -- you're executing on the regulatory front, you've got a good footprint there, some dilution, but I guess what else should we assume -- I guess as we're thinking about modeling and the extension? Where you sort of within that range as we're thinking about like the near- term versus the longer-term as we just thinking about the proﬁle of that shape?","Yeah. I think it's a good question, I'll just repeat what I've said several times now. And, I do think you can tie it back to the HOS sale, recall our discussion about a year-ago that when we sold that business and this transition to sort of full utility. The opportunity created by that sale would result in a ramp-up of the spend. So it takes us a while to get that spend fully deployed and get it fully in rates. So I'd say in the near term like you see a little bit in '22 and in our guidance for '23 which we think is quite strong there is, obviously a ramp-up still reﬂected there. And we've got the proceeds that will come in from the note on the HOS sale at the end of '26.  So again you think about that sort of working its way into the plan, I'd just say what we've laid out in '22 and '23 is reﬂective of that ramp-up. Our view continues to be this long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% we see that extending well into the future. And we just got to get through this sort of ramp-up period and you'll see that growth rate continue."
"Terriﬁc, thanks guys. We'll see in a couple weeks, appreciate it.",All right. Thanks Shar.  Operator  Your next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Hey thank you. First just going back to the your comments on the ﬁnancing specialty equity. I appreciate your commentary on the bulk of it potentially being in '23. I guess is it possible that when you assess the various equity options that you could potentially look to price that equity in 2022 but look to draw that down in 2023 just given market volatility?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"Yeah. I think market conditions certainly play into our decisions here around timing and ultimate size and the tool that we use. So that's obviously still in all of our discussions internally. John, anything you want to add to that?     No, that's right. And I'd say that, we're not expecting to issue in 2022 into, but obviously as Susan said everything is subject to market conditions."
Got it. And then at 7% to 9% EPS growth rate should we assume that it's now kind of basing oﬀ of '23 guidance or should we still use whether it's '21 or '22?,"Yeah, it's a good question obviously we get this question a lot and I'm conﬁdent, my answer will frustrate you. Our view is that it's a long-term growth rate. We would expect that 7% to 9% to be the guidance regardless of the period that you're looking at. Internally we actually don't really use a base year to do the math oﬀ of, our view is it's a long-term growth rate. I know in the past we have used sort of prior year actual your latest actual information to base oﬀ of but again our view would be it doesn't really matter. The long-term growth rate is really the driver."
"Got it. I thought I'd try. Then just one more I apologize. Maybe for Cheryl, I think the EPA maybe still at least this year may on track to put out some mandates related to the people PFOS and other product contaminant kind of the maximal levels. Just based on your operations and your jurisdictions, how would that given what could come out, how does that impact your CapEx or O&M strategy of that? Thanks.","Yeah, Insoo. Great question. We do anticipate that EPA is going to release those regulations later this year and because we don't know exactly where they're going to fall, it's a little hard to kind of put a speciﬁc dollar amount on it. But we have a really good handle on what we have across our system and what the needs will be depending on what those EPA regulations come out at and we're prepared to invest the capital needed to put treatment in place right away. We have gotten we found it to be a very quick process to design and get treatment online wherever we may need to.  So we know, what we've got out there, and we kind of know what to expect depending on what EPA comes out with. So we just have to wait and see. We don't want to spend more capital than we have to but we also want to make sure that we're meeting the regulations as quickly as possible and protecting our customers.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Got it, thank you.","Thanks, Insoo.  Operator  Next question comes from Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Hey good morning, team. How are you, guys? Congratulations. Hey, thank you guys, thank you, guys. Hey, I just wanted to follow up. I know there's a lot of questions about the growth rate. Just what's the base here is the starting point here? Are we talking about pre '23 at this point or are we rolling forward to '23 for the 7% and 9% outlook if we could just start there?","Well Julien, as I said to Insoo. We don't really look at it that way. Our view is a long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% is the answer. So our view is you can start within a year you want and you're going to get the same result."
"Okay, alright. Sorry. Yeah, I just wanted to just press a little bit. All right, and then if...",I appreciate that.
"A little bit that-- always checking here. If I can speak a little bit about the trajectory though. As you, think about the commentary and I heard you, the early response on equity dilution for '23. What does that say for '24 vis-a-vis within that range? Obviously, '23 being at the lower end of 7% to 9%. As you, think about rolling forward that dilution it seems like more so into '24, do you think that again the 7% to 9% is clinical back half weighted regardless, or whatever time period you want to use?","Yeah. I think John's comment about the impact of dilution is really the right one. Our view is that the dilution is pretty minimal from the issue that we're anticipating in '23. I think the real driver is   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   the ramp-up of the CapEx. We were just putting these dollars all to work. We've got the proceeds coming in again from HOS in '26, I think as we continue to see that ramp-up work its way through the plan, you'll start to see towards the back end of the plan more consistent growth rates."
"All right, excellent. No, fair enough. And then just lastly just to clarify some of the earlier conversation about the cash tax rate. So what are the planning assumptions reﬂected in the guidance here as you think about '22, '23 et cetera, just trying to baseline ourselves here if you can?","Well, I mean obviously we're a full cash taxpayer now. So this ﬁve-year plan reﬂects that. The comment earlier around what is IRA mean to us in terms of the alternative minimum tax. I mean again there is still many rules and deﬁnition still to be done around that, that I don't think any of us know exactly how it will work. But I would just reiterate what I said a minute ago we've modeled a variety of scenarios all of which ﬁt in this plan that we've laid out here."
"Excellent. Well, thank you so very much for the time. All the best. We'll speak to you soon.","Alright. Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland with JP Morgan. Please go ahead."
"Hi good morning. Thanks for the time today. Just starting on 2023 guidance the $0.25 to $0.29 cost inﬂation on interest rates with 75% of that covenant rates. I'm curious on the pension side, does that kind of baked-in your estimate of the current marks and so fair to think about you see market moves from here in the interest-rate backdrop as potential upside or downside versus this outlook just, curious what you've baked-in on the assumptions are?","Yeah, it's a good question. And as John said in prepared remarks obviously we'll measure at the end of the year and determine what our actual '23 expenses once we get to the end of the year. But how we've handled this from a regulatory perspective is for the most part what we have gotten achieved, and accomplished here is whatever the '23 expense ends up being that's what will get reﬂected in rates. So, we've lifted a little bit open-ended in the regulatory arena where we'll actually set it at the number once we know what the number is. And in other situations,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we've estimated what we think the impact will be based on year-to-date performance and expected performance for the balance of the year."
"Okay, understood. And I guess to tackle the other side on chemicals, fuel, power is that eﬀectively reasonable assumption in terms of rolling forward to '24 as well, if the current environment persists, or is there suﬃcient kind of incremental regulatory activity coming down the road here to mitigate even more of that in the '24?","Yeah. I think what we have accomplished so-far in the regulatory arena obviously will be in rates until we adjust rates again. And, I think we'll have continued opportunity in the regulatory arena to address these cost impacts in other jurisdictions. And again in some cases the ability to adjust for what the actual costs are in existing cases or an existing jurisdictions. Just depends on how we address that in each speciﬁc state. I think, again, the overall conclusion here is we've got the vast majority of these costs covered and should not really be a drag on our expectations going forward."
"Got it. That's very clear, and understood. And if I could just sneak in one more on '23. Is there any step-up that you expect on the revenue share related to the Homeowner Services transaction? I guess just curious in terms of walking year-over-year on the outside it looks like eﬀectively steady contributions less the post-closed adjustments in '22 is that the right way to be thinking about it?","Yeah. I think it's that's probably the right way to think about it. We're continuing in the jurisdictions, our states that don't have those agreements in place we're continuing to evaluate those opportunities. And working very closely with now the HOS ownership or leadership to see if opportunities exist. So, it's a very active part of our business plan."
"Great, thanks for the time today.","Yeah, thanks, Rich.  Operator  Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Hey, good morning team. Thanks, for squeezing me in here. Good morning, Susan. Just congrats by the way on the regulatory execution here year-to-date, you guys have done a phenomenal job and great outcomes. Just, on the acquisition side of things, can you update us on where you stand year-to-date? We're seeing targets I think this year, you're planning on hitting $500 million in acquisition. So could you just update us there and then I'll follow-up?","Sure, John, you want to handle that?     Yeah, sure. Good morning, Durgesh. We're on track. I think we've closed about 65,000 customers today with another kind of ﬁve -- so 1,000 customers to come. I would say that on a dollar basis as we disclosed in our slides, our expected closings for the year will be in the neighborhood of $350 million which, and as you know we target about $300 million to $400 million a year, we've said over ﬁve years $1.5 billion to $2 billion on a run-rate basis."
"Yeah, $350 million for this year, okay. And then maybe I was just, I don't want to front run your equity process. But just anything John you can share in terms of what are you looking for in terms of valuation or price ranges for this equity? I understand a signiﬁcant portion is expected to land next year. Any additional color that you can share with us there?","No, Durgesh, I wouldn't say we think of it in terms of speciﬁc price range obviously will be very cognizant of market conditions. But I'd say we just -- we think of it more in terms of what we've messaged in the past which is the equity from a mid-plan perspective and as we approach 2023 here that is mid-plan relative to our historical messaging."
"Got it. Thanks for the time guys, appreciate it.","Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Yeah hi, good morning, thank you.",Good morning.
"Hi, Susan. So just on the couple questions related to the equity and balance sheet. So in the 2023 guidance, are you kind of assuming that it's kind of averaged roughly over the year or beginning of the year just kind of, how are you incorporating that into the '23 guidance?","John, do you want to take that?     Sure. Yeah, I think Steve that's a fair way to characterize '23 for modeling purposes. I'd say, I think that whereas, we used a signiﬁcant portion of our equity. I think you can think of that is north of $1 billion of issuance in '23 and as you know we'll have to kind of ﬁnd the right windows. But I think mid-year, is a reasonable way to think about it."
Okay.,"Steve, let me just add quickly, Steve. I think that, as John said these market conditions, of course, will drive this but we are still looking at how best to do it. You've heard us talk in the past about It's likely going to be in sort of a single issue or a block, but we do need to evaluate all those options available to us. So that's still in the works."
"Okay, makes sense. And then maybe just on the balance sheet could you give more color on the comment about getting adding some of this for balance sheet, cushion [ph] ﬂexibility, and what's the thinking there today versus in the past? Is it just a-- the volatility of markets? Is it what you see in terms of kind of acquisition pipeline or regulated investment pipeline or is it tax related? Just why now for the additional balance sheet capacity not a year ago or two years ago?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   John, do you want to take that?     Sure. Yeah, I'd say, Steve just as we've thought about our metrics over time we're in a very strong credit position. But we do look at our ramping up of capital spend both on the organic side as well as on the acquisition side. And so we just think it's healthy for us to have some cushion there. I would say just also as we're thinking about the cadence of our equity issuance where we'll do, much of in 2023 but then waiting until the back end of our plan for another issuance as we've thought about it. There's just a natural consequence of creating some cushion for ourselves.     Yeah, Steve, I'd simply add to that. I think that we've talked a lot about the payout ratio on the dividend and obviously we narrowed the dividend range a little bit here. We just feel the need to continue to really push ourselves on the ability to advance this capital spending as Cheryl talked about the replacement cycle. We just don't want to ﬁnd ourselves in a situation where we have to put some constraints on that, on the investment side. So, I think if we can create a little capacity here it just helps us have that level of certainty around our ability to continue to accelerate. These market conditions obviously are quite volatile and it just doesn't hurt in this environment to have a little bit of extra cushion there. So, I think that's really honestly the driver."
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Your next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead."
"Yeah, thank you.",Morning.
"Good morning. I was wondering, if your guidance on the operating cash ﬂows for '23 to '27, that ramp-up versus the prior plan if there's anything sort of non-operating in there or adjustments   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   or if that's really the growth of the business?","It really is the growth of the business Gregg. Again we just, we feel very good about how we are how the investment is being rolled-out, cash ﬂows from operations, and the ability to get good solid timely regulatory solutions.     Yeah, Greg, I'd just add to that a signiﬁcant portion is just the roll forward. So if you think about what's rolling oﬀ in 2022 versus what's being added and 2027 there is a pretty because of the ramp-up, the ramp-up in CapEx through those years that diﬀerential is reasonably signiﬁcant. And then in the interim years because of our ramp, we're recovering additional depreciation deferred tax contribution to cash ﬂows but a lot of it's the roll-forward by itself."
