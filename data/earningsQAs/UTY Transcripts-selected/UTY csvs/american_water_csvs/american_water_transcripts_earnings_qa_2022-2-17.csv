Question,Answer
"Thank you. And ﬁrst of all, I do deﬁnitely wish Walter the best of luck and hope she is following. And Susan, deﬁnitely good luck in this new role and an important one that.","Thank you, and we certainly appreciate that."
"First question, I think just on the ﬁnancial side, I just wanted to verify that in your ﬁve-year plan, I think at the Analyst Day, you had talked about I think $1.1 billion of equity needs. I just wanted to conﬁrm that that is still the right number that we should be thinking of and that's the case. And related to that, any thoughts around types of equity issuances, whether it's trade or potential for equity units or converse?","Yeah. Insoo, we didn't speciﬁcally call that out today in the call, but you're absolutely right. The $1.1 billion of equity that we laid out in November is still our current plan, and it is still -- we're still anticipating it in, what I've always sort of characterized as sort of the middle of this ﬁve years. So you can expect it now in the '23, '24 time frame I think. We are still looking at options. We certainly think there are lots of tools in place to be able to execute eﬀectively here, the size of the issue just over a $1 billion starts to get interesting in terms of size, I think we could easily   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   do that in a single issue, but we want to make sure that we thought through how best to sort of time the issue with the spend. So we may look at sort of staging that over a period of time, again roughly sort of in that middle of the ﬁve years as I said. So, no change in the total, no change in the timing, still need to ﬁgure out exactly the ﬁnal strategy on how we'll issue it. But I think that the sort of basics are unchanged."
"Got it. That makes sense. And then just on the CFO process of ﬁnding the permanent CFO, are you looking both internally or is it mostly external? And any type of proﬁle that you're looking for, whether it's someone with experience in the utilities industry or what not? Just any thoughts you have there so far.","Yeah. It's a good question. We have engaged Korn Ferry to help us with the search. We do expect the search to move very quickly. And this is a highly regulated business as we've talked about, so certainly individuals that have utility experience have been in or around the industry will certainly be high on our list of potential candidates."
Got it. Thank you so much.,Thank you.  Operator  The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Good morning, team. Susan, congrats on your appointment and also my best wishes for Walter.","Good morning, Durgesh. Thank you. Appreciate it."
"Okay. So just one thing I wanted to clarify. I think Aaron touched on this, but just on the 7% to 9% EPS growth rate starting point, did you guys eﬀectively move that from '20 to 2021 now?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   It is anchored oﬀ of our normalized '21 and our practice here typically has been to anchor it oﬀ of the most recent actual results. So, as we were aﬃrming guidance here and talking about long-term plans, we are anchoring oﬀ of '21."
"Okay. Excellent. And then I think Susan, you also touched this in your remarks but, and I hear you on the strategy being the same, anything big picture that you would do diﬀerently? And I know you've been part and parcel of the strategy, but just any thoughts there.","No. We think the strategy is quite strong. We obviously made some changes when we came out in November with the plan we laid out in November and we're absolutely committed to that plan. We think it is the right plan and as I said at the outset and I think Cheryl demonstrated in her remarks, we're very conﬁdent in our ability to execute on this plan."
"Excellent. Okay. Thank you for that, Susan. And just one last follow-up if I may and I'll jump back into queue. Anything -- so how you're feeling about this New Jersey rate case that you just ﬁled? Anything for investors to watch on? What are the drivers? Anything speciﬁcally that we should be focused on as this case progresses?","Yeah, I'll let Cheryl comment in a second, but certainly it's a large case for us. We've got a lot of investment since the last case, believe it or not and that case I think was just two years ago. So, it's a very important case, large jurisdiction for us. We think we can be and have been very eﬀective in the New Jersey jurisdiction. So we would expect sort of typical issues in this case, but we're very optimistic about the case we have ﬁled and our ability to work through it eﬀectively. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that?     No, Susan. I think really, as you said, the main drivers are the amount of capital that we've invested in the system and it's a pretty standard case for us, strong team ﬁling the case. And I will just go through the process, as we have in the past and it is important for us, but we feel like we've ﬁled a really strong case with great investments."
Okay. Thank you both for taking my questions. Appreciate it.,"Thanks, Durgesh.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead."
"Thank you, and Susan, congratulations.","Thank you, Angie."
"I just wanted to follow up on the equity. So I understand that you have plenty of liquidity right now and that you're trying to match that incremental funding with the spend. But I mean, you could consider an equity forward. There's maybe a way to also monetize some of the smaller, less core assets to avoid the equity. Could you comment on either of those, just to get this equity overhang out of the way?","Yeah. It's a good question, Angie. And I didn't speciﬁcally mention this in response to Insoo's question. But certainly equity forward is on the list of options for us. We have executed some strategic transactions. We covered that in our remarks here today with the exit of HOS in New York and Michigan. Those are all aimed at essentially creating equity, creating proceeds for us to be able to invest that lowers the amount of equity we have to do in the marketplace. Obviously, those things were considered in the plan that we laid out in November and are contemplated in the $1.1 billion.  We'll continue to do those evaluations to see if there are other things we should be doing. At our current position though, we think this is the right set of assets for us to be invested in and the right jurisdictions. I think the plan as we have laid out again supports the need for that equity in the middle of the plan and as you've heard me say many times, while I know there's an anticipation for us to issue and the overhang that goes with that, I don't want to prematurely issue it and sort of carry that, the dilution associated with it, unless we've got investments to match it. So we absolutely have it timed in the plan that we think is appropriate. We'll continue to look at options on how best to do it and any adjustments we would make to that plan will certainly make sure we communicate that, but I don't anticipate any dramatic changes at this point."
"Okay. And then secondly, on any sort of inﬂationary pressures that you are seeing on the regulated side and then how, if at all, that could actually help you with any municipal M&A because I'm assuming that those municipally owned systems also face the same pressures and that might exacerbate their need for funding. So if you could comment on these.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Yeah. I'll let Cheryl weigh in here on the impact potentially to municipal. Largely though on the inﬂation side, we are active in the regulatory process. So we'll be hopefully current in reﬂecting cost impacts to the business through the regulatory process, obviously it impacts our customers. So we do our best to maintain or hold those cost impacts down. We've been very successful in the supply chain side over the course of the year and certainly going into the future to be able to hold those cost increases down. And we think again, we've done so pretty successfully, so any real impacts ultimately to us or the customers should be mitigated.  On the municipal side and is it a driver for them to potentially push them over the edge to want to privatize, I think it's a good question. I think we'll see some reaction to that. We'll see some -- we'll certainly have conversations with some of these municipals on those additional pressures. I don't know that we've seen any real direct impacts yet or any sort of change in the dialogue yet, but I'll ask Cheryl to comment on if what her thoughts are around that topic.     Yeah. Angie, I think it's just one more thing that piles on to those municipal systems that just kind of adds to the load that they're feeling right now. The regulatory environment is absolutely signiﬁcant for putting pressure on those municipal systems, to try to ﬁnd a better solution than operating their own systems. And I think this inﬂation piece and also the availability of pipe and chemicals and things like that can absolutely just add more pressure. But Susan is right in that we haven't seen a big push yet as a result directly of that, but anticipated adding to the load."
"Okay. And if I may Susan, I know you said that you're sticking with the strategy that you've announced well back in -- that you announced back in October or November. Now -- but taking a step back given the recent pullback and valuations of other water utilities yours as well, unfortunately, do you actually think that there is that you could create some value through any larger strategic transactions involving public water utilities?","Well, Angie, that's a diﬃcult question to answer here. I'm just going to say what I said at the outset. We're very conﬁdent in this plan. We have a long track record of execution. We have continued to prepare for this plan and prepare for execution against this plan and that's what we're intending to do. We are always looking and thinking about the strategy and how it evolved. We have plenty of work to do with this plan and we're going to continue to execute against it."
"Okay. Thank you, and congrats, again.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thanks, Angie.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning. All my best to Walter here and congratulations, Susan. Appreciate the opportunity to connect.","Thanks, Julien."
"So, perhaps to kickoﬀ here -- absolutely look forward to it. So, if I can, I think most of (inaudible) on Chester, just to come back to this conversation, I know that you all have indicated your relative conﬁdence. Where does that stand as far as your involvement in that process and your continued conﬁdence therein?","Yeah. It's great question, Julien, obviously lot continuing to go on that particular system, and I'm going to ask Cheryl actually to comment on what our current thinking there is, which by the way has not changed much, but Cheryl?     Yeah. It really hasn't changed Julien. We believe we bid on the system on the RFP and came in with the highest bid and it's really up to the receiver to decide what is the best thing for that community and we believe that the very strong bid puts us in a good spot to be able to close that deal."
"Fair enough. Excellent. And Susan, maybe if I get to strategically or I mean I know the last couple questions kind of put it out there, but any new ﬁngerprint that you're looking at in terms of a revised strategy [ph] or process. I know you covered to the top of the remarks here and in Q&A on M&A, but really, what I was thinking about is diﬀerent states, geographies you're looking at entering to, I know that there's a variety of diﬀerent legislative eﬀorts that you highlighted in your prepared remarks earlier, but as you think about putting your ﬁngerprints on the company here, and any revising non-state entry, et cetera or exit for that matter.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. Julien, I wouldn't say revised, I mean, I think our plan has been and always will be to continue to survey the landscape. We like the states that we're in now and you saw again us make some moves here to sort of reﬁne our footprint to make sure we're in the jurisdictions that we think are most eﬀective for us and we certainly think that's where we are now. We will continue as we always have to continue to evaluate other jurisdictions, both in terms of regulatory climate and legislative climate and the ability to enter a state in a material way.  We haven't changed our metrics around that, what we expect to be able to accumulate in a particular jurisdiction. We got to see ourselves to in our view at least 50,000 customers within a ﬁve-year period, that hasn't changed. But we are constantly looking at those -- at all those options. We're constantly evaluating the landscape in each of the other states that we don't currently operate in just to make sure that the current footprint is the one that is most eﬀective for us. So it's an ongoing process and it has not changed."
