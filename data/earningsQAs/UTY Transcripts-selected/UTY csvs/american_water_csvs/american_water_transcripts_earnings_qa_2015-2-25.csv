Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, guys.","Hi, James."
"Hi, there. Could you give us a bit more color on acquisitions of wastewater systems and roughly how many you anticipate for the next year or two years?","Well, this is Walter. I'll take that question. It's one of our strategic focus areas is growing on the wastewater side and we've been in discussions with a number of municipalities on just that, acquiring the wastewater systems. And you can see from some of the acquisitions we've done over the last year that it's really taken hold.  We're going to continue to have those discussions primarily at the state level. The state teams are focused on having those discussions and convincing the municipality that there is a beneﬁt to becoming part of American Water, and we've been pretty successful there. But it is a key focus area for us and we're going to continue to have those discussions in the hopes of acquiring the systems."
"So, just to get a sense, number-wise, do you see it roughly coming along at the same pace? Do you see an acceleration? I'm just trying to – from a modeling perspective, trying to get a sense of how many you'd see going forward.","Well, so far – I mean, we're adding about two-thirds wastewater and one-third water..."
Yeah.,"...which just shows, I think, the opportunity that we have within the marketplace that wastewater is a prime opportunity for us to continue to grow. So we think it'd be continuing on in that way, maybe half to two-thirds on the wastewater side. But it's hard to give numbers at this point.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
"Sure. Okay. Thank you very much for that. And then my second question, to get a bigger picture, on the 7% to 10% EPS range, how do you see over the next few years and, well, particularly maybe on 2015? Where do you see things shaping up, a little bit closer to the higher end or lower end?","As always, we give our guidance range to be the $2.55 to $2.65."
Fair enough. Okay. Just had to ask.,But that was a really nice try.
"Sorry. Congratulations again, guys. Thanks a lot.  Operator  Our next question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.",
Hi. Good morning.,"Hi, Brian."
Just a general quick question. Some of the other utilities out there that have reported this quarter have made a few comments on bonus depreciation. I don't think I heard any comments from you guys on that regard. But just any color you could give on how we should think about that for you guys going forward?,"Yeah, Brian. This is Linda. Remember, we are in a net operating loss position. So we are currently evaluating the bonus deprecation deduction for 2014 and its impact on each date as well as the   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   overall NOL utilization of the company. And we have until September of 2015 to make the ﬁnal decision on that."
Okay. Great. I guess we'll take a look at that point and what you decide to do. Thanks. Appreciate it.,"Thank you.     Thanks, Brian. Operator, are there any other questions? If not, I can go to closing.  Operator  At this time, I see no further questions.     Okay. Well, just in closing, I just want to recognize and pay tribute to our outgoing Investor Relations VP, Ed Vallejo. Ed has headed up our IR function since our IPO back in 2008, and I think he is the very best in the entire utility industry. Those same leadership skills, ﬁnancial acumen, customer focus and knowledge and experience led us to promote him to his new position of VP of Financial Strategy, Planning and Decision Support. In his new role, Ed will have all of the state and division ﬁnance directors reporting to him, as well as overall responsibility for ﬁnancial strategy and planning, and he will lead our newly formed Revenue Analytics Group.  Despite this big new job, he has continued in the IR VP role to help us through the transition. Just to remind you of what has taken place in Ed's tenure, check out the total shareholder return in the market cap charts on the slide that you see. As you can see, we're very proud of what Ed has done, only to be eclipsed by what he is going to do for us in his new role. Thanks, Ed. We're happy you're part of our team. And he did not know I was going to do this. So you should see his slides right now.  So, with that, thanks everybody for participating. We appreciate it.
