Question,Answer
"Hi, thanks, good morning. So ﬁrst question, are there any changes to your equity issuance plans both in terms of the $1.1 billion magnitude and timing in the middle of the ﬁve-year range?","Good morning. No, expected changes to that plan."
"Great. And then my second question, given the current inﬂationary environment are muni is more willing to sell their utilities, are you seeing any of that or potential opportunities to accelerate some tuck-ins.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We certainly think that is going to contribute to issues that municipals will face. We haven't seen any speciﬁc opportunities pop up because of that, but we do know that those are factors that will weigh heavily on some of these communities and their analysis and assessment of their opportunity to sell to American Water and Cheryl anything to add from your perspective on that.     No, not really. Susan, as you said we haven't seen anybody speciﬁcally come forward related to that, but we do know those pressures are very real and we're able to manage them because of our size and scope, where a lot of the municipals are going to struggle with that.     Right."
Right. Thanks so much.,"Thanks, Rebecca.  Operator  Thank you. Next question comes from Ryan Greenwald of Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, everyone, congratulations.","Good morning Ryan, thank you."
So I appreciate the color around the O&M timing. Can you guys just talk a bit more about how the quarter shook out relative to your expectations. Any other particular considerations that are making you guys kind of hold guidance in place after what appears to be a pretty strong quarter to start the year here.,"Well Ryan, I think relative to expectations this quarter was right on target as we said in the call, we did have a couple of timing items not terribly material, but really what drove the quarter was   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   revenue associated with all the regulatory proceedings that we've been in the process of executing. And if you recall, the largest piece of that is the Pennsylvania rate increase that was eﬀective January 28 of 2021. So this year of course reﬂects a full quarter's worth of revenues associated with that increase. And obviously that was a big driver year-over-year for the quarter. So, again the quarter for us was a very good one, but it reﬂected full execution on our plan and really met our expectations. And as we said, our expectations for the year remain the same. We're very conﬁdent about our ability to deliver on the plan we have laid out for 2022."
"Excellent. And then can you guys just provide an update on Chester from your vantage point where things are in the process, timeline, resolution, overall conviction levels to close the transaction.","Yeah. Not a whole lot to add. Not much new from our side on that, but I'll let Cheryl make a couple of comments there.     Yeah, it's still obviously kind of held up in the courts. If you will, I think I don't anticipate seeing anything probably it's possible this year, but it's going to be months out for sure."
Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.,"Thanks, Ryan.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Please go ahead."
"Hey guys, it's actually James for Shar. Good morning.",Good morning.
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   So I guess just want to build up the prior question, it looks like the customer connections for the year are little ahead of target. Just more broadly, are you seeing increasing competition for some of these many acquisitions.","I'd say generally, yes in certain of our jurisdictions. We have seen certainly more competition here in the Northeast. We continue to believe that we are the preferred provider and should be. We have the scale and the scope necessary to address many of the issues that these municipals face and we have the expertise that we've demonstrated in a number of transactions throughout our service territories that really proves that in fact we are the best provider in all of these situations. So certainly more competition, but we remain very conﬁdent in our ability to deliver the needed services for some of these communities that need help."
"Excellent. And I guess just building on the prior one as well, just on the supply chain side as we think about O&M for the rest of the year, anything that you've seen in the ﬁrst quarter that gives you caution one way or the other or anything that we should think about as we look at the rest of the year.","Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, there is still lots of impacts being felt throughout the economy and we certainly are not immune to that although I would say we're in a better position than most. Just given our size and scale and our ability to sort of mass purchase product that we need. There are some supply chain bottlenecks I'd say around certain items that we use, but we've actually seen a bit of an improvement in the supply in some of those critical items. We've seen price increases, but we've actually seen the rate of those increases start to slow down a bit, which is a positive sign. And again just given our size and scale, we've certainly been able to manage through that so far. And we'll continue to focus on all things we can do to help mitigate those impacts and ultimately the impacts to customers."
"Excellent, thanks a lot. And so, congrats on the new hires. Thanks.","Great, thank you so much.  Operator  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Next question will be from Gregg Orrill from USB. Please go ahead."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yeah. Thank you. I was wondering if you could put into context, sort of the backlog of rate cases that you have right now relative to your sort of 7% to 9% earnings growth target, is it when you think about Pennsylvania and California and what's already outstanding. Do you think that I could take you above trend or is that kind of what we're expecting or is there even sort of momentum that's continuing to build there.","Yeah, it's a good question. I would just tell you that our current regulatory schedule or activity is really according to our plan. We have signaled I think for some time that you can expect us to be in the regulatory arena regularly and certainly in our larger states every two to three years we would expect to be in for general rate increases every two to three years. And I think that's reﬂective also of just the level of capital spending, as you know we have increased our spend trajectory in this last plan update we did in November. So, that just again underscores our approach to regulatory recovery and the cycle in which we will execute that. I think it's also important to note that we have very eﬀective mechanisms in many of our jurisdictions and I think we're somewhere in the 65% range or so of our spend gets recovered through those mechanisms, would certainly helps on the regulatory lag side from an earnings perspective and helps the customer I think sort of better plan for rate increases coming their way.  So we take advantage of all of those things and use those as eﬀectively as we can to execute on the strategy now. Long answer to your question, short answer is, it is according to the plan and we've continued to execute according to that plan."
