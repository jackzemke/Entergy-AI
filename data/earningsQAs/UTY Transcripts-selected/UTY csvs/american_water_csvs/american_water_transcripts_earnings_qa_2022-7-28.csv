Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning and thank you for the time today. Maybe starting with inﬂation and your guidance reaﬃrmation. Could you frame a little bit of the QH inﬂation risk relative to the 6% to 8% impact year-to-date. I guess, in particular, is there any reason the headwind could be ratable and then, given you had the highest beneﬁt in one each that oﬀset. How do you think about oﬀsets over the balance of the year?","Good morning, Rich. Yeah, let me make a couple of comments and certainly have John weigh in here. I think we made it hopefully pretty clear in our prepared remarks. First of all that we aﬃrmed guidance for the year. So as we think about expectations for 2022, we're quite conﬁdent our ability to hit the targets we've established for 2022. We did indicate that we continue to see some pressure and headwinds around particularly chemical costs and energy costs. We also highlighted that we are working diligently in the regulatory environment to ensure on a go forward basis that we have those costs addressed and as Cheryl, pointed out a number of our cases do have forward looking test year, so we're hopeful that we can limit any exposure here really 2022.  The other comment that we made and you obviously rightly pointed out, the HOS gain that was recorded which again those sorts of transactions are not terribly uncommon when you have a transaction of the size we had last year when we sold HOS just ﬁnal working capital true-ups and I would say they are ﬁnal, we don't expect anymore activity related to that transaction. That was a beneﬁt to the ﬁrst half of the year and that certainly helped us oﬀset some of those cost increases.  But I'd also say it's not uncommon for an organization of our size as John remarked to have pluses and minuses throughout the course of the year and our focus on cost management, our focus on how we operate, how we are focused on eﬃciency, we will continue to have the levers that we can pull to oﬀset exposure that we may see in the second half of the year. So that's our plan. And again, I'll just say it again, we aﬃrmed our guidance for 2022, we fully expect to hit those targets for the year."
"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Got it. I appreciate the color there. I guess just turning to this topic, but on a macro level with the commentary around CapEx, just curious what you're seeing on that front. Is there, your potential for even the dollar spend to go up, given inﬂationary factors or I guess on the other hand, less pipe replacement to occur under the current budgeted CapEx. Just curious how you thinking about that into the budget update.","Yeah. And Cheryl can weigh in here too from an operating standpoint, but we don't see any change at all in our plans in terms of the amount of work we're doing. We may see some cost increases there on pipe. But I would tell you again our supply chain folks have done a tremendous job both managing the availability of supply and the cost increases we've experienced, they really have been fairly modest on those types of commodities. And again, we don't expect any change in our plans to invest. Cheryl, anything to add there.     Yes. I would just say that we've always got hundreds of projects pretty much ready to go that we know, need to be done across our systems. And so, we have some ﬂexibility and how quickly we move those projects forward, but at this point, we've been able to manage through any supply chain delays and any cost increases and still get the work that's been prioritized done and continue to to do that we think through the years coming so. No real concerns there, just being ﬂexible and how we approach those projects."
Got it. That makes sense. And just a ﬁnal (inaudible) you talked about potential impacts. are you able to quantify the potential headwind in 2023?,"No. Not at this time. Obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, we do need to get to the end of the year. We'll do the re-measurement there and we'll see where we are. But again, our focus would be to use all of the tools at our disposal to manage those types of increases. I mentioned in my remarks around regulatory approaches. We've got trackers in two states already. So that will mitigate it there, and two of our largest states by the way. And we're continuing to focus on regulatory solutions and all the cases we have currently on ﬁle to address that speciﬁc cost. So, we're optimistic. We'll be able to manage through whatever increases we may or may not see there."
Understood. Thank you for the time today.,"Thanks, Rich.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Operator  Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Hey, thank you. My ﬁrst question going back to, I guess, thinking about the 2022 guidance a little bit given the year-to-date results. I think on slide 10, you said that second half of 2022 EPS will be lower compared to 2H 2021. If I take the last four quarters worth of EPS, it gets to kind of I guess the midpoint of where 2022 guidance would be, so then if the 2H 2022 is going to be lower, is that implying that at least in the range you're trending towards the bottom half of the range?","I don't think you should assume that. What we tried to point out on slide 10 is simply the reality of our earnings proﬁle, we're pointing out that in the prior year. You would have had results from New York. We just didn't want folks to miss that, as you think about what your expectations are for each of the remaining two quarters. And then obviously, you've talked about inﬂation here in our the headwinds we may experience. And again, our strategy is to try to oﬀset those impacts. What we've continued to say as we've aﬃrmed our guidance for 2022 and we're very conﬁdent in our ability to hit that."
"Okay. Got it. I should take that in addition to the other commentary on demand rates and inﬂation too. I guess (inaudible). Okay. Now, that makes a lot of sense. The second question. Last month the EPA put out new advisories for PFS another (inaudible) chemicals. I know it's a lot of this is more state-based, some of the states have mandated somehow their own recommendations and (inaudible), you guys have had your targets as well, just based on the new advisories any thoughts on your operations on the PFS and other chemical levels, whether that translates into CapEx opportunities or in other expenses. Thanks.","Yeah. It's a good question, Insoo. Obviously, it's something that we're very focused on and I'll let Cheryl comment on how we see this latest news.     Yeah. Thanks, Susan. What EPA put out recently were health advisories. And there is no regulatory requirement for us to test or to meet any certain levels with those health advisories. Those advisories were extremely low, in our opinion, below the detection limit of the methods to test for PFS compounds. And so we're anxiously waiting to see what EPA comes back out with as far as a real regulatory limit. But we have tested all across our footprint, we know where we stand. And we have already started looking at what capital projects would be necessary going forward, and any regulations in states other than where we're at today will mean future capital investments.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)"
Got it. That's good color. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Insoo.  Operator  Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead."
Thank you. Just one comment on 2022. I remember in the past used to say that weather can have about $0.07 positive or negative swings for the year. So I'm just wondering if this is still the case and I see that your clients of water conservation and at least parts of New Jersey and I'm just wondering if that could potentially cap this earnings beneﬁt.,"Yeah. Good morning, Angie. I'll let Cheryl comment a minute about what speciﬁcally happening in New Jersey. We haven't really seen to date through June much of a weather impact. We're all I think across the country, sort of sweating this quarter. So we'll see what it does to results here in this third quarter. We probably moved away from that sort of quantiﬁcation. I think what we've historically done there, so we'll just need to wait and see what impact does have on demand in this quarter and Cheryl, you want to talk speciﬁcally about what's going on in New Jersey?     Yeah. We've got two areas in New Jersey where we've seen peak usage rise to the level that we feel it's important that we start to encourage or speciﬁcally ask our customers to conserve to water only on alternating days, put steps like that in place. So that we can kind of shave oﬀ those peaks and that we can serve our customers continuously without any kinds of dips in pressure or anything like that. So we have seen usage spiking and that's why you're seeing those conservation messages come through."
Okay. Changing topics. And I know it's really new. But we see this proposed the minimum eﬀective tax rate 15% at least overnight that it seems that it might pass. Could you tell us how you think it's going to impact your earnings projections. If anything else or cash ﬂows.,"Yeah. Sure. It's a good question. And obviously we need to kind of dust oﬀ analysis that has been done around this topic, again and as you said, it's sort of back in the new. And I think as   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we've talked about this in the past, it really is probably an impact on cash ﬂow primarily, ultimately any impacts to eﬀective tax rates gets worked through the customer bills. So I would say it's probably cash ﬂow. And I think we will again just need to look at our analysis that we did at the time. I don't recall it being terribly material, but we'll just need to dusted oﬀ and see if there is anything there to report."
"And just my last question on municipal M&A. I appreciate all the comments. Susan you had in your prepared remarks, but is there any more if you can share about this one. I wouldn't say an word, because it's an exclusivity period for confer negotiations went to your competitor. I mean we have little to no insight into what terms you proposed versus Aqua Pennsylvania. But I mean is it as simple as the highest price wins or do you have some other competitive advantages that about the location of the service territory. What is it that you might not be winning these contracts despite such a big balance sheet. No contracts there.","Well. Yeah. Sure. I'm obviously not going to comment on any details here. I would simply say it's never that simple. I think it's important to go back to the comments that John made in his prepared remarks that we've got a pipeline at 1.3, we just closed New York, we talked about the acquisition in West Virginia. We just announced yesterday, we have plenty to do in this space. There is plenty to do and we are doing a lot. So we take every opportunity seriously and we approach every one with the same rigor, the same metrics, the same approach to beneﬁts that can be provided to communities. And we put our best foot forward and then we move on. And that's probably all I have to say about that. Again, we've got lots of great opportunities here."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Angie.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Gaugler with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, everyone.",Morning.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)
"On slide 15, Cheryl mentioned in Illinois, the low-income assistance plans now in place. Just wondering, do you have them in most or all of the states you operate in?","Yes, Michael. We have low income assistance programs all across our footprint. But we're also looking at how we can expand those, or how we can make those more accessible to additional customers. We realize there just some customers out there that no matter how aﬀordable our bills are there going to struggle to be able to do that. So we're also working at the federal level trying to get as much support for a federal assistance program, the light what program has been hugely popular and helpful for our customers across our footprint in the states where they've implemented that. So we're going to continue to try to work at the federal level to get more federal funding as well as some of those local or more utility based programs."
So just to be clear Illinois was the last one in terms of adopting this type of legislation in your system.,"Well, Michael, this is a separate piece of legislation. I wouldn't say that there is legislation in every state. We have our own program, our help to others program that all of our states participate in all across our footprint. So our customers have had some access to low-income assistance for years now."
Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.,"Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, team. John, congratulations on your new role. Pleasure to connect.","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Thanks very much, Ryan."
Absolutely. I appreciate the update. Just a follow-up brief on the pension comments. You guys had previously disclosed the 90% loss through mid-May. What was the pension asset performance through June the 30th?,"I don't know, Ryan. I mean I don't think it's something we have got at our ﬁngertips. I don't know what you can divine from the Q on that. Yeah, we don't have anything out there, Ryan to answer that speciﬁcally."
"Understood. Is it fair to extrapolate the 9 million pension expense from the PA rate case for the balance of the company, assuming PA like a 20% allocation.",No.
Any color on the best way to kind of think about that.,"Well, I think that's a diﬃcult approach. Those are estimated costs as of a set of analysis we did for the rate case. I think the answer really to the question is, you really just have to wait until we get to the end of the year and we see really what the impact is going to be going forward. And I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks that, we are working diligently in many of these open cases to address these costs.  As Cheryl highlighted several of these jurisdictions have forward looking test years, and we have worked hard to either include these costs or estimates of these costs in those rate cases or we have proposals on the docket to be able to address go forward exposures. And to the extent we don't cover those cost timely enough in rate cases, we will continue to focus on ways to mitigate those impacts through other cost management eﬀorts other things.  So I don't think you can really draw any broad conclusions based on what you've seen to date, either in terms of market performance or even in our own ﬁlings. I think you really just got to wait until we have more insight into expectations at the end of the year and then we'll certainly tell you how we think about it. But I'd also tell you again remind you that John commented in his remarks, we've aﬃrmed our long-term guidance here. So as we think about this going   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   forward, we're certainly conﬁdent in our ability to manage the cost, both from a just a straight cost management standpoint and regulatory solutions."
"Understood. And then maybe just lastly, the Pennsylvania governors move earlier this month to reduce the corporate tax rate. Any initial thoughts on potential impact for you guys in PA there and how this could play into the dynamics.","I don't really have anything to say about that at the moment. Again, we'd be considering those types of impacts in this current case. So nothing really to comment on there."
Fair enough. I will leave it there. Thank you for all the time.,"Thanks, Ryan.  Operator  Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead."
Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. But other one on pension. You talked about the quarter method. What's the size of the quarter that you use.,"Well, I think the sort of standard approach is a 10%."
"And that's across that's, generally across the company. That's okay.",Right. We had just a single plant. Yeah.
Okay. Appreciate it.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity),"All right. Thanks, Gregg.  Operator  The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.
