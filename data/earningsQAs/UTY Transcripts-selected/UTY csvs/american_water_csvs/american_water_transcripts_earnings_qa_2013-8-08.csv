Question,Answer
"I see in June the EPA released another study indicating that the US will acquire about $400 billion in clean water infrastructure -- I think it was next 15 years or so -- but I guess if I look back those dollars are rarely spent. Do you see any changes in federal or state policy, either on the policy front or the enforcement front, to actually require action going forward on either the clean or the wastewater side?","Kevin, I think, frankly, it's enforcement actions being taken largely through consent decreases on the wastewater side that are really starting to create some challenges and tension for a lot of municipalities. On the water side, the drinking water side, probably a little less so. There isn't a driving issue like arsenic was a few years ago that's mandating investment, although probably the next one that has attracted some attention is the chrome 6 issue, which is one that we've really got our hands around already. So again, it's this notion of -- that infrastructure is out of sight out of mind the level of investment is trailing. That's why you see the average investment cycle of 250 years really going up to 350 years whereas we as a Company are about 125. It's an issue that's attracting attention, but I don't think there's a solution. Well, there's not necessarily a solution that a lot of municipalities are yet facing up to and that solution is really you've got to bring private capital in because the federal money is just not going to be there."
"I guess I saw a couple weeks ago like San Antonio, I guess the EPA forced San Antonio to spend around $1.2 billion given they were -- they didn't scale up their systems to population growth so they're viewing waste waters, I guess just raw waste into the water. So are you seeing that as the most actionable vehicle of growth given the EPA is actually ﬁning those systems?","Yes, the wastewater site is the one that is more susceptible to enforcement and you've got -- gosh, I can't -- I saw recently the number of cities that are under enforcement action. I don't remember the number but whether it's Kansas City, which is a large metropolitan area, or a smaller city like Chattanooga, Tennessee they've got multi $100 million enforcement actions. The challenge will be how strongly does the EPA enforce the timing of it. Do they give them   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   slack so that instead of it needing to be done in the next ﬁve years, oh well, we'll give you seven or 10? That's where we've seen slippage in the past.  I would say one of the things Sandy brought to light was the risk when you have increased volatility of weather and the risk of ﬂooding and the like, whether it be from storm surge or rain or what have you, is the amount of untreated or only partially treated wastewater that got dumped, and that is, I think, a risk that is starting to attract a lot more attention. Just with Sandy it was over 11 billion gallons of raw sewage that was dumped and so that's a broader-base challenge but it puts a focus on the issue of adequate wastewater treatment and doing the right things relative to storm water. So I'm hopeful that the EPA will keep the pressure up to ensure that we as a country are doing the right things. I think it's important that environmental groups and others help support that."
Thanks. Actually I have an obnoxious question for slide 23 just because I know somebody's going to ask me this question later.,How obnoxious?
"Is your 7% to 10% -- is it right to think about your 7% to 10% EPS growth rate being anchored to 2012, or if I'm looking at 2014 should I re-anchor it to the midpoint of 2013?","Yes, we've always talked about it as long-term growth rate and so that's the anchoring in 2012. I know every year we get pushed about, well, so is it oﬀ the new base and we're trying to say, look, 7% to 10% is the long-term growth rate and yes, we're anchoring it oﬀ 2012, even though our range is above that and, of course, we'll provide you a range for 2014 as we get -- probably in the December session."
"Okay. And then is this chart to scale, because if I look at -- if I apply a 10% growth rate to the $1.99 I get $2.19 and that's kind of close to the midpoint of this year's guidance not at the bottom. So am I just not understanding the chart or is it just not to scale?","Hey, Kevin, it's Ed. Yes, it should be up to scale so let me know when you have that service that sees if it is to scale if it doesn't work out or not, but on our side it is."
American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Okay. Great. Thank you.,"I always get nervous because we've got both engineers and ﬁnancial players and whether it's something they put it on logarithmic paper or what I always get a little nervous. Just kidding, Kevin.  Operator  Ryan Connors, Janney Montgomery Scott."
"So I wanted to get some thoughts on the regulatory side and we're coming oﬀ of the recent NARUC summer meetings, I'm sure you had folks there and you got some brieﬁngs, Jeﬀ. Anything jumping out at you in terms of the evolution of the regulatory environment in water, either positive or negative and either speciﬁc to any mechanism in a speciﬁc state or just the terms of the overall tone?","I guess the ones -- a couple that I'd just touch on. We are getting increased understanding and recognition about the issue of declining use. I think this is one where the industry was slow on the up take but is rapidly trying to move this forward. So frankly, there hadn't been much of anything done up until really probably the last three years or so, except in California where there's an overall policy mandate. So I think that's on the positive side.  I think on the risk side is, okay, so what does -- where do returns go and how successful are we in helping people understand that when you have artiﬁcially held down risk-free rates that that doesn't necessarily change the cost of equity and I think we've seen what's probably best described as mixed results. There are some states that have gone fairly low. I think the majority of our states have approached that with a more reasoned and tempered response in thinking about what that cost of -- what's an appropriate cost of equity. I think the two things that we keep a real ear on are the issue of degree of rate change so that we don't push that frontier too hard, yet at the same time we have great reception to the investment of capital. And so as we've talked to regulators about the chart that Susan has talked to you all about how we've shifted how much rate increases are capital versus O&M base that's something that they perceive as positive. I think those are the issue of declining use and now, frankly, you're starting to hear a lot of electrics say, oh, we no longer have growth and so they're starting to scramble on that issue."
"How do you see that evolving, Jeﬀ? Will it be -- is the talk of a California-style ram based decoupling, or are there other approaches that you see prevailing?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   I think each state has to approach this on the basis of its own regulatory background and philosophy. There are some that they look at the California ram mechanism and they wonder if it's too complex for them, is there a diﬀerent way do it, is there a way we can build it in the base rates? What is it we're trying to protect against? Is it all changes in consumption, or is it just the intrinsic on-going reduction in use per customer so what is it that we normalize at? So I think we'll see and we are seeing states take a number of diﬀerent approaches. I think the one that most states move to most readily is, okay, let's take into account what you've seen over the last set of years -- ﬁve years, eight years, whatever it might be -- and build that into your future and let's try to step and then we negotiate how far forward do we step to get the billing determinants, if you will, the denominator right.  I think automatic adjustment mechanisms create some nervousness of regulators unless they come out of that mechanism. For example, Florida has a number of mechanisms, California has a number of mechanisms and New York has a number of mechanisms that has just been part of their regulatory psyche. Other states a fuel and power adjustment clause, and on the water side maybe an electric energy supply clause or something like that. That may be about all they're comfortable with so I don't know how many states will adopt an automatic mechanism as opposed to recognizing the pressing nature but do it in a diﬀerent way. Susan, do you have anything to add?     I think consistent with what Jeﬀ said, we take very seriously our responsibility on water eﬃciency and so we are proactively working with all of our states in terms of how we can promote water eﬃciency and to address the kind of usage through, as Jeﬀ has said, either decoupling tight mechanisms, looking at revenue adjustment for future test years, looking at performance incentives for some of the water eﬃciency programs, so we're really looking at lots of diﬀerent options to address the same issue. And also on the key elements coming from NARUC and looking at some of the commentary, as well as hearing from some of the people there, the commitment of state regulators to the replacement of aging infrastructure may be as strong as it's ever been. The recognition that this is something we have to address and that if we begin to address it today that it will be far better than waiting until we have more severe problems in terms of main breaks, leaks and the economic impact of that. So I think that we've seen increasing and growing commitment to that and as Jeﬀ said, what that means to us is how do we ﬁnd a way to promote that investment while also controlling price increases to the customers and that is through our control of O&M so that any, or most the majority of price increases will be for investment and -- the CapEx investment and not O&M expense.     One of the things that I think that all that says is -- and of course, we may have bias but if I was going to focus on communities that have the greatest potential for growth and expansion because they're going to be able to provide service to customers and not have main breaks, et cetera, I'd look to those communities that are -- have provided service by privately-held companies that are regulated. Because Susan's exactly right, we're seeing recognition of that on the regulatory side, unfortunately not in all communities but in a number of communities your a politician elected today that's an out of sight out of mind investment, it's a little harder to make or a little easier to set aside and not necessarily keep up with that infrastructure. I think there are some cities, which -- and I commend. I'll commend Chicago for what they're trying to do and   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Philadelphia for what they're trying to do in terms of their green cities initiative. I don't mean solely them, I think New York also is there and there are others that are there. But boy, there is a whole host of that 50,000 communities, or individual utilities that that's not necessarily getting done.  Operator  Heike Doerr, Robert W. Baird."
"First oﬀ, thank you for the added details in your earnings material, I know it's high eﬀort, it's much appreciated by all of us.","We try to listen to you all, Heike."
"We like to keep you busy, Jeﬀ.",You're succeeding.
Can you share with us what ROE was stipulated in the settlement that's pending in West Virginia?,"Well, yes, sort of. What happened is that the party submits as part of their testimony a basis for the cost of service that's been agreed to. It is a black box settlement so there isn't a formal ROE. What we have submitted and what -- and I'm trying to remember which party it is that joined us with that --Consumer Advocate submitted -- we submitted a cost of service and the Consumer Advocate did that the ROE is at 9.9% whereas the staﬀ has submitted a cost of service that uses a 9.75%. They get to the same revenue requirement, so it gets to the same rate levels, they just go about it in a diﬀerent way. So I think it's --"
Understood.,"American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   We've [inaudible] 9.9%, but it's in that range."
Okay. Can you give us an update on where you are on portfolio optimization? Are there still states you're weighing whether or not it makes sense to be in and where on the contract operations side are we on that process?,"Well, on a regulated side, as we've said before, the lions' share of any optimization has been done. We will remain open to looking at whether it's interstate or intrastate opportunities. I can't tell you that there's a state -- we're not in the process of saying there's a state we want to exit. We're comfortable with what we've got but we will always look at opportunities to optimize that. On the contract operations side, by and large most of it has been accomplished, moving us into a set of contracts that we can operate in a much more proﬁtable way, starting to shift the way that we're thinking -- we're looking at how that business expands and being very speciﬁc and focused about what we won't go back into. We had to work -- our people did a heck of a job in extracting ourselves out of some contracts and arrangements that just were not proﬁtable and the last thing we'll do is go back into those."
"Okay, that's helpful. How should we think about your CapEx budget and this Monterey Peninsula water supply project? Will that project -- I know it's spread over a longer time period, will it just push you up within that band, or may there be some years that you'll need to spend above that $1 billion we've been talking about at the top end?","Heike, this is Susan. The expenditures for those projects are included in our forecast for -- we this year have said we will spend about $950 million in CapEx. We are looking and there is a range you saw based on some things that haven't been decided yet; the size of the plant, how we're going to approach I believe it's 6.4 million gallons per day versus 9.6 million and 6.4 million would have bigger groundwater replenishment. So we're really working through right now what that will be based on some of the ﬁnal decisions on that project, but we anticipate those will be rolled into our CapEx guidance for each year.  Operator  Jonathan Reeder, Wells Fargo."
"Following up on Heike's question there a little bit. So on a going forward basis is $950 million, is that going to be the bottom end of the range or can we get above the $1 billion, especially when I guess you're looking at the rate cases that are driven more on the CapEx side than the O&M side. Do you have room to get more aggressive with the CapEx budget?   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)","Jonathan, I guess -- the answer I'm going to give you is we're certainly looking at the level of CapEx given what we think our future expenditure level will be that we can put in and maintain the kind of rate levels that we think we can sell with our commissioners and customers. We'll talk more about that in December in terms of what that really looks like, but is there a potential for an $800 million -- the $800 million to $1 billion that we've used for the last couple years to shift over the next ﬁve years? The answer to that is yes. What it shift -- what it might shift to and how much it shifts, if it shifts at all, we'll talk more about it in December.  Right now we've got a plan that, as Susan said, has California included in it. Remember, one of the things that's happening is we've been spending about $100 million a year on BT. That disappears this year so there's $100 million there that was going to that project which now is going to be available to go into hard infrastructure on the regulated side so that's still at the current -- at the same current level. But we are -- we're still not spending for a 100-year replacement cycle, for example, and that's our goal, to get to a 100-year replacement cycle because that's really the outer limit of what we think the life of most of these systems are.     And there's a lot of things we look at, Jonathan, on this. Part of it is, again, not just the ﬂat amount but what does that mean in terms of our equity needs. We've gone on the record that we do not anticipate issuing equity under normal business operations for the foreseeable future so we run a lot of scenario now. We also are looking, for example to Jeﬀ's point, of next year not having to be key expenditures. What does that mean in terms of our distribution system infrastructure charge, which reduces regulatory lag? This year about 39% of our CapEx will be [inaudible] just as a matter of the DQ rolling oﬀ, which isn't eligible, that% could go up next year. When we run the analysis of the overall target we look at a lot of factors, including both the reg side and the market [inaudible]."
"Okay, then I guess as we are looking out our cash ﬂows continue to improve if CapEx doesn't meaningfully increase, what's the balance you're looking at between, I guess, equity -- appropriate equity ratio at the consolidated level, dividend increases, redeploying the cash, everything like that?","Well, you kind of gave what the basket of opportunities are. We are clearly not going to weaken our cap structure, but as we've talked about before we don't necessarily see an over riding need to strengthen it necessarily either. So the 44% equity that we're at today will by nature go up a bit, but we've got room to issue debt to the extent that our total CapEx or other expenditures, for example the kinds of acquisitions like the one we're doing in Virginia that's a little larger, more of those, so we've got head room to do that. If you are poking around at so is there a stock buy back on the horizon, those are things -- we do not have stock buy back planned at this stage. Those are things that are an ongoing part of the business. We're focused on the right amount of capital ﬁrst to invest in the business and that's a function of both what   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   we can aﬀord through rate making process and the amount of free cash ﬂow that we have in head room on the debt side so I kind of leave it there. We'll give you more color about -- of a forward look at the ﬁve years as we hit December.     And that's December 17th, analyst day."
"Okay, and, yes, Jeﬀ, you're right. And then I guess last question, maybe more for Susan. As we look at the operating expenses and everything, why weren't production costs maybe down a little more than what they were given the large decrease in customer demand?","Most of the -- most of our biggest expenses in production is in energy and chemicals and we did see a decrease in both of those. Chemicals we did have in some areas a little bit of an increase due to just some of the operations but they were consistent. Production cost decreases were relatively consistent with the sales decrease. Remember, on the revenue the $15.8 million make up in the revenue we only showed $8.6 million on the slide because that netted out to $7.2 million from 2012 from the California retro, so in terms of anything else on the production."
Okay. So you're saying the production costs were down in line with the decreased customer demand as you would have expected?,"They were down in line, mostly energy chemicals. Chemicals may not have gone down as much on a straight-line correlation because we did have some chemical increased costs in a few areas, but energy was and chemicals were down and those are the two predominant components of those expenses.  Operator  Spencer Joyce, Hilliard Lyons."
I'll also thank you for the additional slide color out there this morning.,Good.   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)
"Two hopefully pretty concise questions for you. One, on the New Jersey desic [ph] that we had go into eﬀect in July how often should we look for reups on that? Is it going to be a little bump every three months like PA, or maybe semi-annually like the isserus [ph] in Missouri? How often can we look for a bump there?","That's a great question and I'm glad you asked. The regulations say we can ﬁle up to twice a year in New Jersey for the desic. Some of you may have noticed there was some earlier material that said we ﬁled for $6.3 million and I just noted that have annualized increase of $4 million. Because of the way that the regulation was worded it appeared that we could go in and so we had anticipated doing seven months on our ﬁrst ﬁling, ﬁve months on our second. The staﬀ really -- and rate counsel really preferred that we do six and six so that accounts for diﬀerence in six, three and the four, but rather than being aﬀective August the 1st it was eﬀective July the 1st. So short answer, it's twice a year, up to twice in 12 month, and we have further guidance that the preference is every six months."
"Okay, fantastic. Second other question, totally switching gears. Congrats on the Nashville and Houston awards there on the market base side. What's the roll out time on those, how soon can we -- or should we be expecting some material revenue impact from those?","Well, Nashville, we've got go through the con -- the formal contract and so that can take 30, 60 days, something like that so it takes a little while and then we have to put together the plan with the city because in that instance this is an exclusive arrangement and it will go on their bill. It won't be until close to the end of the year before it could get rolled out.  On Houston, frankly, I think that's already out there. We are starting to take customers into it, we've had advertisements and releases that have gone out and it's hit the newspapers in Houston. It is non-exclusive and so it's a little easier. They're basically just endorsing a couple of programs. That one's moving forward. Nashville one, because it is exclusive, has more potential, probably won't really be out and customers signing up until the end of the year."
"Another question just popped up. On the exclusive or non-exclusive, looking over some of the historical places that you've serviced what's the penetration rate diﬀerence between places you serve exclusively and non-exclusively?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   In those areas where we are on the bill, so we're on the water or a wastewater bill, we see penetration rates that are up into the 30s and we have disclosed that before, so in the low 30s kind of range."
Okay.,When you're not on a bill it noticeably drops oﬀ.
Okay.,"But we don't give speciﬁc penetrations.  Operator  Angie Storozynski, Macquarie."
"I wanted to talk about two things about your enhanced growth. So ﬁrst of all, the military contracts I know that you are awaiting a number of them to be announced, do you see any impact from the federal sequestration on the timing of those tenders being announced?","Well, it's always hard to tell on the timing. The schedule -- the optimistic schedule is 18 months from the time ﬁrst bids are made to the time that awards are made and that hasn't necessarily ever happened. So honestly, we are still seeing strong activity, in fact it's picked up. The challenge is now there is a 20% sequestration in a number of the areas the we work with because they didn't do it until the second half so they're having -- they're a little higher on the furlough side, and so we are seeing a little bit of a slow down. But I can't -- it doesn't seem like it's signiﬁcant. Things are still moving forward and we're seeing a pick-up of activity, particularly in the Air Force. In one sense I wish I could tell you we're still seeing strong response but we keep the eye out about are they really going to be able to keep the pace."
"Secondly, you mentioned potentially larger acquisitions as the way to the enhanced growth of earnings going forward. Could you put it a bit of in a context? We have some sour memories from the large acquisitions and how dilutive they used to be, equity needs and regulatory lag,   American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   how can you avoid these and also how can you convince the big sellers to give their assets at book value without any goodwill issues and things like that?","Very good question and there's a couple pieces to it. In the sense I would give is the Dale Service. In the send of how big our Company is it doesn't seem large, but 20,000 customer is a large acquisition in this world. Those kind -- these acquisitions, we're very disciplined about the ability to get what we pay in rates. If we don't think we can get it into rates we're not paying it. Now, that does not mean there won't be a premium because there are some states that allow a premium under certain circumstances.  So if we're able, by virtue of that acquisition, to avoid a capital investment or to lower overall costs then acquisitions can be allowed. Now we're still sitting on acquisition premiums made with the Citizens, for example. You're not going to see something like that. Neither Susan nor I nor anybody else in this Company has any appetite for paying major premiums that you're basically going to be accepting a lower return on because that's just not our philosophy about this. But things -- you are seeing certain communities that get challenged and we have a very disciplined approach about what is it that that state will speciﬁcally allow and if they want more than that, well, that's interesting. We're not going to pay more."
Is it easier for you to buy large wastewater systems as opposed to fresh water?,"Easier? None of this stuﬀ's easy because it's got politics wrapped around it and all sorts of other stuﬀ. To me, and I think to us, wastewater is much more of an area that's got greater growth potential because wherever we serve water someone's providing wastewater and so we're already known in those communities and that most of the time is not us. We think that provides a market, particularly given that wastewater is not necessarily held as dear on the municipal side as drinking water is even though it's all one water, so we think that wastewater has signiﬁcant potential for us.  Operator  Brian Chin [ph], Merrill Lynch."
"On the Monterey Peninsula water supply project, obviously this has been a long-running project, could you give us a sense in the settlement to what extent you have cost over-run protections and/or are there monitoring requirements as the project is underway that help give regulators and yourselves a sense of how expensive the project cost is projected to be?","American Water Works Co Inc (AWK US Equity)   Yes, at this stage we only have estimates and that's what's reﬂected in the agreement and part of that is because there are some -- a couple of outstanding issues in terms of the recharge project so there isn't the ability to have certainty on what those costs are yet. As we get those resolved -- those kinds of signiﬁcant issues resolved then I would expect that we'll have much ﬁrmer -- that's why we're giving you a range at this stage, so there isn't a number that someone can say, oh, well, it can't exceed this because its speciﬁcs of the project are not yet fully resolved.  Operator  Thank you, sir, that was your ﬁnal question.     Let me just thank you all very much for your questions and for your interest and we look forward to talking to you next quarter and don't hesitate to call Ed if you've got any questions in the interim.
