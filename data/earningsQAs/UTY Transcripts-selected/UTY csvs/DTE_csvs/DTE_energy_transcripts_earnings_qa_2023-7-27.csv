Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Jeremy.     Hi, Jeremy."
"Hi. Just wanted to start with the electric rate case proceeding, if I could here, and appreciate where we are at the process, only so much could be said. But are you able to expand at all on how this has been progressing? And I guess, hopes for settlement at this point, when that might materialize or just any other color in general would be helpful?","Our target, Jeremy, to settle the rate case is mid-October, and that's before the PFB has issued. So well, we have conversations, and those conversations obviously have become a lot more intense through the summer. But I believe we have the ingredients for settlement, and we'll continue to update on -- update you on that as we progress."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. Just wondering, I guess, to the ability you're able to comment for weather for the third quarter, obviously the big swing quarter for the year. How do things look so far in your jurisdictions and kind of like what you can see over the next couple of weeks? Just wondering if weather help in 3Q could materialize relative to what we saw earlier in the year.","Yes. Jeremy, so far, we're seeing things start out pretty close to what we had expected. And so as you know though, August and September can be really big months for us or really big swing months. So continue to watch that closely as weather plays out."
"Got it. That's helpful. And just last one, if I could, I think for DTE Vantage, there was an opportunity to take steel sales. And just wondering if you could expand a bit more on what that was and are there other items like that, that we should look for to kind of serve as oﬀsets?","Yes, we're looking across our portfolio for oﬀsets. And with the -- ones we have within our steel portfolio represent that, we have some by products that we sell as a process of what we're doing within our steel business and our coke making. And we just had got some opportunistic pricing and some really good pricing for that through the year that we've been able to take advantage of this year.     And I'll say, Jeremy, across our whole portfolio, we continue to look for these one-time cost reductions and some of these opportunities, like this to ensure that we can deliver for the year.     We're also -- Just to add to that we're also seeing some lift in RNG pricing, which is also creating some favorability at the advantage."
Got it. Understood. I'll leave it there. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll go next now to Shar Pourreza at Guggenheim.,
"Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Jerry. Good morning, David.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Good morning, Shar. (Multiple Speakers)"
(Inaudible),Thank you.
"So I'm just kind of appreciating the challenging weather as Jeremy mentioned, and it looks like there was another $0.12 versus normal. How should we think about the ﬂex O&M for the remainder of the year? And is there a need to kind of shift anything from what you embedded at the end of the ﬁrst quarter?","Yes. As we play out the year, we're looking for the opportunities across the business again to ensure that we can oﬀset the challenges that we've seen through storm and weather as we go through the year. And so, we're doing that across our portfolio. We -- as an extended leadership team, we're meeting weekly to ensure that we're ﬁnding all the opportunities we can and extinguishing all the risks. And through the year, we've been able to ﬁnd some additional opportunities to be able to oﬀset the challenges that we've seen through weather and through the storm we saw in the ﬁrst quarter. So we'll continue to look for that ﬂex throughout the year.     Yes. And just to add color to some of the areas where we're diving into, to look for these opportunities, we're taking full advantage of attrition, so we're only hiring critical operating roles to make sure that we have safe and reliable operations. Some of the other one-time initiatives are happening across all the staﬀ groups as well in terms of attrition, a signiﬁcant reduction in overtime. We've deferred non-critical maintenance and pulling on some of the bank maintenance that we did when we had surpluses in prior years. We've had contractor workforce reductions.  And then, of course, as Dave mentioned, we're seeing market favorability in our gas business, as well as at advantage and trading, for that matter. In addition, we've also started to renegotiate supply chain contracts with long-term relationships to give us some value. So we're hitting all the buttons and we're learning a lot about our company. And some of these will stick, but by far and large, most of them are one-time. But I'm really proud of the team because we're hitting all the targets that we've given them to oﬀset these signiﬁcant headwinds."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So I guess, it would be fair to say kind of no big changes, just executing on the plan from one- key.",That's correct.
"Excellent. And then maybe shifting to eﬃcient ﬁnancing, how are you thinking about supporting credit metrics in a tighter capital market environment, especially as we continue to see high levels of investment and rate-based growth? And just any thoughts on internal versus external balance sheet support? And as you mentioned, the Vantage assets are potentially helping, but maybe how are those -- the value of those assets stacking up against any future equity needs?","Well, yes, if you look at our overall ﬁnancing plan, we have some good headroom to our FFO to debt levels at the rating agencies. So, we have some room there. And as we've said in our equity plan, our plan on equity is $0 million to $100 million over the next few years, so very low equity needs that we would do through internal methods. So we're seeing that we're still in a really good place on our balance sheet from both a debt and equity standpoint."
"Excellent. And maybe the last one, housekeeping, to close out, following up on Jeremy's question on the rate case. There's been some data points on kind of higher ROEs could potentially the ranges that kind of have been recommended, and that shows some recognition from stakeholders. Do you anticipate that will start to make an impact, whether in the 24 timeframe or just in settlement negotiations?","Well, we've ﬁled for a higher ROE. I mean, it will be part of settlement negotiations. The pattern, I think that we've seen from the commission in the past that it's a slow up and a slow down. So it'll be -- whatever happens, it'll be extremely gradual. But certainly, we've asked for higher ROEs, and that will be a part of our settlement discussions."
Excellent. Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions.  Operator  We'll go next now to Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America.,
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Hi. Good morning. This is Heidi Haugen for Julien. Thank you for taking my question.,"Good morning.     Hey, Heidi."
"Good morning. Hi. Just my ﬁrst question and kind of a follow-up to the rate case, what has been the ongoing stakeholder feedback to some of your proposals in the electric rate case, like the IRM? And then following intervener testimony, are you exploring any incremental mechanisms, such as, for example, ring fencing of vegetation management spend or something similar?","Sure. So there's been certainly positive support from the staﬀ for the IRM, and we're getting all the right signals that this is something that will be really valuable to our customers and help secure the investments that's necessary to move towards a more resilient and reliable grid that one feels encouraging.  In terms of ring-fencing tree trim, we've essentially done that already through for a good portion of it is ring fenced, and we're executing against that plan. And actually, in good years where we've had surpluses, we've even put more against future mink as we see it as a signiﬁcant level in terms of reducing customer outages. So I feel that positions are productive positions that we've seen in the various parties and we're going to work hard to get towards a settlement before the middle of October."
"Great. Thank you. And then also, can you comment on whether adjusted sales trends year-to- date and how these factors into low-growth forecast or whether this is consistent with your expectation?","Yes. Early on, our sales have come in exactly as we expected on a weather adjusted basis this year. If we look back to last year, residential sales are down about 3.5% to 4%, and that's really what we had predicted with people returning to work. Our commercial is down a little bit due to energy eﬃciency and some other things, and our industrial is up as our plants in Michigan are experiencing a lot less downtime. So I think now we've seen that our sales are kind of at the right level or where they are with people returning to work and kind of very consistent with what we have forecasted through the year.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Thank you. That's helpful. And then just really quick last one from me. We've seen some reports this morning of storms causing outages in your service jurisdiction. Just wondering, I know it's early, but can you comment on restoration eﬀorts this morning and kind of severity of these storms relative to expected storm activity or normal storm activity? And then ﬁnally, on your level of conﬁdence in achieving guidance in light of storms. I know, we've touched on weather, but speciﬁcally on storms. Thank you.","So we did have some storm weather move in last night, approximately 92% to 93% of our customers have power at this moment. We've mobilized almost 3,000 of our team members to address the storm conditions. So, we'll wrap most of it up in the next couple days. These types of storms are pretty typical in July and August. So, nothing out of the ordinary at this point in time.  In terms of achieving guidance as I mentioned and Dave has mentioned, we have seen about $200 million of headwinds, and we have a plan that addresses these headwinds. And those headwinds included some of the prior storm activity and cooler weather that we experienced and warmer weather in the winter. Many of the emissions will be one time in nature, but we're learning, as I mentioned, a lot more about our company, which is good for us and for our customers. And the team is achieving the plan, they're right on top of the plan. We've asked them for some signiﬁcant delivery on initiatives, and they're delivering on that plan, so I'm proud of their accomplishment, and that'll land us at the midpoint of our guidance."
"Great. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the results.  Operator  Thank you. We go next now to Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research.",
Hey. Good morning.,"Good morning, Mike.     Good morning.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Hi, Jerry. Hi, Dave. I just had a quick one on the IRP. I was just wondering, if we could get a little more color on -- you mentioned like studying technology to replace Monroe and kind of what that could look like. I think originally in the plan, you do may have had a gas plant with carbon capture in there. Did that end up making it into the oﬃcial plan or what sort of other solutions are on table there?","Yes. What we settled on, Michael, was that we would ﬁle another IRP in several years, and that would really be, what I would say the key topic for the last two units of Monroe, retiring those two in 2032. So the agreement between the parties and us, of course, was that a lot could change in two or three years, but we will need a dispatchable resource there. We had proposed a combined cycle plan with carbon capture. And so we will have to study that as an option amongst many other options, more batteries, more renewables, but deﬁnitely a very large resource that we count on from that part of the service territory to feed our industrial base in Detroit. And so we will need a dispatchable resource that is going to be of high quality and a 24/7 resource. So it will look like that. It may be a mixture of -- it's just hard to tell right now where those studies will take us, but we agreed to study that together as a stakeholder group. So we got time to do that one."
"Okay, great. And then another one on the IRP, I think somewhere in there it was mentioned, potentially looking at IRA funding for the Bell River conversion. Can you talk a little bit about that and how that may help customers or your plan?","Well, certainly (Multiple Speakers)     Yes.     Go ahead, Dave. Go for it.     Yes. What we mentioned there for the Bell River conversion was some of the DOE funds that are now available for replacing or repowering energy infrastructure that gets ceased and it kind of ﬁts right into what this Bell River conversion is. So along with some other capital investment opportunity we have, we're going to look rate at Bell River and see if there's some DOE funding   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   that can come in and it can give a lower interest rate that can really help at customer aﬀordability as we're building out there prior infrastructure in clear generation plant."
"Okay. And any sinusotomy on like, when that phase out when you know, you can get the funds return?","It'll -- as we get closer, we will know. It will be over the next few years. Those funds are available for -- if you look at timing four or ﬁve years on that. So we have some time to get that, but just opportunity to get some lower interest rate for our customers and well over all expense."
"Okay. (Multiple Speakers) Oh, go ahead.","Yes. Mike, as you know, we got a -- we have a long list of capital projects waiting to get into the plan. Also as we ﬁnd unique ways to ﬁnance some of it, it'll allow us to accelerate our journey in other areas, like for example, with our grid. So lots of -- the more opportunity we can ﬁnd like that make more headroom, we will take full advantage of it."
Awesome. Thanks again.  Operator  And we'll go next now to David Arcaro at Morgan Stanley.,
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.,"Good morning.     Hey, David."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Hi. I was wondering just in your arsenal of cost cutting measures or oﬀset measures. I was wondering if there are ﬁnancial tools that you might have at your disposal that you've considered. Just thinking that CMS did a tender oﬀ a recently on one of their outstanding bonds, things like that. Are those things that you would consider for oﬀsetting weather headwinds this year?","Yes. We look -- we always look across the portfolio for opportunities. We've looked at convertible debt. We don't have much more corporate debt we need to do this year and we'll look for other opportunities like that. But right now, we don't see a similar opportunity that what they brought up. And of course, anything we do, we want to make sure that we maximize the overall value for shareholders too."
"Got it. Thanks. And then separately, could you just give an update on what we could expect to see in the updated distribution grid plan this year and what the timing might be for that?","We will ﬁle that before the end of the year as required by the commission. And it'll -- it really addresses four major buckets, the continued surge of tree trim, which we expect to end in three years. But then we'll be on more of a maintenance cycle, so that'll be a key feature. What we call pull-top maintenance, which is replacement of press arms, insulators, equipment that pulls themselves, that'll be a big part of the plan on our aging system. Third is automation, trying to accomplish full automation of the grid in ﬁve years. That'll be a major component of the plan. As we've seen more frequent storms and more sizable storms over the years, automation will be a big, big lever for us to boost duration of outages.  And then lastly, as I've mentioned before, 1/3 of our grid is quite old. It's a 4,800 volt system, and that was installed in the early 1900s through the 60s and we need to replace that, that's about 16,000 miles. So that'll be also a part of this updated plan to really accelerate our journey to try and get that done over the next 15 or 20 years. Those are the major components that you'll see. There'll be other things there, but those will be the four big hitters in the distribution grid plan."
Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Thanks so much.,"Thank you.     Thanks, David.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator  Thank you. We go next now to Alex Mortimer at Mizuho."
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Alex."
"With the new commissioners' focus on electric vehicles, how do you think about the upside for load, CapEx and rate base above what you might currently have included in your plan?","Well, look, we're a big proponent of transportation electriﬁcation for several reasons. One is, it's great for the environment. The transportation sector is, I believe, now the largest emitter of carbon in the economy. So I believe that it's going to be very valuable for that. But secondly, obviously, we get signiﬁcant investment opportunity from that in the sense that it creates headroom for our investments as we see more load coming on. It is not fundamental just yet, but we expect that near the end of our ﬁve-year plan, we'll start to see it be a pretty signiﬁcant contribution to margin growth, and that'll help ﬁnance a lot of these large investments that we're making now to prepare ourselves for the electriﬁcation and transportation ﬂeet, as well as the deal with the inclement weather that we continue to see. So we're pretty excited about it.  We're happy that obviously, our new commissioner is very supportive of that agenda, but the other two commissioners are as well, so lots to do there. We also have an administration that's quite supportive of electriﬁcation. So, we're pretty excited about the prospects in the future. But like I said, it'll start to become more impactful in our plan, from a margin creation perspective later in a ﬁve-year period. From an investment perspective, we're already investing against this opportunity."
"Okay. Understood. And then just given the additional headwinds present this quarter, should we essentially understand that all contingency has been exhausted at this point and you now normal weather for the balance of the year to achieve the stated goal midpoint of guidance?","I would say that, contingency in the electric company has been exhausted. But some of our other BUs still have a bit of contingency, but we are relying on normal weather, both from a temperature perspective and storm activity perspective.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. And then other than weather in a more kind of quote-unquote normal year, kind of, what would get you to the high, middle and low point of your guidance? And is the bias still towards the middle in a more normal year?",I would say the bias is -- and our target and the bias is towards the midpoint at this point in time.
"Okay. Thanks so much. That's all for me.  Operator  Thank you. It appears we have no further questions this morning. Mr.Norcia, I'd like to turn things back to you for any closing comments.","Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll just close by saying I'm excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us, including our accelerating our path to cleaner generation. And to further strengthen our electric grid and prepare the increased -- for the increased demand electriﬁcation on our system. We continue to execute on our plan to achieve our goals in 2023 and remain well positioned for long term future growth. I hope everyone has a great morning and a safe day.  Operator  Thank you, Mr.Norcia. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the DTE Energy second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Again, we'd like to thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.
