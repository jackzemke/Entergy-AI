Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, guys. It's actually Constantine for Shar, he had to hop on another call. Congratulations for good earnings.",Good morning.
"Just one kind of quick question you've -- Gerry thanks for going over to the business growth at GSP So, one other thing that I wanted to ask was you mentioned that there's kind of a mix o, kind of greenﬁeld and gathering opportunities, and some potential strategic acquisitions in the future. In terms of thinking about how you're going to deploy capital into that business, what's the mix there and how are you thinking about it?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Our ﬁrst order is always organic growth. What we're seeing right now is signiﬁcant opportunities, organic opportunities in our existing platforms, and generation pipeline is an example of that as we close that and then move to connect with the NEXUS It'll be a great market sync for that pipeline. We also have several other opportunities across all our platforms that we're pursuing that we feel real good about and those are organic in nature, either connectors or expansions. And in addition to that, we do see opportunities for strategic asset acquisitions that connect to these platforms we will look hard at those."
"And magnitude wise, do you think it's going to be closer to something like generation or slightly bigger, just thinking about the overall kind of $4 billion to $5 billion number over the ﬁve years?","Right. I think we're -- right now we're focused on building out that opportunity set and I can tell you that we're I would say we're in line with our guidance this year, in terms of growth capital for both P&I and GSP, and feeling really good about that opportunity pipeline, and we continue to secure -- as we secure those we're securing EPS growth for the future.     But I would say in addition to that things, we've looked at for acquisitions have ranged anywhere from the scale of generation pipeline to the scale of Link and lots of things in between. The other thing I'd say on our capital numbers is we're a lot more focused on value and accretion than we are a capital number and earnings number.  And the organic things tend to come in harder with better returns, less capital, some of the acquisitions that set you up for more of that, maybe larger capital numbers, but at least at the outset a little bit lower accretion, so to continue growing we need a mix of those things, and we're looking at a series of ﬁrst of organic and then see the range of things we've seen for potential acquisition is all over the map from pretty small bolt on to things that are a bit larger on the scale like Link."
Okay. And just a quick follow-up on also on the GSP business. You mentioned kind of a mix of shorter-term contracts on NEXUS. Is there a plan to ﬁll that with longer-term contract or is the kind of economics working favorably right now on keeping it the way that it is?,"So short certainly the answer is yes, we're looking to move the balance of the capacity to longer term contracts. We feel some of the tailwinds there are that the basin that we're operating and continues to grow, we expect 5% to 6% a year, which is signiﬁcant. It's producing about 28 Bcf a day, a day now. And so we view that as a sort of strong tailwind. In addition to that we're seeing some other pipelines face strong headwinds, if you will, in terms of going into service. We ﬁnd   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   ourselves in a pretty good position with available long-term capacity that we can place when we see the prices being right and the term being right. And that's what we're really working toward just trying to get the right price and the right term for these contracts, long term contracts. So we're happy to take the short-term contracts in the meantime."
Okay.,"And I would say that we're consistent with what we've really been saying for about a year, which is, we see the basin going short takeaway in the early 2020s, 2021, 2020 time frame. And that's what producers will be targeting. Of course, if some of the pipes in the region delay or don't get built, it intensiﬁes that dynamic."
"Great. That's really great color. And just one kind of last one on a little bit more of a strategic end, as you kind of mentioned the 25, 75 kind of non-regulated to regulated business mix. Is that kind of target going forward for the next ﬁve years?",Yeah. as model forward that's where we keep landing.
"Okay. And kind of the IRP, I guess supports some of that growth on the regulated front?","Yeah, that's right. IRP, voluntary renewables and -- as you know, we're in a heavy capital replacement program in both distribution or operations as well, gas and electric. So yeah, that's what keeps the mix even though we're growing the other businesses keeps the mix at that 75, 25 roughly."
Okay. Perfect. Thanks. That's it for me.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta of Citi Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.,
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Thanks so much. Hi guys.,Good morning.
"Good morning. So, maybe just touching on the IRP and the whole retirement of coal plants. I wanted to understand from an economic perspective most utilities almost have a beneﬁt on customer bill that these are diamonds.(ph) How do you -- how are you seeing that play out in your IRP? Do you see customer bill impacting positive, ﬂat or bills going up? How do you see that playing out in your IRP plan?","So what we've talked about on our bills overall is that our goal is to keep as we invest both in distribution and generation, keep our rate increases to low single digits and we think we'll be able to do that. In some regimes, if you get into the Great Plains where wind may come in at $0.02, you can displace fuel costs in a way that you may see beneﬁts to bills. We're trying to get our renewable additions in with modest increases and that's what we're seeing. So there's enough capital here and we bring say wind in today at $0.045.  So we have good wind regime in Michigan, but it's not the best in the country. Certainly a long way from the worst too, it's a good regime, but not quite as strong as you might see in the Great Plains. So I'd say, we're bringing it out in a way that works for customers and is going to keep our overall bill increases aﬀordable and workable."
"Got you. So as not as good at beneﬁt, but it is manageable within the current plan?","Yeah, I mean we wouldn't be out saying we can go down 50 and 80, if we hadn't modeled that this is workable from a price and reliability perspective. We spent a lot of time studying that, and absolutely is workable. And generally speaking, I think technology is going to continue to evolve in ways that make this more workable and probably make things happen faster than people anticipate today."
"Got you, interesting. And the other interesting point you brought up on the voluntary contracts, is that something you expect would push the process of this transformation sooner? And how does that then play into bills? Do these people who sign up the voluntary contracts bear an incremental burden for the transition for those particular contracts?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, the contracts are signed up with customers. So the balance of the customers don't pay for those. So GM is paying for their renewables, Ford, UM And so what that means is at the utility we have said that we will have at least 25% of our supply from renewables by 2030. This voluntary could push us up to the range of 30% for the state, with some of that being utility commitments and some of it being individual customer commitments. So the RECs for these projects are assigned to those speciﬁc customers and retired by those customers, and in the name of those customers. So we can't use it for utility compliance. It accrues speciﬁcally to GM, Ford and the University of Michigan."
"Got it. Okay, that makes sense, thanks for that. And then just ﬁnally, just a simple clariﬁcation question, when you talk about the gas business, Q1 '19, versus '18, the $40 million uplift that you experienced in '19, only partly is explained through weather and the one-time, I think the tax impact that Peter also talked about.  What else is driving the improvement and why doesn't that show up on an annual basis in terms of an uplift for the gas side? It seems like the annual number is still the same. So just trying to understand and reconcile how Q1 performance doesn't kind of ﬂow through?","We've had a very strong start to the year. You mentioned some of the items. We have some of them that are kind of one-time more in nature. We have weather variability this year and we also have some tax items. Last year, we booked some accruals related to tax reform where we gave signiﬁcant beneﬁts back to customers.  That's about half of that $40 million, we look at the weather and tax timing year-over-year. The other is more permanent. We have a new rate case, last year, we have new orders, new rates coming in. We do see a disproportionate amount of that coming into the ﬁrst quarter just because half the volumes for the year play out in the ﬁrst quarter. So we see a lot of capability with the new rates coming in as well as we have NEXUS related revenue coming in with NEXUS in service, that's the other half.     In NEXUS, we had investments in the utility to enable NEXUS Those actually beneﬁt the utility customers. I think they see a beneﬁt, but there are earnings tied to that. So, between the new rate case which internalized new capital into rate base and the NEXUS impacts, that's an equivalent impact of what the weather and timing items were.     It's a very strong start and Gerry Anderson did mention in his opening remarks around continuously we're building this year and we do have some contingency we are building with    DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  the gas utility."
"Got it. Well, thanks so much guys. Appreciate the color.",Thank you.  Operator  We'll then take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
"Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Good morning.     Good morning, Julien."
"So I just wanted to follow-up on the IRP discussion. First, just to be exceptionally clear about what's reﬂected in your CapEx budget today, obviously, the gas plant is, but with respect to generation investment on a longer dated side, how does that reconcile with some of the updated and accelerated timelines that you propose in the IRP?  And then secondly, and related, obviously, we've seen some developments on consumer energy's IRP of late and some speciﬁc settlement terms. How do you think about the ability to settle your own IRP, and I know, again, I appreciate it's early, but some of the critical pieces, such as recovery on PPAs, and again, more broadly with respect to PURPA, if you can comment, at least initially as you see it?","Yeah, so the IRP, as I said, is very speciﬁc for the ﬁrst ﬁve years. And then after that, we actually proposed a range of scenarios that may play out depending on how technology and other factors evolve. And when you look at the ﬁrst ﬁve years, they're very consistent with the plan that we laid out at EEI last year. So Blue Water is in there, as expected. The renewables that we need to build to meet the 2021 commitment that we have under the RPS are all in there. We do   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   have voluntary renewables in the plan, we have 600 megawatts in. But we are only one quarter into that plan, and we signed up 350 megawatts. So we're feeling awfully good about being over halfway. only a quarter into the ﬁrst year of the ﬁve years in.  I do think there'll be more of that, as other companies continue to look hard at what they need to commit to their investors and their customers, So that's going well. So I would say, on the whole, the IRP is entirely consistent with plan that we laid out at EEI and makes feel really good that we're on track to achieve it from that perspective. Concerning CMS and their settlement, I think you'd probably be better to direct questions of settlement and terms and so forth around that to them.  We could settle, although, I don't know that I anticipate that. Ours is a pretty early in the process. And then I think it's a pretty straightforward IRP in the sense that most of the discussion that's speciﬁc is near term and it's all things that have been out there for the commission to see for a long time. So wouldn't think the ﬁrst ﬁve years would be controversial.  On PURPA, we actually got a staﬀ order on our PURPA case today that, I think continues to evolve that policy in the right direction in a positive way. In our case, couple of speciﬁcs where that they found that we had no capacity need, no need for capacity. So any PURPA projects would be attached with energy only prices and if the day does come that we're determined to have a capacity need, they set the price at the Blue Water Energy center price which is in the $0.045 range, which is pretty consistent with the renewables that we're bringing on, as I mentioned earlier.  So the new assets that we're bringing on are in the $0.045 range. And so that's where -- roughly where they've set the price, which is a good evolution from -- I'd say the -- some of the early thinking on how PURPA pricing might be handled. So we feel positive about all of that."
"Got it. Understood. And then separately, just to clarify this voluntary renewables, I know you mentioned it already, but is there a timeline on getting the balance of the 300 megawatts to 600 megawatts resolved?","Yeah, I mean, within ﬁve years is that -- it's in our ﬁve year plan, so we've had a really fast start to the eﬀort. I mean, we -- be looking to bring in 250 megawatts more over the remaining four years and three quarters."
"Excellent. And then lastly, anything quickly on replacing the remainder of the midstream acquisition plays held there?",DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I think we answered that earlier with we're looking at a whole range of potential or both organic and sizes on acquisitions if we execute those. So I don't know that there's more to say than that.
"Okay, fair enough. Just maybe wanted to be crystal clear. Thank you very much.","Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from -- just a moment there, sorry, from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open."
"Hi, good morning. Another follow-up on the IRP As you guys already mentioned, the ﬁling of one more wind capacity up front, far less solar heavy, relative to some others in Michigan, largely due to cost -- competitiveness. But when you think about the mix between DTE Electric owning versus PPA in this capacity, and how other dockets have progressed. Does wind present a more compelling utility own proposition relative to solar over the next ﬁve years in Michigan? Or they're not really material diﬀerences between owning and PPI if it's wind versus solar?","Well, look, one of the reasons that the legislation in 2016, that was passed in '16 evolved to enable companies to own 100% is between 2008 and 2016, when there was a 50-50 split, there just was no compelling evidence that third parties were bringing in wind capacity or renewable capacity more cheaply. In fact, we were always, DTE was always at or below the third-party.  So the legislation in '16 enabled utilities to own the renewable capacity. And that's what our plan calls for. We think we can absolutely do that at or below what third-parties can. And as you said, near-term that means wind, but long-term, we're convinced we can do the same on solar, and that we will be bringing solar on at or below what third-parties can, and that's our plan."
"Okay. Thanks. And then one follow-up on P&I, I know we talked about RNG projects in the past, I mean, you announced acquiring cogeneration projects. Are there any kind of incremental insights you can provide on kind of returns, contract duration, and maybe how late in the cycle that cogeneration project is? Is it already developed or are you just kind of buying the rights?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   We are -- the contracts are long-term on the cogeneration projects that -- cogeneration project that we're looking at, that we're in the ﬁnal stages of discussion on. So I can say that."
Okay. But are -- so is this a completed kind of cogen project that you're just acquiring once it's done? Or is this something where you'll be having an organic aspect to it?,The one that we're in ﬁnal stages on is an existing facility -- operating facility.
"Okay. And then the high level, are there much competitive advantages with buying an existing cogeneration project? Are you able to bring gas from the S&P or anything like that?","But I can tell you that the returns are favorable and north of typical utility returns with a long term contract. So we feel good about our position there.     I'd also say that our group who does that, probably does have operating cost advantages over other operators. Like any business, you can do a really good tight job of running assets or you can mess it up. And they've got, I don't know, 20 years of experience running these projects. So really understand how to do it eﬃciently.     And the asset is critical to the operation of the facility that it's connected to. And so operating experience and expertise is fundamental and certainly a competitive advantage.     Okay. The other one is -- the other one is being ﬁnalized, so we can't say too much speciﬁc about -- much more speciﬁc about it and until perhaps it's done in public. But I will say the combination of that plus the two RNG projects we mentioned, get you a long way down the road toward the $15 million that we can got that business targeting this year for incremental earnings growth. But there's as Jerry mentioned, the signiﬁcant amount more in the queue that's very active behind those three projects. So he and I continue to feel like the opportunity set is, is good."
All right. Great. Thank you. Congrats again on a good quarter.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),Thank you.     Okay. Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
"Hi, guys, how are you doing?",Good.     Hi Michael.
"Hey. A couple of questions on the -- in the electric rate case, the infrastructure recovery mechanism. Is that -- if that isn't approved, what happens with the next ﬁlings over the next few years? How does it change things?","One proposal they've made is that we set up a work group to work out the details on the IRM rather than use the rate case to ﬁnalize that. And that would be ﬁne, if it's the way it plays out. I think there -- Jerry, you talk. But on my sense, is there continues to be a real interest in the mechanism but a desire to work through the details.     Yeah, we spent a lot of time with commission staﬀ creating an understanding of our investment proﬁle over the next ﬁve years. And I would say there's been really strong support, as we invest in reliability and modernization of the grid as well as our generation ﬂeet, modernizing and transforming that ﬂeet. So there's good visibility into our plan.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So there is the opportunity to have an infrastructure renewal mechanism to sort of accommodate well understood capital. But I think as Gerry said, it's going to take some time to work through the details with the staﬀ and the commission. And so our expectation is it is likely not going to happen in this rate case.  And the consequence of that is it will be in for more regular rate cases. And I think if we can get one done the beneﬁt is that we can lock in long-term investment plans and drive eﬃciency into those plans for our customers. So we see value there as well as reducing the frequency of rate cases that are pretty straight forward.     The staﬀ proposal was to set up a work group to continue to work through the details."
"And working group is better than a rejection. So, on gathering and processing, can you talk about volume growth and what you expect that to be over the next few years?  What it's been this year and speciﬁcally on Link, what's the capacity utilization rate on the Link system at this point during Q1?","Well, what I can tell you is that, we expect the Appalachian basin which most of our assets, all of our assets are really connected to grow at 5% to 6% over the next 10 years or so.  That's very positive. I mean, it has grown faster in the past, but I think as the basin matures, as well as you know capital discipline has entered into the production, capital markets. we see -- we project a 5 % to 6% growth. And we think that our assets, Link, Bluestone, Millennium, NEXUS are well positioned to competitively attach that volume growth.     So and you asked speciﬁcally about Link, Link continues to perform, as Jerry mentioned earlier, ahead of the pro forma that we had for it. We mentioned last year a new gathering contract, we are in the middle of building that out. The drilling that we see around Link is proceeding kind of exactly as we anticipated, actually, in this year's plan. So there is talk of producers not getting out over their skis with capital they spend to chase resources.  But in terms of the drilling we're seeing around our gathering assets, it's right in line with what we expected and right in line with our plan for this year. So that, I guess, domain you'd say is proceeding well for us in 2019."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I think you've had -- last update was that its 80% contracted. Is that still over the latest you're willing to talk about or is there an update to that?,"I don't think, we've--     I don't think we've talked about contracting levels. It's certainly rising. We're growing into it in. There are various components of the pipe too, so there's a Southern Leg and a Northern Leg and each of them have their own dynamics. So it's not like a point to point pipe like Millennium is it's quite as easy to sum up that way, but     Like we've said in the past that there's signiﬁcant amount of expandability that we could secure on a pipe. And as matter of fact, they are under construction right now with a signiﬁcant expansion on that pipe, to support a customer need with long term contract. So we're in expansion mode right now on Link."
"Great. And on P&I, are you guys ahead of plan for $15 million a year of growth? I mean, it sounds like there's -- it sounds like you're doing better than you expected. Is that fair?","Certainly -- yeah, doing better than we expected at this point in time in a year. I mean, we have approximately most of our growth locked in that we expected the lock in this year and with the very strong queue behind it. So we expect more good news in P&I as we go forward."
"Great. And I had one ﬁnal question on just the equity share account. Do you -- are you guys including the Link conversion, the equity conversion, in this year's guidance for share count and also in this quarterly numbers?","Yeah, we are including that. My disclosures I gave on the call, which is a $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $250 million (ph) this year, does not include it. And what we can disclose the share count it doesn't really.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. So, it's not -- we've got $1 billion to $1.5 billion plus the converts that will come in as equity. And of course, those are all in our EPS forecasts and the ﬁve year plan that's been -- we've been forecasting that convert for years now. That the $1 billion to $1.5 billion would be over and above that."
Make sense. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  We'll now take our next question from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI Please go ahead. Your line is open.,
Thanks. Good morning.,Good morning.
"When you look at the ﬁrst quarter results in GS&P and the decline in overall earnings associated with coming back to more normal volumes, I know that the ﬁscal year guidance was for overall - -lower overall. But is that sort of in line with your expectations and reﬂective mainly of the Atlantic Sunrise pipeline coming online and those volumes being diverted to that pipe?","Hi, Greg, this is Peter. First of all, last year we indicated that we had a really strong year $62 million ﬁrst quarter last year, $48 million this year. So that's the $14 million decline from $62 million last year (inaudible) AFUDC accounting for NEXUS also hit all of our platforms (inaudible). So that $14 million is the combination of the returning from AFUDC accounting as well as normal volumes. When you look at the $48 million you annualize that and also you take a look at the growth we have for the year as Jerry Norcia was mentioning the Link.  On the last question we're feeling really comfortable with this year's guidance. And we're not anticipating any other pipelines not coming in service and volumes coming from that. It's really just contracted growth that we're already constructing that's going to help us get our annual guidance.     Put another way the ﬁrst quarter results were right in line with our plan for the year so we're just ﬁne..   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it. You guys didn't call out earlier the ﬂip from AFUDC, so I didn't recall that. So it's a combination of the AFUDC and volumes normalizing, but still down the fairway of how you had thought it would play out so that good.  The second question I have, a little oﬀ the beat and track, when I look at your IRP, as I recall and I did it review it recently I didn't see any call out speciﬁcally for a signiﬁcant commitment to battery storage.  Can you talk about that and what type of technology or vendor you might decide to partner with? Just reading recently that for instance Arizona Public Service down in the Southwest has deployed a fairly signiﬁcant chunk of battery source and recently had a major equipment failure from a large vendor and I was wondering as you look at that landscape how are you thinking about that?","One thing that's unique to Michigan is that we have a massive battery that's existed in the state for a long time known as the Ludington pumped storage facility. So that things we've been investing along with consumers, over $800 million in that facility in recent years. And it takes it up over 2,000 megawatts. That's the fourth biggest pump storage facility in the world, a couple in China and one here in the US that are larger. And so we (inaudible) actually do some modeling recently on forward needs for storage, as we build out our renewable assets in the state and they just don't show much of a need because a lot of the short term ﬂuctuations that renewables will introduce in Michigan can be handled by Ludington.  So what we see for batteries is more niche investments for example at substations to oﬀset investments on our distribution systems. So we will have some but, for the reasons I just described I think the big dollars will be in the renewable assets themselves versus storage within Michigan."
"Excellent, I've been to that facility. It's really an impressive site. Thank you. Take care.",Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
Just coming back to the new cogen acquisition and previously you'd been talking about the plan in that business that would focus on developing new opportunities. I thought is this -- are you still on that track and this was an opportunistic--opportunity that came along or is this a shift in focus?,I think your assessment is accurate Jonathan. We are focused on developing Greenﬁelds in this space and we have several of those opportunities under way that are addressing quite well actually. This was an opportunistic acquisition opportunity.
Do you see others?,"We have for example a Greenﬁeld that I'd say It's an advanced development quite interesting. That would be a new build, would be the next one we're looking at behind this. So if we see these come along as an acquisition opportunity, a bolt-on that ﬁts our return and skills we're happy to do it, but we do continue to develop Greenﬁeld actively as well."
"Great. And then just on RNG, you said, you were ﬁnalizing these two last quarter as well. So I'm just curious is that of -- is that something that's come up that's making this take longer, is it just the process, what's the kind of update on getting those over the ﬁnish line?","Well the deals are done on those two, really we're in a due diligence phase from a development perspective, make sure that we're happy with everything that we're closing in on from an economic perspective, but we feel really good about it we expect them to go forward."
"So is that you are just still in due diligence and you were in due diligence couple of months ago, and do you think that any of these will close?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Just to be speciﬁc, we were in late development a few months ago. The contractual terms are agreed to now, but you always have once you've agreed on terms conditions et cetera in a deﬁnitive way you always have a period of ﬁnal due diligence where you make sure the assets you're buying, ﬁt the description and so forth. So they're working way through that but they're very late in that process."
"Okay, so since you last updated us, you've gone to terms and moving forward eﬀectively.","Yes, I fully expect we'll move forward on these two RNG deals."
Great. I think that's it. Thank you guys.,Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
"Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end of the hour here. First, just a couple questions on wind. For the voluntary renewables program, I just want to be clear would those assets sit in the rate base or outside of it, notwithstanding the dedicated recs(ph) that you mentioned. Are rates negotiated or would it be a cost plus with something like a 10% ROE?  And going forward given the size of Ford and GM, would most of the growth tend to come from residential and commercial customers or industrial? And does that matter from a rate to margin perspective?","The contracts are signed with the individual customers. and they are ﬁve year term. We expect them to evergreen, because a lot of these companies have long term commitments they've made. They -- if they, any individual customer didn't renew they do revert into rate base. So they behave just like a rate based investment.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   They essentially are utility asset that behaves like rate base. And in terms of returns, those are negotiated with individual customers to work for us and work for them. I think he can think of them as pretty much rate based assets."
"Okay, so the returns will be comparable to the rate base ROE, right, is that that what you said?",Yes.
"Perfect. Okay, great. Then just one last one on midstream. You mentioned that you're expecting that tightness in takeaway capacity for Appalachian Gas in the next, say, two years. Others might be less conﬁdent thinking that there could be suﬃcient availability for a while, especially if people assume a slower rate of production growth than you do. So just to be clear, would you need to see that market tightness to hit your 2023 operating income targets? Or would that represent upside here to your plan?","Well, we look to -- I mean NEXUS is running full from a contractual perspective, based on available capacity, what we'd like to see is turning out those revenues and at favorable pricing. So I -- we still are pretty conﬁdent that we're going to achieve long term contracting on this pipe and move our short term contracts to long term. The basin is growing. I mean, last year it grew 18% year-over-year. We are forecasting what we believe a pretty conservative growth proﬁle of 5% to 6% going forward and that's what's built into our ﬁve year plans.     The discussions that we're having now with producers are very consistent with what we've been telling you for some time. They're active. And we still do see that tightness coming in the early 2020s. I've been telling investors, this capital discipline that people talk about, I think it's a short term phenomenon in the sense that demand ﬁve years from now is what demand ﬁve years from now is. And the fact that producers are being more disciplined about not getting way out ahead of it and producing a surplus, it makes sense for producers, but it really doesn't aﬀect what the demand is in 2022 or 2023. And all the modeling that we see on fulﬁlling long term demand continues to see substantial growth out of the Appalachian base broadly. But then as you get into some of the stronger sub markets within the Appalachian bases, they grow beyond the pace of that 5% to 6% that Jerry mentioned. So you're well exposed to the right theology, you not only see growth, you'll see more than your fair share."
