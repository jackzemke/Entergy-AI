Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Good morning, Shar.     Good morning, Shar."
"So let me just touch a little bit on the non-utility. The recent acquisition, you guys did kind of highlighted $2 gas is still being economical and obviously would continuing to trend below this. Could we -- could you just get a little bit of a status on your thinking there, given weakening fundamentals. But really more importantly, is there any impact with your prior guidance, like $2 billion to $3 billion incremental accretive growth opportunities you highlighted for this segment in, let's say a prolonged weak gas price environment, especially for sort of the opportunity as you guys highlighted in the past as being in early to mid phases. I mean, could we see some of that capital being diverted to other areas?","So I'll say this that our -- for 2020, our forecast for Indigo is right on top of our ﬁxed fee charges and demand charges. So we are highly conﬁdent delivering 2020. Also, as we mentioned prior our growth on this asset is also contracted at about a 90% level for the ﬁrst three years. So we're really conﬁdent in the growth that we're forecasting with this asset."
"Got it. I guess the question is just more of a longer-term. You've allocated some obviously accretive or incremental growth opportunities for just the gathering and storage segment. I'm just curious like the $2 billion to $3 billion that could be incremental opportunities that are sort of in the early phases of spend in a weakening gas price environment, is there a potential that you could redeploy capital somewhere else or even projects that are in the early phase will continue?","All of the projects that we planned for this year, we're conﬁdent they're going to continue Shar. And longer-term, as we look at our assets, multiple platforms, here in the Northeast as well as the Midwest and Louisiana, we feel that we've got a great resource behind those pipelines and extremely well connected to markets. And the one thing that we do know is that supply and demand are currently rebalancing. We saw this happen in 2015 and 2016 and that's happening now. So longer-term with demand growth in the natural gas sector, which continues at a pretty robust cliﬀ, we see that our resources are really or our pipelines are well positioned with these resources and markets to deliver on our growth. So we're not seeing anything right now that long-term would give us pause in terms of growth of our assets in this space.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay, perfect. That was the ﬁrst question. And then just second, can we just shift to the regulated and talk a little bit about the IRP and sort of the recent ALJ recommendation. How we should sort of think about the generation needs there, may be from a framework perspective?","Sure. So I would say that the staﬀ position in the IRP has been quite supportive. But also say that most of our assets are in ﬂight to deliver on our ﬁve-year plan. So I would say that the bulk of our renewable asset build has been approved already by the commission and of course, our combined cycle plant has been approved by the commission, it's is well under construction and is 40% complete. In addition to that, the heavy investment that we're making in our wires business is getting very good support from the staﬀ and from the commission in the last rate case and also signals that they're sending with their testimony in this rate case.  Terriﬁc. Thanks guys congrats.     Thanks.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question."
"Hey, guys. Just to follow up with Shar's line of questioning there. I understand 2020 is seems pretty locked in with hedging at Indigo at 275%. But going forward beyond that, how far out are they hedged above $2 or in that $275 million range that could support them, supporting the contracts that they have with you?","Michael, I would say several things. One is that this is our -- hedged beyond 2020 in a signiﬁcant way that we're dealing with. In addition to that, our contracts are solid with them in terms of 85% of our contracts moving forward for -- in the ﬁve-year time horizon 85% ﬁxed fee and demand charge. So we also look at their credit, and we are monitoring their credit on a regular basis, with basis which we've always done and looking at their liquidity. And we feel, at this point, based on their current hedges that there they've got the ability to furnish on those contracts.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Great. And then on the P&I business, the three projects that are under construction for the -- on the RNG side, is that the origination that you need for this year to make the -- to achieve the $15 million? Or with any additional origination?","We're in the process of originating an incremental $15 million this year and we have some really good prospects. The $15 million you referred to was what we brought in the house last year. So we've got three years in a row now where we've locked in $15 million -- years of net income growth. So we've got a total of about $45 million new net income that's been already originated, and we're looking to originate an incremental $15 million this year, with good prospects in and around the boat, if you will."
"Great. And the California plan, California's rules that support that program? Is the -- are there any changes contemplated there at all or...?","That's been a really robust program and we -- there's really high conﬁdence through 2020-'30 in that construct, and it's providing a really solid basis for the unlevered IRRs in the RNG space for us. So we're feeling really good about California. ly"
"Terriﬁc. And also just remind me, when are they supposed to give you a ﬁnal approval on the IRP?","In February. It'll be this month.     February 20, is a good day we're targeting."
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.",Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Julian Demulan Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, team.","Good morning.     Good morning, Julian."
"Excellent. So I want to come back to some of the earlier utility commentary. You talked about nailing it this year. I suppose coming oﬀ of 2 years of strong weather, being at the upper end of the range on 2019. How do you think about trends even within the utilities for 2020? And more speciﬁcally, if you think about being able to do some of the O&M work ahead of time given some of the weather trends we've already seen. Just could you elaborate as to sort of the positioning beyond, just folks handling it?","So Julian, as I mentioned, we look at our ﬁnancial condition both opportunities and risks every week and we've been doing that for about seven or eight years. So I would say that in early last year, we were already working on building contingency for 2020. And so we entered 2020 with a signiﬁcant amount of contingency that positions us to deliver on our results. And that's how we deliver on our results each and every year. If we see any of that contingency being threatened, we immediately start to work on tactics to hold that contingency, and deliver it for our shareholders at the end of the year. So when I say nail it that's the reason I feel conﬁdent that we're going to nail it, is because of all the work that we do weekly at a very senior level and we walk through every lined item of opportunity and risk. And the goal of those discussions is to seize the opportunity and kill the risks. And we've done that quite well in the past and conﬁdent that we're going to do that in the future.     If I just expand on what Jerry Norcia is saying, and you mentioned the weather, we are seeing warmer weather here ﬁrst quarter, but we go into each year with 3 plants. One thing I've learned in my career here is that weather normal usually doesn't happen. So we came in, we have a plan around lean, if weather comes in a little bit lighter. So we've already are deploying   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   those plans as well as we came into the year with good -- really good contingency levels that Jerry Norcia mentioned."
"All right, excellent. And then a little bit of a cleanup on the last couple of questions, if you don't mind. The non-utility side, just long-term targets unchanged, I know you kept the consolidated numbers you reaﬃrmed, just want to make sure on the GSP segment that's indeed the case. And then also to elaborate just quickly on the other question on the IRP just the process, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the last question there as well?","For the non-utility our capital guidance hasn't changed from EEI. We have -- the whole portfolio of $19 billion, $15 billion of that's going into the utilities, so for $4 billion is going in the non- utilities. And there was questions on the midstream segment to $2 billion or $3 billion, just a reminder, $1 billion of that is tied to the Indigo and the Haynesville acquisition milestone payment as well as building out that system there. So we're still feeling really good with anything in prospects that you tend to add on to the existing platforms in midstream. And as Jerry Norcia mentioned we've been mailing a $15 million per year origination goal in P&I. We're feeling good around continuing to deploy capital in that space as well.  On the integrated resource plan, we are really in the ﬁnal stages right now. It's really right with the ALJ decision. It's going to be right before an order. And there's a commission meeting on February 20, and that's what we're expecting and we're expecting a constructive outcome actually from that. It has been a great process. Part of the 2016 legislation was to do this. So all the stakeholders got their voice in that process. And as Jerry Norcia mentioned, we don't really have capital tied to this program. It really goes through our renewable energy plan as well as the certiﬁcate of need that we had at our gas plant. But we're looking forward to having a constructive order. From our IRP."
"Excellent. Thank you, all.",Thanks.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"My ﬁrst one is, is it going to be a bounce-back year next year for the red wings, too?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","We hope so with Yzerman in town. We hope so.     Yes, Yzerman are feeling good."
"They make the rangers look like Stanley Cup champions, which is hard to do. The -- so I'm sorry to beat a dead horse on the GS&P segment, but it really has been an intense focus for investors. That 2-- ﬁrst that $275 million number that was across all your counter parties, not just Indigo, when you said -- when you talked about where they're hedged. I just wanted to clear that up?","That's correct, Greg."
"Okay. And I think you've been pretty clear that the Indigo relationship has not just demand payments, but minimum volume commitments on 90% related to 90% of your expected ﬁnancial outlook. But I think the concern is also in the Marcellus on the link and Bluestone systems and on throughput on NEXUS. And you talk about, having contractual protection, but do you also have volumetric protection, as you look out past 2020 into 2021 and '22? And if volumes -- if you don't and volumes were to fall short of your baseline forecast given that, Jerry, that you're very proud of how you model for contingencies in your ﬁve-year plan, what might be the contingencies you could fall back on to still achieve the remarkable success you've had over the last 10,15 years of being at the high end of your earnings guidance.","Well, I'll start with this Greg. So ﬁrst of all, our ﬁxed fees and demand charges across our whole portfolio for 2020 and beyond are at approximately 85% of our revenues in our plan. So that would give you an indication of the quality of the contracts that we have for the medium-term and long-term on our assets. So that gives us good comfort. And we also in many of our contracts have credit provisions that help secure those payments as well. And as I mentioned, we look at the quality of credit, liquidity on a very regular basis. So we feel real good long-term where we stand with the quality resources that our pipelines are connected to. And of course, we are going through a readjustment between supply and demand. But the last time that happened in '15 and '16 it was about a nine-month process before attrcted itself, and I think we're in the middle of that now. We planned for that for this year conservatively; I think we described that in our past discussions, so I feel really good about 2020. And long-term I feel that our pipes are well-positioned against the resources and the markets that they serve and with the quality of contracts that we have, being 85% ﬁxed fee and demand charges.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Yes, I get that. But if you're wrong and I'm sure you probably do some contingency planning around what would happen if you were wrong on those assumptions. Are there other areas in the business where you could pivot? I mean, is the RNG business sort of potentially larger than what you're currently budgeting? I mean, where are the opportunities in the plan.",Well the value...
They really pair shaped on the E&P side for longer.,"Sure. That's a great question Greg. And the value of our portfolio is that we've got really strong utilities that are -- have very strong growth prospects. And I think we mentioned at EEI. We've got capital sitting on the sidelines that we're working on every day to get into the plan from an aﬀordability perspective. So opportunity there for sure. Our P&I business is also ripe with many opportunities and still feel conﬁdent that we've got really strong opportunities inside our GSP business. We're working smaller highly accretive transactions inside GSP each and every day. So when you take our portfolio in total and in addition to our conservative contingency planning each and every year, I feel real conﬁdent that we're going to deliver our 5% to 7% going forward."
"Thanks, Jerry.","Thanks, Greg.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Chris Turner with JP Morgan. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, guys. I know it's a smaller part of your business, but could you give us some color on maybe the end of 2019 performance for the trading business? What you're thinking for your 2020 guidance, kind of what's underlying that? And just remind us of the maybe geographic proﬁle and customer proﬁle of that business?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yes, our 3D business had a really solid year. We had performance economic. We really measure that on economic income, so economic income and contribution was $40 million. That translated into $30 million of operating. We do typically target $30 million to $40 of million economic contribution every year. So we're feeling really good with that. And we do plan a bit conservatively in terms of operating guidance that's allowed this. The economic contribution will ﬂow sometimes in the current year, sometimes in future years. So we always come in the year in terms of our guidance being a little more conservative, so we do have a midpoint of guidance of $20 million for 2020."
Okay. And no color there on the current state of the market and how things have trended in recent years?,"We make our money there across a portfolio of businesses. We have FRS contracts that we do -- I'll show -- the trading company supports our GSP business. In terms of marketing those as well. So we also have a credit renewable business line within that as well. So we have between power and gas renewables and supporting our midstream business. So we have a lot of products to, kind of -- creates some stability of earnings year-on-year out there.     Yes we rely on the trading business really for steady cash ﬂow. We generate between $30 million and $50 million a year of cash from that business. And the fact that it supports our pipeline business as well as our RNG business, we view it as strategic in that way, but we don't count on it for growth going forward."
"Okay. And then switching gears to the balance sheet. The $100 million to $300 million of equity this year, I think it's all internal programs, but can you remind us of, how you're thinking about pension contributions here? And then maybe if you're disclosing this with share count or FFO expectation for 2020?","Yes, we're going to be issuing out -- our disclosure has not changed in the EEI, so we're going to -- planning and issuing $100 million of $300 million to equity here in 2020, they will be internal sources. A lot of that is through our pension contributions. We are planning on over the next probably three to four years to be fully funded there. Next year $100 million ,to $400 million and that'll probably be a good portion of that through our pension contribution as well. We do target an 18% FFO. That really positions us well, in terms of our current credit ratings, both S&P and Moody's and Fitch.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Okay. And do you think you can hit that FFO this year? Or is that more of a target into next year?,"The target, but we do hit even in '19, we achieved 18% FFO. So that's our target and we have been bale to achieve that year in and year out."
Right. Thank you guys very much.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
"Quick question on the CapEx guidance for 2020 or you give the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion for non-utility. Which I think is a new disclosure. Could you break that down a little bit for us between pipelines, I believe, a good chunk of it for the expansion project. And then the P&I?","Close to $1 billion of that is GSP and it is tied to the milestone payment. We have a $400 million milestone payment and $600 million of capital to build out the LEAP system as well as the gathering system down there. So good bulk of this is the midstream, then the remaining amount will be on the power and industrial, and it really is tied to the origination of the $15 million per year goal that we have there."
So $1 billion GS&P is the right ballpark?,"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Right. There may be some incremental or one above that maintenance-type of capital, another potential of origination, but the bulk of that is going to be is that the new acquisition, the $1 billion."
"Thanks very much, Peter.",Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. The next question will come from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my call.,"Good morning.     Good morning, David."
"Sorry, to repeat a little bit here, but I just want to get a little more context. I believe you said a nine month collection process in the natural gas sector. I just wanted to know broadly, what does that look like for the Haynesville or the Northeast in 2020, kind of versus your multi-year production growth expectation?","Well, the reference, I made to the nine-month process is what we saw happen in 2015 and '16. I mean, every cycle will be diﬀerent of course and it's hard to predict what it will look like, but the correction has started to happen where we've seen producers start to slow activity. And we think that's the beginning of a correction to better balance supply and demand. Now demand continues to grow as I mentioned. And as it relates speciﬁcally to our portfolio 85% of our growth is contracted going forward, and with good contracts good resources strong, resources that will dispatch at the front end of that dispatch stack to bring incremental supply to the market going forward. And we're also connected to really good markets. So I -- that's what gives us conﬁdence in the GSP growth for the long-term.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. And then sort of thinking a little bit more longer term and maybe to Haynesville, but I guess, broadly speaking, when you mentioned being the front end of the dispatch stack there. So if Indigo or another producer was un-hedged and you were to have a situation where maybe the Haynesville was ﬂat or even slightly down, would it put a substantial amount of ﬁnancial distress? Or would it be something that they could do economically to continue to grow in line with the MPSC, even in a situation where the broader basin isn't growing?","Well, we saw that -- when we looked at their drilling plans for the long-term, I think what we saw was that they had very economic resources at the $2 price range for over a decade and were 15% unlevered returns. And we modeled that as well as three independent reserve consultants that looked at that with us because we got on the inside of what Indigo is able to do. So very high quality resource that's dispatchable, obviously in a signiﬁcant way at $2 and above with strong contracts, and they also have now a very strong balance sheet. They've met all their commitments to deleverage their balance sheet and there's a signiﬁcant milestone payment tied to further deleverage, where there'll be one of the -- have one of the best balance sheets in the industry, if you will going forward.  So we feel good about the contracts, feel good about the resource and feel great about the markets that they're connecting to. And one of the advantage they have from a market perspective is their proximity to one of our fastest growing markets, which is the industrial and chemical complex in the Southeast and the Gulf region, as well as the LNG export markets. So the proximity and cost to get to those markets matters and they're in really good position with us to do that."
"That makes sense. Thank you. And then so as you can see, this is a broader question. I think in the past in 2019, when you'd mentioned, potential opportunities with laterals, with natural gas power plants in the Northeast, Ohio area, I think you've done Pennsylvania in the past. I was just wondering since a number of things have actually changed with Ohio subsidies, the expanded mopar, there's been PJM auction delays and now much cheaper natural gas in the region. I'm just wondered to have some of the conversations with some of these power plant developers may have evolved over the past six months?","The conversations continue in earnest because natural gas is readily available and really economically priced. There is incentive in the Midwest to convert to natural gas from coal. So we're still seeing continued conversion opportunities in and around all our assets. So that's positive. We were also seeing -- we're working on an expansion, several expansions on our link assets. We're looking at connecting the generation pipeline to NEXUS that's progressing. We're also looking at unique optimization opportunities with our vector asset and our Bluestone asset. So lots of activities all small, but nicely accretive, exactly where we'd like it.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. That makes sense. And then sorry, just one more on the regulated side. I was just wondering if you could frame the near-term versus medium-term growth rate, especially when looking at the recent gas rate case ﬁling, where the rate base ﬁgure over two years was double- digits, in the context of -- you recently raised from 8% to 9% to 9% net income growth at that segment. How that kind of looks near-term versus the medium term ﬁve years?","Over the next ﬁve years, we're highly conﬁdent in the growth rates that we projected for both our gas utility and electric utility. The gas utility is in and around 9% income growth and we've got 7% to 8% at our electric company. So there's lots of good capital that will drive improved reliability and eﬃciencies and safety for our customers all pointed it at that.     Yes in near-term, David, I think what you're seeing in electric segment, a little bit higher growth. This year we have a renewable investment signiﬁcant renewable investment year-over-year 2020. It is close to like $550 million more. There's some new projects that we have coming in and have been pre-approved part of our renewable energy plan. So we are seeing near-term higher growth rate, but we are in the long-term to 7% to 8% electric company and the 9% for gas utility."
"Okay, great. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you for the question. The next question will come from Greg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.",
Thank you. Good morning.,Good morning.     Good morning.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I was wondering if you could touch a bit more on the development backlog for the RNG business beyond 2020? And how you think about committing capital around that?,"Sure. We've provided a forecast over to ﬁve-years in terms of growth for the RNG space and the co-gens space. So we are seeing a lot of activity on both fronts. So we are looking to originate $15 million in new internet income each and every year going forward. We feel that the last three years, we delivered on that and we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that gives us conﬁdence to deliver on that for this year. And looking -- obviously every time we deliver $15 million of new net income, that travels across the next ﬁve years, and each year, we start -- we continue to bring that forward. Good prospects both in RNG and co-gen with a low gas price environment and electricity rates continuing to March up slightly, across the Midwest and other parts of the U.S. So the co-gen business is very active as well."
"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. That is all the time, we have for questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.","Well, I'll wrap up by thanking everyone for joining the call. As we already mentioned multiple times, we had a great year in '19. I feel really good about the position we're in to continue our solid track record of delivering premium results for our shareholders. We've got one of the highest historical growth rates in the industry at 7.5%, and we'll deliver a growth rate of 7.5% this year, '19 over '20, and have great conﬁdence that this will continue into the future and deliver at the 5% to 7% EPS growth in the future as well.  So thank you very much. I look forward to providing you updates, as we move through the year, and look forward to talking to you and seeing you soon.  Operator  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
