Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar.     Good morning.     Good morning, Shar."
"So just real quick on the Generation Pipeline, could we talk a little bit on returns even in general terms and what sort of accretion we can expect sort of from this deal? How should we think about it relative to your plan? And kind of more important, when do you sort of expect to decide on the lateral oﬀ of NEXUS and could this sort of change your current assumption on the mix of short-term versus long-term contracts?","Hi, we'll have Jerry Norcia dive into that one for you, Shar.     So we expect that certainly to be accretive, it does meet our returns thresholds for this business. So we're happy with the returns. In terms of strategic value, it is 4 miles oﬀ of the NEXUS pipeline and our plan is to interconnect NEXUS to this pipeline and that will provide signiﬁcant market access for the NEXUS pipeline of over 300 million a day and growing as we attach new customers on that line and will create value for our shippers in the future."
Okay.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"So it's signiﬁcant [ph], I'd say 350 million with the potential to expand that is a really nice interconnection of market area load for this pipe. We've always said that the route across Northern Ohio, which allow -- we had interconnection points all along that pipe we -- that from early on that we expected those to play out over time with load addition opportunities and we had struck a couple of those earlier. But this is one we really like. And so as Jerry mentioned, the deal itself, which is fully contracted is accretive. But we think there's upside opportunity to this as we pursue growth in that area and it also has opportunity for NEXUS clearly as we interconnected."
Do you think you'll be in a position to sort of update on that incremental growth opportunities as we head into EEI?,In the fall?
Yeah.,"Yeah, I think we could -- we'll probably have the acquisition, obviously, clearly in hand and we will probably have our thinking advanced about potential timing of interconnection and things like that. So we'll give you what we can additional at EEI."
"Excellent. And then just lastly on the RNG deals that were just announced. Can you just -- what's the structure of the deals sort of the tenure of the contracts, the returns? And should we just for modeling purposes assume they start to contribute in the second half of this year?","Yeah, the deals that we closed just in the recent past will be tied to -- we use various contracting methods to secure revenues, there is ability to hedge the product. There's also ability to have long term contracts. So we're in the process of making all that happened right now.     So without getting into -- not wanting to reveal stuﬀ that's conﬁdential to the business, I would say that we always have the oﬀtake of these locked up. And then you can do ﬁxed price contracts, so sometimes ﬁxed price contracts if you do or may not have the return that you get   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   when you hedge them. So we got some that are ﬁxed price, some that are hedged and you could take some of these open in the short term too if you like the short-term price dynamics and then hedge them later. So, I think we'll end up with, Shar, as a portfolio that we manage in that way with oﬀtakes clearly locked down and then prices managed through contracts and hedging to make sure that we like the predictability of it."
"Thanks, guys. I'll jump in the queue. Congrats on the execution.",Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Hey. So just to follow-up a little bit on Shar's question if you can. Obviously, 150 million to 200 million for this ﬁrst transaction. Can you elaborate a little bit further on how you're thinking about ﬁlling up the remainder of potential even white space for acquisitions here in the GSP side? I suppose there is ample latitude in the capital budget bill for further such deals and to the extent to which you are looking at them. Are we looking at sort of more platforms? Or we looking at more simple bolt-ons in Link and NEXUS more narrowly?","Julien, I would say our ﬁrst order dispatch, we have a series of organic development opportunities that we're pursuing. So that will be our ﬁrst order dispatch for capital. And, yes, we do have additional ﬂexibility in our capital plan to accommodate the organic developments. In addition, we're always surveying in the market for potential bolt-ons in and around our platform. We'd like for them to be contiguous just like the most recent one will become   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   contiguous over time. So the order dispatches organic development, which we see the highest return potential from and then acquisitions that have growth potential in them."
Got it. But you aren't necessarily saying whether it would be more bolt-on versus larger platform acquisitions at this point?,"No, we -- Julien, we judge all that by the merits of the returns and economics. So I think we told investors last year that we were looking prior to the -- an acquisition and eventually concluded didn't meet our return requirements, didn't create value for us. So we walked away from it. This one we liked. And we like the future growth potential. So this one probably turn out to be an acquisition that's then followed by organic growth, which usually leads to really good result and dollars spent on acquisitions is not nearly as good a measure as value created through often organic upside, which is sort of high-value EPS growth and we love that sort of stuﬀ. So if we can do more like the one we just did, we love to; there are good opportunities, the scale that's comfortable with upside, those are -- those produce really good value."
"Excellent. Then if I can just quickly complementing that speaking of organic growth. What is reﬂected in your current plan with respect to the voluntary renewable expansion? So you talked about 280 megawatts is being signed up, a third one on the way, and then an additional 300 megawatt in total. So out of that, almost 600 megawatt what's reﬂected in your outlook in advance?","Yeah, we have 300 megawatts in the plan that we laid out for you at EEI, but we did talk at that time about the potential to go up. So I think with 280 megawatts signed up with another contract waiting in the queue. We're sort of through the ﬁrst 300 megawatts and working our way into the next 300 megawatts. And this is an area we like, it's obviously for ﬁlling a need for our customers they want it. But it also is a way to move the state forward in terms of additions of renewable capacity, but do it in a way that isn't rate base, doesn't work its way through rate cases, it works its way through this approved tariﬀs. And so we really like this area and we're going to continue to work with customers who have the goal to help accelerate things here in Michigan and to -- there is obvious value for these customers in terms of their own proﬁle and what they can communicate to their customer basis. So it's a good area for us to work and we're into the second 300 megawatts now. And you know, as we look forward, I think there's maybe upside to that as we continue to -- we're working with our very largest customers, but -- we have a lot of customers. So we're thinking now about how to make more of this."
Excellent. Thank you all.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael, are you there?"
"Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ﬁnd out about the equity issuance. Recently, the $250 million of internal funding, at what point do you think you'll have to complete the complete plan with the block issuance at some point?","We are in early stages of looking at that right now. We still do have some room in our pension plan to get equity, we're at about 85% funded level in our pension plan. And I'd say within the three-year window part of the back half of that. And we're probably looking at more ATMs attributables versus the big block equity issuance."
"Right. And on the Generation Pipeline, one question I had is, are you anticipating expansion through compression in addition to the lateral as part of the value proposition to that?","Right now our ﬁrst order business is to look to connect that pipeline to the NEXUS, it does have the fact that NEXUS carries a very high pressure as it helps create some potential.     So that's one of the values NEXUS can bring to this pipe is that itself is very high pressure and that can create -- that can create expansion capability and growth capability for this pipe alone."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And I've got a lot of questions about the Link asset and what is the contracted status there? And then also what are the expansion opportunities that you're looking at? And what's the plan for expansion down there?,We had planned expansions and those are progressing as scheduled. So those will continue into this year for one of our large clients on that pipeline. The status of the pipe is that it's performing better than the performance that we had described to our investors. So we feel really good about that asset and its dynamics.
Okay and thank you very much.,"Thank you.     Thank you, Michael.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Please go ahead."
"Good morning. Just ﬁnishing the M&A topic in the GSP sector, so last year you guys were preparing as in the sense for some acquisitions seemingly in that sector. At least for 2019, do you think that you are done with this Generation Pipeline deal?","You know, Angie, it's -- I think in M&A to say you're done or not done probably wouldn't be smart on our part because totally depends upon whether there is an opportunity with really good value. I mean, if we look at a handful of them this year and there's no value, we don't do any. And if we look at them or as we do continue to scan the environment and we ﬁnd one that we really like, we could do on this year. So it's completely I'd say market and opportunity dependent."
"Okay. And changing topics on your regulated electric utility. So, last year, we were hoping to see a CapEx rider on the electric side. We saw the CMS's rate case, they didn't get the rider.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Could you give us an update, what are your thoughts about that and when such a rider would be achievable?","You know, in our case, it's in our rate case that that discussion is playing out. So, last year, we did introduce the idea of it because we were ﬁling the case. And if you look at the staﬀ reactions to our case, I think you'll ﬁnd the commentary around the infrastructure recovery mechanism is positive, although they suggest that perhaps ﬁnalizing, it should be done outside of a rate case. So with the opportunity for more deﬁnition of the details, I guess you'd say, that could be the case. It's possible that the commissioners will feel they have enough information on record to establish it. So that really we will see through the ﬁnalization of the case. But if you're asking how do we feel about continued quality of discussions around this at the commission, we feel good. We feel that there has been constructive engagement with the staﬀ and prior to the case with the commissioners on this. And that it's set up for continued discussion. I think they just want to get it right. We have one other gas company, it's operated very well. So that shows that well-designed mechanism can work well here in Michigan. And so I think the process we're in now is getting the design right and get getting both sides comfortable that we're ready to move forward with this."
Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citi. Please go ahead.
"Thanks so much. Hi, guys.",Hello.     Good morning.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Hi. So, just following up on Angie's question on the regulation and the rate case, given the new Governor and new Commissioners, how do you see that playing out? Do you see that impacting the process and what kind of regulatory kind of sentiment, or more do you see going forward with the environment in Michigan?","So we have -- we do have two sitting Commissioners that we've worked with for quite some time now. And they obviously can keep the commission ﬂowing and active in the near term. That said, we do expect one appointment to play out shorter-term and then the other would come after July when -- no, I'm sorry, will retire. And wouldn't make any sense to be speculating or commenting on speciﬁc Commissioners. But I would just say that we've had inﬂow and outﬂow of commissioners and governors across many years here at DTE including the 10 that we mentioned earlier where our ﬁnancial performance has been strong and steady. And our job is to work really well with the Commissioners that the Governor appoints.  We know the governor well, worked with her through the long career in the Michigan Legislature and since then and we work closely with her on the agenda that she has for the state moving forward. And I think she understands that the appointments to this sector, it's big sector with heavy investment in the state, I think she understands how important these appointments are. So I'm conﬁdent we'll get a competent person."
"Got you. Thank you. And then maybe just a speciﬁc question on this -- on the results and on the Corporate and Other segment. The 122 negative versus 100 to 110 range, you said there was a speciﬁc one-time item that kind of drove that. Could you provide any -- little bit more color around what kind of drove that Corporate and Other segment impact?","Yeah. This is Peter Oleksiak, we had a contribution to our DTE foundation and other charitable causes. This is part of our strategy to be a force for growth and good in our communities that really sets us up nicely, and as we have strong results for the year we like to do that. So this year we did -- in 2018 we did roughly about 20 million after-tax between the two."
"I got you and that was incremental to the plan. So that was something you plan to -- you hadn't planned for, but then kind of did at the very end in 2018.","It was incremental to plan. So if you adjust 2018 results for that, you'll see it's in line with our 2019 guidance for that segment."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Got you. Understood. And then ﬁnally quickly, just back to Generation Pipeline acquisition. Just wanted to understand, why the range of 150 to 200, if you have a deal, is that range to kind of not provide more speciﬁcs, so that you kind of keep the economics a little vague, or is there anything speciﬁc around the range of the price?",We're -- the deal is ﬁnalized and we do have conﬁdentiality agreements in place and this is what our counterparty is comfortable with at this point in time.
I got you.,"So you did ask about revealing the speciﬁc number and they just didn't want to do that. And you can understand that is they are active in the marketplace maybe in another positions, they want to keep their hand a little vague. So this was the agreement we reached with them."
"I got you. But there is no speciﬁc term in the contract that would change the price, the price is ﬁxed. There isn't earn-out or anything else that kind of drives the price -- drives any change in the price going forward?",The price is ﬁxed.
The price is ﬁxed. Thank you.,"Price is ﬁxed. We still want to be clear about it. We are happy to be clear, they weren't. So it is what it is."
"No. Understood. You've seen that in the past and understandable from their perspective. So, appreciate the color, guys. Thank you.",Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   We will now take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Thanks. Good morning. I think you pretty much answered, just answered my question. So at some point in the future, we'll get more speciﬁc purchase price ﬁnancing and expected EBITDA contribution of the pipe, but for now you're just limited is what you can say, fair?","Yeah, I think, certainly we're limited and what we can say and we may ﬁnd that the seller is okay with us down the road, being more speciﬁc and if that's the case, we will be."
I see that the owner is Generation Pipeline LLC. Do we know -- can you disclose to us who owns Generation Pipeline LLC?,"No, that's under CAL so."
"Okay. And then one other. But you did say that going in day one, the investment hits your traditional cost of capital hurdles for a pipeline investment and that over time as you integrate it into the NEXUS system you expect that to expand?","Yes, I mean, I'll be honest with you, if we never improve the pipe a bit, we're happy with the returns. But value, we always say, the -- the value and heat in these sorts of investments is what you can do with them once they become part of your portfolio. So, yes, happy with the returns from the contracts that are in place for the pipe. We have the belief that there is good value to create beyond that."
"Yeah, I was able to ﬁnd a map -- a detailed map of the pipelines route online, and it does look like it goes through some pretty densely -- dense industrial areas. Some -- the assumption being once you build that lateral that you'll be able to boost the volumes and maybe boost the contracted volumes on NEXUS by serving those customers, is that the obvious synergy from this?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yes, absolutely. I think that's exactly our plan."
Okay. And one other --,So that part of Toledo is where heavy industry plays out. So it's an area where I think there's an opportunity to -- for our producers tied to NEXUS to be able to deliver into that base over time through this pipeline. So be good for that industrial community and good for us too.
"Okay. One ﬁnal question, and maybe it's semantics. But on the -- in the EEI deck, you said very speciﬁcally you're targeting 5% to 7% operating EPS growth through 2023, I think your language was slightly diﬀerent in your script today, but is that still your commitment?","Yeah, it was slightly diﬀerent. It wasn't meant to be. It's exactly what we said at EEI 5% to 7% operating EPS."
I just wanted to make sure that that was on the record guys. Thanks.,"Yeah, you bet."
Have a good morning.,"You too.     Thanks, Greg.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   We will now take our next question from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. Just on the returns on the generation pipeline, kind of how do we think about your hurdle rates for that segment kind of a little bit north of utility hurdle rates?","Yes. That's where we like to start. But I think what's proved out over time is if you can buy and start there -- either construct and start there or buy and start there, the value comes from the options that it presents down the road or upside."
"I think you've already said this, but you're already there, correct?",Yeah. Correct.
And what kind of capital structure should we assume on that accretive analysis?,"It's 50-50.     It's 50-50, Paul."
"And then getting an IRM on the electric side is not legislative, that's all before the commission, I think you said that earlier?",That's correct.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. Thank you very much.,The other positive thing in our current regular rate cases that the commission has been very supportive of the capital that we're planning to invest in the electric utility.
Thank you very much and congratulations on the year. Appreciate it. Thank you.,"Thank you.     Thanks, Paul.  Operator  We'll now take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard. Go ahead."
"Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question, this also similar to Greg. It might just be semantics, but I want to clarify. The EEI slide deck, you said you were targeting strong investment-grade credit ratings. Now it looks like targeting changed to maintaining. Is there anything to that? I mean, are the metrics where you want them to be and particularly after this acquisition?","Yeah, there's nothing -- nothing meant through that. Peter, if you want to say more?     No, we deﬁnitely are committed to our ratings and we are targeting to have a strong credit ratings that we have today. It gives us a lot of ﬂexibility to have a strong balance sheet and it's been proven out over the years.     Actually, our FFO results for the last year played out stronger because of the cash ﬂow and earnings. So we had good strong FFO-to-debt and when you do that, it builds in some strength or ﬂexibility forward. So we're probably in a better position than we were when we to you at EEI.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Got it. Just wanted to make sure you weren't changing the messaging. Next question is relative to the last week's cold snap. How would you describe the utility natural gas supply that's going into this snap? And how are you positioned for the rest of the winter?,"Well, we are positioned really well going into it. I'll just describe the day for you. We did hit design conditions on our -- during those peak conditions, and we moved about 4.5 billion cubic feet of gas through the gas utility that day, of which 2.5 billion was destined for our in-franchise customers and 2 billion we were exporting to other interstate pipelines that served markets as far as New York, Wisconsin, Chicago. So we were extremely well positioned to move gas in that day.     Does that answer the question or --?"
"Yes, just wondering how you're positioned going forward. If we have another coal stretch, is that going to be trouble?",We welcome it. We're well positioned for it.
"Good. Next question on the electric side. The weather normalized sales were ﬂat for the year, obviously, given the extreme weather this past summer. It's hard to do math on that. But my question is, what's your estimate of the impact of energy eﬃciency these days? And what's embedded in your guidance for 2019 and beyond?","Andrew, we did have ﬂat sales 2018 versus 2017. When you look at the residential sector in particular, we had ﬂat usage. But we have customer count, it's very healthy 0.7% increase on customer counts. So, really there is an awful energy eﬃciencies. Energy eﬃciency deﬁnitely helping our customers. We do have targeted energy eﬃciency programs there."
And what can be the outlook?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"So what we're building into forward plans is very ﬂat. There just isn't growth. We aren't counting on it. Frankly, we -- I don't want to sound the wrong way, but we don't want it. We want these energy eﬃciency programs to really bite through our customers, because it helps manage their bills and their aﬀordability at a time when we're making signiﬁcant investments at capital. And that's the whole trick here is to help customers, keep their energy cost aﬀordable, while we really fundamentally reinvest in the assets and our business. And so we're driving that eﬃciency side hard. Now there are things that are growing, and as Peter said, we're getting customer count additions, we got a lot of construction in the City of Detroit and so on and so forth. So they are healthy signs, but we are working the eﬃciency side of it hard."
"I like the strategy. Maybe one last one if I could squeeze it in here. An update on the volumes ﬂowing through NEXUS. And how -- if NEXUS does connect to Generation, how much capacity is there on NEXUS to add that 355 and potentially more?","Well, ﬁrst, I'll say that NEXUS is ﬂowing at its current capacity and that will also increase over time as we bring more assets online, as it relates to the upstream portion of NEXUS. In terms of connecting Generation Pipeline, it will provide a signiﬁcant market outlet and demand source for the pipeline. So we expect that as we make those connections, two things will happen: one is, it will make the pipeline much more attractive for our current shippers and also for our future shippers. And the question of, could we accept all of that on the NEXUS? The answer is yes."
Great. Thank you very much.  Operator  We will now take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.,
"Yeah. Hi, good morning. So just ﬁrst on the curious kind of your view on Northeast gas. So we had some of the producers come out and I think the production expectations for this year comment a little bit lower than people expected. So just how are they coming in with kind of what you're planning for this year on your system?","Good question, Steve. We -- obviously, we've been watching that very closely on our platforms and all of the projections of the producers that we do business with are in line with our current   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   guidance and on our current forecast. So we're feeling really good about it at this point. Also, I think we kind of see this discipline that's entering the market is positive for the long-term with producers and in addition to that, we see this as short-term phenomenon because the demand for the product is there. And I think as producers get healthier, it will help improve the -- I think the price complex for the producers as this discipline sets in.     So Steve, just to add to that. As Jerry said, I think there's -- producers are being encouraged by investors to show capital discipline and there has been this ﬂip in the market from investors really looking for how fast can you grow production to show me the cash ﬂow, show me the healthy cash ﬂow. And so they're all being encouraged to show capital discipline. And that can wiggle things in the short run. As Jerry just said, we -- it's -- we don't see it for us, it's in line with our plan. But when you think about this longer term, the production is what it is. I mean, the demand will be what it is from the Power and Industrial and LDC sectors and declines in well productivity happen every year and those need to be fulﬁlled, those need to be backﬁlled. The clients and the demand growth needs to be met. And so even though there's capital discipline, that's really a short run phenomenon. You get into the medium and long-term and that's just dictated by the realities of supply and demand. And so we continue to see the region that we're serving very well positioned to continue to meet and grow as that plays out."
"Okay. Great. And then just one question, high level on the equity issuance that you're planning the 1 billion to 1.5 billion. So just to clarify, and I guess this really goes back to EEI. Does that include an assumption of more acquisitions beyond what you said or not? So if you announced a larger one, would that potentially already be embedded in there?","It assumes we have -- each of the segments we provided disclosure around the level of capital spend. So it does assume capital spend on each of those platforms and subsidiaries. And as Jerry Norcia mentioned, our ﬁrst order business is greenﬁeld, but in many cases, instead a greenﬁeld we'll do acquisitions occasionally. I'll just (inaudible) all-in capital spend and that's really what supporting that equity issuance plan."
Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.,Thank you.     Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   We will now take our next question from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Hi, guys, good morning.","Good morning, David."
"Thanks. On the Generation Pipeline, this was some quick research, so I apologize. Let me now if I'm wrong here. But it looks like they ﬁled for an Ironville Lateral already that could begin construction as early as Feb 25th. Is this something that was anticipated and expected as part of the purchase price?",Yes.
"Okay. And then with those sort of opportunities, especially because this is a little more exposed to Ohio industrials, do you see this as presenting a competitive advantage for P&I as well on maybe the combined heat and gas opportunities in the future?","We are having some of those conversations, but I wouldn't say any of them are well advanced. But there are potential synergies between the two businesses, for sure."
Okay. Thanks guys. Congrats on good year.,Thank you.     Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
"Hey, guys, just a quick follow up. I just was noticing that the sequentially earnings at the GSP business decline in the fourth quarter versus the ﬁrst three quarters of the year. Just wondering if you could explain that and what drives the seasonality of that or whatever it is?","David, Peter, you want to --?     No, we can probably get back to Michael. My ﬁrst sense is that we had strong kind of mid year with the summer and some of the ﬂows gases, some of them may just be some gas volume as it related to some of our pipelines.     Peter, this is David. I think this is maybe the timing of how each platform plays over the course of the year.     I think we can have somebody good here. It was nothing material or anything really that we took notice of. So if you're seeing that we'll -- we can do a tic and tac for you and just tell you what it was. We saw some seasonality there, obviously, because our pipes ﬂow hot and heavy and hard at certain times of the year like they have been this past month, and other parts of the year less so, so that produces some variation."
All right. Thanks a lot guys. Have a great day.,"Thank you.     Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Gerry Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.     Well, I want to say thanks again to all you for joining the call and for the good questions. As I said at the beginning of the call, I feel great about the year that we had in 2018, not only ﬁnancially, but on a lot of other fronts that goes such a long way to keeping the context here in Michigan positive. And I feel really good about the position we're in heading into 2019 both the start of the year and the plan that we have for the balance of the year. I think we're in a really good position to deliver another good year and strong results for you all. And we look forward to providing you updates on all of that as we move forward. Thanks again for joining. We will talk to all of you soon.  Operator  This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.
