Question,Answer
First question is about the $3 billion of additional investment from the retirement of coal generation by 2023. That's correct?,"Good morning.     Good morning.     Yeah. The timeframe – so we're going to work through (21:11) process and work through, with our regulators, the phasing of both the retirements and the investment, but we do expect that to play out by 2023. Yes."
Is that part of the $18 billion that you had previously announced for 10 years?,Yes.
Okay. So that number of $18 billion doesn't change?,That's correct.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay. And on NEXUS, I just wanted to – I think you mentioned this, but could you reiterate the level of interconnect agreements versus the capacity of the pipeline, and also how those interconnect agreements are being converted over to full contracts?","Yeah. The pipeline is 1.5 Bcf, and the interconnect agreements are 1.75 Bcf. Those interconnects are independent of what we already have contracted on the pipeline (22:00). Maybe I'll hand it over to Jerry Norcia to talk about – probably the process and timing for converting those to contracts.     Sure. Thanks, Gerry. So right now, the pipe is two-thirds full, and the environment, as we see it, is starting to improve signiﬁcantly in that region, in the production region that NEXUS serves our gas pipes (22:21). So we're seeing renewed interest in terms of discussions from the producers, as well as, we're progressing a series of conversations along the pipeline in Ohio and in Michigan and other markets – in Ontario, as well as other parts of the Midwest, where customers are interested in (22:43) capacity. So we're conﬁdent that by the time the pipe goes into service, we will have more market commitment for this pipe (22:50)."
"Okay. Thanks. And now, hey, one last question. You're going to – you mentioned that you might push oﬀ the equity raise this year, but I noticed in the guidance, the share count isn't diﬀerent. That's obviously just for convention, or...?","Yeah. We are still planning on the $100 million, but we're really monitoring that the summer regular the (23:14) weather, we get additional revenue, also the cash ﬂow is coming into the year. So we are looking at potentially deferring it, the material right now does reﬂect the $100 million (23:23)."
All right. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will now take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Shar."
"So just on the NEXUS, the additional conversations you're sort of having in the Midwest, can you just maybe disclose whether that's with shippers or additional LDC or electric demand?","I guess, primarily with other LDCs."
Yeah.,(24:00) Ohio also involves power producers as well.
Okay. Got it. And it's too early to ﬁgure out whether this thing can be upsized to a little over 2 Bcf?,"Correct.     Yeah. That will be later. I think step one is, bring it in, get it well contracted for current capacity. And step two then is to take on expansions. And expansions, as we've talked in the past, they always bring good economic value.     One of the things that we're ﬁnding, that I'll add, is the – a lot of the pipelines that are greenﬁeld pipelines, that are proposing to take gas out of this region, are facing signiﬁcant delays and oppositions. And right now, our pipe is not faced with that. So we feel that we may be one of the ﬁrst greenﬁeld pipes to the market.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it. That's helpful. And then, just on the coal retirements; is there any more upside to that retirement, because even if you shift to the latter part of the decade, you'll still have a little over 3.5 gigawatts of coal, or is that sort of you see that envision within the portfolio?","So by the end of 2030, I think we'll have everything retired at our Monroe plant. The Monroe plant is the one plant that we invested in scrubbers and SCRs. It's a big plant, it's 3,000 megawatts. But that will be what remains, and essentially all the other coal will be retired and replaced through that plan of renewables and gas that I described."
"Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, on the growth trajectory, on the earnings standpoint, how should we think about it oﬀ the higher base of $5.05? Is it sort of supportive? Are you comfortable at 5% to 6% growth oﬀ of $5.05, or still within that $4.93 is the base?","We're indicating at this point it's oﬀ the original guidance. We'll continue to assess 2017 and beyond. But at this point, it's oﬀ the original guidance.     So that's been pretty much our pattern, is that our original guidance, if we exceed, we grow earnings oﬀ the original guidance than the prior year. But I guess, I'd just keep pulling you back to actual performance, which has been 6.5%. So I think, our pattern is pretty well established at this point."
Thanks. Solid results. Congrats.,Thank you. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Neel Mitra from Tudor Securities. Please go ahead.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Neel.     Good morning, Neel."
"I had another question on the NEXUS pipeline. You expressed that there had been a lot of support from Michigan, (26:48) Attorney General come out with some opposition. Can you just remind us the process? Does the commission ultimately have to rule on the utility contracts, and when would that be?","So let me comment on the Attorney General ﬁrst. If you watch sort of energy discussions and dynamics in Michigan, our rate cases and most things, it gets ﬁled around energy. There's usually a challenge of some sort or another, put out by the Attorney General. You just need to understand whether or not the challenge really is fundamental. But it's still – that's just the way of saying not unusual or surprised (27:32) dynamics. Don, maybe you can talk about timeframe for inclusion. Don Stanczak is here with us. He heads our Regulatory Aﬀairs. He can talk about how the inclusion of NEXUS would play out at the utility (27:46).     So as Gerry indicated in his comments earlier, we've already put NEXUS in our PSCR cost recovery plan. I think it covers a ﬁve-year period, and of course, the ﬁrst cost will actually incur within (28:02) 2017. So the real key will be our PSCR plan in 2017 and the reconciliation where we actually get recovery of those costs.     And that was a case being reviewed, that I quoted from earlier, where the staﬀ was (28:20) their comments."
"Got it. Okay. And then my second question. Could you just generally comment on what's going on in the Power & Industrial segment? Is it seasonality, because right now, I guess, you're at $38 million of earnings versus $90 million to $100 million for the full-year, and then in the presentation, you commented on maybe some weaker steel oﬀset by more positive REF earnings?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Neel, there's two dynamics happening. Now, one of them you mentioned was the seasonality that will occur with our REF units, actually the ﬁrst quarter with a little bit lower volumes given the warm weather, winter we're seeing actually reverse coming here in the summer with a hot weather we're experiencing. (29:08) there is back-end loading that will occur with our REF units. We did have some planned maintenance outages. We have wood waste renewable plant so that those planned outages did occur this year in the second quarter. So there is seasonality related to those earnings as well for the planned maintenance outages. We came into the year understanding the depressed steel market (29:32) into plan, and the onset was the REF units, and the volume related to REF, and that's playing out as designed.     I guess, one comment would be that, just as in the E&P sector, you're beginning to feel the turn there. Same in steel, that there you're beginning to feel the turn in the steel sector. So I think it begins to bode well for 2017 and 2018 as that sector gets some win behind it."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc.     Hey, Paul."
Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter.,Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
Just kind of pick up at DTE Gas. Just wondering how much of that is kind of leaning out the business in response to the ﬁrst quarter?,"It is. It is basically all of that. You look at the year-to-date results, year-over-year they're relatively ﬂat. We knew going into the year, we're going to have a warm ﬁrst quarter that did play out, and we plan for the rest of the year to make it up. And the second quarter, the O&M levels, in particular, were down quite a bit that helped oﬀset those ﬁrst quarter earnings. One thing we're looking at right now given the strength in our Electric utility, and we always like to manage typically on combined utility bases that we essentially will start investing back into the gas utility and getting those O&M levels back to normal levels."
"So if we look for the balance of the year at gas, as far as O&M, have you caught up kind of where you want to be?",We still have some investment we're going to making for the balance of the year. We are still committed to the guidance range as well for that segment.
"And then, if you were to expand NEXUS from 1.5 Bcf to 2 Bcf, that's just incremental compression. What would that involve and what's the capital opportunity?","Jerry, you want to take that?     Sure. It would involve, to get to 2 Bcf a day, would involve some compression and some looping (31:41) on the 36-inch pipe."
And any sense of the capital?,"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Not yet. That's something that we haven't worked out quite yet. We're trying to get to the 1.5 Bcf ﬁrst, and then, I think, we'll quickly move to that 1.75 Bcf once the pipeline gets built, and people starts to get interested in more economic expansions."
"And then lastly, is there anything going on behind the scenes in Lansing with regards to energy policy and legislation?","So we continue to work this summer with some of the principles. I think what's likely come fall is that there will be activity again in the Senate. Kind of running out of time there with all the dynamics in the legislature between plants and roads and Detroit schools and things. So I think, there will be activity in the Senate. And then there'll be a chance that something could get passed in the Senate in the session in September, but we'll see. And then, I think, everybody will watch the election, and see what the election dynamics mean for the Michigan legislature, with the possibility that we would pick back up and pass legislation in the lame duck session at the end of the year. So if legislation is going to pass this year, would be in the lame duck. I guess I'd keep reminding folks that this is not so much a ﬁnancial discussion, in fact it's not a ﬁnancial discussion, really doesn't aﬀect our ﬁve-year plan. But it is an energy reliability discussion. And at some point or another, we need to get – we need to be clear on who is building power plants for 10% of the market, and right now the answer is, nobody. And until we get policy in place that ensures that somebody does it, there's risk of reliability issues for the state. So if it doesn't happen this year, it'll happen at some point when it becomes clear that we need to take care of that."
Thank you for the update.,"You're welcome.     Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please proceed."
"Yeah. Hi. Good morning. The higher guidance for 2016 for the midstream segment, I might have missed this, but can you just explain what's driving that for the full year guidance?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Some of that – we are seeing a strong earnings coming across the multiple segments and sub- segments in it, and projects within that. It's tightening the guidance, pulling up that bottom end of the range. So we are seeing strong results for the year, and so we're feeling comfortable now of pulling up that bottom end of the range.     What it doesn't include, Steve, is the increased drilling activity that we now expect. So I think (34:38) for example (34:40) calls, they're now back drilling again. They have been completing ducks (34:45) and they continue that, but we'll be drilling again in our region. And so that has the potential to help with some strength for the balance of the year. But as Peter said earlier, and particularly – it particularly sets up well for next year."
"Okay. But, you noted that it does not include Southwest most recent announcement.",Correct.
Okay.,(35:13) would be upside to this year.
"Okay. And then, one of the areas you've talked about for growth at P&I is co-generation. So I'm wondering if there's any update on new opportunities there.","I would say that the portfolio discussions there on co-generation is as full and interesting as it's been in years. And we don't have one to tell you about that's popped yet, but I think we all feel that, out of that portfolio discussions, we're going to have some that do play through. So we hope to be able to give you a positive update sometime over the next six months."
Okay. Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. We move on to our next question now from Brian Chin from Bank of America. Please go ahead."
Hi. Good morning.,"Hey, Brian.     Good morning, Brian."
"Just piggybacking oﬀ, the Swinn (36:17) question. Is there a sense of sensitivity that you can give? We've seen how many rig announcements Southwestern has announced over the last few days here. But is there a sense of sensitivity that you might be able to help us calibrate a little bit?","We've seen two rigs move into the area that we're operating with Southwestern. So that's a very encouraging sign. So our expectation is that they'll continue to complete the ducks, as well as drill new wells with those two rigs.     And when you say sensitivity, you're talking about upside this year and what it means for next year. Is that what I'm hearing?"
That would be helpful. Yes.,"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. I think that what we probably ought to do is, let our team get a better sense for kind of the pace of completions, and what we're seeing there put a fence over that (37:10). Maybe we can be clear about what we see in terms of impacts this year and next, maybe on the next call."
"Great. And then, just going back to the...",(37:20) I don't think we played it all the way through.
"Understood. And then, just going back to the equity issuance question. So you gave a little bit more clarity on the equity issuance thoughts this time. Can you talk about, for the $200 million to $300 million equity issuance for the next two years to three years, should we be marginally shading our thought process on 2017 and 2018 as well, or do you still feel comfortable with the $200 million to $300 million in equity issuance over the next two years to three years?","I'm still feeling comfortable with the $200 million to $300 million in the next two years to three years. It really does relate to the amount of capital spend we're spending at both our utilities and our non-utility business. So (38:05) we really want to maintain the strong balance sheet, thus set us up nicely. It's good even in this period of time having a strong balance sheet, so it's $200 million to $300 million until we see other way."
Excellent. Thank you very much.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. As there are no further questions in the queue, I will hand back to the speaker for any additional or closing remarks. Thank you.     We had Gregg Orrill. Did he sign oﬀ? We had heard Gregg wanted to come in with a question.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   He removed himself from the queue. Thank you.     Removed himself. Well, great. Well then, we're out of questions.  Operator  Sorry for that. He just came back. Sorry for that. He just moved back to the queue. I will take his question now if you wish.     Pretty good.  Operator  Perfect."
"Thanks Gerry.  Operator  (38:59) is open, please.",
"Two quick ones. On the DTE Electric variance analysis for the quarter, there was a negative $8 million around rate base and other. What was that, was that bonus depreciation?","No, it's standard actually (39:21) depreciation on the new capital spend come again in property tax (39:27)."
"I got it. Okay. And then on the PSCR, when are you looking for the outcome on that? And are there any other – I guess, we've talked about the drivers in general. Is there anything else that you would point out that's noteworthy there?",On the PSCR case?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
Yeah.,"Okay. I'll have Don answer that as well in terms of when that will play out.     So in terms of the timing, I'd expect the commission order later this year, split (39:58) into next year. And again, as Gerry indicated earlier, having support from Michigan Agency for Energy and committee chairs of the legislature, all that bodes well for a good result (40:18).     We've spent a lot of time talking to the Energy committee chairs, the MEDC, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, and the agent, the administration, about NEXUS. So they kind of get how it ﬁts into the gas supply picture here in the state is the state (40:35). Both we and consumers are transitioning oﬀ a lot of fuel supply from coal to gas. So they've taken the time to understand it. I think the letters of support, the statements of support are really based upon their belief that this is good for the customers, most importantly good for economic development and the state as well."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you.  I think, with that, we are done with questions. So I would just reiterate what I said at the outset. Six months in we're oﬀ to a really good start ﬁnancially and otherwise. So we look forward to giving you another positive update in three months. And thanks very much for joining us this morning.
