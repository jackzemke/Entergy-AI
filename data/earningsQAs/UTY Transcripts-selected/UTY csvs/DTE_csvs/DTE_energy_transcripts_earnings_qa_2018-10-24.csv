Question,Answer
Guys.,Good morning Shar.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Good morning Shar.     Good morning Shar.
"Just on the -- just real quick on the incremental REF tax equity transactions. In prior deals you've announced, you've obviously tempered your equity needs. Then so curious on this incremental $100 million you're getting. Does that sort of further tamper your viewpoints on your needs for equity at least in the near term?",Shar that was contemplated in our guidance that we have in our long-range plan. We would not amortizing and hitting this cash ﬂow in.
Okay got it. And then just real quick on sort of links. It's obviously missing from the slides and appreciate the update that you guys gave us on NEXUS. Can you just give like a little top-level view on sort of how that projects going expansion? Is it tracking ahead? And should we assume is that obviously going to be a big update on this given the fact that it's missing from your slides?,"Shar this is Jerry. Link is performing very well, as I mentioned in my comments, all of our platforms are performing better than expected and Link would fall into that category as well. You asked about expansions, those are progressing well. So we're really good about that asset at this point in time."
Are you within your $0.10 accretion targets for '19? Or should we assume there are some upside there?,I think as I mentioned in some of our prior calls we -- our pro forma internally was higher than that $0.10. And we're performing -- we're meeting our internal performance. So we're doing better than the $0.10.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Okay, got it. And then just lastly on on-site generation. Do you expect to provide some updates there incremental to the Ford deal at EEI?",Yes. We'll give you an update on both the co-generation project queue and developments and how that feels as well as the RNG projects at EEI. And really the overall P&I earnings forecast for 2023. So we had that $70 million number out a couple years ago. We told you that's obsolete. It's going to be higher and we'll pin down a forecast for you when we're together at EEI.
"Great. It's good to see you guys, you're back-ﬁlling the REF earnings. Congrats. Thanks guys.",Thank you.     Thanks Shar.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.
Hi. Good morning guys.,Hi Michael.     Good morning.     Good morning.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Glad to see the -- taking the long view of Detroit Tigers with a winning record anyway. That's good. On the REF earnings, the REF projects I guess you announced there were two projects closed in 2018 under construction. Does this put you still on track for $45 million by the end of the second year I guess to ﬁll another $15 million this year with three to four projects?",Those are -- you said REF but you meant RNG projects.
"I mean RNG. I mean RNG, yeah.",Yes. It puts us at least on track to that. So two years in we would have hit that number but I think what we communicated is that that $45 million number is sort of obsolete at this point. We're fully expect to go well by that.
Got you. And on NEXUS the two-thirds are contracted still or is there any progress on the remaining third?,"Well, we've got $350 million a day approximately ﬂowing today on short-term contracts. And our long-term contracts going about $840 million a day start to ﬂow in around November 1. So we're feeling pretty good about how the pipe's ﬁlling up."
Got you. And on regulatory progress for the next I guess the distribution enhancement plans and also the next rate case ﬁlings. How's that going at the utilities?,"The -- at the Electric company, the gas case we completed and we got an acceleration of our gas main renewal program from a 25-year program to a 18-year program. So that was very positive. On the Electric case, we ﬁled for an introduction renewal mechanism as well. That covers about $1 billion a year of CapEx and that's connected to reliability and modernization investments in our distribution business. It also covers the build of our new combined cycle plant and some investments in our nuclear facility. So we're -- had lots of conversation with the commission staﬀ about that and we ﬁled something that we hope will help us to do two things.  One is reduce rate case frequency. So it's a three-year IRM that we ﬁled at the Electric company. And it'll also allow us to gain a lot of eﬃciencies for our customers because when we can create   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   certainty around what our investment plans will be, which usually drive a lot of costs out of our investment plans."
"What are you assuming in the 2019 early outlook? I guess the 7.6% growth for the Electric and 12.2% for Gas, is that -- what does that assume in terms of rate case outcomes?",We'll give you an update on that at EEI in terms of our assumptions. I think in terms of investment level in the business and what that would imply.
Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.,You bet.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey, good morning everyone.",Good morning.     Good morning.     Good morning Julien.
"Excellent. So I wanted to follow-up on a couple of details. First, just wanted to clarify on the '19 early guide for NEXUS. What's assumed in terms of volumetric ﬁll-up just as it goes through the course of the year?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Right now we haven't really disclosed what the exact volumes going to be, but we expect the pipe to essentially ﬁll with our long-term contracts and short-term contracts. That's what's in our forecast."
"Okay. All right. Fair enough. I mean or maybe asked a little bit diﬀerently, what kind of ROE are you assuming?","Yeah. Julien we don't go asset-by-asset in our portfolios and talk. Returns ROE for obvious reasons which is throughout interacting with counterparties on transactions. But I think what we've said is the pipes got healthy actually, volumes ﬂown right now before we get into any of the long-term shippers which is encouraging. And we expect that to continue next year. And then next year is the year where we will transition those short-term volumes into longer-term contracts. And the ultimate plan, of course, is for this to behave like; Link is behaving; like Bluestone has behaved; like Millennium has behaved, that real juice in these comes from all the add-on investments and expansions and other opportunities that a platform creates. And we are seeing those begin to evolve through and we'll give you some color on that at EEI.     The other thing Julien that I would say is a lot of these platforms like Millennium and Vector, we enter the investments just north of our cost of capital, and as we expand and develop new markets and connecting markets to those pipes, we see that drive well north of our cost of capital. I mean we saw that happen with Vector; our Millennium assets; our Bluestone assets as well as Link and we expect very much the same with our NEXUS asset."
"Got it. And since you bring it up, I mean, how are you thinking about adding complementary assets to this plan. I know that that have been brought up earlier in the year?","We're working on that. I think you may hear more about that if we got some of this done when we get to EEI. But we are looking at connecting neighboring assets, laterals and expanding our deliveries to customers along the path. So lots of good things cooking on NEXUS. And as they evolve we can update you."
"Got it. And then separately again this might be preempting things a tad bit. But on the voluntary renewables that it seems like about 600 megawatts give or take, I mean, what's the pace, the   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   cadence of that coming into service? I mean presumably it's within the time frame that the PPC is rolling oﬀ. And then separately as you talk about having seen a surprising amount of demand on that front can you elaborate a little bit on what the latest conversations? Have you largely tapped it out of at this point in your mind at least through the existing PPC window? Or is there still an opportunity to run out there and grab some market share, while the tax credits exist?","So the 300 megawatts that we talked about initially I think a lot of that demand is in late-stage discussions I'd say and feels very good. But we have additional demand beyond that which is why we're going for 600 megawatts. And in terms of the tax credits as you would expect there are -- both we and others have preserved the ability to use tax credits at project sites. So those are what are coming forward. So we have -- we've done in the past and we'll do in the future these to build-on transfer projects with developers whose real business is to go out and develop sites and perhaps pin down through equipment commitments, the tax credit viability and we then work with them to bring those sites to fruition. So that's what we're doing. And yeah, we've been encouraged by the level of interest from industrials and institutionalists in carbon emission reduction. And so we're going to -- we'll try to knock down the 300 megawatts, work our way into the 600 megawatts and there may be more beyond that. We'll see."
Last one detail on the trading side. Just can you clarify is there a locked-in level that you're looking at '19? Just obviously it's up from the '18 levels as you expected initially.,Well we'll talk about -- we can talk about trading at EEI as well I think. But one thing I would say is it's just been a very consistent performer in recent years. So what we're essentially doing with this guidance is putting it in line with reality. And so that's what you see in the guidance for next year.
Got it. All right. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.     Hi Greg.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Good morning. Really remarkable track record you guys are building here. Very impressive. Couple questions. Could you please elaborate more on what the volume situation has been this year on your system and that you do have an assumed decline in the earnings contribution next year on GSNP, given I presume I guess normalization of volumes. Does that have to do with Atlantic Sunrise or other pipes coming online that are now producers are now moving oﬀ your system, that they perhaps needed to be on your system on an interim basis? Anything you can do to help us understand the ﬂows would be much appreciated?","Sure. We saw increased throughput on a discretionary basis across all our platforms. That would include like Vector which is our Chicago, the Dawn pipe. Even our storage assets performed better than expected in terms of market value and volumes. Millennium performed above target and Bluestone and our Susquehanna gathering was a huge contributor as well. And then our Link assets performed better than we expected. So it was across all the platforms and it was for various reasons. I think one of them you touched on people looking for other places to send their gas, use some of our platforms to do so. But we also saw market conditions evolve in diﬀerent markets that drove the need for incremental throughput. So we thought that to be what we would consider a higher than expected --     IT's an all cylinders here. I mean weather was there too. Lot of ﬂow to me. Some are weather demand. It was strong -- certainly stronger than we have projected, since we projected normal weather. I think we told you that we have producer drilling that was more progressive than we thought it would be. And so we're not projecting that sort of aggressive drilling next year. It may come, but we just don't think it's prudent to build plans around, repeated aggressive drilling, repeated warm weather, storage outperformance, volume outperformance and various platforms. I wouldn't say it's -- we aren't pinpointing it to other pipes coming on or anything like that. It was more of these conditions asset-by-asset that was better than we expected."
So would it be fair to say Gerry as you talked about the idea of contingency across the business that there's a contingency built in here as well?,"Well we told you we try in every business and the company overall to come into the year with contingency. We -- and I just have a philosophy, it's hard to deliver anything that has uncertainty in the future if you don't have some room for things to go wrong. So yes, we do, and I hope conditions emerge so that that contingency will accrue to you. That's been typical in recent years, but time will tell."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Thanks. One last question. You mentioned and I'm sure you'll give us an update in due course about expansion opportunities on the system. You didn't explicitly mention the potential for additional gathering and processing. But should I assume that that is part of what you might consider at the right value proposition?,"If we get the right deal we'll certainly look at those. So yes, I'd say the investments that we're looking at GSP, across the board, mainline lateral, smaller extensions out to gathering platforms and potentially the gathering itself."
And then processing assets or no?,"Processing if need be. So we are very familiar with those. We've done them in Michigan for many decades. It hasn't been a focus of ours, but if needed by one of the producers we'd certainly take it on."
Okay. Thanks. Looking forward to seeing you at EEI.,Thanks. You as well.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
Hi guys. Congrats on a good quarter.,Thank you. I aprreciate it.     Good morning.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Good morning. So maybe start with the tax equity piece. Just wanted to understand that what is your cash ﬂow proﬁle if you didn't do the tax equity deal, how early could you utilize that tax attribute? So I guess how early have you pulled forward the cash ﬂows related to this tax equity deal and what kind of returns are generally are you seeing for these investors who are buying this tax equity kind of product?","This is Peter. The cash ﬂows that we would have seen from these if you would have kept the credits on counterparty, I'd say by the decade away by 20s. So it really made sense for us to pull that cash forward.     We've been -- as you know we've had a number of these projects around for a while. So as we get deeper into the -- deeper into our ownership, the use of the credits goes from current -- quite current to being pushed out which is why it makes sense not for us now to monetize and pull them forward."
"Yeah I know that sounds like it makes complete sense. So in terms of the tax equity deal, it did not reduce your equity needs because thay you had already contemplated in your plan. Is that right?",That is correct.
I got you.,"Yeah, we knew these -- we anticipated that we would do these and planned to do the tax equity transaction. So I think we have been signaling that across this year that we were working on them, so we're now getting very close."
Fair enough. And then in terms of the acquisitions I know you'd mentioned earlier that potential acquisitions you would look at on the GSP side. Is that still something that you have on your radar? Or now do you have the platform with NEXUS that you're looking at that as the build-out opportunity or is M&A on the plate as well?,"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   No, M&A is on the plate. In fact we have a couple of assets that we're looking at with great interest right now. So we'll provide you with updates as soon as we can on those, and what we can at EEI if we're able. I will say that on the second quarter call I think a couple of you sensed there was something that might have been quite close. There was. We had a sizable transaction that we were well along on, kind of entering deep due diligence. But as we got deep into the due diligence on that when we found that the geology just wasn't strong enough for us to be conﬁdent in it the underlying geology and so I was really proud of our team. I came back and said 'Look this deal has constructed. It doesn't ﬁt our investment discipline. And we got to look at other assets. And if we can get it at a lower price great, but not at this price.' And so we did move on from that one. But there are probably more assets out there than are visible to the public. I'll just put it that way and we're looking at a couple of interesting ones."
That's very interesting. Good color and glad to hear of the discipline. Thanks so much guys.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
Good morning guys.,Good morning Paul.     Good morning Paul.
Congratulations on the quarter. Peter at least somebody in Detroit can hit out of the park. Can you just refresh our memories? What is your forecast for ﬁlling up the one-third capacity at NEXUS?,Right now we're well on our way with the short-term contracts. As I mentioned we've got about $350 million a day in short-term contracts already ﬂowing in the pipe as we speak. And our   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   long-term contracts which total about $840 million a day will start to ﬂow in and around the 1st of November.
But kind of longer term what's your -- what do you see the split between kind of excess capacity and 100%.?,"Well we're -- they'll all be ﬁrm contracts with the exception of a very small amount to our total capacity at 15. So whether they're short term in nature or long term in nature there will be ﬁrm contracts that we'll deliver on. And I think what will evolve over time is we'll do two things: one is move some of those short-term contracts and the long-term contracts and also start to expand the pipe.     So we've said on prior calls and there's really no new news on this that we expect the pipe to really ﬁll up and in signiﬁcant measure with short-term ﬂows and we're seeing that. In fact we expect those short-term volumes will increase as the upstream feed to the pipe increases as assets are put in service to deliver our long-term shippers. And then the process of transitioning those short volumes to longer-term contracts, a lot of that is expected to play out over the next year as we said on the midyear call. And our team and the Enbridge team will work that together."
Because these ﬂows are mostly pushed rather than market pull. It should be little seasonality?,Well I don't know if I'd characterize it that way. There's actually there is a very healthy spread to Michigan right now from the producing regions which just says that it's an attractive market and given that the volumes are ﬂowing.
And then just clariﬁcation. What is the base of the 5% to 7%? You threw out a lot of numbers.,So you can take it oﬀ of our early outlook for 2019.
Thank you very much.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),You're welcome.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning.     Good morning.     Good morning, Jonathan."
"As you told yourself my main question but just coming back on NEXUS, when you say short- term contracts what are we -- what term are we talking about? Because I know your longer-term ones are 15 years if I'm not wrong. So I'm just kind of curious when you say short-term is that very short-term or is that something in the middle?","I think the range our short-term contracts Jonathan are range from very short-term to medium short-term. So it'll be some could be months some could be years. So I think it will be combination of -- that's what we consider short term. That's what will help ﬁll the pipe in the near term and then we'll transition those to multiyear contracts as we move forward.     Is the basin -- we talked previously the basin is projected to go short capacity in the 2020-2021 time frame. And it's when you approach those both we and producers both want to line up then. And so next year is 2019 and that's why we think it's going to be an active year of discussions about those longer-term contracts. I mean some could be as long as the anchor shippers. But generally you bring your anchor shippers into 15 to 20, you bring your other shippers in, you could get some 5 and 7. Some might push out longer than that. And then as   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Jerry said you may have some of that's transacting in the short-term market on top of that. So, but I think next year will be an active year in the ﬂows that we've seen immediately come into the pipe being transitioned to multiyear-term contracts that's what I just described."
"I mean, last quarter if I'm not wrong you were pretty adamant that you didn't want to go shorter than the 15-year term and that you thought that you would close out the rest of the pipe with long-term contracts in late '18 or early '19. So I'm just trying to understand what shifted in the environment that you do seem to be changing what you're saying here.","Actually I don't think we said that we do 15 or 20-year contracts on the balance. That's not typical. What's typical is you come in with term but you look for your anchor -- underlying anchor shippers to prior that. We may get it if the basin tightens substantially, but 15 to 20 years would be pretty long for people who are coming in after the anchor shippers.  On the other hand we do expect -- we don't expect it to be in the very short-term market. We expect it to be in that ﬁve perhaps three's, ﬁve's, seven's, 10s those sorts of things. That's typical for a pipe as it build out it's portfolio."
Okay. Can I just lastly clarify around -- on the M&A side in GSP. When you were talking last quarter you talked about opportunities on a similar I think scale to Link. And I heard you say that those didn't come to pass but now you're looking at other things. Are they also on that type of scale? Or are they in a diﬀerent kind of scale?,Yes the one we passed on was very analogous to Link. But the two we're looking at now one is smaller and one is analogous to Link.
Okay. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard Weil.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Thanks. Good morning guys.,Good morning.
"Quick question on the Electric guidance. If I look at the original guidance plus $100 million of weather, that suggest number is much higher than $673 million. You're obviously accelerating O&M as you often do. But anything else to call out there? I'm seeing a delta of about $80 million which seems big for your investments.","About half of that $50 million pretax were pull-forwards and investment in our operations. And I would say the other half was due to what sometimes comes with hot weather. We had incremental storm expense as well as we continued to invest in our customer systems to improve service from that new system that we installed.     So pull-forwards, storms and we have some called customer 360, we're in the ﬁrst year of those and typical when you bring in a big new customer platform, your expenses rise some and then fall away and we've seen that as expected here."
"Okay. Then also in the electric side, how would you describe the discussions so far around the ﬁve-year distribution plan that you ﬁled at the start of this year?","We met extensively with both the commissioners with the commission staﬀ in particular. Our people were up there working in detail about future plans and future investment levels and the rationale for those. And so it's really on that basis that the three-year IRM ﬁling was made. I'd describe it this way.  I think the commission would like to be oﬀ the every year rate case cycle because -- and the reason for that is there is a lot of waste in that. It's driven entirely because capital expenditures and reinvestment in the system is high, but the forces that we look at everything on an annual basis. And there are a lot of things that are more sensibly looked at every two or three years. So it is a lot of work that is really unnecessary if you know that you're investing in this power plant or you're going to invest in your distribution system or you're going to make investments that are necessary in your nuclear plant, while drive rate cases with those known items.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   And so I think there's a mutual goal to rationalize the rate case ﬁling process and frequency. And we've done our best to work hard with the staﬀ to get a position in front of them that makes sense to us and makes sense to them, and so we're hopeful that we'll land on a spot that meets both needs."
"Very good. And then lastly, earlier in the year you quantify the tax reform beneﬁts for 2018. Fair to assume that you show the year-over-year growth from '18 to '19 using the original '18 guidance. Would it be fair to say that the 2019 tax reform beneﬁts would be comparable, adjusted for the underlying growth in the nonutility businesses and therefore may be would be a wash with the REF tax equity transaction EPS impact?","Yes. Andrew maybe I didn't understand your question a bit more but our '18 original guidance was at the year-end call which we put in the tax reform eﬀect on that, so that was baked into that the original guidance. So that is comparable the '19 -- early outlook to the original guidance is comparable in terms of both reﬂecting tax reform. But I'm not sure if that was the nature of your question."
"Yes, it was. Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our ﬁnal question from Gregg Orrill with UBS.",
"Yes. Thank you. Mostly asked and answered. But if you could comment on the details around the 1100 megawatt plant that you're building at DTE Electric, just technology and eﬃciency and anything else that you think is important there?",I'd say combined cycle natural gas power plant about 1100 megawatts will be located where our Belle River and St. Clair existing coal units are. So it's going to be in that location. We're receiving great support from the local community. In addition to that in terms of eﬃciencies it's around at 6000 heat rate on our latest GE turbines. So it is a GE turbine. So those are the high- level details.
Okay. Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Thank you. And that I am understanding it is our last question. So I'll just reiterate, really appreciate everybody being on the call. We had a great year this year and I think our two guidance increases indicate that. I also feel really good about the position we're in to continue the performance that we've been able to deliver you in recent years, really over the past 11 years. And we look forward to providing you updates on our ﬁve-year plan at EEI and the investments at our utilities and our nonutility businesses that will undergo that plan. So we will see you all in San Francisco and thanks for joining the call.  Operator  And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
