Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Morning, Shahriar."
"So congrats obviously on the quarter and the news coming out of GSP today. Couple of questions here. Can you ﬁrst, can you comment on sort of that forward growth expectations post the spin of 5 to7 consolidated verses 7 to 8 electric, 9% for gas. Is that like kind of explained by some dilution from Equity issuance, especially in light of the higher CapEx Outlook? Alternatively, is there some desynergies and splitting the GSP segment that could put some pressure [ph] and just the 5% to 7% it's oﬀ the original guidance range. Can you just remind us how are you reiterating and replacing sort of midstream earnings? What's the key drivers there?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I'll start Shahriar, and then I'll ask Dave Ruud add, but the 5% to 7% EPS growth is oﬀ our 2020 base and it's pretty consistent with our growth pattern that we've described to our investors over many years. And certainly we always end up on high end of that as we've seen this year and other years, but it's driven post spin, It will be driven by our capital programs at both our utilities which are quite robust and very visible. You know, we see ﬁve plus years of really strong investment opportunities our two utilities. So that's fundamentally what's driving the 5% to 7% EPS growth for the company [ph] Dave -- do you want to answer that?     Hi, Jerry and Shahriar to think that I think you actually explained it very well. We had some -- the diﬀerence between what you see at the utilities to decide to 7 is, is due to some of the equity coming in but we are very conﬁdent in the 5% to 7% growth going forward. (Multiple Speakers)."
Sorry Jerry.,"I was going to say -- I was going to say Shahriar, in addition to that we're not seeing any incremental equities as part of the spin. So it'll be equity as we had forecasted prior."
Got it and any desynergies from the split. Dave?,"There will be essential [ph] costs but the (Inaudible) that we will have to work through, but there's no long-term desynergies after the ﬁrst year or two."
"Okay, perfect. And so, when we're thinking about this spin, now as you contemplated the four times debt-to-EBITDA sort of implies about $3 billion of debt attributed to GSP in the spin. How should we sort of think about post and leverage on the hold co like seems like it could be a sizable amount of debt that remains. Are the credit metrics going to stay intact? What sort of been the feedback with the agencies and any sort of guidance on pro-forma credit metrics for DTE and [ph] that you can kind of guide to it today?","Dave?      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yes, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet at DTE and committed to maintaining our ratings. We do expect that this separation will be credit enhancing for us. And so that's going to allow some ﬂexibility for our metrics while still maintaining our solid investment grade rating. We've owned our initial conversations with the agencies yesterday and those are positive. It [ph] will be providing them more detail in the coming months. But you were right Shahriar the way it will work is that as we spin mid stream and they develop their own capital structure at that four times that the EBITDA that will require them raising debt and [ph] will come to DTE. Our plan at DTE will be to use those proceeds to pay down our parent debt in the same amount."
"Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly for me is, given today's announcement. Curious maybe, Jerry, to get your thoughts on sort of the remaining non-regulated businesses -- really just P&I. Is there sort of invalue to having that segment now that majority of the non reg is slated for a spin just curious on your thoughts here and on the remaining mix?","Shahriar the way we are doing P&I is that it's actually complementary to our ESG agenda as we invest in R&D projects and also invest on behalf of some of our industrial customers to reduce their carbon footprints with cogeneration projects. So it's -- we view it as a small part of our business overall. It will be 90% utility, 10% non-utility, but complementary."
It's Perfect. Congrats guys.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats.","Good morning, Andrew. Thank you."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   First question, I want to go about the long-term EPS guidance a little bit diﬀerently. So you're continuing to guide to 5 to 7 [ph], that's where you pointed in the past, you've consistently delivered better than that, more like 7% or 8%.  Now it seems like a lot of that upside came from Midstream, so looking forward, should we think about the actual EPS growth rate of 6% or might there be some good old-fashion DTE conservatism still in there that could take it more toward the higher end?","Andrew, my sense is that you'll continue to see the DTE better of under promising and over- delivering. So our 5 to 7 [ph] is the target, but, of course, we cover the mid, but we've always done better than that, because we have [ph] built for each year. And as I look at 2021, it's looking really strong and we're also starting to work on 2022 and that's looking really good. So I am conﬁdent that you'll continue to see DTE's better as you've seen in the past."
"Terriﬁc. That's great to hear. Next on dividends, you mentioned a lot of comments about peer average growth rates and payout ratios. Can you maybe put some numbers on that? I mean, we've all got our own calm seas [ph], but what do you consider to be a utility peer average dividend payout ratio or growth rate?","Hey Ruud, you want to take that.     Sure [ph] remained about where we are with our payout ratio, which is the right ground in that 60% range, which is kind of consistent with the best Pure Play peers and then dividend growth that's going to be consistent with our earnings growth going forward."
"Okay. Great. Helpful. My last question is, you've invested a ton of capital into midstream in recent years including the Haynesville acquisition for over $3 billion about a year ago. My question is, how do you think about regulated utility M&A now? That hasn't really been much of your focus historically, but might you see yourselves as being potentially acquisitive in the regulated world and if so, what kind of and the targets might look the most appealing to you?","You know Andrew, we have a $17 billion utility capital plan, right now, which is a very large capital -- organic capital program and that will create tremendous value for our investors -- for our utility investors. And I'll mention again that that's $2 billion higher than our prior 5 year plan. So I -- we're going to remain highly focused on our organic growth opportunities. So we really have no thoughts or intentions at this point in time in terms of M&A.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Okay. And can you come and tell about the potential for a sale of the utility business if one were to -- if you were to be approached given even the pure play look?,We've got that great wealth agenda and organic platform for growth at our utilities and we're happy to pursue that.
It sounds good. Thank you very much and congrats again.,"Thanks, Andrew.  Operator  Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, Steve. Thank you for your time. And once again -- once more congratulations (Multiple speakers) appreciate the opportunity to it. Hey, howdy, perhaps just to follow-up a little bit more of the clean-up on the credit side. I think a lot of folks are asking you here. Just to be extra clear about this. You said I think the quote you credit enhancing. Do you know what your new thoughts would be around minimum eﬀort at target speciﬁcally here? And you might have been indirectly asked this earlier, just want to try to come back on that, because you're 18% now. Do we think about this being closer to some of your peers, at call it 15%?",Dave Rudd?     Yes. We are here. We're working through that and we're in discussions obviously with the agencies. We do think it is credit enhancing. And so we do think we can have the opportunity to move our FFO debt down to something that's more in line with peers. But that's yet to be deﬁned as we work through the details now.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Got it. And when do you think you'll provide an updated view and and maybe this is the leading question into the 5 to 7 as well, when do you think you'll be in a position where I had an updated view on the credit as well as how you're thinking about that bass line moving oﬀ of your current base, right? When do you think you'll roll it forward once you close or more on a pro forma sort of 22 basis? And I asked this speciﬁcally, because you obviously have the P&I segment perhaps holding back that 5 to 7 at least given the ref stepdowns coming up here.","Dave -- you want to take that?     Yes. Our plan is to roll things forward sometime in the beginning of 2021 is when we'll get some more detail on how this will play out, but it will be before -- on a pro-forma level before the [ph]."
"Got it. So do you say -- so that wouldn't yet include the step down on the graph for the baseline, right, when you think about it?","Well, our 2022 projections, when we put those forward and are 5% to 7% EPS growth rate Julian does include the step-down REF and the replacement that we've been working on at P&I. So we will -- our 5 to 7 -- yes."
"Sure, absolutely. I only stressed it because the earlier questions at did not ﬁxated on the discrepancy between your utility and your consolidated growth. So that's why I'm ﬁxated on when you could potentially move beyond that big item there. Okay, excellent. Well, thank you all very much. I think I'll leave it there.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.",
Hi guys. Good morning.,"Morning, Michael."
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Could you talk a little bit about why not sell the midstream business to another buyer like Berkshire Hathaway similar to we (Inaudible).,"Well we (Inaudible) Go ahead, please."
"Yeah, why is spent [ph]? Yeah, that's the question.","Yeah, we examine the series of alternatives as we were looking to make this pivot through a more of a pure play utility model. And when we look at all those alternatives, we found that the spin in our opinion created the greatest amount of shareholder value for our investors going forward."
"Are there any tax consequences and also is the four times debt-to-EBITDA level, is that low enough to compete with a sector that's a publicly-traded industry and sector that's already kind of under stress?","Well, there are no tax consequences. It designed to be a tax-free spent. And certainly the debt level of the new Midstream company will be very competitive and provide tremendous ﬂexibility to provide a strong dividends and strong dividend growth as well as pursue their capital growth programs."
"And on that dividend issue, just to follow up on Shahriar's questions. Are -- how would equity needs remain unchanged at DTE Energy after you've lost the cash ﬂow from this business? I know you're said it's credit enhancing, but I'm just wondering if that's -- is that enough to not change any equity needs going forward? (Inaudible).","Dave Rudd, you want to take that?     Yes. The piece you mentioned there that credit enhancing those helped support the additional - - the lack of additional equity that will need and we still do have the equity converts that come in 2022, but we see our plan -- our equity plan being very consistent with our previous plan.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
And one last question. When do you think you'll ﬁle the next metric [ph] credit case that's coming up probably early next year?,"We are looking at ﬁrst quarter next year, but we're going to remain ﬂexible and we're going to try to obviously delay as much as possible. But that's our baseline right now."
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.,
"Hi. Hope -- thank you. I have actually (Inaudible) couple of questions. The ﬁrst, I remember the previous EI contractors [ph] talked about how the aﬀordability issue sort of [ph] ability to grow utility CapEx. Now you're showing us this very sizable growth on the electric side and this potential increase on the the gas side. So what's changed since last year?  Well Angie, good question, the pandemic revealed some signiﬁcant opportunities for us from the cost structure perspective of both our utilities. And as I mentioned in the earlier calls, we had this $2 billion sitting on the sidelines looking to get in. And but we needed to create aﬀordability room while we have in fact done that and created aﬀordability room and pandemic was very revealing as to what we could do. In addition to what we have been doing for many- many years. And so that's how we found the aﬀordability room to bring in that capital and our plan part of utilities.  Okay. And this additional 0.5 billion of CapEx on the gas side, I understand that this hasn't been approved. So what are you waiting for with that incremental spending?",The $2 billion is something that's in our plan at the electric company. The $0.5 billion at the gas company is sort of in the same position that the $2 billion was in which is we're looking for our aﬀordability initiatives to bring that into the plan and we're trying to display that we've got a very strong inventory of investment opportunity at both utilities.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Great. The 5% to 7% growth that you are reiterating, what's the -- I understand the oﬀ of 2020 -- this -- what's the basis? What's the starting point -- so it was like $5.47 on basically stripping out the other GSP earnings from 2020?","Dave Rudd, you want to take that?     Yes, so what we are showing there now is at 5% below 7% for next year based as if we didn't spend 5% to 7% will be based on as having GSP removed from the baseline."
"Okay, and there's not going to be any type of reallocation of current level expenses or something like that, that [ph] what's going on that 2020 number?","We will have to work through the current level expenses and how we manage those internally, but they're not expected to be material over the -- [ph]"
"Okay. And my last question about the these midstream spin-oﬀs. So we have this debate about among investors about what is the multiple that the settle [ph] business will be trading at? And we see this big disparity between pipeline multiple versus gathering multiples. Can you give us a sense from that EBITDA perspective, what percentage of the 2020 EBITDA is associated with gathering assets, which to trade of meaningfully lower EBITDA multiple?","David Slater, do you want to take that?     Sure can Jerry. Angie, good to talk to you and yes, that's a good question. And what we've disclosed previously is we have about 10% in our storage business about 40% gathering and 50% in the pipeline segment. And those percentages are income percentages. So that's a good proxy for your question."
"Okay. Well, so with that in mind it's like a simple math [ph] which indicates that this business would have a relatively low market cap like coming around $3 billion, $3.5 billion with seemingly strong technical pressure [ph] its utility investors and that's based on how your stock   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   (Inaudible) on that with 50% of the -- . So why you convince that this (Inaudible) create value given the relatively (Inaudible) small market cap and technical questions [ph] that it's going to face?","Well, we think that ﬁrst of all, the spin creates premier regulated utility 90/10 sort of structure inside our utilities that investors will have the opportunity to invest in with a strong capital growth program for ﬁve-plus years. Our midstream company is going to be well capitalized when we compare it to its peers and to have strong dividend growth and we think it's going to be a very attractive investment for the midstream investors and also current investors in DTE.     Curious I could add to that may be.     Sure.     Yeah, Angie, I think it's going to be a very unique investment opportunity in the midstream space with predominantly natural gas. And its portfolio is really laying over the best dry gas basins in the country. And fundamentally, there's a lot of fundamental support and growth in those areas. So I think this investment opportunity for those investors that are looking for a really high-quality maturing investment. I think it'll be very attractive."
Great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.,
"Hey congrats. just I don't know if you -- hey, Jerry, so I'm not sure your position to answer this just but it has this call was going on Elliot came out and said something about, kind of, being happy with there so could you just comment on any involvement they might have had with this? Or how to characterize that?","So I'll start by saying, Steve, that we started to talk about this pivot in the summer 2019 and we started looking at a pivot towards a Pure Play utility model and it was a series of discussions   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   between management and the board that really culminated just in the last few days. We talked a lots of investors, a lots of potential investors and analysts and get feedback, but I'm not going to comment speciﬁcally on what we talk to you or don't talk to."
"Okay. And then, just to kind of get a sense of the kind of thought on the new company ﬁnancial. So obviously the cash ﬂow from the gas business will be separated, but you should have more this 18% [ph] debt target that you've had for a largely pure regulated utility. I would assume that you'll be able to fund it with somewhat meaningfully lower [ph] that. And what is that -- if you look at the piers for a largely regulated utility at your credit, like what would that range be versus the 18 plus that you've been at?","Dave Ruud, do you want to take that?     Yeah. When we look at our peers we see them down in the 14% to 16% actually in that range that we are still committed to maintaining our ratings. And so we're going to be really careful with that. But we do expect that this will be credit enhancement or us."
Okay. And then lastly just on the just on the midstream business. So you had a kind of growth targets out there together for the midstream business and it was like 9.5% net income growth type of thing. Could you just comment on how that business is tracking versus the prior growth target? And was it -- is it on track with what you'd said before for midstream through -- I think it was through '22 or '24.,"So, Steve, I'll start and I'll turn it over to David Slater. But, I would say that nothing's changed fundamentally from a growth perspective in our mainstream business. All of the organic opportunities that we were pursuing continue to play out. David Slater, Why don't you add some more color to that?     Sure thing Jerry, and Steve, that's great question. And I just reiterate that absolute [ph] exchanged in this business between yesterday and today, and we've got a great team -- a great management team that's going to be leading the new company, the next one operating [ph] coming along. As we progress through this standing up of a new C-Corp, we'll be putting out detailed for guidance kind of best in class guidance as expected in the Midstream sector. And certainly, be able to answer the question you're asking a lot more granularity in detail as we move forward in the process here. But suﬃce it to say absolutely nothing's changed in the business. If anything the fundamentals in the basin's I described earlier are just strengthening   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   right now. So we feel really positive about this new company and it's going to provide an investment vehicle for some of the midstream investors that really doesn't exist in the sector today. There's not another company and c-corp in the midstream spaces position like this company will be positioned around those particular basins in the country, really attached some really strong market centers."
Great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,
Hey team good morning. Just real quick follow-up on the tax implications of the spin. Can you remind us when are you expected to be a taxpayer? I believe it's mid-2020s and it's been impacts that are all.,David Ruud.     Hey you're right. But currently it is in mid 2020s and 2024s and this will be able to tax free Spin. We don't expect it to improve that but we'll get back to you for sure on that.
"Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one quick one on 2021 guidance. What are you assuming in terms of if anything on COVID impacts? And then obviously strong execution on the [ph] this year, should we expect that to sort of continue into 2021 as well?",I would say 2021 is positioned extremely well. We -- as you know we planned very conservatively for our forward years. So we have signiﬁcant tendency to accommodate any sort of changes in load patterns or potentially incremental expenses. So I feel really good really good about our position in 2021.
"Okay, perfect, thanks, guys.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning and congratulations.",Morning. Thank you.
"I wanted to talk about the Midstream business. Would you be able to give us a sense of the maintenance CapEx? And I'm thinking not just about physical maintenance, but the CapEx needed to keep the cash ﬂows ﬂat and especially for the gathering business. How do you think about just the sort of base capital needs to keep the business running ﬂat on EBITDA?","Well, I'll start this by saying it's a relatively new system. So those maintenance CapEx dollars will be modest at best. But David Slater, you want to add some color to that?     Sure, Gerry. You're exactly right and see that's a great question and we're deﬁnitely going to be providing more color around that as we approach spin date but the systems are all generally new. So very modest maintenance capital required for the foreseeable future and that will be a very small number, especially as you compare this midstream company with some of the other midstream companies that have more mature larger networks that they're having to maintain."
"Understood. Yeah, as you all think through that, I'd love to get a sense not just the physical which I assume is low, but the economic maintenance for gathering just given the nature of the business. But I guess, moving on to just thinking about the gathering business in credit quality. Could you give us a little more information on the credit quality for that particular segment in terms of sort of range of customer ratings, any customer notices to modify or terminate agreements, and just sort of other credit protections you have that's a pretty common question that comes up on the gathering side especially. Just curious how you think about the credit quality there?","David?      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Sure. Yeah, that's another excellent question So as we disclosed in the past and we provide a lot of detail on this one -- we did the Haynesville transaction last year. In most of our agreements, we could credit enhancements clauses in there to really protect not only the receivables, but the forward obligations of those customers have. So that would be sort of my ﬁrst state and that's sort of hard coded into our DNA. It's always do that. So it has the eﬀect of enhancing a credit proﬁle of the counterparty. But as I kind of step back and I know we've shared this in the past with some of our bigger customers on the gathering side of our business would be names like Southwestern, Cabot [ph], obviously Indigo and Taro. So those are some of the names that are in our portfolio. And again, what we looked very closely at their credit and monitor that with a lot of detail have a lot of information that they share with us quarter-by-quarter, so we're monitoring that closely. And all of those customers are in good positions, they have no signiﬁcant maturities before them and their cash ﬂows are strengthening in the current environment with the fundamental strengthening and dry natural gas. Its it's beneﬁting all these companies. And so, we actually see their credit proﬁle strengthening. It's easier to see when you look at their -- it just look at their long-term debt and how its trading, you can clearly see a strengthening credit proﬁle across our gathering customers."
"It's really helpful. And just last one for me, just for the mystery business overall, are there -- are any additional cash ﬂow metrics beyond the EBITDA that you laid out, whether think about distributive cash ﬂow, free cash ﬂow, some deﬁnition of cash ﬂow, or is that something that you all are going to provide out a later date?","Yeah, you're exactly right, Stephen. Those are, what I would call, best-in-class midstream metrics. Metrics and what the opportunity is standing this company up new we're going to make it Best in Class. So we're going to work through those details and look forward to spending time with you down the road when you get closer to spin date and share all that."
"Understood, that's all I had. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question comes from James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.",
"Well, thank you very much. And good morning.",Good morning.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Most of my questions obviously been answered, but just two real quick questions. I guess the ﬁrst is as you were looking at becoming a pure play. Did you explore potentially the divesting or winding down both the P&I and or the energy marketing business. And what was the determination to retain those businesses?","So James, I'll start by saying that when we looked at all our alternatives to unlock shareholder value and create incremental value for our shareholders the biggest mover that we saw that was to really create the spin for GSP. We saw P&I as complementary to our ESG agenda with our remaining utility platform, which will be 90% of our business. And so we've decided to pursue this path at this point in time."
"Okay, great. And just I guess could you also just remind us also the -- what would the outlook I guess for equity on a going-forward basis? And the question has been asked a bunch of times, but I know that you're targeting 18%, but with a pure play utility you probably should be down sort of in the mid-teens. And then on top of it, you have the conversion I think in '22 of the convertible that was done to ﬁnance the Midstream business. Seems like you have a lot more ﬂexibility [ph] either not to issue equity or maybe to use incremental debt. So could you provide some guidance, I guess, how you're thinking about how much equity leasing your plan now for the 5 year period?","David Rudd, you want to take that?     Sure. And in the deck, in the appendix on Slide 28, it showed our previous planned equity issuances. You can see in the next year, there was 100 million to 400 million and then in '22 was the 1.3 billion of convertible equity units that come into the plan. So that was -- that is and was consistent with what we're seeing going forward."
"But as you move, I guess, beyond 2022, should we expect any material equity? Or is this going to be something that's just going to be more sort of 100 million or 150 million -- subtype [ph] of issuances?","Like in our plan [ph] going forward, there are no major and no equity issuances that we see in those years."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Okay, great. Thank you very much.  Operator   Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.",
(Technical Diﬃculty). Just trying to see if there any reason to think that EBITDA -- growth is a diﬀerent estimate trajectory see on the -- to remind us as far -- . How much is How much this quarter is contractually independent with MUC [ph]? It's just trying to get a feeling for that. Thanks.,"David, do you want to take that?     Sure. I can Jerry. Jeremy, I had a little hard time hearing the beginning of your question. I'm just going to repeat it. I think you're asking about EBITDA growth versus earning growth and how much of that is kind of in hand. So that's a question I'm going to answer and you can change it if I got it wrong. But -- so ﬁrst oﬀ, just to reiterate, nothing's changed in the business from what we previously disclosed. So business is strong , has performed incredibly well this year, been incredibly resilient to a diﬃcult year in the sector and the diﬃcult year with respect to the pandemic?  So that gives me lots of conﬁdence of the durability of the business. In terms of the growth and would EBITDA growth be moving in tandem with income growth I think that's generally a true statement and again I think as I answered earlier we will be providing a lot more granular details, sort of best in class guidance as we progress and get closer to spin date. So, I trust that answered the question."
"Yes, that's helpful and just wanted to see the see it sounded contractually on that quote and with over 90% demand contract that seems like a pretty unique in the midstream -- just one conversation. It was up next and it sounds like it does. So that's really helpful context here. And then just ﬂipping it may be towards the midstream and to yourself, I don't know what you can say looking forward as far as the strategic power there is anything that you can [ph]. You know, good organic growth that's kind of unique in the space right now. I don't know anyone else talk about surely near the low end of peers out there. So it seems like you have some like you can build strong ﬂexibility there that maybe you could (Technical Diﬃculty) just want to get the sense of these things. Are you guys going to stick to your base into what you're doing there or if anything better to be anything going to change strategically?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah, that's a great question. So yeah ﬁrst oﬀ the assets are great assets and they're positioned across when you look at the resources in the country right now, these are the resources that all the analysts expect are going to get attention in the next year or two. And the company is positioned from an investor perspective to provide an investment vehicle for people that want to have exposure to the midstream around the best natural gas basins in the country and attached literally the best market centers in the country. So I think you alluded to it, it's a very unique investment vehicle that we believe is going to be distinctive in the sector and we're setting it up to have a very healthy balance sheet with the healthy dividend and a lot of ﬂexibility going forward to continue what I'll call the strategic intent that we've had which is continue to make highly accreted value generating investments on and around that portfolio of of assets where we have competitive advantage and asymmetrical information. So I don't think there's a -- there's no signiﬁcant strategic shift that's expected here in the near term. But again, as we approach spin date, I'm looking forward to laying the plan out in more detail and having good conversations with the investor base going forward. So, thanks.     Thanks, Jeremy, for the question."
Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Just a couple, Jerry, you Jerry, you know in the question about RAF [ph]. You've mentioned the outlook oﬀ of the, I guess, adjusted 2020 original base. It includes the replacement that you've been working on. Is that -- are you just referring to the $15 million a year origination pathway that you've talked about or is that something more signiﬁcant your may be alluding to that?","No. It's essentially that $15 million a year that we've been originating in new income, so you're correct.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. So I just want to make sure there wasn't something else that you're hinting at. And then, secondly, there was a comment made about potentially delaying the next right case and ﬁling you'd recently made. And it was a lot of material. I just wonder if you could clarify what you were saying there and maybe put it in context of your comment about the base case timing I think of [ph] 21?","Sure. Great question. So, we've had a really strong year in company this year. And some portion of that has been driven by incremental sales due to covid and the pandemic as it relates to our residential markets. So what we're doing Jonathan is essentially the forewing portion of those earnings in 2022 to oﬀset a potential rate increase in 2022. What that does is it gives us the opportunity to reconsider tapping of ﬁling the rate case. So that's really what that's about."
"Okay, and that just any suggestion of to the how far they would it be fairly roughly a year or so, it's good assumption?","It's probably too early to say Jonathan, but we'll continue to update you as we move forward."
Great. Thank you.,We'd like to see a portion of 2021 start to play out before we make that decision.
Okay. Thank you very much.  Operator  All right next question comes from David Fishman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, just a few questions -- with me. I know the spin itself is tax-free, but is there any impact on your ongoing cash tax positions with spend? Does this pull forward when you might   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   become a cash taxpayer at the regulated remain [ph] the ﬁve-year plan? Or is there not much for material back there either?",Dave Rudd.     Yeah. We're going to -- we'll look more into that and see what the impact is there and we'll have to get back and let you know on that. [ph] We weren't cash taxpayers until 2024. We don't think it will have much of a material impact.
"Okay, good to know. And then back on the post REF P&I I know you've pretty much just mentioned that you're still shooting for REF to 15 million or so a year, but could you guys maybe comment on what you kind of broadly see as the opportunities that there for RNG and cogeneration? And do you expect P&I really be growing enough to maintain a 90/10 regulated versus unregulated mix longer term, especially given the elevated regulated growth rates?","Well, that's what we see now (Inaudible) P&I be able to grow in the sectors that we described which is really through RNG and cogen and we're still seeing good opportunities. We have one that's in late stages right now on the energy front that we're feeling really good about and so, we're continuing to see activity and really nice returns there. But it will be a very small part of our portfolio going forward, but we do see it at that 90/10 over the next 5 years."
"Okay. And then, I guess, still on the clean energy, on the voluntary renewables initially you guys have talked about a 100 gigawatt target by 2030. Your updated ﬁlings looks like nearly that amount of 2025. How have your conversations kind of gone for maybe the second half of 2020 if you even went out that long because it seems that clearly over the next ﬁve years, you had a big pull forward. Just to be to maybe give us a little bit more color on kind of how the whole decade is, kind of, shaping out all that there?","Well, I have to tell you this voluntary renewables program that we have has been very exciting. You know, it's a product that we have a hard time keeping on the shelf. You know, we are selling it quite a bit through our residential customers and also our large industrial customers and even smaller industrial customers want this product to really green up their power portfolios, power usage portfolios. So as you said, we've been able to pull forward our projection system when we will hit the 1.4 gigawatt but we will continue to sell into this market and continue to update as we go forward, but we're doing much better than we had ever anticipated in that market.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Got it, and I imagine it's might this is something to get a little bit more color on [ph]","Yes. We will provide an update at EEI, but what we can tell you now is that we have 750 megawatts so [ph]. And we're going to build for that. We've got some ﬁlings in front of the commission to pursue those bills. And as we learned more and develop more market, we will continue to update you."
"And just last one from me. And you brieﬂy touched upon this. The energy trading business, what would you say is kind of a strategic rationale as keeping the energy trading business as a part of the ongoing kind of DTE entity.","David it's a very small part of our company and certainly not business that we look to grow and what we use it for is to really be a market maker. So for example with our RNG projects and even in our cogen facilities, we use it to manage risk with those Investments either for ourselves or on behalf of our customers. And that's really the primary purpose of that little [ph]."
"Got it. Okay, congratulations and thanks for taking my questions.",Thank you.  Operator  The ﬁnal question we have time for today comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Please go ahead.
Good morning. So --,Morning.
DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So what are your [ph] tax bases in the midstream portfolio today? And how long would DTE midstream need to remain a public company to avoid triggering tax [ph] event for current DTE shareholders?,"David?     Well, I don't think we've -- we haven't released our tax basis or said what our tax base is [ph] midstream. What was the second half of that question?"
Would you be willing to disclose that? And then also how long would DTE midstream need to remain a public company to avoid triggering tax to taxable event for current DTE shareholders?,I think we'll have to get back to you on that one.     Yeah.
Okay. And then how are you thinking about getting a new DTE dividend -- DTE midstream dividend policy? And how are you deﬁning the dividend coverage ratio in the (Inaudible) with two times for 21 for this pro former company [ph]?,"Ruud.     Yes, that's still to be totally down as we established the midstream company. But we do plan to step is one that's competitive with peers and we talked about that thing that two times [ph] in coverage ratio. And that's the distributable cash ﬂow over the dividend is how that we will be deﬁned consistent with other mainstream company."
Okay. Thank you.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Operator   This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. And I would like to turn it back to Mr.Jerry Norcia for ﬁnal comments.,"Thank you. Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll close by saying we had a very solid quarter and are well positioned for a strong ﬁnish for 2020 and a really great start to 2021. I believe the spin of DTE midstream will unlock signiﬁcant value for our shareholders and drive future growth. I look forward to talking all of you in the few weeks at EEI. And I hope everyone has a great morning and stay healthy and safe.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you once more for participating.
