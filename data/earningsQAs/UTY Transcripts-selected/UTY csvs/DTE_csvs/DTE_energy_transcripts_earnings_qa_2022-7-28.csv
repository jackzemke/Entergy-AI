Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar.     Hey, Shar"
"How you doing? So, Jerry, let me just, if it's okay, start with the IRP, as we're kind of getting closer to the date. Do you have any sort of incremental thoughts on the overall approach beyond just the acceleration of coal and renewable investments? I mean do you see opportunities for some immediate step ups, like a purchase of an existing asset or more gradual capital over time? And any changes to -- in ﬁnancing in either scenario?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, we see early in our plan, is certainly incremental investments in renewables, as well as batteries and also potential conversion of Belle River Power plant to natural gas use. So we see those types of investments, Shar, coming into the plan, and in the view in the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the plan. So those are the major areas that -- of opportunity that we see. And of course, longer term, we see signiﬁcant investment in baseload generation, potential incremental renewables as well.  So we're getting pretty excited about how this plan is shaping up and we're starting to get feedback from our stakeholders that is for somewhat supportive, some stakeholders want us to go faster, some of them want us to go slower, but we're feeling pretty good about how the plan is shaping up in order for it to be, what I would say a resilient, reliable plan for our customers as well as aﬀordable and also valuable to our investors."
"Just a follow-up on the slowing down. I know, really want to just maybe focus on the coal assets, right, because there seems to be a push in a few states to kind of maintain their viability longer for reliability purposes, et cetera. Any sense if your thoughts have changed and how to think about plants like Monroe, or are we still looking to accelerate those retirements, just given what we've seen in several states?","I'd say Shar, our thinking has not changed. If you looked at how we've handled this thus far, we've retired a signiﬁcant amount of coal already. We retired St. Clair, Rouge, Trenton, and we basically replaced those baseload generation assets one for one with natural gas assets that we purchased as well as new power plant, gas plant, that we just built; and so we feel real good about our position in terms of having reliable and dispatchable generation, and I think you'll see that pattern to continue, where not only will we build out renewable resources into our plan, but we'll also have battery systems and we'll have baseload generation in our future that will help achieve our resilience and reliability as we look to retire Monroe sooner than what we had expected, or forecasted, I should say."
"Yeah. Got it. And just last one for me, just around the visibility of the Vantage growth and any kind of strategic updates? I mean obviously, there has been some turbulence in RNG, which is one of the major drivers of that business, but at the same time, competitors are starting to merge more prominently focused on RNG, I guess do you see that kind of complicating the development process, but more importantly, as we're thinking about strategically, does this kind of present even a better opportunity for you to recycle some or all of those assets?","Yeah, Shar. I'll start by saying that we're always looking for opportunities to maximize investor value. In that business today, we see a strong -- we have a strong line of sight to growth,   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   especially in the landﬁll to RNG conversions, got a good inventory of those projects and those are still giving us mid-teens type of unlevered IRRs. So we feel really good about the growth but then again, a constant evaluation is the best path forward for our investors."
"Terriﬁc. Thanks, guys, congrats on the results.","Thank you, Shar.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy.     Hi, Jeremy."
"Just wanted to dive into load growth a little bit more, if you could share any more thoughts on your expectations for residential going forward here at this point in kind of the drivers? Just thinking about how -- post COVID world, if we are -- things are kind of evolving at this point relative to prior expectations?","Dave, you want to take that?     Sure. Hi, Jeremy. Yeah, I'd say things are things are going as we had planned or as we had thought it would. If you remember, our residential sales were up about 7% to 8% over pre COVID levels, kind at the heart of everybody working at home, and we're seeing that trend down, when we saw that a little bit in this quarter, with about a 2% lower residential sales this quarter, and we think that's going to continue to trend down a little more as people come back   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   to work and that's what we've contemplated in our rate case, and just assuming we get closer to those pre-COVID levels.  And we have seen, commercial and industrial come back and so we're ﬂat overall. But we're seeing as people tend to go back to work, we're seeing some of that on -- some of that expected reduction in our residential services. Still higher than pre-COVID right now."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And hot oﬀ the press and maybe too fresh, but just wondering those recent report surrounding mentioned supporting certain legislation out there on a climate package and just wondering if you had any preliminary thoughts there or how this might or not impact your upcoming IRP?","Well, you're right, it's hot oﬀ the press, it's interesting. And it was a good surprise last night. We are not counting on any of this right now in our plan but we think that there is some, some good beneﬁts and some good impacts to clean energy going forward. So we see the PTCs for solar, actually PTCs for nuclear and the increased value for carbon capture all being positive to help this transition and really help with some of the things that we want to do in the IRP.  So we're going through and reviewing this, we had gone through it a year ago or whenever it ﬁrst came out and kind of going back through and seeing what the impacts could be to our plan, but -- so, right now our plan didn't contemplate any of this, but this could all be good positive stuﬀ for us."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Yeah.  Operator  Our next question comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open."
"Hey, thank you. First question, going back to the upcoming IRP a little bit. And given the recent experience by CMS or Consumers Energy getting their IRP approved and the diﬀerent items, including they're still getting the recovery in return of the value of their coal plants that they're retiring early. Just -- I know it's, we'll just have to wait for the ﬁling at all, but how has that   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   decision and the components of it impacted, I guess, your planning overall, as you think about your ﬂeet?","Well, ﬁrst of all I will say that the results in the CMS case were instructive and very positive and supportive of the plan that we're looking to ﬁle. I will also say that in terms of assets, we're looking in the ﬁrst ﬁve years for a conversion of an asset. So we will not retire any coal facilities at this point in time, likely, in the three to four years, but it will start to fall into, likely the tail-end of our ﬁve-year plan and beyond, where we'll pull forward future retirements, where we have to address undepreciated amounts through either conversion to diﬀerent beneﬁcial use or perhaps accelerated depreciation or take the option at CMS (Inaudible).  So lots of options available to us that we need to ﬁnalize that we look to pull forward retirements, especially the Monroe retirements, which, there's four units there and we'll do that in a likely in a staggered -- in a staggered way. I hope that answers your questions?"
"That's good additional color. Okay. And then secondly, impressive guidance raise and that's almost a 9% EPS growth year-over-year oﬀ of the original, as we just think about again, the cost inﬂationary environment right now and I think you're doing your part every year to manage O&M or pull forward any extra levers you have to get ready for the following year is -- how you set up I guess for 2023, just given, I think this environment is a little bit more challenging than the normal years that you've been experiencing?","I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Dave. But I would say we're really well positioned for 2023. I would say that our 2022 raised guidance still has, what I would call, very adequate contingency in the plan to address the balance of the summer and the fall, and we're also looking at an opportunities to pull forward. Maintenance expenses that help build contingency into 2023, lots of work in that regard.  In terms of the inﬂationary pressures, I'll ask Dave to comment on those and how we're handling those in the 2023 planning and beyond.     We continue to -- We see the impacts of inﬂation, we continue to really work hard to manage it, to make sure it doesn't impact our plan going forward. We've had a really good success in the past of lowering our cost, our costs, or keeping our costs down compared to our peers. And one of the things that we see is 85% of our spend is Services and we haven't seen as much inﬂation there. So we're, trying to manage that and what we're doing really is looking at all of our long-term contracts, watching the market closely extending some of those contracts, doing some bundling and some other bidding to help mitigate any of the impacts we see there. So we know there -- we see the inﬂation, we feel it in -- with the wages, but within our planning   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   process, we don't see it impacting our capital plans or our O&M going forward as we continue to ﬁnd oﬀsets for it."
"Got it. That's good color. Thanks, Jerry. Thanks, Dave.  Operator  Our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.",
"Hey, good morning, Team. Thanks for taking the question.",Good morning.
"I wanted to ask -- Good morning, good morning. I wanted to ask about the the new federal clean energy package, just, I imagine there's a lot of stuﬀ in here that's similar to the prior and on the point of just nuclear tax credits, you do have the exposure at Fermi, and what type of headroom the PTC kind of create for customers there and do you have capital opportunities that could backﬁll that bill headroom if needed? Any color there would be great.","You're asking to how the nuclear PTC can play in for us, Nick?"
"Yeah. Exactly, exactly.","We're still looking through that, we looked at it in the last plan too. Doubt that it could be an advantage for -- even our plants in a regulated environment because of how it is still selling into the (Inaudible) market. So we're looking at that, it does have a phase out when the market price is high, but we think that it can be a nice backstop and really help with our customer aﬀordability as that comes down."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Got it. All right. And then I guess just on the electric rate case, you do have a history of constructive outcomes there, but just how do you feel about ultimately being able to settle this case at this point?","Nicholas, we're very interested in settling and we're having those conversations now. I would say that whether we settle or it goes to a ﬁnal order without settlement, we're feeling good about a constructive outcome. This rate case is primarily about capital investment and that capital investment is very well understood, it's not about increasing operating expenses, it's really about deploying capital that if we feel that the Commission, the staﬀ, as well as the administration is very supportive of this infrastructure build out as it relates to renewables and baseload generation, as well as signiﬁcant investment in our electric grid, I believe that our capital investment is very well understood and valued by the interested stakeholders, so we expect a good constructive outcome, but we would love to sell this certainly."
"Got it. Thanks a lot.  Operator  Our next question comes from David (inaudible) from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.",
"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.","Hey Dave, Morning."
"Morning. I was wondering on the O&M pull forward side of things, I was just wondering is there a certain level of O&M that you've been able to pull forward so far into 2022 from 2023, just given the strength that you've had thus far in the ﬁrst half?","Dave?     Yeah, we have been able to do some of that. Some of it was natural pull forward, we accelerated some of our tree trim expense and we were able to do that because we frankly we had less   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   storms we are able to work through some of our tree trim that we've been able to pull forward and then some of our outages are planned outages, we were able to do a little bit earlier as well. So there is some of that and that's what we're seeing play through in the second quarter."
"Yeah, okay.","But we do feel like it's putting us in a nice position for '23, the more of that we can do as well. So we're trying to manage a few years at the time here."
"Understood. And then I think on the rate case, do you have any line of sight as to how long you might be able to stay out from rate cases again after the conclusion of this one and would strategically your preference be to have it be several years between rate cases going forward?","Yeah, that's something we'll have to assess once we get the ﬁnal results. Obviously our desire is always to stay out as long as possible, but once we once we ﬁnalize, we'll have a better view on that. We are looking at in future rate cases, potential mechanisms for example, trackers on capital that I would say is very transparent and very well understood and there seems to be renewed interest in that thought. So that's something that we may pursue in our next rate case."
"Got you. Thanks. And then last quick one, I was just wondering, is there any commentary you'd provide on how the trading environment is looking thus far in 3Q just in terms of the market volatility, are there prospects for continued strength in that business?","Well, I'd say, you've seen there is still is a lot of volatility in that area. We continue to manage things really tightly and have strict controls in there, but we're generally long in our physical position. We've had, frankly, we've had a really good year there, as we mentioned, we're at $52 million year-to-date in the business, but some of that is timing that we know will play out over the second half. But even with the volatility, there should be some additional opportunity there as well."
"Great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Please go ahead, your line is open.",
"Hey, good morning everyone, just a lot of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just wanted to ask two on the gas side. Can you give us any update on the clean vision natural gas program, the voluntary clean gas program, where does that stand?","Andrew that -- we're getting subscriptions weekly. I would say that we're roughly around 5,000 to 60,000 customers that have signed up. So it's following a similar track as when we oﬀered the MIgreenPower program on the electric side. So good interest, we're evolving the product, if you will, to try to attract commercial customers and industrial customers to the program.  So that will be the next evolution of that program and when we do that, we will -- we expect larger volumes. Right now, we're getting small volumes from residential customers and it's primarily a residential program, which is the way we started MIGreenPower. So we're going to continue to evolve that product as we've seen interest from some of our institutional customers and corporate customers that would like to enroll. So more to come on that."
"Do you think that business could be as big as the electric one, relative to the proportionally?","It's early to tell, Andrew, but we're certainly seeing an interest in the product, if you recall the product is really bio sequestration products, which are forestry products that we use as carbon oﬀsets, as well as a small component of RNG and so we'll have to look to be acquiring more assets to support what I would say larger volumes, right at this point in time, we've acquired assets in Michigan through third parties that are in the forestry business that oﬀer us those carbon oﬀsets and we're well supplied and we're looking to see what the opportunities are for larger institutional corporate clients that would like to have this product. So more to come, it's hard to say if it will be as big as the electric business, but it took us three or four years to get that voluntary program on the electric side that really started coming and to get signiﬁcant interest and commitment."
"Okay, that's helpful. The other one is just on the gas rate case, any sense of when the next ﬁling might come?","We're looking either fourth quarter or ﬁrst quarter, fourth quarter of this year or ﬁrst quarter of next year.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. That would have rates in place for not this upcoming heating season, but the following one, right?",That's correct.
"Okay, thank you very much.","Thank you, Andrew.  Operator  Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open."
Good morning.,"Good morning, Ryan."
"Morning. It looks like about 40% of the, the EPS increase guidance was from Energy Trading. Would you be able to talk about how much of the year-to-date performance is expected to be reversed and then given the volatility of the last few weeks, does this guidance seem conservative from your perspective, when you look for the remaining portion again?","Ryan, that's a good question. You're right, we had another good quarter in trading and had a really good start to the year. So like I mentioned, we're at $52 million year-to-date in that business. And that's why we are conﬁdent raising the guidance from, like you said 15 to 25, up to 20 to 35, and the timing impact is probably about half of that and the performance is another half. So we're seeing, half of it that's really come out on performance, but the timing could play out in two ways, either with if we see prices come back or some of it just plays out as we deliver on the physical position. So if pricing doesn't come down as much then there could be some   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   favorability in that timing piece for the second half of the year too. But we're conﬁdent in the guidance right now."
How is that guidance set then given the comment you just made. What are the bookends of the range that was provided?,"Okay. I'm sorry, if -- we said it based on what we know we can achieve and what we think we can achieve, and so we see that performance part is right within the middle of that guidance; and then, if some of the timing or the pricing doesn't play out in the kind of in the downward way, then we can reach the the high end of that guidance."
"Okay. And then as in the release, looks like you reaﬃrmed your longer-term EPS growth guidance, should we view that to be oﬀ of a re-based '22 number that reﬂects the higher '22 guidance?","That's of the original '22 guidance, is where we go from."
"Oﬀ the original. Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.",
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Steve."
"Hey, Jerry, the -- I'm just curious, going back to question before on the RNG business, there was this recent transaction for Vanguard renewables and I'd be curious just any any thought on kind   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   of the the pricing valuation of that and how it impacts -- how you're thinking about the value of Vantage?","Yeah. We saw that as well, Steve. It was, they're a diﬀerent business than us and they don't have as many operating projects, but it did look like a really good opportunity and shows great interest and great conﬁdence in the RNG market going forward and the opportunity for additional development projects. So sorry to do a direct comparison of pricing but was viewed as a positive in the market, that there is still some strong -- or still a lot of strong interest in RNG."
"Okay. And then I apologize, this is also kind of breaking news questions, but just in the past, when, I think, late last year, when BBB was ﬁrst likely, you talked about, interest, and you've talked about interest in carbon capture storage and opportunities there long term, could you maybe just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that business opportunity?","Sure, Steve, we certainly were encouraged by the tax beneﬁts that the current plan, good oﬀer. We need to understand it clearly, but we've got a handful of projects that we're looking at early feasibility stage and in our service territory, as well as outside our service territory. And these could be quite interesting, with enhanced tax credits, especially the 45-Q that we believe is being proposed, change in that. So more to come on that but could be quite interesting in terms of evolving potential investment opportunity."
"Okay. My last unfair question is just, I guess, to Dave just in terms of thinking about this 15% minimum tax, could you just give a sense of whether that would be an issue for you at all?","Yes, Steve. We -- we looked at this before and we got to revisit it again, just to go through how it could all work. When we spend time with it a year ago, we understood that we could, we think it could work on an earnings basis and we can ﬁnd ways to oﬀset the earnings that may have a little bit of a cash it, but it wasn't that strong, it's also want to look at how that plays into some of the renewable development projects and the accelerated depreciation there is the other piece of that. But we were able to, as we are doing some of our analysis, mitigate most of the impacts of what that seems like it could do."
"Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Thank you, Steve.  Operator   Our last question will come from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open."
"Good morning, Jerry. Good morning, Dave.","Morning, Anthony.     Hey, Anthony."
"Hopefully, just two quick ones. Just related to I'm just going to slide 16 on the convertible equity units. What I think is a dilution you get hit with (Inaudible), I think it's November for fourth quarter this year, the tailwinds that you guys have going into '23 to kind of oﬀset this, I'm thinking of electric rate case and maybe more earnings for Vantage, are there any other tailwinds that may be that could potentially oﬀset the dilution?","I would say, Anthony, the entire capital plan at both utilities is a fundamental tailwind that will move us through 2023 and we're pretty conﬁdent we're going to achieve our growth targets in 2023 because of the primarily driven by the capital plan at the two utilities. I think you'll see that our growth at both utilities is very healthy in 2023 and that's what will move us through. And also Vantage, of course, will make its contribution in its growth, we're adding $15 million a year there.  So all three entities are really going to drive us through 2023 and that dilution that you're talking about."
"I actually don't think you're going to answer this. But would you be able to give us -- would the company be willing to give us guidance on net income? Like right now, we have I think 5 to 7 EPS growth. I mean I'm thinking for net income from '22 to '23 or base here, it's more much higher above the 5 to 7, is that something the Company would provide?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, that's something we can look to provide, Anthony, show the growth that are underlying utilities, maybe is something we've shown in the past, so that's something that we can look at also."
"Great, thanks so much for taking my questions.","Yeah, thanks, Anthony.     Thank you, Anthony.  Operator  We have no further questions, I'd like to turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for any closing remarks.     Well, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll just close by saying that DTE had a very successful second quarter and we're feeling great about the remainder of 2022 and also our long-term plan. I hope everyone has a great morning and stays healthy and safe. Thank you.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
