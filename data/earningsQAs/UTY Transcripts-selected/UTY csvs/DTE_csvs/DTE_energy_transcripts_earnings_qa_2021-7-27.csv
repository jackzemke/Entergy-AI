Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.","Morning, Shar.     Hi Shar."
"So just on the IRP, Jerry kind of reference in your prepared. Your peer obviously has an aggressive decarbonization plan out there, probably one of the more aggressive plans. Can we maybe just get a sense on how you're thinking about your upcoming IRP and sort of not front [ph] on the process? But can you get out of all your coal prior to the 2030?","We're looking Shar. We're looking at how we can accelerate our coal retirements. You know, we've started with a larger position in our coal ﬂeet and our self-generation ﬂeet. So, we're-- we are looking very closely at how we can accelerate all of these retirements, a prior to 2040. So your -- you'll recall that are -- in our prior IRP, we are retiring all of our coal by 2040. So we're looking at acceleration scenarios to pull that forward and without mentioning, in past discussions, we will update you likely at the end of the year or early next year as -- what those plans may look like. And we're spending a lot of time with various stakeholders through the summer, including our board, having those conversations and trying to balance the interests and acceleration and of course, aﬀordability and reliability."
"Got it. And just Jerry, can EEI be the right podium to disclose the updated plan?","It'll either be there Shar, early in the New Year in front of the (inaudible) that's the range of timing that we're looking at right now. We will get a little tighter on that as we go forward."
"Got it, got it. And then just as a follow-up sort of between kind of already strong rate based growth at DTE Electric and Gas, which obviously exceeds your earnings guidance growth rate.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   And you have the potential to accelerate decarbonization with the updated IRP coming. And I guess, how does all this kind of play into your 5% to 7% growth rate? Obviously I understand you're taking the conservative bend here, but could we see some incremental upside here in time especially if you decarbonized faster than what's in your current internal planning assumptions?","Well, we're looking obviously, we're in the middle of all of that analysis and as you mentioned Shar, typically we update our capital forecast of EEI. For our ﬁve-year outlook and as we start to build in these earlier retirements, there could be impact on the back end of that plan, as you recall, the back end of our plan, return more to the average in terms of rate based growth and earnings growth of the two utilities. So we're -- likely it'll be impactful in the back end of that plan. So more to come on that Shar, but we're working through all those details now."
"All right. Terriﬁc. Thanks, guys. That's all I had. Appreciate it.",Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from Jeremy Tonet with J.P.Morgan.
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.     Hi Jeremy.
"I know that GSP is now discontinued so obviously not a focus going forward in the same way, but just wanted to better understand, I guess what was happening here? If I look at the results so far, it seems like GSP has put up 56% of the high end of the guidance already. And so, I was just wondering if you could expand a bit more on what speciﬁcally GSP did to kind of exceed expectations in the ﬁrst half or if there was something baked into later in the year that was going to weigh down? Just trying to understand a bit better what was happening there?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Well, we can comment on the ﬁrst half and I know the pipeline company will have their earnings call out here later, I think early next month. So I'm sure they'll comment on that, but what we can talk about is the, the ﬁrst half of the year and we just saw favorability in all the platforms across the board -- our southern platforms and our northern platforms."
"Got it. I mean where those sustained or is anything kind of one time in nature, that was a positive beneﬁt?","Again, it was a pickup in activity and value across all our platforms, both in the Appalachia platforms and the Haynesville platform. I think, in terms of forward looking, that'll be more appropriate for DTM to describe."
"Got it. And maybe just kind of pivoting over to the electric utility, some really strong results there, I'm just wondering if you could provide a bit more color with regard to low trend recoveries there, it seems like commercial sales were coming better. But just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on how things materialized versus your expectations, versus your guidance for the segment and how you see that kind of trending?","Dave, you want to take that.     Sure. Yeah. First, if you look at quarter-over-quarter that we have been there, you can see that was way up and that was especially commercial industrial that was really because we were comparing back to the worst period of the pandemic, so quarter-over-quarter, we saw commercial industrial way up. Interestingly we saw residential stayed pretty ﬂat quarter-over- quarter. That's interesting because last year with people working from home and we saw a residential load running at an average about 8% higher than we would have expected pre- pandemic. And this year so far, we're seeing that continue even though there has been some return to work, but we still see that we're seeing this favorability at residential and that's what's driving some of the favorability. So, we expected it to reduce more but at this point it's pretty sticky. So we're going to be watching this closely to see how it plays out and how it can impact really customer aﬀordability going forward if it's remain sticky."
Got it. (multiple speakers)   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),"Yeah, I would say commercial load. I mean that's come pretty much all the way back from what to -- what we would have expected and we -- at the kind of the height of the pandemic. We thought we'd see some more bankruptcies and closures in the commercial and we really haven't seen that. So, we've seen our commercial load really come back to as expected. Industrial load was cut -- was coming back and pretty much came back, but that has some variability in it, due to some of the instability really or the challenges at the auto plants right now with the chip shortage is they're running a little more sporadically. Really it's been a great return to load and then the residential remains really sticky for us."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. If I could slip in one more on RNG, just wondering if you could expand a little bit on how large, do you see this business kind of growing over time? It seems like there's more of a focus there. And how do you see the growth rate of that business kind of comparing to the rest of the DTE?","Well, the non-utility business will make up no more than 10% of overall operating earnings for the company. So the growth will be modest compared to the growth that we're seeing under two utilities. We're planning to put $17 billion to work over the next ﬁve years in our two utilities and somewhere between a $1.5 billion to $2 billion to work on a non-utility businesses. So it'll be modest levels of investment. We don't need a lot of income growth from that business. So we're being really picky and discerning about the type of projects that we invest in RNG and where we're seeing three to four year paybacks, simple cash paybacks and unlevered IRRs after tax in the teens. So that's what we're, that's what we're going after. So not a lot of pressure to grow there. And so we're being very discerning about our growth projects."
Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.,
"Hey, good morning, team. Congratulations, on the results.","Thank you, Julien. Good morning.      DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Good morning, Julien."
"Absolutely quick question. I think you alluded to it a couple times and I think Jeremy might have been trying to get after this, but you've alluded to a smooth trajectory here, a 5% to 7% in the '22. Just want to make sure that sort of on balance net of all these items for the ballpark we should still be assuming, right?","Just want to (multiple speakers) right Julien, we're going to be -- typically we target the midpoint of our growth rates, right? That's how we plan for our business. That's how we build contingency plans. And so, we're going to deliver this year."
"Excellent and perhaps even more importantly here as you think about layering in these incremental items, be it be IRP at some point or frankly some of the renewable opportunities that are more on voluntary side and/or some additional as you say, perhaps late stage, your advanced stage conversations on the industrial and RNG side. What's that -- what's that outlook, the timeline here? Some of the IRP updates may be beyond the ﬁve year or do you think that some of that actually accrues the near term? I would presume the voluntary renewables and the non-utility businesses to be more in that ﬁve-year period.","Yeah, the voluntary renewals update and I will provide in the fall will certainly play into the Five- Year Plan. I would say the IRP work that we're doing, could come into The Five-Year Plan or late latter part of The Five-Year Plan, but certainly that will be a good story beyond the ﬁve year plan as well."
"Got it. And maybe clarify your earlier comment about sort of showing the normalization in the rate based growth trajectory, when you commented to Shar. Is that beyond the ﬁve years that you're talking about or is that even within the ﬁve years that you kind of alluding to -- to potentially seeing a more sustained current level rate base growth rather than that normalization trend?","What we are seeing Julien, is our growth rates in our operating earnings for our two utility is higher than our average that we've advertised, right? The 9% at the gas company and 7% to 8% at the electric company in the ﬁrst couple of years of our Five-Year Plan and that's helping us deliver that smooth EPS growth rate that we've described. And then it returns more to the average in the out years of the plan as we have -- as we described.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Right. So, despite the long-term nature of some of the IRP on balance we could see some of that really accrued to the back half of this 5 year plan regardless?","That's possible. Early, too early to tell, but certainly possible."
"Excellent. All right. And just again to come back to Jeremy's quick clariﬁcation there on the, the RNG side. Again, your 10% you're sticking with it, right? So, we should really be thinking about scaling it and sizing it within that bucket, right?",That's correct.
Excellent. Thank you so much for the clariﬁcations here. All the best.,"Thank you, Julien.     Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs."
"Thank you. My ﬁrst question on the ﬁnancing side of things, when you think about the ﬁve-year growth plan and beyond 2023? How should we think about potential equities in the back half of that plan? And what's embedded in your guidance?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Dave?     Right now, we're -- you have seen we have given the guidance through the three years which only has the only acquisitions as well as converts to come in '22. You know, as we look out of the ﬁve year plan -- our goal is going to be to continue to minimize the acquisitions really and that's how it ﬁts within the plan that we're looking at right now."
"Got it. So based on the base that the current CapEx plan, you're looking at more moderate level of EBIT [ph]. It's kind of like what you're seeing on the 2023 front.",Right.
"Got it and then just going back to RNG a little bit, appreciate the earnings mix that's going to have in the overall portfolio. When you talk about the strong returns that you're talking about, are you seeing increased competition now, with a lot of other players focused on that and as you know you look out at potential new projects, are you seeing those translating into a tougher returns on a comp basis?","You know what we're seeing is with the level of investment that we have to make which is a couple of RNG projects a year. Couple of dairy farms a year is another way to think about it. Not really having trouble originating greenﬁeld where we've seen things get a little more frothy [ph] as when assets are up and running. People are paying a lot of money for these assets that are up and running private equity and other types of investment vehicles. So, but on the origination front greenﬁeld -- we're more able to get the returns we want, get the projects that we want."
Understood. Thank you so much.  Operator  Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.,
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan.     Hey, Jonathan."
"But on the trading in the quarter which you have said was gas portfolio. Is that was that really yeah, this sale of storage out of the -- is it related to the winter storm event or was that favorability more in the ﬁrst quarter and this was discontinued good performance, just curious, what's driving that?","And this was discontinued good performance of the trading group in the gas portfolio. We can say, the -- what gave us the conﬁdence to raise the guidance was the favorability we had from that small physical storage position, that gave us the gain during the ﬁrst quarter, during that cold weather in Texas. For our expectation going forward in future years is that -- will be more in line with our original guidance when we don't have those kind of unexpected one-time things."
"Okay. And then just some back to the growth rate of the comments about to -- Jerry just to be clear. You, you're talking oﬀ of the original 2020, midpoint, right, which was I think 513 [ph]? And I just want to be sure that and that -- is that the number of which you're intending to show smooth 5% to 7% growth or, and we should think of sort of this Q21 favorability is --which kind of puts you above that range, but you still are using that as the base. I just want to be clear about that.","We're using the -- you are correct, we're using the original 2021 guidance that we provided as the basis for our growth rate."
Is that '21 or 2020.,2020.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
Okay.,"But it would be similarly smooth through '21 because we targeted midpoint for each of the years, in terms of original guidance from the starting point."
"Okay, so we should just be calibrating oﬀ of original guidance in both cases, and that's --.",Correct.
"Great, thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore.",
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my questions.",Good morning.     Morning.
"You have answered the -- you have answered them most. Good morning. Maybe just update us on the recent, what's the most latest on, the gas rate case front. And then the timing of the electric rate cases, is that still sort of late this year?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So, the -- on electric rate case, yes, it's still late this year no earlier than October of this year that we will ﬁle. And on the gas case, we've engaged in conversations with interested parties, to actually try and move the case toward some form of settlement settlement, but we're feeling pretty good about that in terms of how that case is progressing and it's a ﬁnal outcome."
"Excellent. And then, just a little quick clariﬁcation and you sort of address the demand trends pretty strong quarter Q2 '21 versus Q2 '20. Obviously if there are concerns around this Delta variant anything sort of that is striking or sort of material for us to talk about anything that you're seeing in your territory and any cause of concern as it relates to Delta variant?","We are not at this point. Certainly the large manufacturing outﬁts are starting to take actions to make sure that the Delta variant doesn't impact their operations, things like masking and social distancing starting and we reintroduce somewhat in preparation for potential Delta variant surge here in Michigan. But we're not seeing any thing that puts any of our margin at risk at this point in time."
Excellent. Thank you guys. Great quarter.,Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from Andrew Weisel was Scotiabank.
"Hey, good morning everyone.","Good morning, Andrew.     Andrew. (multiple speakers)"
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Hi. A lot of my questions were answered, appreciating the conservative and given that you've grown 12.5 % this year and grew 9%. Are you beating up by 9% in 2020, but we'll stick with 5% to 7% for now. Just to clarifying ones on 2021 outlook. First of all, does the updated guidance, reﬂect July weather?","Dave?     Yeah, we do take into account weather into account, but there hasn't been too much, too much weather in July, yes."
"Okay, then on cash ﬂow -- excuse me. I see you updated the outlook from cash from operations to reﬂect the Midstream spin-oﬀ. What about the underlying DTE business? Looks like cash has been stronger than expected since you're pointing to no equity needs this year. Of that $300 million reduction, can you talk about how much was Midstream and if there was any change to the base business?","In the guidance update, that was all taken out the second half a Midstream. And you're right, we have seen some strength too. And I we were coming in a little bit above our plan in cash so far this year, mainly due to the strength in operating cash ﬂows from Electric and from some of the other businesses too."
"Okay. Then that strength is not reﬂected in the updated guidance, right? So, there might be some upside?","There, yes there might be some upside. The guidance was really just taken out the Midstream part."
Okay. Great. Thank you for clarifying.  Operator  The next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),
Good morning.,Good morning.     Morning.
"Can you update us on longer-term O&M outlook and now that we're emerging from a COVID environment, if you're seeing any more structural changes to your cost proﬁle?","We constantly work to maintain O&M as ﬂat as possible. And I think, you'll see from our history that were one of the better performing utilities in terms of being able to keep our O&M costs relatively ﬂat, I think over the last several years we've been about 1% CAGR. On O&M, we do have signiﬁcant opportunities to continue to do that looking forward. And that certainly is built into our growth plans as well as our aﬀordability (inaudible) gets for our two utilities."
Are you seeing any inﬂationary pressure for labor or any other component of your cost structure?,"We've been looking on that pretty hard as we started to build our plans for '22 and beyond. And we have got a long-term contracts for some of our key commodities on the material side. So, we're not seeing pressure there. And with our contractors, I don't do -- a good portion of our work, those are obviously negotiated prices and again, not seeing anything that would give us great concern at this point in time."
"Okay. And then, on energy trading you had highlighted the increasing guidance range that largely was reﬂecting the year-over-year increase for the second quarter. Is there embedded conservatism for the second half outlook -- in light of some of the volatility in the gas prices that will rise to higher prices? Or is there any color you can share on what's driving the relatively no change to the second half outlook?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Yeah, there's conservativeness in that. As you can see, we put our guidance from 25 [ph] to 35 [ph] and we're pretty much within that range or at the top end of that range already. So, we do have some conservatism in that number and we'll just have to watch how it plays out throughout the year."
"Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.  Operator  The next question is from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.",
Good morning. Can you guys hear me?,Yes. Good morning.     Yeah. Good morning.
"One real quick question. And I know it's early in the IRP as sort of the end of next year. But as you're approaching the acceleration potentially have more coal. How are you thinking about, I guess the regulatory recovery mechanisms for accelerating that coal retirement, are you thinking more regulatory asset model or securitization potentially?",What we're looking at are various techniques that we have our disposal one of the accelerated depreciation. We're also looking at ways to make the assets -- asset lives longer in terms of being remaining used in used (inaudible) in all kinds of ﬁscal options for that -- that we're considering. And we're also looking at some tax strategies that could help smooth aﬀordability as well. So multiple ways that we're looking at making ﬁnancing on the retirement of coal earlier more aﬀordable to our customers and also making sure that our investors get their value out of these assets.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Great. Thanks so much, guys.  Operator   Have a follow-up from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.",
"Well, thank you, guys. This is a quick one. On the convert post the spin, I believe the numbers may change in terms of other shares it will convert into and we'll have you, will that be disclosed in the Q [ph] or could give us some guidance here as to what the implications of the spin worth a conversion?","Yeah, there is -- there will be an adjustment to the settlement rates to ensure consistency of the economics. So it'll change the convert price kind of in proportion with the equity price so that equity holders remain (inaudible) and Barb can send those mechanics to you -- you can contact Barb and get the actual mechanics of that if you want after the call."
"But there is an oﬀset Dave, it's really my question, rather were they still pending on trading levels?","I think, with the trading levels seeing where the stock price will be at the time there will be convert still will aﬀect that."
Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator  And your ﬁnal question comes from line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.,
"Hey, good morning, Jerry. Good morning, Dave.","Good morning.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Hey, Anthony, how's it going?"
"Hey, hopefully two easy ones, I guess the ﬁrst one Jerry earlier in the call, you are highlighting how the transaction team worked, you got to spin of DT Midstream very seamless. I mean, you seem like you're transaction team is in midseason form right now. Any thought to keeping them in shape with other transactions?","Well, right now we're -- Anthony, we're really focused on our $17 billion growth agenda of the utilities, I will choose the lion share of our CapEx. And of course, having a nice modest growth for our non-utility business P&I and RNG and cogen primarily. So, that's really our play right now, for the next ﬁve years."
"Great. And then just lastly, post spin and I just don't know the process. Do you know if your ESG score is under like evaluation now that the company has removed the ESG business and looking at your new I guess environmental footprint DTE classic, I mean how often is that review happen or any insight you give on the potential for a change in your ESG score?","So, I would venture to say that our ESG metrics will improve with this spin of DTM, but Barb, maybe I'll get Barb to provide some insights to Anthony as to when that might happen, when might we get the next score.     (multiple speakers) Sorry about that. Yeah, those happen annually, typically and right now we're sitting above average on quite a few of those metrics."
Great. Thanks so much.,"Thank you, Anthony.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I will now turn the call back over to Jerry Norcia for closing remarks.     Thank you everyone for joining us today. I'll just close by saying that DTE had a very successful ﬁrst half of the year and we're feeling really good about the remainder of 2021, and also how well we're setting up for 2022. So, I hope everyone has a great morning, and stay healthy and safe.  Operator  This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
