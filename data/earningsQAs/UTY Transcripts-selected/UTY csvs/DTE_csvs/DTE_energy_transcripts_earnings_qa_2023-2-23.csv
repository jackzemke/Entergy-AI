Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a great quarter.","Good morning.     Hey, Constantine. Thanks.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Certainly, appreciate the disclosures around the lower revenue approval. Can you maybe just talk about the changes that are now embedded in that reiterated '23 guidance? And maybe just contrasting with prior years, I think you called out around $100 million of kind of contingency ﬂex. So what would be a good proxy for '23, speciﬁcally as we think about lean actions? And what portion was built-up in '22 like weather and reinvestment versus more recurring and prospective reductions?","So, as Dave mentioned, we had prepared our plans in the fall prior to the rate case. We had adequate contingency in our plans and we had anticipated some of the headwinds from interest expense and inﬂation. When we received the rate order, it created an incremental approximately $120 million challenge to our plan. And so we dove deep into our lean plans and started exercise our lean plans immediately, which is a practice that many of you are familiar with that we undertake.  And the areas that basically we pursued were delaying hiring, reducing contractor workforce and placing our employees into those roles, reducing overtime signiﬁcantly and deferring maintenance work without sacriﬁcing safety or quality of service. And as you know, when we have years where we experienced favorable outcomes like last year, we started to invest heavily in our maintenance practices. And so this year, we'll be drawing on those banks, if you will.     And I'll just add that as soon as we knew that this rehearing was a possibility or that we saw the sales, we went into action building our plans. And now, we're tracking this daily and a lot of times in weekly and we're executing on our plans really well so-far this year."
"Excellent. And following-up on the parent guidance and holdco [ph] debt, as you mentioned, it looks like '23 is relatively ﬂat to '22. Can you talk about the interest rate assumptions and reﬁnancing needs that you're embedding at this point? Utility bonds continue to hover in the high 5s range. And is that fully embedded in both the '23 guidance and the reiterated 6% to 8%?","Yes, it is. At the highest level, we've incorporated increasing interest rates in our plans for our ﬁve year plan. At the holding company, right, we don't have any retirements in '23 other than this $800 million of outstanding term loan. And for that, we've entered into some ﬂoating to ﬁx to make sure we reduce any exposure to interest rate volatility in '23.  And then in '24 and '25 and beyond, we've conservatively modeled rates in our plan and look for opportunities to bring that in even more favorably as we go forward.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Excellent. And last quick one, just housekeeping on the DTE Vantage side. Have you seen any shifts in economics and valuation in the business as it relates to speciﬁcally the non-solutions businesses like RNG? You've seen a lot of new entrants and private equity engagement on that front. So kind of does that make it more or less attractive versus development like carbon capture or any other emerging solutions?","I can start, and Dave can add. Certainly, we're seeing very aggressive values for RNG transactions. That's encouraging in terms of value for our assets. And we are starting to look at a handful of opportunities in carbon capture and storage, especially with the IRA providing signiﬁcant tax credit uplift in that business. And we're looking at very small projects to sort of get our feet wet, if you will, in that process with our expertise in storage and pipeline work as well as processing.  So Dave, do you want to add to that?     I agree. I think all I was going to add is that the IRA has made some of these projects more attractive. So we do see some additional competition, but we also have some of our own landﬁll gas projects that we can work for conversions that can be very attractive for us in the future, too."
And just any thoughts on capital rotation within that business or more kind of toe in the water approach?,"At this point in time, there's no deﬁnitive plans for capital rotation. But I -- we're constantly looking at those types of opportunities. We've got a track record of rotating capital out of our non-utility businesses and helping to fund some of our utility work. At this point, you would notice that we have very little equity needs. So we're trying to certainly match up sort of ﬁnancing needs with potential rotations in the future. So we'll see more to come on that as we go. But certainly, always open to anything that creates accretion opportunities for our investors."
Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thanks.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity),
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This is (inaudible) for Nick today. So just ﬁrst question...,"Good morning, Nick. Well, good morning."
"Yeah. So ﬁrst question is on the regulatory strategy, as you mentioned to continue practice of pursuing a settlement with all stakeholders. Could you just update us on this front? And how should we view this new rate case ﬁling just diﬀerent from the last one ﬁled earlier last year? Also, recognizing PSC's comments on the rehearing process, I think it's -- I think although the request was denied. The commissioners believes that DTE comes in with a very constructive approach and willing to negotiate.  And also just on the electric side, I think mostly rate cases have been conducted through litigation. Can you just help us better understand the new electric rate case ﬁling strategy with these backdrops?","Sure. So our intent, we've got two major regulatory initiatives this year. One is the Integrated Resource Plan that will conclude in the second half of this year and then our electric general rate case that will conclude in December. We are very interested in settling both. And I would say that in the ﬁrst instance, with the integrated resource plan, many of the parties that are involved are very interested in settlement discussions. We've had our ﬁrst set of discussions, which are encouraging. And we seek to settle that case, which is the Integrated Resource Plan. Later in this year, we will start those conversations for settlement around the electric rate case.  We do have a history of settling gas cases in many of our renewable regulatory ﬁlings as well as our cost recovery factor ﬁlings and GCRs have been settled in the past. So we know how to do this and have done it, and we will pursue it in these two major regulatory initiatives this year."
"No. Thanks. This is really helpful. Thanks for all the colors. And just quickly on the '23 guide, you provisioned for midpoint. And given all the mitigation strategy, can you just comment on just how should we think about -- I think it was timely call on the storm cost or any weather conditions that could throw you oﬀ this midpoint, how much or how should we think of -- have you provisioned for that?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Well, certainly, the contingency that we walk into the year with is exactly for these purposes, whether it's deviations in weather or -- we do carry a storm budget as part of our base plan. And then, of course, if storm costs exceed plan, and that's what contingency may be used for -- or maybe for weather variations. So I would say that we have adequate contingency at this point in time based on what we've seen so far in the year.  And as we consume contingency, as I mentioned before, we go into deeper lean actions to try and restore contingency, especially as we head into the summer season, which is really our biggest opportunity to create value for our shareholders. That's when we really want to make sure that most of our contingency is intact."
"No, it makes sense. Really appreciate the colors here. Thanks.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
"Hi, good morning. This is a Heidi (inaudible) on for Julian. Thank you for taking our questions and congrats on today's results.",Thank you.
"Thank you. Just the ﬁrst question, kind of coming back to the 2023 O&M cuts. You mentioned historic success in executing on these cuts with COVID and the last recession. Do you perceive any risk, I guess, at this time around, once again executing on O&M costs given, a, the inﬂationary cost backdrop we've seen and then b, a bit higher scrutiny from Michigan regulator across Michigan utilities on vegetation management eﬀorts, particularly with the 2022 storm docket? Thank you.","Yes. So let me start with vegetation management ﬁrst. We've got our largest vegetation management program that we've ever had historically in our company. Back in 2013, we were investing about $65 million a year in vegetation management. And several years ago, we came   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   up with a creative solution with the commission to basically more than triple the investment in vegetation management. This year, for example, we will invest over $200 million in vegetation management. And we actually agreed to amortize those costs over time in order to smooth out the impact to our customers, but still give our customers the beneﬁt of reliability improvements.  And as I mentioned in my comments, I think the commission would agree that we've had signiﬁcant impact on reliability where we have taken on a very aggressive tree trimming, as well as hardening of the system by replacing poles and wires and transformers. So very signiﬁcant investments in the grid. And where we've completed that work, we've had signiﬁcant improvements in reliability.  So we feel good about the work that we're doing. We were always looking for opportunities to do even better. And we believe that, that's what the process that the commission has initiated is really about, is really ﬁnding joint opportunities to accelerate and improve processes to make our investments even more eﬀective than they have been. So I'm excited about that.  In terms of cost reductions, your ﬁrst question. We are undertaking many of these one-time actions in order to accommodate the challenge that we received late last year. And we feel pretty conﬁdent in executing those. We know they are one-time. They're not sustainable. Things like not hiring people or suspending hiring. We do need to replace critical positions in our company over time. And not to say that there's not potential eﬃciency opportunities that we will pursue, some of this could stick. I mean, that's the opportunity that we're faced with. But a lot of these actions are one-time and not sustainable in nature. And also, deferring maintenance work, we can do that for short periods of time, but certainly cannot do that for a longer periods of time. Hopefully, that helps."
"Yes, deﬁnitely.","Yeah. And as we built these plans, we were very careful to ensure that we weren't going to impact -- ﬁrst of all, never impact safety. Nothing that would impact reliability or our ability to deliver for our customers. And so these plans are built with that in mind and so it should ﬁt well even though they're unsustainable for, in the future should ﬁt well with what we're trying to continue to do for our customers."
"Understood. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just kind of switching gears a bit here. I know we've seen some recent headlines detailing, for example, plans for large-scale battery manufacturing facilities in Michigan to service electric vehicles. So just kind of wondering what you're seeing in terms of new industrial load and if any of that will kind of accrue favorably to DTE in terms of higher electric load?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Certainly, last year, General Motors has announced the battery plant and battery operation -- assembly operations in our service territory. And certainly, we're really excited about that. In the past year, we also saw One Energy announced a new battery plant in our service territory. In addition to that, the University of Michigan announced a multibillion-dollar investment program right next door to our headquarters for an innovation center, which will drive economic growth and development in the city of Detroit. And most recently, the Henry Ford Hospital system is rebuilding their hospital campus in Downtown Detroit with a multibillion-dollar investment as well, which will create new jobs, new economic development activity.  And those are some of the big ones that I mentioned, but there are so many others. In my time at DTE, this has probably been the most active economic development period that I've seen. So we're pretty excited about growth both in the industrial and commercial sector, which ultimately, as you know, will drive growth in residential investment as well and commercial investment to support those industries."
"Great. Thank you. That's great color there. Thanks for your time this morning, and congrats again.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Your line is open.
"Good morning, guys.","Hey, Angie.     Good morning, Angie."
"Good morning. So just going back to the rate case strategy, and I know that we are maybe over analyzing this. But I'm just -- I mean, you have another rate case ﬁling, a big one this time. Are there any lessons learned from the previous case then that you've embedded in this ﬁling? So any changes in the strategy? Some, I don't know, outreach to the commission and the staﬀ ahead of it? So that's one.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Number two is how is -- how are the residential sales trending vis-a-vis the -- well, the past rate case and the current rate case? I mean, are you seeing any deterioration in sales versus what you had expected?  And then lastly, you mentioned, I think, as far as the gas rate cases that you might elongate the time in between the rate cases. And I'm just debating this myself if that's the right strategy given that, that maybe increases the amount of the ask in the next rate case, if you stay out, again just trying to have some lessons learned from the outcome of the last rate case on the electric side.","Sure. So let me start with, Angie, the lessons learned and I'll have Dave talk about sales, and then we can talk about the gas rate case strategy as well. So as we reﬂect on the outcome, certainly, the major issue there was sales volume forecast. And again, it's -- and Dave will talk about how our sales are tracking, but they're essentially tracking as we had expected. And -- but I -- this will be resolved in the next rate case. Sales will not be a mystery. So that's point number one. That was the biggest fundamental deviation, if you will, in this last rate case.  But again, we dug deeper than that, Angie, and said, how can we improve what we ﬁle. So we've taken another really deep inspection and review of all of our ﬁlings to make sure that they're well supported, well understood, continue to be well understood in order to get a better understanding with the staﬀ and the commission and other interveners as to what is it that we're trying to accomplish with this signiﬁcant investment proﬁle that we have with directed at our grid, as well as our renewable assets. So a lot of work went into, what I would say, continue to improve and continuously improve the quality of our submission.  So that's something that we did, as well as we spent a lot of time ahead of the rate case, creating context, not only for the commission, but also for some of our interveners as to what are these investments pointed at and why is this fundamental? And if we look at the ice storm that rolled through our territory today, I would say it certainly further reinforces the need to invest in our grid as we see these climate change patterns start to take shape. We've had three or four major events in our service territory and across the state of Michigan over the last ﬁve years, which points to weather becoming more and more violent in our service territory, and we have to have a grid and investment in the grid that will stand up to all of that.  And secondly, we also are seeing signiﬁcant electriﬁcation. We've got EV attachments increasing rapidly in our state, and we need to have a grid that's prepared for that. So we spent a lot of time, energy creating context not only with our regulator, but also with intervenors and legislators to ensure that there's a deep understanding. And we're going to continue that process all year to ensure that the context for what we are trying to accomplish is well understood and not misunderstood.  And I will say that the capital part of our program has never been a signiﬁcant question by the commission or even the interveners. So that's a positive. And I would say that the administration and legislators are very supportive. But I believe that this work that we would do throughout the year they continue to create context at all levels of government and with our regulator will be very helpful. And we seek to settle, I would say that as well.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Dave, do you want to talk about sales for a minute?     Sure. Yeah, Jerry. Yeah. As Jerry mentioned, our sales are tracking pretty well to our forecast, and I think as end-to-end to what we have in the ﬁling. And I think what will be the beneﬁt going into this ﬁling is we'll have some more stability, because you saw our sales and particularly our residential sales from 2022 versus 2021, they were down about 3% with people returning to work.  As we look to our forecast in our test year, it's down a little under 2% from that level. So far in the early months, we're seeing that we're tracking like right on that level. And so, we think we'll come in at a forecast that will be a lot more agreeable as we go forward. And overall, from pre- pandemic levels to where we are in our test year, it's up about 1.5% to 2%, too. So I think it's all triangulating really well.     And in terms of the gas rate case, Angie, we're looking to ﬁle late this year is the current plan."
"Okay. And then just one follow-up. So one is you mentioned all of this outreach. I mean, what -- again, I want to believe. But what I'm trying to say is that this rate case is next electric rate case happened in such a proximity to the decision in the previous rate case. And I'm just, again, wondering how could you have embedded the lessons learned in such a short period of time. So that's one.  And number two is probably even more importantly. So over the years, you guys have always had this early earnings look, right, guidance and then it would gradually increase through the course of the year. And I'm -- and as we look from afar, we're just wondering if a conservative sales forecast were partly the reason why you were able to historically beat numbers, i.e., should we assume that the current guidance is also conservative, even given the outcome of this electric rate case?","So let me start with the ﬁrst question, how did we start on these lessons learned. We started that really early in the summer. We always get feedback from the staﬀ through their questions and through their commentary. And we started to really sharpen our focus on improving quality of submissions going into this rate case. So we were working on this rate case before -- months and months before or probably six months before we even got the results in November.  So it did start and then I think it intensiﬁed once we got the result. And the outreach certainly intensiﬁed after the result in November because we felt the need -- great context for the fact that, hey, we've stayed out of a rate case for four years and we've invested $8 billion. And the feedback we're getting is there's very strong support for that investment. And unfortunately, we had a mishap with the sales forecast in the last rate case, but I think that will get corrected. And   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   there will be strong support for the investments that we're making and continue to make. So that would sort of summarize the rate case part of it.  In terms of the forecast, I would say, as Dave said, we are tracking right towards the midpoint at this point in time. And that's our goal. And all of the cost initiatives that we have undertaken, Dave and I review them weekly, and the rest of our team is reviewing it out daily. And we're right on top of that plan. So we feel good about where we're at. We're also looking to restore contingency as it gets consumed sometimes by weather. So that's where we're at. So we're conﬁdent in hitting our midpoint at this point in time as we look at our outlook."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you, Angie.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open."
Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.,Good morning.     Hey.
"I was wondering if -- let's see, on the IRM that you are proposing in the electric rate case, how long could that lead you to potentially consider staying out of rate cases to the extent you're successful in getting that applied here?","Well, the positive side of the IRM is that we've been talking to the commission about it for years. And as you saw in the last rate case, they invited us to ﬁle one. So there's strong alignment in order -- in terms of creating the IRM. And we think that, that, as you know, and our gas company has simpliﬁed greatly the regulatory process for capital that's not disputed, if you will, but needs to be invested. And it's going to be primarily directed -- actually not primarily, it will be directed   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   at the grid. That's what the IRM will be used for. And it will build over time. So it's going to take a few years before it starts to have an impact on the timing of rate cases.  But to give you an example, as we built it up in the gas business, it allowed us to stay out for two and three years at a time. And that's certainly the case this time. We've stayed out for at least several years already in the gas company. So we expect that to happen with the electric business. As we build conﬁdence in the IRM, we'll start with modest amounts going into the IRM, as you've seen in our rate case ﬁlings, and that will build over a three year period. And we'll get used to working together on that because it does take some time to build conﬁdence in the execution as well as the management of the IRM.  So we're taking a page out of the gas playbook to build up this IRM and achieve our goals of making the necessary investments, as well as starting to put time between rate cases. So it will take a few years is my answer before we start to see a signiﬁcant impact on timing of rate cases."
"Okay. Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate that context. And then was curious, obviously, the decline in natural gas prices that we've seen is a nice tailwind for customer bills. But when -- just based on kind of storage levels and the seasonal use of that gas, when would customers potentially see the lower prices ﬂow through into rates?","They're seeing it right now. As a matter of fact, I was talking to the President of the gas company the last couple of days, we're going to lower the factor by about $1 here in the next little while. So we're seeing the prices come down quite nicely from their peak."
Got it. And could that lead to a year-over-year decline overall in the fuel portion of gas? Or is that going to take still some time to kind of ﬂow through the higher priced gas that might have been collected late last year?,"I think we've already seen a year-over-year decline, and it will continue to decline. We've made a series of reductions already in the last several months in our gas prices. Our gas recovery, that's a factor. And the most signiﬁcant one is coming here very shortly. It's about $1 decline in price."
Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.,DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Thank you.  Operator   Your next question is from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
"Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Michael."
"Hey, guys. Maybe just wanted to ﬂip over to the IRP. I think we have intervenor testimony coming up in the next couple of weeks here. Just what should we expect from that? And then in terms of settlement timing, what should we think about as coming ﬁrst between the IRP and the electric case?","So I'll start by saying that the expectations that we see is there'll be challenge to the timing of some of our retirements, especially the Monroe Power Plant. So I think you'll see that. We won't be surprised by that. And we will also perhaps see some desire to increase energy eﬃciency. I think many -- some parties will challenge natural gas as a future reliability source. And of course, we've got strong views on that, that the natural gas enables a large build-out of renewables as technology continues to improve around providing baseload generation.  So I think those are -- those will be the issues, if you will. And -- but there's strong support for a large portion, I believe, of our IRP. At least that's our early indication that it's received favorable reviews informally, if you will. So we look forward to the testimony that will be ﬁled.  In terms of timing of settlements, we expect that the IRP will be settled ﬁrst just because it was ﬁled before the rate case. And just the timing of testimony and process puts the rate case a little behind the IRP in terms of the opportunity for settlement discussions. So that's how we expect the process to unfold."
"Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe a question for Dave. Just in terms of the FFO to debt, you target the 15% to 16%. Can you give us an indication of where 2022 ﬁnished up? And then to what extent you're still waiting on deferred power fuel cost recovery into this year?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Yeah. That's a good question. '22 ended up right around 15%. And as you mentioned, the big driver of that being a little lower was the fuel cost recovery. So we had our power supply cost recovery was a use of cash for us in '22, but will be more of a source of cash as we're recovering. The majority of that in 2023. So we'll see our FFO to debt be a little bit higher, a little bit better in 2023."
"Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
"Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Andrew.     Hey, Andrew."
"I appreciate the detailed answers to the previous questions. You covered a lot of what I wanted. Just two follow-ups maybe for me then. First, in terms of the sales forecast, obviously, that was a big diﬀerence of opinion in the last rate case. Does that change have any impact on the IRP and the long-term outlook for capacity resource needs?","We had built that in, Andrew, into IRP forecast. Now, of course, what we do in an IRP is we provide for scenarios for demand increases, both the largest demand increase opportunity is really EV attachments and some of the economic development activity that we expect in the near-term. But we try to build an IRP that not only addresses point estimates, but also a range and scenarios and forecast. And that's something that is required by the IRP ﬁling guidelines. And I think we think it's a very wise thing to do because obviously, over a period of 20 years, there can be a signiﬁcant amount of variability in demand forecast. So we provide low, medium and high type of forecast.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. And you're still in that range, essentially?","Yes, yes."
"Okay. Great. Then lastly, on equity. The sources and uses of cash page -- Slide 17, shows zero or a little dash, I suppose, for new equity. But in one of the earlier slides you talked about up to $100 million per year. How likely is that to remain zero? Is that a function of the timing of CapEx or the $1.3 billion convertible last year? Just trying to understand why that's zero and not something greater than zero.","Yeah. Our goal there will be to keep that as low as possible, obviously, and how we generate cash and how we get cash through our plan will be one of the big drivers of that and how we use it in CapEx. So we see in our plan minimal equity issuances, hopefully, in that -- around zero, but it could be in the zero to 100 range as we go forward."
Okay. So it's zero for the entire three year period is a realistic possibility?,"It's a possibility. I would expect some internal equity issuances that we have through our internal sources, so."
Okay. Great. Thank you and good luck with the restoration eﬀorts this morning.,Thanks.     Thank you.  Operator   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Your next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is open.
"Jerry, good morning. Good morning, Dave.","Hey, Anthony.     Good morning, Anthony."
You guys keeping warm I hope.,"We like the cold, Anthony, you know that. We don't like ice, but we like the cold."
"Well, again, I hope the restoration eﬀorts go quickly. I'm sure it's a grind for all the workers out there. So ﬁngers crossed.","We're really proud of our people out there. They're braving these elements, and we just hope for their safety and good health, and certainly the same for our customers."
"Yeah. I'm sure we all take for granted the service we get provided in our electric system and gas. Just two quick ones. One on the IRM ﬁling or request. And I apologize if I had this wrong. Has DTE requested that for the electric segment before? And just what -- if so, what gives you optimism that this time maybe it gets approved?","You know the last time we did it, Anthony, we requested a really large IRM amount, and this is like over a handful of years ago. And this time and it was -- I felt at that time the feedback we got that, maybe it was too big of the request. And we were trying to make it big enough to stay out of rate cases immediately, so that there would be an immediate beneﬁt to us and many other interested parties not having to have rate cases every year.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Well, this time, we've taken a diﬀerent approach. We've made it smaller in the early years, which may have us -- may create a little more work as you're in for both rate cases and reconciliations in the early years on the IRM. But over time, it will start to put distance between rate cases as we grow it. And I think it will give the party -- all parties involved conﬁdence that we're executing well on the IRM. So that's why we took a little diﬀerent approach this time. And we feel that it will be successful. We socialized it ahead of time before we ﬁled and got very strong positive feedback. So we feel good about it this time."
"Do you guys ever estimate or provide what the cost is to ﬁle a rate case? If I think of all the DTE personnel that have to go around aggregating data, all the test running, you add all that up. Is there a value that you guys have put on that may be an IRM, again, you guys have been very clear that very modest in the beginning. It will take years before you start seeing that with delayed rate ﬁlings. But what's the potential savings that a customer sees if you're able to lay a rate ﬁling?","I would say, there are, of course, the costs of sort of prosecuting a case, if you will for us and for our interveners and for the commission. So we'll reduce that. And I think that will be signiﬁcant. But I think the more signiﬁcant piece, Anthony, will be the fact that once we have certainty of an investment proﬁle from a supply chain perspective, we can start preordering materials and working out supply arrangements that are much more eﬃcient over the long term, over three to ﬁve years, and lining up our contractors where the bulk of the cost is and extracting value from them on behalf of our customers.  So I would say the beauty of the IRM that we saw in the gas business is you can start lining up major supply chain and initiatives and also contractors to extract eﬃciencies. When you can commit to somebody for ﬁve years, there's a huge incentive for them to respond to our eﬃciency initiatives. So that's where I see millions of dollars of potential savings in capital and the ability to accelerate our work."
"Great. And just lastly, DTE Vantage. I love the guidance you've given out, I believe, till 2027. Can I think of the growth from '23 to '27 as linear? Or is it more back-end loaded? Like, just any clarity on the growth in earnings at DTE Vantage?","Typically, we're targeting that $15 million to $18 million, Anthony, of growth at Vantage to support that forecast. So that's what the team is tasked with each and every year. And sometimes they beat it, sometimes it's lower. But overall, it averages out to about $15 million to $18 million a year of income growth. And a lot of it is -- we can look to it coming because we've got these landﬁll projects that are under our current control that we can convert to RNG. And so we've got a nice line of sight at least over the next two or three years into project development.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
