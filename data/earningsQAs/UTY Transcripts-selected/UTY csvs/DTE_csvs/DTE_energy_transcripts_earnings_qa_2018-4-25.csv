Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Morning, Michael."
"Hey, could you discuss the contracting for the remaining one-third of NEXUS, and what – speciﬁcally I understand it's going to be mostly producer push at this point. And I'm wondering what is the demand from producers that you're seeing out there and – for capacity? And also what your expectations are for length of term and that kind of thing?","We're targeting producers. The discussions are underway, negotiations with producers, LDCs and industrial customers, and we are targeting long-term agreements, 15-year agreements."
Are you seeing adequate demand out there to ﬁll the pipe by the completion of construction?,"Yes, we are."
Okay.,We just need to get ink on paper at this point.
"Got you. And how are those negotiations progressing, is there any constraint around them? Yeah.","They're progressing well, of course, lots of negotiations back and forth, as you can imagine. And we are positioned as one of the pipes that does have capacity to bring to the market quickly. So we feel conﬁdent that we'll start closing deals here.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Great. And what kind of a timeline do you see for maybe introducing solar into the mix at the utility?,"So we already have introduced solar. In fact, last year we brought online a 50 megawatt, 250 acre solar project, so that was a relatively big one for us. We did it now to push our self down that path.  But when we do the numbers, it's pretty clear that wind today is a superior resource in terms of pricing. So as I said on the call, we're going to lean on wind as long as that diﬀerence is there.  But we continue like a lot of people to see solar cost trend down. And I do think probably by the mid-2020s or so, it's going to be ready for a larger share of our renewable mix. So as we think about Renewable Energy Plans beyond the one we just ﬁled, we'll probably see some of that mix begin to shift. Does that hit the answer on that one?"
Yeah. I was just wondering about what kind of timing you're seeing on when those prices actually cross the threshold and become competitive with the wind that you already have in there?,Mid-2020s is what it looks like.
Okay.,"So – and by that time, we will have a pretty large installed base of wind in Michigan. So I think some diversiﬁcation will be helpful as well. So that explains our thinking."
And one...,"We want a diverse mix of renewables, but we also want to strike where the price is right, so we're going to wait a bit on large scale investments in solar.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   So we'll continue to add at sites like the one we described earlier, the 15 megawatts, and the 50 megawatt site that we did, but we're investing in wind in the 1,000 megawatt sort of scale. That will come for solar a bit later."
"And just one last question on this. Could you like maybe break out the percentage of how much you expect to add through with the C&I oﬀerings that you're giving, and then how much will be utility scale going forward?",You're talking about the voluntary oﬀering?
Right.,"So, that – we've set aside 300 megawatts for that. I'd say that's hopefully a starting investment because we are seeing some of our large customers come to us and request the ability to increase the renewable mix in their portfolio.  So you've seen customers like GM, for example, say that they want to be 100% renewables by 2050. Well, they're getting started on those sorts of things, as are other large industrial and commercial customers.  So, we're going to set aside 300 megawatts, so that would be 300 megawatts out of a total of 2,000 megawatts by the time we're done with this round. So, you can get a sense for how much that is, but our expectation would be that we'll continue to see demand for that. And as we do we'll push that into our mix."
All right. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)  Hey, good morning.",Hi Julien.     Hi Julien.
"Hey. So, I was wondering can we get a little bit more clarity on the tax reform beneﬁts at the two segments here, just the $35 million and the $5 million at GSP and P&I. I suppose maybe naively, how has tax reform discussion evolved such that you get such material beneﬁt from these two in 2022? And I've got a follow-up.","We disclosed on the year-end call that the existing contracts we will get the beneﬁt, so what you're seeing there, an increase of the existing contracts we have in place today. What we've assumed is that new contracts we will pass that on, but we may potentially share in that and that could potentially help close up that white space gap, but mainly it's the new contracts that you're seeing the increase from."
"Got it. And so, actually that plays right into the follow up here. With respect to NEXUS, not to harp on it too much, but it does – this reﬂect higher kind of structural applications on that project. I presume that's probably the bulk of the new contracts that you're contemplating in GSP.","On NEXUS, the tax reform doesn't have any impact on our ability to capture the value that we forecasted because our recourse rates will be well above our negotiated rates."
"Right. So, that's not impacting those negotiations at all, right. And again, just to say it even more bluntly, the impact from the FERC ruling altogether is very immaterial?","Very modest, because most of our pipes are operating with negotiated rates and we – on our last call, we said that the impact is about $1 million to $2 million from the FERC actions.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Right. Exactly. But if I can go back to this producer push subject because – if you could elaborate a little bit about the incremental investment, maybe on the gathering side and the other midstream investments to bring the product to NEXUS, how do you think about that in the context of the statement about continuing to add investments in Link? Are there other type systems that you're looking at whether organically or inorganically to complement the NEXUS expansion?","Where we're seeing most of our action right now is on Bluestone and Link, the two gathering assets that we own today. And as it relates to NEXUS, there are many, I would say late stage discussions about continuing to expand that system with our producers on that system. So, it's a very attractive system and it's got a very attractive resource. So, more to come there, but we're feeling really conﬁdent right now about meeting and exceeding our pro forma on that asset. And as you know, that asset is pointed right at NEXUS. So, we expect that in the future, those'll help support the ﬁll and expansion of NEXUS.     When you say that asset, he's talking about Link...     Yes.     ...which – the activity about Link, around Link has been really encouraging, and as we bought that I guess, late 2016. So, we're a year and a half in and in a year and a half in, we continue to be very encouraged by the economics therein by our investment opportunities. So, it's been a good asset.     (00:31:20)."
"But, you're still on track with the targets you had laid out for Link at the time of the acquisition now?","Yes, indeed.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)      Yeah."
"Excellent. All right, guys. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Thanks, Julien.  Operator  We'll go next to Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners."
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning.     Morning, Shar."
"Let me just follow up real quick one more time on Michael's question on NEXUS. Thought we would have an update on this call with at least one of the two industrial customers that you were working with. I felt one was nearly ﬁnalized. So, what's the status on those two customers that you've ﬂagged before in the past?  And then, just curious can these two customers provide enough end market demand to ﬁnally ﬁll this pipe with E&P signing on to these supposedly two markets – new markets?","For the one industrial customer, it's essentially done. Second, we're still negotiating with to complete producer agreements. Again, we're continuing to exchange proposals. So, those discussions continue. And we also have several LDC discussions well underway. And – so, that's the current status.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
Curious why you're not disclosing the one industrial customer that's been ﬁnalized?,"I think we've – have the ability at this point to disclose, but...     No, it's under conﬁdentiality agreement."
Okay. That's helpful.,"So, we can't disclose them."
"Okay. That's helpful. And then, just looking at additional Link type investments and sticking with midstream here, the recent sort of what ""the meltdown"" you've seeing with MLPs, I know you guys vetted Links for a long time before purchasing that investment. Have you seen additional Link type opportunities, especially given the recent – I guess for a quarter and what you've seen in the MLP markets? Are you seeing more willing sellers of assets that you would, I guess, want to vet?","I think the short answer is, yes, we are seeing more of those. Like Link, we'll take a long hard look. I think the more we hear, the more we believe that there will – this isn't going to be a short term phenomenon. Some of these companies are going to need to work through this over the foreseeable future. So, we will look at and evaluate opportunities analogous to Link and if we think we ﬁnd one that's a good strategic ﬁt, makes sense economically we'd be open to that."
"Okay, got it. And just, lastly, on distribution. So far, can you maybe just update how the dialog is going? And then, just more importantly with the track or a rider request, how should we sort of think about what the podium would be for that ask?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   I can tell you that the engagement level between our team and the Michigan Public Service Commission team, staﬀ team is very high. We've got multiple discussions that are scheduled and happening between now and the time of our next rate case ﬁling. And the goal is to get alignment on investment and distribution, as well as other items in our capital plan that could result in a capital tracker. So, lots of interest in that from both parties, both from the Commission staﬀ and our team, and we're hopeful that we can get to a strong alignment that we can ﬁle in our next rate case."
Excellent. Thanks so much guys.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Praful Mehta with Citibank.
"Hi, thanks so much. So, the ﬁrst question just on the utility side. It was helpful to get your tax reform impact for the GSP and P&I. But on the utility side, wanted to understand from a tax reform perspective, especially given post the rate case, how do you see the growth rates that those two businesses individually play out through that 2021/2022, and how does that ﬁt with the overall growth rate for the business?","Yeah. This is Peter. The growth rate we will be funding is – at the end of the year, we're going to have a case around the deferred tax. It's approximately $1.7 billion; we're going to be giving that over 25 years, about $70 million a year. So, as we're funding that piece, in particular we're going to be replacing that half of that with equity. So, we are going to be seeing equity levels increase in both utilities and its worth about a 1% over and above rate base. So, we are anticipating earnings growth happening on the utilities from tax reform."
"Got you. So, that should be – just to be clear that should be over and above just the rate base impact because the deferred tax refund eﬀectively ﬂows through as higher equity in your calculation?",That is correct. It's about 1% adder on the rate base growth.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"Got you. Perfect. And then, secondly, just strategically, given most of tax reform impacts are now kind of built-in and you're looking at I guess enough questions on the NEXUS and in the midstream side, but just strategically for your business, is there more discussion ongoing in the industry in general now on M&A, both corporate M&A, both on the buy and sell side? How do you see that playing out and is that dialogue increasing given tax reforms now kind of in the rear view?","Oh, geez, that's – so, we like everybody has – have investment bankers who come through, and I don't know that I've had too many times when I haven't been told that the interest in the industry and M&A was high. But, I do think there are parties out there looking around. We saw one play out just the other day was Spectra.  And I think there is ongoing interest, but I don't understand – I don't sense that tax reform has unleashed a wave that's fundamentally diﬀerent if that's what you're asking. I think we continue to see the sort of ongoing interest that consolidation of this industry has witnessed for a long time now."
"Fair enough. I totally get the investment banker point, but just to clarify it's not like credit weakness for some companies would be an opportunity for others in terms of M&A as you see it?","Well, I – actually one of the folks I talked to recently, I think stated it well as an investor not a banker, and he said, look, strengthen your balance sheet is really option value, it gives you the opportunity when good opportunities arise to strike, and when you spend that balance sheet ﬂexibility, you've lost your option value. I think there were companies who spent their option value on what we view as some – not so accretive transactions. And – so, I think there are companies who didn't do that, who probably have greater ﬂexibility if they see something come along that they really like.  And so, we continue to look to the earlier question at potential GSP sorts of acquisitions. But, if – we've always said, if the right corporate transaction came along that we really thought added value, we'd be open to it. But, we aren't going to be involved in a high premium sort of transaction, we just don't see the value in super high premium deals that don't make sense to us. So open, but we'd do them at the right price with the right counterparty."
"Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thanks.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Just one on wind projects. Could you give us a ﬂavor of the nature of the projects you have in the plan or the sites that you've been developing yourselves. Are they coming early or late stage from developers, are you going to do BOT or can build them yourselves, just a little more sense of kind of how that plays out.","They're mix of both, Julien (sic) [Jonathan] (00:39:50). So, in some cases people had lined up lease rights and we have entered the build out and transfer. In other cases we did that ourselves, and will simply sign a construction agreement and then do the build out by DTE."
So would you say it's sort of an even split or...,"I probably ought to go back and get the numbers before I answer, Jonathan, to give you a split. Maybe Barb could do that with you after this.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Yeah. Okay. That's ﬁne. And then looking further out in the utility, you're obviously close to the decision on the gas plant. How far out would you see your next gas plant being, given some of the comments around renewables and gas in the longer term future?","So we don't see a need for another gas plant till the end of the 2020s. We'd have our next major coal retirement in the late 2020s. That's when we'd evaluate the need for the next gas plant.  I think one of the things we'll watch over the next decade is how the overall system around us evolves, as we add more and more renewables and our neighboring companies do the same, we have to watch how the MISO grid evolves. And we may ﬁnd we need the new gas plant out in the 2030 timeframe. We may ﬁnd that investments in renewables will cover us and provide the reliability.  So I think the answer is we will see. But in the meantime, we're – between now and the late 2020s, the real focus will be on renewable additions."
"Great. Thank you, Gerry. And could I just on your comments about the rate case order and skewing you towards the lower end, is that a – do you see that as a 2018 guidance factor? And you'd hope to sort of get back on trajectory, given it's your largest segment beyond or...","I think the easy way to say it is that we're not modifying our 5% to 7% growth target for the company. So I think in that sense that, yes, we expect our plan to be on track."
"And is – okay. I think I have said enough, Gerry. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  And we'll go next to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Thank you. Gerry, could you just – I think there might be some confusion based on some things I've seen. You did not lower consolidated guidance to the lower end of the range, just the Electric segment. And then...","Yeah, yeah, yeah."
...what was your commentary on the other segment?,"Oh, yeah, exactly. The Electric segment, we biased towards the low end of the guidance range. The gas utility is doing ﬁne I think in a lot of places. The weather started a little mixed but has actually ﬁnished strong here in April. So the gas utility from a weather perspective is in good shape.  And as I said, the two large non-utility segments are running hot to their plan. So the year looks in really good shape."
Thanks for that clariﬁcation.,"So unless we get surprised by something we don't see, should be a good year. I think we're in good shape."
"Thanks, again.",Yeah.  Operator  We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Yeah. Hi, good morning. So just on the rate order, as you mentioned you'll be back on track after this year maybe. But just what are the types of costs being disallowed? And just is this   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   something that we need to worry about in future cases?","Yeah, Steve, this is Peter. One of the costs that was disallowed was a part of our incentive plans with some ﬁnancial measures. We've had this in the past. So that wasn't completely unanticipated.  The other was inﬂation. We had some inﬂation in the plan, and then they modiﬁed the level of inﬂation that we had in the plan."
"Okay. And so is that, but – okay. So basically the reason you might be at the lower end is just that inﬂation may end up being higher than what they allowed, so to speak?",Yeah. We had a little bit more of that – we had the 10.1% and more inﬂation.
And then a little on the ROE. Okay.,"The ROE and that were built into our numbers for the year, so it backed us up a bit. But as we said the overall plan looks ﬁne."
"Okay. And then the renewables program that you announced more speciﬁcs, is that – how much of that is additive to your capital plan if at all? Or is it all already in there?","So the 300 megawatts that I mentioned pulling, that was the pull forward and that's a nice investment. But I guess I'd say that we aren't modifying our 2022 guidance due to that pull ahead. So it's additional investment, but when you look at it in the total scheme of the company I think the guidance we put out there for 2022, we will just stand with."
"Okay. And then just on the mid-stream side, more high level, again, the – someone asked before about just the unrest in the sector and maybe created more opportunities. Could you talk a little bit about how size-wise you're willing to kind of make this business as a mix of the   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   whole company? And we assume if you do acquisitions, they'd be more kind of asset-by-asset as opposed to larger kind of company-sized acquisitions?","Yeah, I think that's a fair characterization, Steve, that they'd be asset-by-asset. We often ﬁnd that we're able to get a better strategic ﬁt, and therefore, create economics we like when we do it that way.  But I'd also say that we stay in very active discussions with our investors on mix and the mix that they like. And I think the feel we have from our investors is that this GSP segment provides the company nice earnings growth proﬁle. But we also know that it could become too large if we pursued investments too fast .So, we're trying to walk the mix line in a way that really works well for investors and for rating agencies by the way. We're well within the boundaries for them too. But I think if you did a large corporate acquisition, it could shift that equation for our investors and potentially for the agencies. So, does that get added, Steve, or give you sense of things?"
"No, that's very helpful. One last very quick clariﬁcation, the 2022 guidance updates for the GSP and REF, is that just for the tax changes no other changes in the outlook out there?","Yeah, that's what that was for. Yeah."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you. Appreciate it, Steve.  Operator  We'll go next to Charles Fishman with Morningstar Securities."
"Just one question I had. On the doubling of the renewable and speciﬁcally the wind, I would assume there may be some transmission involved in that. I realize you sold your transmission, gosh, a long time ago. Are you depending on – is there a signiﬁcant amount of transmission involved or are you depending on somebody else to build that? Is there any risk to that 2022 target date or non-issue?","DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   No, we had a signiﬁcant transmission build out in what they call the thumb part of Michigan, where most of our early wind investments came. But in Central Michigan where we are moving now with many of these investments, there doesn't appear to need to be material transmission build out, so we don't see that as a factor in timing."
"Okay. That's all I had, Gerry. Thank you.",All right. Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.
"Hi, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Andy.     Good morning, Andy."
"Just a couple of quick questions. Just on the Electric side. Was there a refund in the ﬁrst quarter, the true up for the rate case because you were collecting I guess since November 1?",Yeah. There was not a refund. How we're going to get this back to customers will come in three parts. The current rates will be adjusted most likely for both utilities by early fall.     He's talking about the rate case refund...
"Yeah, the rate case. Yes.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)","Oh, the rate case – the rate case refund.     Yeah. Yeah.     So, the rate case refund, there will be self-implementation proceeding, which is normal course. So, we'll be probably having that over the next probably few months."
Was that in the ﬁrst quarter? Did you adjust the ﬁrst quarter for the refund?,"Yes, we did."
Or no? Okay. How much was that?,"We adjusted for the level of the rate case, the rate order."
Is that what like $0.11 a share or something like that or?,"We did have a certain amount of the self-implementation, plus a little bit of a reserve on top of that. So, it wasn't that material."
Can you tell us what that number was?,The total impact or the reserve?   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)
"No, just the total impact of – so the ﬁrst – in the ﬁrst quarter, the total impact of the rate refund. So, it's kind of like a one-time item, right?","Yeah. So, we were...     I'm getting..."
"And it's part of your operating earnings, I understand that, but I'm just also suggesting that's maybe part of the reason why you're at the (00:49:48)...","The full ﬁrst quarter was trued up. So, it really wasn't a refund in the ﬁrst quarter, the full – it was trued up to the levels of the rate case, we did have some self-implementation early – late last year that was trued up as well in the ﬁrst quarter, which is very immaterial."
Okay.,Just to put...
I understand.,"Just to put a number on it, net of reserve was $10 million after tax is a rate case impact.     Yeah. Positive."
"DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)   Okay, okay. And then I guess, maybe $0.11 is versus the $1.25 if you had it, okay. And then, is that part of the reason why you're at the low end because of the refund or is it just the lower revenue amount from the rate case in general?","Look, it's all taken together. All impacts, so we have the earnings range for Electric that we had communicated and not unexpectedly if our ROE gets pushed down a tenth and the couple of the other things that were pushed back in the range a little bit."
Okay.,So...
"And then, sorry, go ahead.","No, as I say, I don't want to overblow it. We had rate cases play out over time through the years, and we've got lot of other things in the mix, but that is as described, and that said, we're going to play out in the earnings range that we laid out there. And for the company I think, it's going to be a very positive year."
"As it is always for you guys. And then, just on NEXUS. Can you give us on an annual basis, once it's in service, any type of guidance or high-level of thinking on what come in the ﬁrst year out, what the annual earnings may be from NEXUS? And then, also whether you project ﬁnanced it at all?","No. We haven't project ﬁnanced it. That's always an option down the road if we wanted to do that and our partners wanted to. And I think you know we've generally concluded it's not in our interest to break out earnings kind of line-by-line project-by-project just because we have lots of counterparties to each project and lots of interest in when a deal is signed, what did that do to your proﬁtability on this project.  And so, we're trying to balance our need to interact with counterparties with. I need to give you good information, but that's led us to give you guidance at the segment level, but not do it in detail pipe-by-pipe.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)"
"Okay. I mean, that's – $1.3 billion is the investment. And I guess, maybe at the very least we can assume kind of a utility return and then kind of go from there once it's full?","I think our history with these sorts of pipes is at minimum we want to get in at our cost of capital, right. And then we push from there and our history has been that the pipes end up with returns well above utility returns as you expand them and add compression, and so on and so forth, which is why we like these investments, they've proven to be really good value creators."
Okay. And I assume NEXUS will be similar?,"I think NEXUS; NEXUS has that same feel. So, let me – I'll just go to Link, Link is a little further along because it was constructed when we bought it, but it was still a young pipe. But we went through it fundamentally, because the geology that it accessed was superb, that's playing out.  We've had a couple of the producers and to be honest, it's always hard when you're dealing with really good geography to ﬁgure out who it is, that's going to be pushing it hard, but we've got a couple of producers there that are just going after it, and it is accruing to our beneﬁt. So, somebody asked earlier, how you're feeling about Link, we're feeling really good there.  And we're at and beyond pro forma and they've got that ﬁrming up now years out ahead of us. So, that's been a real positive. NEXUS is earlier, but it also accesses superb geology, and I think we're going to see driller's go after that hard.  In a gas environment that's long generally in the country meaning, we aren't going to be short gas, as far as anybody can tell. Drillers double down on their best geology and that's what we're seeing at Link, that's what we're seeing at Bluestone, and I think it's what we're going to see around NEXUS. They're going to concentrate their drilling in those really good geologies. And so, that's happening around NEXUS, but obviously it's earlier, but we are hearing chatter now that you get out a few years and in the drillers they're worried about pipe takeaway in the region that NEXUS access being constrained because their own drill plans there, and what they perceive other people's drill plans to be.  So, it feels like the dynamics are set up in a similar way, we're just earlier with NEXUS than we are with certainly with Bluestone and also with Link."
"Okay. And no MLP, right Gerry.   DTE Energy Co (DTE US Equity)",Not at this time.
Okay.,I think we'll hold on that one.
"Yes. That was a good decision years ago. So, anyway thank you very much. Have a great rest of your day.","Thank you, I appreciate it."
Yeah.  Operator  And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the conference back to Gerry Anderson for any additional or closing remarks.,"No, I'll just wrap up by thanking you all for being on the call. I do feel that as I said at the outset, we're oﬀ one quarter into a really good start in the year. And we look forward to being able to update you again down the road here. So, appreciate it. We'll talk soon.  Operator  This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
