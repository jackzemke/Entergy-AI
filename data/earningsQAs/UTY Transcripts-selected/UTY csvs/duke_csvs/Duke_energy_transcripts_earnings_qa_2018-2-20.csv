Question,Answer
Good morning guys.,"Good morning, Shar Pourreza."
"Just a quick modeling question. Just, can you elaborate a little bit on the drivers of growth from '18 to '19, Steve, I mean, to get you back within that previous 4% to 6% range by '19, you sort of would need a lot of growth year-over-year almost 8% just using the midpoint of the 2018 guide. I know it's not linear, but are we thinking about this step up in earnings correctly? Should we think more bottom end in '19, just remind us how you're closing that gap?","Well, let me discuss some of the drivers here for 2019, and they're really pretty similar to the drivers that we have in our businesses each year. We've got rate riders and rate cases that kick into play. We've got our normal volumes growth which has been pretty strong as well, and then there's AFUDC on various investments. When you look at 2019, you'll have the full year impact of the Carolinas rate cases, and then in 2019 we expect to see accelerated spending in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, those will be a couple of big drivers towards the earnings that you might see in that particular year, Shar."
"Okay, that's helpful. And then just real quick on ACP, it's good that it's moving sort of ahead here, but at what point sort of in the construction cycle should we think about incremental growth opportunities? Is it sort of post the state approvals or with the latter part of the construction phase, like, how are you thinking about the next leg of growth with ACP 2 and ACP 3?","Sure. Thanks for that question. We're proud of the progress that we've made over the last several months with state and federal permits, and our focus is ramping up, construction to hit a late 2019 in-service date. I think about additional investment opportunities in two ways, there is expansion of ACP which would occur in the form of compression, a very cost eﬀective way to   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   add capacity, and then extension would be another opportunity. I think at this point our focus is on building the initial project as it's established, we will then turn our attention to expansion, compression expansion really driven by needs of our customers and then following that we'll look at opportunities to extend."
"Got it, that's helpful. And then just, Lynn, one strategic question. Duke falls in and out of M&A chatter, especially recently with some of the jurisdictions that you've been active in, which is Indiana and the Carolinas. Can you just sort of refresh our thoughts on how you're thinking about additional growth through inorganic opportunities in light of kind of what you're seeing as far as tax reform and sort of maybe even the stress on sort of the balance sheet?","Our focus, Shar, is on organic growth at this point. We feel like we've got a very robust set of investments within our jurisdictions and very attractive jurisdictions that give us an opportunity to deliver beneﬁts to customers and investors, with the steps we've taken around the balance sheet, with the equity issuance that also positions us to support that organic growth, and so M&A is not a part of our strategic plan to achieve what we've laid out before you. We look at that as opportunistic, but are really comfortable with the organic plan we have set forth."
Excellent. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Steve.     Good morning."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Just wanted to touch on what you have mentioned in terms of further growth in renewables and the commercial segment. Just at a high level, I'm curious your thoughts on the competitive environments for renewables, the degree of growth potential there, what are you seeing out there on the competitive playing ﬁeld for that business?","Stephen, I think the business is a competitive business. I think there's some adjusting as the result of the tariﬀs that have recently been imposed. We'll have to see how that landscape plays out. We also are pacing the lower tax rate. We'll have to determine how tax equity markets perform, although we still expect them to be there. So we believe we have a very solid business, a business at scale. We believe we're capable of competing. But we have also been appropriately conservative with our assumptions around returns and are not going to chase it unless it's delivering a return above our cost of capital. And that will be our approach as we go forward. I would point to regulated renewables as well, so we've got 700 megawatts from building within Florida. HB 589 in North Carolina represents an opportunity for either our commercial or regulated business, so we'll be looking closely at those opportunities as well."
"That's helpful and thank you. And then just, thinking high level around Amazon and the potential for them to put HQ number 2 in your service territory. Without getting too speciﬁc, I'm just curious, your thinking at a high level as to what will be required to accommodate that? What kind of incremental capital or operational changes you need to make to accommodate that?","So Stephen, I think we're capable of serving Amazon today with a really robust system in the Carolinas. We have the pleasure to serve an expanding facility in Northern Kentucky that we're working closely with them on. The triangle area around Raleigh has been an important growth area for the company for some time, so we'll be anxious to put infrastructure in place if additional infrastructure is needed. And I think about our approach to economic development in general. We've been very aggressive in our service territories, making investments to attract businesses. And that will be our approach here as well if we have that opportunity for the Carolinas."
"Thank you so much. If I could just maybe one more on changes to the grid. You've been spending a lot of time and eﬀort thinking about grid modernization in a number of ways. I'm just curious, as you see it now, do you see incremental investment opportunities in grid modernization over and above what you've already laid out? Or is that likely to be a relatively long evolution in terms of changes you've been making there?","I believe we have a robust plan, Stephen, where we have been disciplined in establishing business cases for each of these investments to deliver beneﬁts to customers, whether it's   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   greater customer experience, whether it's reliability metrics. We do have the ability to change the timing, accelerate, slow down, depending upon the needs of customers in each of the jurisdictions. And I would expect, as the system continues to grow, which we would see it doing over the next 10 years, with Southeast just attracting an incredible number of new citizens, people migrating to this area, that we'll ﬁnd continued opportunities to expand our system. So we have a team of people focusing on modernization as a full-time assignment to ensure that we're building the infrastructure that our states count on. Same for Indiana, same for Florida, same for Ohio."
Okay. Thank you very much.,Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi, good morning everyone.",Hi.     Good morning.
"Hey, to what extent do you see the increase in earnings growth or -- earnings growth into 2019- 2020 period as driven by the rate base increases coming from deferred tax amortization. In terms of -- does that give you increased conﬁdence in that ability to get back up to the mid to high range, because this portion of the rate base growth is -- no, it's not -- it's a certainty, right?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yes. And Michael, I think the -- you can see the front-end impact of the loss of interest shield and the dilution. But as you ﬂip back into our slide deck, looking at rate base growth, you can see $2.5 billion growing to $3.5 billion of rate base over that period, and that's without spending $1 of capital. So it's that rate base growth in the fundamental business that we operate low risk, high quality jurisdictions that give us conﬁdence that we can maintain the 4% to 6% growth rate really after we've adapted to tax reform in '18, get back within the range in '19, mid- to high in '20 and beyond. So the point that you're making around the strength of the rate base growth is exactly right."
Okay. Great. And also maybe you can just comment a little bit about the tax equity market around renewables after the BEAT provisions in the tax reform package?,"So we believe we'll be successful in that market with our size of our company, scale and credit proﬁle. I think all of this is something that we'll continue to monitor. We are actually in the tax equity market right now with a project and are seeing success in putting that together, so we are optimistic."
Are you seeing any additional opportunities that may be coming your way as a result of smaller players maybe having a harder time gaining access to that market now?,"Michael, there's a lot of opportunity ﬂow that comes through and compliments to the team to approaching -- as they approach it in a disciplined fashion to identify projects that makes sense for us, but we do see good opportunity ﬂow."
Okay. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Good morning, guys.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Hi, Jonathan.     Hi."
"Hi. Steve, this -- when you talked about what you've assumed for the cash treatment of tax reform with regard to customer rates, it sounded like you were saying you've assumed you'll ﬂow it back reasonably quickly, but then you talked about several things you're doing which would do the opposite. So is there any way you can give us a sort of a high level what the -- what's assumed in this FFO target versus the range of potential outcomes?","Yes, Jonathan. We've looked at a number of outcomes, and they may vary per jurisdiction. Certainly got a constructive outcome in Florida. In general, what we're thinking about here is that the impact of the rate decrease from the 35% to 21%, we'll work that back through prospective rates and give that aspect to customers. We're looking at the excess deferred tax piece. The protected piece will go back slowly, and we're looking at utilizing the other excess deferred taxes to be used as a mitt [ph] against the rate base increases that are coming as well to help reduce the volatility. But that's a general way to think about the way we've incorporated this into our plans."
"Okay. So the -- so for example where you have rate cases pending at that point the 35 to 21 would be part of that case and in other jurisdictions it would be later, is that right?","Jonathan, I think -- I'll talk about the Carolinas and Steve will chime in here, too. We are not expecting the tax reform will be a part of the DEP case that we are expecting an order on any time. There's a separate docket that the commission has established. A testimony will be presented in the DEC case around tax reform, and I think it's really an open question on whether or not it's dealt with in this case or in a separate docket. But I think in all events, there's an opportunity here to use tax reform to lessen the impact of rising prices or investments in the state. The other states, some of them will go automatically into place where there are riders. So in Indiana and Ohio, where there's a rider tracking mechanism, those tax reform impacts will go in immediately. Piedmont would be another example of that. And then we'll tailor other jurisdictions based on general rate case timing or separate dockets are established. And as Steve said, it will be really customized jurisdiction by jurisdiction."
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And can you just touch on ACP in that context?,"The ACP project is beneﬁted by tax reform. Again we've got several breaks with our customers on ACP and it's not a formula type rate there. And so that will be one of the things that beneﬁts us more with the application to ACP.     And you may remember, just one point on that. ACP was a competitive process early on with negotiated rates that came out of the competitive bidding process. And ACP was selected as the most cost eﬀective solution and continues to be the most cost eﬀective solution for customers."
So you don't anticipate an adjustment there?,That's correct.
"Okay. Great. Thank you. And then could I just on -- just when I look at the FFO to that slide, you show '18, then you show the '19 -- the '20 to '22, does that -- should we assume like '19 is sort of - - part of a bridge to that new number, or does it go down a little then improve what's the -- what's the sort of '19 proﬁle as you ﬁll in that gap?","We'll be improving on our metrics throughout the plan, Jonathan. I don't want to give year-by- year guidance, but we do see improvement throughout the plan.     It trends up from 2018, Jonathan."
And have you had the opportunity to sort of download with the agencies on how the plan looks now you've framed out some of your equity piece.,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We have. Yes, we visited with all 3 of the agencies, Jonathan, in advance, sharing with them our prospectives, the actions we've taken, not only the equity, but the reduction in capital, our focus on cost management, the demonstrated track record in pursuing regulatory recoveries. So we've had a very comprehensive discussion. We believe we've put forward a credible plan to the agencies to support our rating. Of course, they will deliberate and look at that over the coming months. But we feel like we've had a very good discussion of a very credible plan like that."
"Great. Thank you. And if I might, just the '18, you have 15% to 16% targeted eﬀective tax rate. Is that the right ballpark going beyond '18? Or is it still low -- is that lower than you think it'll be?","I think that's certainly what we see for '18. We typically don't project beyond that, I don't know that it's going to vary a lot from that as we go forward though."
"Great. Thank you, Steve. Thank you Lynn.","Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.     Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, I just wanted to follow-up and clean up a few items from past questions here. First, on the growth in the '19 and then '20 and beyond. Just to make sure I heard you right, mid- to high end in '20 and beyond, is the right way to think about this that basically you're targeting a 7% rate base growth oﬀ of 2018 such that, that gets you to close-ish to 2019, the midpoint of that -- the range, as I think Shar initially asked? And then, again, as you roll forward, take 7% net out a small amount of equity dilution, and then, again, that's how you outperform the 4% to 6% from '19 into '20? Just want to make sure we're hearing the puts and takes appropriately here.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So Julien, I would think about 2019 as being within the range -- within the guidance range. I think the lower end of the guidance range would be the way to think about '19 as we're still getting in to get that recovery of the increased rate base investment, because if you think about '19 earnings, it's going to have to be -- rate case is prosecuted in '18 for certain of those jurisdictions. We will see the rider impact and other things. But within guidance, that's the way I think about my team. And then by '20, mid to high, because we have an opportunity for another year of securing that revenue stream, building on that rate base growth. And so $3.5 billion of additional rate base growth without spending an additional dollar of capital in these jurisdictions we believe underpins our ability to get in that range by 2020, mid to high."
"Great. Excellent. And then coming back to a prior question on the commercial side of the business, speciﬁcally renewables. Can you elaborate a little bit on what's driving your thinking? I think, in the commentary, you suggested that you would actually be increasing the size investment. But then, perhaps in some of the Q&A, if I hear you right, you're a little bit more cautionary on tariﬀs, et cetera. Are you looking to expand this? Or is this really a statement around HB 589 and the opportunities there? Is there something beyond the Carolinas here that you guys are really seeing out there?","Julien, there's about $1 billion of investment in Commercial Renewables last year. It is modestly higher than that this year. We have introduced tax equity for the ﬁrst time. You may recall, before tax reform, we thought we would be a taxpayer and someone who could use credit sooner than what's going to happen. And so we have looked at that business in the -- through the lens of tax equity. We do see opportunities from HB 589. And as we just planned the implications of HB 589, we've put that capital in the commercial business for planning assumption. So I think our message here has been consistent. We like the business. We have scale in the business. We believe we can invest in a manner that's proﬁtable for our investors, and the modest increase in capital is HB 589 and other market opportunities."
"Got it. Excellent. And just last, nitpicking on the FFO to debt question real quickly. The 2018 number you show, is that inclusive of the equity? Or should we be thinking about the jump -- the ratable improvement from 14% up to the 15% to 16% range, the equity being a big chunk of that improvement? Just want to make sure we're level setting here.","The equity is in the upper side [ph].     Yes, the equity --"
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   It is reﬂected in that 14 already?,"Yeah.     Yes, that's correct.     Julien, I think, as you know, an equity issuance impacts the denominator, right? So it's going to have an impact on FFO to debt, but it has a more dramatic impact on our holding company debt, which, of course, will be declining over the 5-year period to roughly 31%. So more aggressively than what we shared with you last year. The engine for production of FFO is our regulated businesses, and that has not changed from tax reform. So we will go after investment and delivering returns in the way that we historically have by delivering returns to the regulated process, and that's the engine that drives the FFO growth over the period.     That's right. And our ability to execute in our cost management has helped us exceed the original estimates we had for 2017 in our credit metrics."
Right. Excellent. Thank you.,"Right. Thanks, Julien.  Operator  We'll take our next question from David Paz with Wolfe Research.     Hi, David."
"Hi, good morning. Just going back to the growth question. So looking on slide 12, when you say mid to high end of growth -- of the growth target in 2020, is that the growth over 2019 earnings, or is that a compounded average annual rate oﬀ the midpoint of your 2017 guidance?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","2017, David."
"Okay, great. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hi, guys. More of a longer-term question.","Hi, Mike."
"Hi, good morning. More of a longer-term question. How are you thinking about the jurisdictions where you have the most lag? What you can do to structurally change that to reduce that lag outside of just kind of continuing to ﬁle cases on a pretty frequent basis?","Michael, I appreciate that question because we have drawn our attention to what we're calling regulatory modernization, which is trying to look at the regulatory mechanisms and match those mechanisms to the way investment occurs. And so Indiana, Ohio, multi-year rate plans in Florida, all of those are very well seasoned to work with the type of investments that we're making in the grid, in renewables, clean energy, et cetera. The Carolinas is where we have a little bit of work to do. We're pleased with the result of HB 589, which puts trackers in place for renewable and for a PURPA contract, both of which were important. And we, as you may recall, have also ﬁled for a tracker around grid investments. In our DEC case, our intent is to follow on the dual path as we did with HB 589, ask the commission how far they believe they can go and then pursue legislation if need be to ﬁnalize that work. I believe it's a win-win. The types of investments that we're making will deliver immediate customer beneﬁts. It minimizes the impact on price to customers. And I believe with tax reform as another tool, we should be able to ﬁnd our way to something that works for customers and for the investments we're trying to put into play. So the focus of modernization is throughout all the jurisdictions, but we have some speciﬁc objectives we're trying to achieve in the Carolinas.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Got it. And when you're looking at the Carolinas, how -- what's been the feedback in the rate cases regarding the grid modernization tracker?","So Public Staﬀ produced some testimony. They have some questions about what is modernization, really questioning the types of investments. They like some of them better than others. We believe that there's a strong case throughout the program around modernization, but they also introduce the notion of a cap if the commission were to approve the tracker. So I believe there was a good start to a conversation that will continue as part of this case."
Got it. Thank you and much appreciated.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Praful Mehta with Citi.     Good morning.
"Hi, thanks guys. Hi. So, I guess just bringing together both the growth trajectory that you've talked about here and the credit that you've laid out. I wanted to understand how tax reform in this discussion with the regulators ﬁts in, because you've kind of highlighted discussion around regulatory asset recovery, accelerated depreciation. So, if any of those variables change and the discussion with regulators are -- I guess better than expected or worse than expected, which variable should we look at that can impact either your earnings trajectory, or your credit or putting more pressure on the balance sheet, how should we track that?","Yeah, Praful, I'll get it started and turn it over to Steve. He and his team have worked extensively on the implications of tax reform really dating back into 2017. But you can appreciate any time you put a 5-year plan together and you're putting it together with a range of assumptions. And that's the case here as well. We won't have complete certainty on the way the commissions are going to address tax reform until later into 2018. But as Steve indicated, we're assuming pretty current return or reduction in rates around the tax rate of 35% to 21%. And so I think that's a   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   reasonable assumption that should play out in '18 and beyond in each jurisdiction. And then on the accumulated deferred taxes, the protected ones go back over light, consistent with normalization rule. And we are proposing that the unprotected deferreds go back over a reasonable period of time. In some of our jurisdictions, the deferred tax direction is related to property. So a longer period of time makes sense to us. That, of course, will be subject to negotiation. And we will check and adjust, and we always do depending on how that plays out. But I believe we have reasonable planning assumptions. Steve?     Right. I think Lynn covered it very clearly there that's kind of how we look at it, I think that makes sense. This is an opportunity to reduce customer rates pretty quickly. But we also have an opportunity here to utilize some of this to oﬀset some of the rate base increases that are coming. And we'll be looking at the excess deferred as a tool for that, and that was what was done in Florida. I think a very constructive settlement there. And so we'll see how it plays out in the other jurisdictions."
I got you. So how big is the unprotected fees that needs to be refunded and what assumption is being made on the timing of that refund?,"Unprotected deferred taxes are about -- for the total corporation about 1.8 billion, protected are about 4.5 billion."
"I got you. And the assumption on the return of the unprotected, I'm assuming is quicker obviously because it's the -- not the average life of asset. You have some unprotected apparently that are connected to PP&E. But for the rest, is there a -- is it like a 5-year period? Just to get a sense for what kind of time frame should that refund have to take place in.","Praful, I would just say a reasonable time frame at this point. We're early in the process of this discussion with our jurisdictions, and it's going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction. As I said a moment ago, some of the riders mechanisms will be treated diﬀerently than the general base rate case. So as we learn more in these dockets that are open in front of the jurisdictions, we'll be prepared to share more speciﬁcs on that, but believe that we've put together a plan here with a reasonable set of outcomes."
"Understood. Fair enough. And just quickly just last point on the holding company debt, the -- it's going from -- to 31% to 32% I guess in the 2020-2022 time frame, that percentage, is that being achieved because the underlying denominator that is the total debt of the company is   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   growing, or is that being achieved because the holding company debt is being paid down during that time frame?","It's really reﬂecting the beneﬁt of the equity issuance, Praful. So we are delevering the holding company with the equity issuance."
I got you. So apart from the initial paydown there isn't anything incremental happening post the '18 time frame in terms of delevering at the HoldCo?,"So there is a modest trending up ACP and other things, and then down again so that's the starting point in '18, and the ending point are ﬂat."
"I got you. So I'm just trying to conﬁrm that post '19, is there any assumption of debt paydown at the HoldCo or no?","Relatively ﬂat end-to-end. We can probably take you through our ﬁnancing schedules after the call, Praful, if there is more detail that we can help you with."
Understood. That's super helpful. Thank you so much.,"All right. Thank you.  Operator  At this time I'd like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Great, thank you, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll be available by phone and have an opportunity to meet with many of you over the next couple of weeks. I want to extend my thanks to the team who has put all of this together with tax reform coming late in the year.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   It's been an all-out eﬀort and we're really delighted to put it forward today. Thank you for your investment in Duke Energy.
