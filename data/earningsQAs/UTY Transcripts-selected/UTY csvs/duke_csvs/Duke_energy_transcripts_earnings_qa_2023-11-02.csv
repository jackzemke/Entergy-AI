Question,Answer
"Thank you. Good morning, guys.",Hi Shar.     Morning Shar.
"Good Morning, morning. Well, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'll be obviously updating the capital plan in February as you always do, and directionally, you're talking about some upside buyers with CapEx, but maybe you can help at least frame the potential magnitude. So is it kind of supportive of the ﬁve to seven or more potentially better   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   and where you see the increase is coming from, so sort of the various buckets in which states as we think about CapEx upside? Thanks.","Sure, you know, Shar, the capital is really underpinned by the integrated resource plans that we have ﬁled and so if you look at the Carolinas alone, the ﬁling that we made in August compared to where we were in 2022, we see load growth. And we also see the need to raise the reserve margin is a result of all the growth going on in this region and the winter-peaking nature and so if you look across all of the types of MW from solar to battery, natural gas, et cetera, you see an increase there and that will become reﬂected more fully in our capital plan of course, working through that process with the Commission in '24. But we see a need for additional MW in the Carolinas, really driven in large measure by population growth, economic development, and reserve margins.  We're also moving deeper into generation transition in Indiana so as we have ﬁled Integrated resource plans and we've accelerated our thinking around the timing of coal retirements, we see natural gas coming into the picture in Indiana, as well as renewables and so CPCNs will be ﬁled in the next several months, really setting the cadence for Indiana. And then, I think you know on our regular schedule in Florida, we will be updating the multi-year rate plan eﬀective 01-01-25 and so expectations for capital spending there will be updated.  And then the gas business continues to see not only extraordinary growth for a number of customers but integrity management continues as capital. So we are in an extraordinary period of growth in all of our jurisdictions. It's transparent, it's ﬁled with our commissions in the form of integrated resource plans on the electric side and clear on the--on the gas side as well. So we're anxious to provide that update to you in February, and have a chance to talk further about them at that point."
"Got it, Lynn obviously, you highlighted that the current base plan assumes no equity through '27, which is consistent but you're obviously leaving it open for potential equity to fund spending above the current base plan. As we think about sort of your balance sheet capacity, should we be assuming that every dollar of incremental CapEx is funded with a balanced cap structure of 50-50 debt-equity or is that too simplistic and we should be also factoring in other sources of equity funding above straight equity. So just I guess help us bridge quote-unquote balanced approach with quote-unquote, balance sheet strength? Thanks.","Sure. I would think about balanced approach, kind of in the 30% to 50% range and when I think about equity we've talked about shareholder-friendly equity. You have seen us accomplish that with our transaction in Indiana. I don't know how much potential exists for that given present cost of capital, but we would of course explore that and then evaluate the role of dividend reinvestment and aftermarket programs as well. I would also say that the other couple of things that we're watching we have yet to ﬁnalize the DEC case. So we'll have more visibility on that in December and then waiting for treasury guidance on these Nuclear PTCs and the transferability market, those are also very consequential cashless standpoints. So I feel like we have just a   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   number of levers available to us and we will exercise them in a way that maintains our growth rate. But also underpins the strength of the balance sheet."
"Got it. Perfect, thank you guys. We'll see you in about a week. Appreciate it.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you,, for your question. Next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much. Really appreciate. Hey, Lynn. Pleasure. Just coming back. At the same direction as Shar here. Just in terms of the balance sheet, obviously it's been a source of continued conversation is illustrated by the ﬁrst couple of questions here. How do you think about maybe shoring up the balance sheet incrementally? In addition to funding these incremental upside here. I just want to make sure that we're clear about how you think about that piece of it, right, obviously coming into a position of strength here with the rate case resolution that you already resolutions that you alluded to by 4Q here, but how do you think about kind of getting to that next step, where perhaps conversations on less focused area, but...Thank you.","Yes, Julien, thanks for that. And I-- you know as we lay out what we laid out today. I think you're watching us strengthen the balance sheet of one billion seven of deferred fuel to be collected in '23, another one billion dollars, seven of deferred fuel to be collected in '24 and the multi- year rate plans, which have not only given us an opportunity to reset rate base from historic spending, but also prepare and put into eﬀect rates for future, I think those will be credit- positive.  The transfer ability that I mentioned on IRA will be credit-positive. And so as we bring to you a ﬁnancing plan and think about the future and the continued growth that we see from capital investment, we will be targeting a minimum of 14% as we go forward and feel like we have the tools to accomplish that.  Operator  Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Yes, hi, good morning, Lynn and Brian. Just-- Hi, so the-- you mentioned a couple of times, the monitoring the sales trends and. I know you gave a little bit of color on the return to work and-- and could you just talk a little bit more in more depth on what's going on with sales in new territories and-- and some of the recent weakness?","Sure, and Steve I'll give it a start, and then I know Brian will have something to add to it. So we've seen some weakness in '23 and I think you saw us early in the year, trying to ﬁgure out, do we have volume weakness or is it weather, because we had such extraordinarily weak weather in the ﬁrst and second quarter. But the weakness has continued into the third-quarter. I would mention textiles. I would mention paper, it's two industries that have been impacted and then outside of those industries, we're hearing from our customers, supply-chain labor, interest rates being an impact to them that they are adjusting to they also many of them have inventory they working through. So they dial back production and production of course hits us in terms of lower-- lower volumes, but. I would say there is optimism in that same Industrial Group about a rebound later in '24 and into '25. And what I would further say as we have evaluated this.  Residential, of course, return to work, but we think we're probably where that return to work trend is situated meeting no more impact from return to work. I think we've pretty well worked out through that ourselves through that transition. And then for our largest jurisdiction, we go to a decoupled environment in 2024 and customer growth continues to be very strong, and its customer growth that will drive revenue and then on the industrial side, the rebound is positive on existing customers, but this economic development has been extraordinary.  And we've given you a sense of what that can look like it starts to layer in as early as '24 and so that gives us some conﬁdence around our longer-term growth rate that we've got customers sort of working through the macro trends here in the short-term, but over the long-term, we continue to see this economic development being incredibly strong and I'm sure you saw yesterday in the journal, the Toyota battery plant is expanding further. Also, sitting here in the North Carolina territory. So that's what I'd share. And Brian, what would you add?     Now I would add, Steve. North Carolina Residential has contributed a signiﬁcant amount of the weakness this year over half. So go into decoupling is something we need to really emphasize, it's going to mitigate risk and volatility going forward. And our Florida jurisdiction has seen strong growth in the residential space. It's been a hot year in Florida, but we've also had strong population migration strongest in the State of Florida. So we see positive shoots coming out and we do see this industrial load in the Carolinas turning as we talk to customers, kind of mid to late next year."
"Great, that's helpful. One other separate question, just on when you're doing your plan and your growth rate from the standpoint of interest rates, are you generally just kind of using the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   whatever the forward curve is of rates for whatever-- for ﬁnancings and reﬁnancings and the like--",It seem we are generating--
And how do you want to purchase you know--,"Yes, absolutely, absolutely. And as you know, that's a dynamic area. So we look at a range, a range of outcomes we did that in '23 we'll do it again in '24. And as we talked about all of the sport, we're doing on cost structure, our objective is to oﬀset the impact of interest rates in 2024."
"Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. See you soon.",Thank you. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is now open.
"Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning.","Hi Nick, sure. Good morning."
"Hey I just wanted to ask, you know, there has been some pretty signiﬁcant changes in the Carolinas in terms of just rate structure with these MYRPs and I know that you're a little lower in the range for ﬁscal '23, but could you just help frame EPS volatility? '23 versus '24 and the residential to come decoupling just stands out to us, if you could just frame how that informs your conﬁdence to hit the ﬁve to seven implied EPS growth for '24 speciﬁcally? Thanks.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Nick. I would conﬁrm that it does underpin our conﬁdence in 5% to 7% growth. This modernized construct in the Carolinas is consequential. It's kind of a ﬁrst in history of the utility that we will have multi-year rate plans, the ability to set prices as we go forward. Of course, delivering value to customers every step of the way, but also more closely matching the expenditure of capital with return. And I would add to that our conﬁdence in the capital underpinning that 5% to 7% growth, very transparent integrated resource plans that outline what it's going to be necessary to serve this growing stake.  So, you know, the Carolinas, we're very well-positioned for the future. And as Brian mentioned a moment ago, continue to see extraordinary growth in Florida. And we have strong capital and Florida grid and solar will be updating our mufti-year rate plan and our investment in the Midwest continues well-- along both generation and grid in Ohio, for example. So I feel like we've got all of the elements to underpin our conﬁdence in the growth. And the jurisdictions are constructive jurisdictions that ﬁnd the right balance between beneﬁts to customers and investors and we're-- conﬁdent in the future."
"Okay, great and what about just on O&M, I know in slides where you kind of talked about 50% sustainable after '23, but just looking back to prior calls. I think we've kind of talked about 75%, so just maybe that's just diﬀerent buckets and I am mi characterizing it, but could you help reconcile that view and then how to just think about '24? Thank you.","Yes, Nick. I really appreciate that question because we have two diﬀerent $300 million so I think, as I look at some of the commentary has been confusing to you also. Let me step through it for you-- may recall that we entered '23 with a cost initiative identiﬁed a driving out $300 million of cost, primarily in the corporate center. And we said to you at that time we thought 75% of about $300 million would be sustainable.  We have executed on that throughout 2023 and have gained conﬁdence that the 75% is going to $100 million that we'll be able to sustain all of it into 2024. And then further we have developed mitigation plans based on weak weather and volume in 2023, which is included not only O&M but other levers including tax ideas that totaled $300 million as well and we think 50% of those are sustainable into 2024. And we also highlighted on our drivers' schedule that we will continue to look for cost-saving ideas.  Part of the continuous improvement structure, that's what we're talking about. On slide 10. So we believe we have various elements in-place to continue to drive O&M lower we think '24 will be lower than '23 and that's just part of our conviction to continue to drive productivity and eﬃciency in our operations."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Many thanks, will see you soon, thank you.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is now open.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. All my questions have been answered. I just sort of-- Good morning, Lynn. Good Morning, Brian. All my questions have been answered, just a quick clariﬁcation Lynn. I think in response to the ﬁrst question, you mentioned 30% to 50%. I believe you were referring to the equity content of any incremental CapEx, could you just clarify that. If my understanding is correct there?","That's correct, Durgesh. It was in response to what is balanced mean and so that's the range I would think about and of course will bring a concrete ﬁnancing plan and capital plan in February that we'll lay this out more clearly. But as we think about all of the tools and levers and cash-ﬂow opportunities that we have across all of our business, that is the range I would consider for incremental equity matched with incremental capital for growth."
"Perfect, thanks so much for clarifying that. I appreciate it.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Carly Davenport, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hi, good morning. This is Jon Miller on for Carly. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to start with the North Carolina resource plan. Just curious if there's any areas where you expect if any to get some pushback. Obviously, a healthy chunk of renewables in there with the wind and solar and also a share of natural gas as well security, if you're expecting the focus on reliability with that, outweigh any concerns with the natural gas?","John. I appreciate that question. I'd start by saying, these integrated resource plans are informed by a very robust stakeholder process, and as you imagine pulling stakeholders together they are diﬀerent points of view across the spectrum from renewables two batteries to natural gas to nuclear some pro some con but we believe we've put forward is a very balanced all-of-the-above strategy that provides. The right balance between reliability, aﬀordability, and increasingly clean, which is our commitment to the state so we think all of those elements will be closely reviewed and evaluated as part of the process in front of the Commission and we believe we'll work through this in a very constructive way, consistent with the way we've moved forward in the previous plans. And we'll keep you posed every step of the way."
"Got it, that's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just one follow-up to the O&M discussion. I know this a bit of the business agility savings will come in 4Q. But as we are now in the year in November, just curious if you have any indications of where you're trending towards that target of 50% being sustainable?","We're going to make 50% sustainable.     Were there, John. We have line-of-sight to the Q4 eﬀorts because a lot of it was tied to the-- to the fall outage season as well as just a culmination of work it takes-- it takes a couple of months to implement and we've evaluated the ability to keep those going on for 2024 and beyond and we've conﬁrmed that."
"Okay, got it. Great, thank you so much.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the call back to Lynn Good for any closing remarks.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Well, thank you all appreciate your engagements today and investment in Duke and we're looking forward to seeing all of you at EEI. So we'll continue the conversation then and of course, IR and Brian and I are always available. So thanks so much.  Operator  That concludes the conference call.
