Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity to connect. I appreciate it and thanks for the details to the call.",Good morning.
"If I'm just going back -- good morning, indeed. If I can go back super quick to the -- the solar CapEx here in the conversation very quickly. I think the key point was your in-line from '22 to '23, so kind of at that 150-ish level for -- for '23. Again you said if delays persist. Can you elaborate a little bit more about what that would look like if delays persist? And also if you can -- can you recap for us a little bit on the earnings recognition? Just how should we think about that -- that the weighted sort of average of across your portfolio, how much of that ITC has been captured in that ﬁrst year if we think about sort of the mechanics behind that -- that impact that you have?","Sure. And Julien, I'll take a shot and I'm sure Steve will have some things to add. I think the headline that I would like to leave with you is we are on track in 2022 for both commercial and regulated renewables. So, the -- the earnings that we have been talking about the adjustment that we made to 2022, we are tracking exactly to both of those.  For 2023, we continue to prioritize our regulated renewables and they are on track. As we look at '23 for commercial, there is some uncertainty that's been created by this investigation really around price and how that price is going to ultimately impact project economics. So, we are planning for a range of outcomes and what Steve shared with you is that range could include something comparable to 2022 if the delays persist or we have the potential to do better than that as clarity occur soon enough so that we can keep projects on track. I think it's important to   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   recognize that this is a minor amount of capital in the construct of Duke Energy and so as we think about 2023, we are conﬁdent in our 5% to 7% growth rate. So, on income recognition, I'll turn to Steve to talk a little bit about that, Julien, and then we can circle back and see if we resolve these questions.     Right. Julien, on the ITC recognition, the past couple of years the projects we've been looking at are three to ﬁve years in that range depending on the tax equity arrangement, but we've been in that range. The accelerated depreciation beneﬁts have been overall perhaps ﬁve to seven type year spread. That's what we've been looking at, but again as projects move we look at what the needs are and what makes sense to the tax equity partner as well. But that's -- that's kind of where we've been."
"Got it. Okay, fair enough. It just a disclaimer there. So, how much of that would be shifting if you can shift it, I don't know, half of your portfolio. How much of that impact that's '23? Just maybe clarify that? And then a second question, if I can. Go forward, Lynn, please.","Yeah. We were trying to share, Julien, is if we do end up shifting, our expectation is that '23 would be in the range of '22."
Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Forget the part of my question is focused on the plan for -- for this year.,"Yeah. And then as we look out 2024, we believe that gives suﬃcient time hopefully if we need supply chain issues to resolve themselves more clarity on price. And we also see a ramp up in regulated renewables by the time 2024 rolls around. So, we're talking about moving a few projects in the Commercial from '22 to '23 if this uncertainty persists. The more of course be monitoring and updating along the way."
"Right. Yeah. Clearly inevitably the timing-related issue, but I very much appreciate that. Just a super quick second question. Just treasuries, you guys have the sensitivity in the slides, et cetera. Could you comment about the impact to your business today from the move-in rates that we've seen? Again lots of diﬀerent ways to take that. Lynn, where would you go with it? I know you get this -- this $0.12 (inaudible) really out there?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yeah. And $0.12 is -- is not a high end, Julien, as you would expect because we're experiencing that interest rate really on short-term at this point and it's all are averaging in the long-term rates, but Steve can take you through speciﬁcs.     That's right. We gave a sense of it -- sensitivity based on variable rate securities in the portfolio, but we -- some things that we've done to mitigate that very signiﬁcantly have we've increased hedging over the past year-and-a-half on some of the securities that we knew we were going to be issuing in '22. We've got around 30% of the securities hedged for '22 and we've hedged even some in -- in '23 that we know we're going to occur.  So, utilization of that we've been opportunistically going into the market working with tenure and timing which given our scope and scale, we can do pretty well. So, we have signiﬁcantly knockdown of the $0.12 impact to -- to the plan that you might see through those techniques."
"Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you all very much. Really appreciate it. Good luck.","Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan, your line is now open."
"Hi, good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan.     Good morning."
"Quick one on -- on the carbon plan. Obviously, appreciate you're going to tell us more about that and tells us more about that in a bit. But then you mentioned, there will be several diﬀerent options and now encompass diﬀerent technologies, but would you expect to make a deﬁnitives   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   like preferred portfolio recommendation with your ﬁling or -- or is it more a range of options and then the Commission is going to take that decision on which one to choose?","Jonathan, it's a latter. We're going to present a range of options on the 70% reduction and then that will be the subject of public hearings and reviewed by the commission and ultimately it would be the Commission's decision on pace technologies, price implications, et cetera. And those portfolios reﬂect the input from stakeholders, so we've had three robust stakeholder meetings, we've also had a series of technical conferences to dig more deeply in to topics that are relevant to the carbon plan.  So when we ﬁle this on Monday, Jonathan, we will come provide information to all of you on what's in there, and then, of course, it will be a centerpiece of our discussion over the balance of the year."
"Okay. But there's no -- there is not going to be a rethink, this is about one -- one thing like that from the sound there?","No, no."
"Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then just on -- just in terms of what you're seeing on load and that your comments about second quarter probably being the peak and how is that what you've seen, sorry, ﬁrst quarter. How is, what you've seen in terms of the last few weeks relevant to the trajectory you expected when you gave that year-end, 1.5%. Yeah, glide path, I guess. You -- has it tracked a little ahead or is it roughly on the line you would have thought, or any more color you can give us there?","Jonathan, I -- I would say we continue to experience very strong growth in the Carolinas and in Florida and that shows up with customers, it shows up with economic development, and our results reﬂect that strength. But we're also monitoring, what's going on in the broader economy with inﬂation and GDP growth expectations, and so that has kept us at our planned level of 1.5% for the full year.  And I don't know, Steve, if you would add to that?      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yeah, I think we're going to have -- we gave strongly here, but as Lynn said we're not going to move oﬀ of 1.5% at this time because there are other factors we need to think about. We're early in the year but it's nice to continue to see the migration and -- and when -- when people move in, the commercials is going to follow that; hotels, restaurants, et cetera. And we're seeing robust industrial growth just in our service areas due to economic development eﬀorts and just the general good business climate.  So, hopefully, that will carry through and continue on, but we're oﬀ to a good start, but we got to keep an eye on it, not time to change the forecast."
"Great. If it has been good, but it's enabling it to be a little more conservative if you think about the rest of the year?",That's right.
Great. Thanks so much.,"Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  Thank you, Jonathan. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy, your line is now open."
"Hi, good morning. It's actually, Ryan Carr on for Jeremy. Thanks for taking my questions. I just one and a follow-up on the carbon plan ﬁling. And you just remind us how that ultimately will show up in your multi-year plan ﬁling. I think you talked about DEP 4Q and DEC 1Q and just -- just going to remind us of the big milestones to watch ahead of those ﬁlings?","Sure. A couple of things I would note there. Well over 50% of the multi-year rate planning capital will be transmission and distribution investment. We will include some level of renewables and battery storage consistent with the carbon plan really targeted for the end of the three-year period to think about projects that would come into service '25-'26.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And the way the rate cases work here in the Carolinas as we do have an opportunity to continue to update capital beyond ﬁling through the date of the hearing. So that will give us an opportunity to fully understand the approved carbon plan to the extent any adjustment needs to be made in capital, then we do so at that time.  So I would think about these things running in a bit in parallel, Ryan. But given that the majority of the capital is T&D, we don't expect a material impact on the multiyear rate plan from the carbon plan in this three-year cycle. A lot of impact in the next one."
"Got it. No, that makes us. Very helpful. And then just one on inﬂation maybe or supply chain impacts even outside of the solar. Just curious, you hit on a little bit in the script, but just going to general trends you're seeing across your cost structure, how you kind of see that intertwining with your ability to kind of continue taking out O&M?","We continue to see what you're hearing throughout the industry, whether it's raw materials, labor. Of course, fuel costs have been front and center. But as Steve indicated, we are addressing those risks with improved planning with our long-term contracts, our scale, inventory, substitution, additional suppliers, just a variety of considerations. And as we look at O&M in particular, we're conﬁdent in our trajectory that we had planned for 2022 and maybe a little background there, Ryan. We had originally been planning for a negative 1%. We raised that to ﬂat, giving us some headroom and so the combination of all the things I mentioned give us conﬁdent that we're on track for O&M in 2022 and we have yet to see any impact to our overall capital plan as a result of these changes. We've been able to address even delays in supply chain make substitutions in our projects and keep executing for our customers."
"Got it. No, that's -- it's very helpful. Thank you. Always the best.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you, Ryan. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is now open."
"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Hi, Michael."
"Congrats on a good -- Hey, Lynn, and congrats on a good start of the year. I actually have a couple. First of all, O&M. O&M, ex-storms was up year-over-year. And if I understood Steve's comments correctly, you will have some O&M pressure in the second quarter with outage schedules, I would assume. How should we think about what that means for the cadence and trajectory of O&M in 2022 ex-storms? Flat, up, down, and if it's down, is it more back-end loaded?","We have targeted ﬂat, Michael, and it will certainly be at least ﬂat. Our agility eﬀorts frankly that we are putting in place, I think could drive it downward. It will be back-half, and that's just the timing of when things are aligning. But absent storms, I feel good certainly about being ﬂat to potentially declining."
"And I know you've got the RFPs coming in Indiana and I'm just curious of the 2.4 gigawatts. Can you remind me, how much of that is renewable versus conventional and how do you think about what is potentially utility or cell phones versus kind of just on under a traditional BBA [ph]?","Yeah. So, Michael, it breaks down almost 50-50. So a 1,100 megawatts of renewable resources 1,300 megawatts are electric generation and we continue to believe that utility ownership is valuable to our customers and we'll be putting that forward in our expectation of -- of building renewables, buying renewables that there would be some degree of utility ownership.  And then, we'll know more about the dispatchable resources. The results came in May 2. We're still digesting that the third-party administrator has not shared a lot of speciﬁcs on that, but if it's renewables any indication will get robust responses to those -- those resources as well."
Got it. And then last one. You mentioned quickly in the remarks today that you -- you updated the Storm Protection Plan ﬁlings in Florida. Can you remind me how much of a material -- how material of change relative to the original ﬁling? Does that make to your capital spend plan in the revenue requirement for this year in the next couple years and Florida?,"Overall, the impact was about a $1 billion increase as a result of updating the SPP ﬁling in Florida, Michael.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"About $1 billion over 10 years, $1 billion over two years? Just can you put some cadence and timing around that for me, please?","I would expect it to be back half of the decade. Michael, you may remember we're under a multiyear rate plan through early 2024. We will be updated capital in connection with that ﬁling. So it's not going to be in the next couple of years, it would be later.     That's right. It was a 10-year ﬁling, so Lynn is right. It would probably be in the back part of the year. We'll get some of that in the latter part of our ﬁve-year plan, but the bulk of it's going to be after that."
Right. And I thought that was covered via tracker or rider the separate from the -- from the core GRC sort of forward-looking test [ph] years you have in Florida?,"That's correct. It is a rider, it started in late '21 and it's kicking in this year. That's correct. But most of that increase in spend will be -- will be updated ﬁling will be in the latter part of the decade.     And, Michael, I would -- I would suggest that we look at all of these things. The multiyear rate plan, the Storm Protection Plan is a part of an integrated approach to serving customers in Florida and really thinking about how the impact of price and schedule and our construction activities in our capital.  So, we plan them in a coordinated way."
"Got it. Thanks, Lynn. Thanks, Steve.","Thank you.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Sure.  Operator  Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony, your line is now open."
"Good morning. Lynn. Good morning, Steve. Congrats on a good quarter.",Thank you.     Thank you.
"Hey, hopefully just an easy one. A lot of the focus on North Carolina. If I could pivot to South Carolina. Just wondering, I don't believe that state has a decarbonization target yet. I'm wondering when do you think we get more clarity from the state on the decarbonization target and I guess how would that impact Duke's CapEx plans?","Anthony, I would maybe pull out just a little bit to talk about the alignment between the two states, that has existed over decades whether you think about nuclear or even work around economic development to make sure that we've got investment going in both states. South Carolina has a strong interest in renewable generation. You may remember Act 62 set out some parameters around renewable construction and we will continue to work with the state on how the -- the clean energy transition should occur so that both states are able to meet their objectives.  And I would think about energy policy is being important to both states. The language may be slightly diﬀerent, the approach, we believe will be aligned and coordinated in a way that makes sense for our customers and for our investors.  So, I'll leave it at that at this point, Anthony, but a lot of work going on to make sure South Carolina is completely up to date on all that is occurring and I should indicate that they have been very active stakeholders in the carbon plan in the stakeholder meetings here in North Carolina."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just I think you guys have great clarity on the pressure on renewables. Again, it's probably, I think 3% units overall earning. So a pretty small portion. But just I know if it's Steve or you Lynn, just what kind of toggle or what kind of leverage would you pull to navigate maybe the pressure on renewables that I think '23 is ﬂat, '22 that we look for may lower O&M and in the utilities to maybe overcome that. Just wanted to clarify where the leverage would be to oﬀset the pressure on renewables and I'll leave it there?","Yeah, Anthony, I would think about that. I would also think about acceleration of capital and other places in the business. So the types of agility levers we have pulled time and time again to maintain our trajectory. And Steve, over to you to see if you got anything.     Yeah, I think that's right. We look at the rider mechanisms that we've got, the investments that we can make there and our O&M agility is a core muscle that we exercise in these times. And given our scope and scale, we can look across the footprint, we can look at supply chain and -- and various mechanisms within there as well. So, number of tools across the footprint in that vein, Anthony."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you, Anthony. Our next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe Research. David, your line is now open.     Good morning, David. Good morning."
"Good morning, Lynn. How are you doing? Can hear me okay?","Yeah, we can. Thank you."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Great. So I appreciate the -- the comments you made on the solar CapEx relatively modest your current plan. Just curious, how should we think about solar post your current plan? So I think you've given us a range in the back half of the decade. Would you -- would you say it's going to be in a similar percentage points or was -- are we are touching seriously higher?","David, the thing I would point to as I look at '24, '25, '26, we will be ramping renewable construction in the regulated business in a much more signiﬁcant way than the short term. The '22-'23 that you are accustomed to seeing. So think about the Carolinas. We have not had renewable build in our capital plan in the Carolinas. But that will begin to show up in '24, '25, and '26. We've talked about the fact that we will see an increasing amount of regulated renewables and that will impact the way we think about capital allocation between regulated and commercial, you'll begin to see that in '24-'25."
"Okay. Just I would say that whatever projection you have for solar in the Carolinas, so at least North Carolinas your plan reﬂects the ownership level that you -- under the law, I think 45% or 50%?","Absolutely, 55-45. 55% utility ownership. Yes."
"Great. And if I can ask a general question maybe speciﬁcally to but just can you talk, Lynn, about the eﬀorts that you and Duke and maybe industry generally are conducting really informed administration about the DOC solar investigation and maybe just clean energy incentives generally?.","Yes, and you David, I would say, there has been an ongoing discussion around clean energy policy around renewable tax credits, around supply chain issues really dating back to the end of last year, continuing into this one. We share the goal with the administration of reaching a net zero future and so these elements, we're talking about are relevant to that conversation.  So we believe a timely and eﬃcient resolution of the Department of Commerce inquiry is important. We also believe that the renewable tax credits are important for our customers, as you think about the level of investment that is plan to reach these goals. So we're very actively engaged in policies that impact our goals for net-zero and I don't see that changing."
Okay. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you, David. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now pass the conference back over to Lynn Good for any closing remarks.     Well, thank you for participation today for questions for your investment in Duke Energy, and as always, we're available if there are questions or further follow-up on anything that we've covered today and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks again.  Operator  That concludes today's Duke Energy quarter one 2022 conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.
