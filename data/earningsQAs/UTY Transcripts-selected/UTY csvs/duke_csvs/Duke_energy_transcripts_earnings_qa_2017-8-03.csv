Question,Answer
"Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Good morning.     Hello, Mike.     Good morning, Mike."
"Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the status of legislation in North Carolina, and where you think that might be going, and what kind of timeline you might be expecting on that?","Hey, Mike, we're really pleased with the H.B. 589 that we referenced on the call. This was very constructive, I think really a win-win piece of legislation, culminating from a 10-month stakeholder process, and bringing not only the opportunity for growth but reduction of cost to customers, improving reliability and opportunities for additional investment for Duke. So we see it as a demonstrated milestone for us as we continue to advance legislative initiatives in the Carolinas. As you know, additional investment around the grid remains the priority for us, and we have laid a very strong foundation in this legislative session on the compelling business case for customers, and also the case for job creation in North Carolina, and look for ways that we can continue to advance that agenda, not only in the legislature but in the regulatory arena as well. So we see 2017 as being a year that we made great progress and more to come.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"And also with the PURPA reforms test, when do you expect to see maybe some additional opportunities coming from that?","There is a procedural schedule that goes with the legislation, Mike, where we need to make a series of ﬁlings. So think about this as beginning in 2018 generally. This does represent additional investment opportunities for us in renewables which we'll evaluate carefully along with all of the other capital opportunities that we have. But we see it as a very constructive piece of legislation beneﬁting customers, and also creating a sustainable renewable market here in the Carolina."
"So perhaps, maybe we'll see some more info on that next February. Is that in the next CapEx update?","Sure. Certainly, we'll give you an update on CapEx in 2018, and we'll continue to develop this opportunity, Mike, even between now and then. So you can think about us as looking for ways throughout all of our jurisdictions to continue to deploy capital. And this represents another opportunity that provides investors with visibility on what's possible, and we think, underpins our growth rate for the future. So we look at this as a very signiﬁcant milestone for us."
All right. Great. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead.
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Greg.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Good morning, Greg."
"Congratulations on the legislation. It's clearly a win for customers by lowering their costs, and also a win for you guys being able to participate if you can bring in competitive projects. So congrats on that.",Thank you.
"On the rate case, you indicated we won't be getting any details on the Duke Energy Carolinas ﬁling until further little while now. But what was the date again at which we'll be able to sort of analyze the ask (25:05) there?","Greg, it will later in August. So we typically ﬁle notice 30 days before the case is ﬁled. That's the process here in North Carolina. Soon we (25:15) ﬁle notice late July, you'll hear more in late August."
"Great. And can we talk a little bit about the ask (25:22) and the Duke Energy Progress case? I know it's early days in your ﬁling, and you'll be engaging with all the major parties in the case as we go through time. But the headline, increase is 14%, that's a pretty substantial number. Now, I also understand that you haven't ﬁled a rate case in many years, and so that's a cumulative of having been away from rate ﬁlings for a while, and the fact that you've put a substantial amount of capital to work, which you deserve recovery for. But still, it's just a very large number. So can you talk about sort of how you socialize that, especially in the context of a lot of the growth capital that you've talked about related to grid modernization isn't even in this case, it's going to be in subsequent sort of future negotiations with Commission.","Greg, it's a fair question, and I would point to a couple of things on this. It's been several years since we've been in. One thing you shall notice that's not in the case is very aggressive cost management. So we've been able to deliver consistent and deliberate cost management to oﬀset impacts to customers. And as we think about moving this case through the process, we'll also engage with stakeholders, as you referenced, to reach a settlement, if we can do that or to have good constructive discussions on how we move forward. So we've got strong capital in here for things like the Sutton Plant and new solar, and we also have investments in the Western   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Carolina Modernization Project, which has been strongly supported here in the Carolinas, and of course, coal ash. So I think we have a demonstrated record. If you look at the way we've approached the rate cases in this state, really in every state we operate in; bringing people together to come up with a solution that works for customers and investors will ultimately be our objective, and I believe the Commission as well, ﬁnding that right balance between customers and investors. So we will work this as we've worked every case, and I have conﬁdence that we'll deliver an outcome that makes sense for both customers and investors."
"Great. And can you just refresh our memories traditionally, if there was an opportunity for settlement, that sort of what window in the case does that usually avail itself?","I would look to kind of that October, mid-October to mid-November timeframe, Greg, for the DEP case. The procedural schedule has the hearing set for November 20. Testimony occurs kind of in that last month before the hearing. And so that's the point where you start to see the positions of the parties, and you create an opportunity to sit down and have discussions."
Perfect. Thank you. Have a great day.,Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan.     Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hi. So we just wondered, you cited ACP as one of the drivers in the quarter, increased investment. Can you share how much you've invested to date and – prior to things getting moving?",Yes. We've got about $500 million invested in ACP at this point.
"Okay. And so that's the rate base number, eﬀectively, that's driving the (29:01)?",That's correct.
"Okay. And then, just on the cost to achieve on Piedmont, they seem to be kind of still running at a decent clip. Give us a sense of what's still being booked there, and when does that start to fade?","That will continue to fade through 2017 and through 2018. We still have some software integration costs that we're looking at. That's the primary area, as you retire systems that Piedmont was on, convert data over into the Duke system, and do those types of software integration eﬀorts. That's the main eﬀort underway at this point."
So you think by eight – (29:49) they'll run through next year and then be small.,That's correct.
Okay. Great.,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Jon, I would add, I think the integration of Piedmont has really been a textbook integration, very smooth. The business continues to run very well. And, given our track record here of a number of mergers over time, we've developed a playbook that we've eﬀectively executed here. So I'm really pleased with where we are in the integration."
Great. Thank you for that.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next one from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead.
"So, quick question on the rate case, Duke Energy Progress rate case. Is the ROE something that would also be up for discussion, in terms of the 10.75%, or you think that one is more set and really not up for debate?","Praful, ROE is always up for discussion. Our allowed ROE today is 10.2%. We believe, in a rising interest rate environment, the 10.75% is a dependable ask, but ROE is always a topic of discussion, and will be in this case."
Got you. And the rising interest rate environment is more based on projections of where you see rates going over time. Is that how they will look at it?,That's correct.
"Fair enough. Got you. And the other thing I was also looking at was the holding company debt. I think one of the slides in the back you have the issuances, and there seems to be more to be issued in this year. So it's from slide, I think, 25. Just wanted to understand, like what is the percentage target, I guess, in terms of holding company debt as a proportion to total for this year? And then, is there any concern from a notching (31:50) perspective in terms of credit ratings, where agencies are limiting or saying that, hey, above a certain level, there could be a notching (31:59) implication on the rating?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Yes, Praful. As we put forth in February, we expect the holding company debt to be in the mid- 30s percentage of total company debt this year. And over our ﬁve-year plan, it will crest around the mid-30s percentage and start to come down a bit in the low to mid-30s percentage by the end of the ﬁve-year plan. And we've been very transparent with the rating agencies about that. We think with our low-risk proﬁle of our businesses that certainly is comfortable for our credit ratings, and our rating agencies have agreed with us on that. Regarding our holding company position for this year, we've issued about $1 billion, a lot of it through private placement thus far through 2017. There'll be some other issuances at the holding company level that we're planning could be fairly soon in the summer.     And Praful, I think the important point here is, if you look at where the company is positioned, coming out of all the portfolio transition that's been underway, we operate a very strong set of regulated utilities and low-risk jurisdictions with visible capital investment that we have a demonstrated track record of completing. We've been very transparent with the agencies on our capital plans, and they're comfortable with where we are. The recent action on Moody's is an indication of that. And so there's nothing in this ﬁnancing plan that's a change in the way we're managing the business. And we'll intend to execute our strategic plan in growing the company and maintaining balance sheet strength."
"Understood. And just ﬁnally, I mean, you guys have a pretty good perspective across the U.S. of load growth. So wanted to understand electriﬁcation and just electric cars, there seems to be quite a trend at least expected over time to move in that direction. Do you see that as something impacting load growth over time? Do you see that as a hope for the utility sector in terms of incremental load growth? How do you view that electriﬁcation trend, I guess?","Praful, I think it is positive. And I think it will grow over time. I don't see it as a step change though in load growth because of all the other factors impacting load, including energy eﬃciency and other items. But it's deﬁnitely a positive trend, and we are actively in the electriﬁcation market with a team of people working in our service territories and with vendors to ﬁnd ways that we can take advantage of that opportunity."
"Got you. Thanks so much, guys.",Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Hey, guys. Just a question, I mean...","Hi, Mike."
"Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.",Thank you.
"I want to talk Florida for a second because you're getting in the seventh to eighth innings or so with some of the gas generation development, meaning Citrus, Hines. I'm just curious how you're looking at your Florida jurisdiction in terms of; A, the need for new conventional generation; or B, a potential utility scale solar rollout in Florida. We're seeing some of your peers in Florida, the regulated companies actually do a sizeable amount of annual investing in utility-scale solar. Just curious if your customer base and if the regulator and the intervenors who talk to you down there, kind of have an appetite for that for Duke Energy Florida?","Michael, I feel like we have a wealth of opportunities in Florida. You may remember that we're under a settlement agreement that runs through January 1, 2019. And so the team is very actively looking at the next wave of investments to deliver customer beneﬁts. We think renewables will be a part of that. You may have noticed in our 10-year site plan, we have like 750 megawatts of solar on our agenda. But we also see additional growth investment potential in Florida. So that work is underway. And as we continue to mature those ideas and reach a timeframe where it makes sense to talk about it more speciﬁcally, we'll do that. But we see great opportunity in Florida, and really pleased with the rebound in the economy there. But the growth that Steve highlighted just underscores the strong and growing jurisdictions in which we operate.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Got it. Thank you and much appreciated.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.
I know it's early but...,Good morning.
"Good morning. (36:51) what you see the opportunity around Bill 589, and do you think, is that incremental capital or would that displace other capital?","Paul, one way to think about it is, there's about 3,000 megawatts or so of solar in that legislation. We have an ability to compete for 30% of that, and we have the ability to buy beyond that 30%, and ﬂow those costs through a rider, which gives us timely investment recovery. In our ﬁve-year plan, we have something like $400 million of capital directed towards that type of investment in the Carolinas. So we do have more investment opportunities than we imagined (37:38), and our role will be to look at those investment opportunities, compare to alternatives and do as much as we can in a way that delivers great returns. So I see it as a growing list or great opportunities to deploy capital that underpins conﬁdence and the ability to grow 4% to 6%."
