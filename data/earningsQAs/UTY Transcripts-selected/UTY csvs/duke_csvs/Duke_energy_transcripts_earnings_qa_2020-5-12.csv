Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.","Hi, Shar.     Good morning."
"So with the mitigation plans that was announced, how much of the $0.35 to $0.45 is sort of cemented and if COVID is more protracted and recurrent, 3% to 5% [ph] low degradation, do you have incremental levers? And I do have a quick follow up.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","So I'll start and Steve, you can add. We have deﬁnitive plans for the $0.35 to $0.45, Shar, as well as upside potential. And I think at some point, depending on how this economic downturns plays out we would continue to go more aggressively, not only at the cost categories we've identiﬁed, but really within a broader contracted transformation. And this is where we'd be more aggressive around corporate center, around outsourcing real estate footprint, digital tool, early plant retirements. Just a variety of things and that work is already underway.  So this is something that I'm particularly proud of this. We've demonstrated the ability to understand our cost and cost drivers signiﬁcantly over the last ﬁve years. We've also put infrastructure in place to drive transformation and the plans are underway for a range of economic outcomes."
"Got it and then just focusing on the O&M side of the $350 million to $450 million in mitigation plan, can you touch on how much of this could be ongoing perpetual nature as we sort of think about the shaping of your O&M proﬁle post 2020?","Sure. I would say, there will be elements of the cost reductions that are sustainable and there will be elements that move with timing. So an example would be when you put a hiring freeze in place. We will enter 2021 with a lower headcount than we would have originally projected, and then we will begin bringing skills in at the appropriate time in case depending on the needs of the business. I think outages, because we're running our assets whilst [ph] we've been able to dispose some of those that we will be thoughtful about maintaining assets are important to customers and settle those back in as needed.  We're also spending a lot of time and what we've learned around remote work and the activities underway from COVID-19 and I believe there will be permanent savings from the way we are using resources, that we're trying to get our hands around quantiﬁcation of that as we look at remote work policies and as we look at our real estate footprint and you can expect to hear more about that as we think about 2021 and beyond. Steve, would you add to that?     Well I think, Lynn hit it very well. I'm very conﬁdent that we're learning a lot through this pandemic about how to work remotely, how do you use technology tools, that we didn't really realize what we had. That will serve us well as we go forward. We'll couple that with the digital capabilities that our business transformation center is utilizing in data analytics. I think we will be able to -- we have found a new avenue, a new half [ph] of another body of eﬃciencies through what we're learning through this COVID-19 pandemic."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Terriﬁc guys, congrats on the plan that was announced. Great execution. Thanks.","Shar, thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
Hope you all and your families you're doing well through this (multiple speakers) times.,"Thank you, Stephen and hope yours as well."
"Thank you. I wanted to touch just ﬁrst on ACP and I think we expect and I think many expect that you will be victorious at the Supreme Court. From there, I guess I'm thinking about the Montana litigation and potential impacts in terms of decision to restart the project or ability to restart the project. I think there is a chance there that litigation could be fairly extensive. How does that factor into sort of the decision-making around restarting work on ACP?","Stephen, it's an important consideration. And as I said in the remarks, assuming that we can get this resolved successful through selling season we will be in position to move forward, maintaining cost and schedule. Given the fact that, that ruling happened yesterday you're catching us at a very early time in our evaluation. We would expect the Army Corp and DoJ to appeal and we'll be monitoring this closely as I know, others will be in the industry and other infrastructure companies. And of course there are more from the Army Corps and DoJ as we go forward.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So it's something to keep on the radar screen. And we will continue to monitor and update as we learn more."
Understood. So it is clearly relevant as you're thinking about the overall plan for the project.,"Yeah, (inaudible) on it."
"Understood. And then maybe just a quick one on the credit statistics, Steve that you laid out laid out kind of a pretty clear path, and maybe sort of over thinking or just looking at the discussion here in terms of the 15%, FFO to debt level that you're targeting versus sort of the 15% or 16% level, would you mind just touching again on dialog with rating agencies, your overall sort of sense for where you want to be over the next several years in terms of your FFO to debt?","Yeah, so our targeted range for credit ratings is to have FFO in the 15% to 16% range. We've taken steps to make that happen in our plan, and in the past, we have good dialog with the rating agencies. Moody's reaﬃrmed our rating, S&P pulled the entire sector onto a negative outlook and everybody is looking at the impacts of this pandemic. So we will continue our dialog.  We are seeing some erosion at the top line revenues and that aﬀects FFO. But you can see the mitigation impacts that we have put in place, that moves in the opposite direction. So we'll continue the dialog. We will continue to work to meet our ﬁnancial plans, both earnings and on the credit side. A couple of things that are unique to us, we've got these AMT credits, accelerated monetization helps us quite a bit here. We're also taking advantage of diﬀering corporate portion of payroll taxes. That's about $100 million cash ﬂow beneﬁt.  Our pension plans are in good shape in terms of funding and so forth. We're not a cash tax payer until 2027 in a signiﬁcant way. So we've got some solid strength in our balance sheet that help us.  And then the continued regulatory activity of getting the recovery of cost is essential there. So we'll continue that dialog with the rating agencies and we'll keep them abreast of what's moving forward."
"Now that makes total sense. And just lastly if I could, just on the O&M cost control, impressive results in terms of being able to cut costs, and it's an interesting point about sort of some of the learnings that you're engaged in. When you think about sort of the EPS growth guidance in the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   longer term that you've laid out and the trajectory, is there a potential that some of these learnings that are -- that could last and be beneﬁcial, could that have a meaningful beneﬁt in terms of, as you think about your overall trajectory or is it a little too early to say. How are you thinking about what you've been able to learn here?","Stephen, I think, O&M agility and the ability to lower cost structure is a tailwind to growth because it puts us in a great position to deploy capital without raising price to customers. And so I do think about it as something that's important to the long-term growth of the company."
"Understood. And it sounds like a portion of these cost savings are things that could be more permanent in nature and be beneﬁcial, longer term, whereas others things like outage timing are more transitory in nature. So it sounds like it's a mix of the two.","I think that's right, Stephen. But I think it's important that you're hearing from us that lowering our cost structure is not only a core competency of ours, but a strong objective and we think, particularly in a time when you we've got economic uncertainty to move early and aggressively is a smart thing to do and that's how we are positioning ourselves in 2020 and also for 2021 and beyond.     And we are learning techniques to utilize our workforce much more eﬃciently in this situation. We can virtually shift engineers within functions. We have shifted ﬁnancial people from budgeting to accounting to audit services, IT people to diﬀerent functions. With virtual capabilities as we learn more about, and they're going to help us utilize our workforce more eﬃciently. And I think that's going to provide longer term savings capabilities."
"Very good, thank you very much.","Thank you.     Thank you, Stephen.  Operator   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research LLC. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.","Hi, Steve, good morning."
"So just the -- could you, if you don't mind, just remind us kind of the North Carolina rate cases, when you expect outcomes and just if that does get delayed further how much we have to worry about the timing of that exactly in terms of your range for this year.","So Steve, we made a ﬁling maybe a week ago, two days ago. Adjusting or recommending a consolidation of the two cases in the Carolinas supported by public staﬀ, putting the hearing in July of this year. And so we think the commission will develop close consideration and that will put us close to the timing we had originally planned.  So we feel like we've got some ﬂexibility within our ﬁnancial plan for 2020 on that timing. I also think it's fair to say that there are tools with these cases, whether its deferrals, accounting orders, give back to -- deferred income taxes, interim rates, a variety of tools that could be used to support the health of the utility. And we'll be evaluating all of those considerations as we go in as tools. Many of those tools are available to the commission is you know."
"Okay. And any updated thoughts on whether you have control, likely potential to settle those cases or expect them to be fully dedicated to the end?","Steve, we've introduced (inaudible) on a handful of items in the DEC case. We do have similar discussions on DEP and between now and July, we'll continue to keep lines of communication open with the parties to see if there are other opportunities. I think this is an important time as you recognize customers of course, working through the economic downturn, but the health of the utilities are also extraordinarily important and I'm not sure that there has been another time when the essential nature of our service has been underscored more than this. And so we'll continue to have discussions. It's hard to forecast whether or not we'll get to any further settlement at this point, but we'll keep you posted."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay, and then lastly, I think you mentioned that there has been the initial meeting in the North Carolina energy plan. I think it's the initial meetings there. Could you just give color on where that stands and when we might start seeing any outcomes from that?","Sure. There have been two stakeholder work streams, Steve in 2020, one focused on climate policy. So this is a group of stakeholders focused on retirement of coal, CO2 markets, clean energy standard and they have continued to meet even remotely talking about these various items. We would expect a draft report from those discussions in the second quarter, public draft for third quarter and then a recommendation going to the Governor by the end of the year. You may recall that the objective is to get to at least 70% carbon reduction by 2030.  And it's actually greenhouse gases not carbon and so there are some alignment around base years and other things going on to ﬁgure out exactly how to do the accounting. We're comfortable with this objective. You know from our climate strategy, where it's at least 50% by 2030. So that stream of work is very engaged.  There have also been two meetings on a stakeholder process focused on modernized regulation performance-based rate-making and other tools. The discussion there is early, I would say just I think there was one meeting in person, one remote meeting. The objectives there are trying to ﬁnd ways that carbon reduction can be incented, distributed energy resources and so that is moving at perhaps a slightly slower pace, but good discussion and dialog there as well.  So I think on both of these we will have more feedback as the year progresses and determine whether or not there is any speciﬁc push coming out of either of these processes for legislation in 2021."
"Okay, great. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you We will next go to Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
"Hi, good morning everyone.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Good morning, Jonathan.     Good morning."
"Just a quick question, sort of on the guidance reaﬃrmation, and the cost savings versus the question you see on sales. Is it reasonable to assume where you're sitting today, if those things play out as we've outlined, recognizing there is a lot of variability, but you would be sort of solidly in the range or are we kind of holding in at the moment or if there's any other color you can give us there?","And Jonathan, I appreciate that. We have built a plan and are executing a plan that matches the COVID-19 expectation as well as the ﬁrst quarter weaker weather which really gives us an opportunity to move in solidly within the range. And as we talked about, we have a track record of being able to manage O&M in the fashion and we have a high degree of conﬁdence that we can do that, but we also recognize we're only a couple of months into this. The third quarter is still ahead of us.  There are a wide range of assumptions on how this economy is going to play out or states are just getting to reopen. We have the milestones around the pipeline [ph] that we've talked about with the SCOTUS [ph] decision and also biological opinion. So we'll continue to update on all of these things as the year progresses, but the actions that we've put into place right now are designed to place us solidly within the range."
"Perfect, thank you for clarifying, Lynn. Just one other thing you talked about keeping regulated informed on incremental costs, could you just set -- are you actually deferring certain items and just where are you on sort of deferral and potentially orders out of commissions allowing you to do that in normal?","For the ﬁrst quarter, Jonathan, minimal impact because we were just sort of starting into this process and the various policies with customers, but we are reporting and tracking all of these costs to our various commissions and you will begin to see ﬁlings around deferrals or accounting orders and other things. I think Ohio and Indiana already underway and as we get more of that feedback going, then we will reﬂect appropriate accounting entries at the right time.  Steve, how would you add?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Yeah, that's correct. We're preparing ﬁlings in the Midwest, in Ohio and Indiana. We are tracking costs in all of our jurisdictions. And at the appropriate time we'll will make various ﬁlings and work with our regulators on appropriate deferrals. Nothing is being deferred at this point but applications are getting prepared tracking is moving forward and we'll continue to look at this and see what makes the most sense."
Okay. And how have you treated that in guidance I guess?,"So, Jonathan, we're assuming that we will get appropriate treatment of the incremental costs and I'm focusing on things like bad debt expense. The timing of when that occurs in terms of cash collections will depend on the jurisdictions. But for incremental costs, we are assuming that we will get appropriate regulatory treatment."
"Okay, thanks. And (multiple speakers) the recent executive order about not sourcing equipment from adversary nations. Do you have any initial thoughts at the high level on how this might impact your ability to execute the plan on grid for example? Just give any color and I realize that you have to be deﬁned so seems to be a new (multiple speakers).","We are closely following it, Jonathan. I think the spirit of it is to address cyber risks, which is something we strongly support. There was a similar executive order issued formerly a few years ago for the telecom industry and so we will factor in as we learn more these plans into our investment plan, but as you know, making investments in T&D intended to address cyber and physical risk as well as renewables and customer programs, all of that, is clearly within our strategic investment plan.  So we will adjust it as we learn more and applaud focus on cyber risk and around the bulk power system.     And I would add that we have a supplier base across our footprint. As you said, Jonathan, there is more to learn and so who is speciﬁcally being targeted here but we look at our vendor base and try to diversify as much as possible, so we can move in diﬀerent directions if necessary."
"Perfect. Great, thank you very much for your time.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)",Thanks Jonathan.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning. Hope you all are well?","Hi, Julien."
"Hey, good morning. So I know you addressed this in part, but I want to come back to a little bit, how do you think of the sustainability of the cost cuts beyond the current period. Obviously it's a dramatic number, so it's not necessarily expected, but how do you think about the cadence of that against the need for perhaps evolving rate case timeline. And even within that number that you talked about this year is a follow-up question, how are you thinking about that complementing your cost-cutting eﬀort to mitigate impacts from coal ash, if that make sense as well?","Well, so I'll take a stab and Steve, you can build on it. We have developed a plan Julien to match what we see as COVID risk as well as mild weather. So you've got an economic downturn as well as a weak start to the year and we've identiﬁed from a range of things, operations, corporate center, employee expenses, hiring freeze, on track to contingent workers, over time, variable compensation, a variety of tools that we will use to go after that.  As I commented a moment ago, the fact that we are only a couple of months into this and learning about the reopening and learning about what might unfold over the balance of the year, we are also looking at each of those cost categories for potential upsizing of them as well as moving into what I would call more transformative changes where we might look at real estate and early retirement of certain assets and so on. So there is a lot of planning going on because the future is uncertain.  If I look at that range of plus, some of them may be sustainable. I'm not prepared to give you a percentage or a speciﬁc number on that, but I do believe that some of them will be sustainable. The example I gave a moment ago, hiring freeze is going to put us into 2021 with a smaller workforce and we will monitor as we go, how to convert to a sustainable lower cost structure, if we ﬁnd ourselves in a longer downturn.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I think as you talk about things like coal ash, you're talking about regulatory growth and the rate case outcomes and how that will factor in. We have a range of assumptions in our ﬁnancial plan as we think about rate cases. And that is always part of our thinking and developing the size of mitigating actions. And so I don't point to a speciﬁc item on that, but I will say, anytime you put a ﬁnancial plan together you're evaluating a range of outcomes.  We feel strongly that recovery of coal ash costs and recovery will return is important, we believe it's important for any health of the balance sheet, when you think about a cost of this nature. And we will be prepared to strongly defend that when we are on the stand later this summer.     And I might add Julien that as we think about our regulatory cadences, the ability to generate these O&M eﬃciencies is a very useful tool here. It gives us headroom and needed capital investments on behalf of our customers, as Lynn alluded to earlier, and minimize any rate impacts to customers. So this capital optimization around our O&M optimization in sync with the regulatory cadence, it is a very important part of what we're trying to put together. And we've got ﬂexibility in the capital plan. So we can move that capital around, so it's pitted under O&M eﬃciencies to help our shareholders and our customers.  So those are the types of dynamics we plan to put together across our footprint."
"Excellent. Can I just follow-up very brieﬂy here, how you are thinking about the shaping here by quarter of the cost cuts and how they manifest themselves relative, I suppose to the reduction of loan. I mean it sounds like you were rapidly able to identify the cost cut, such that if you think about 2Q and 3Q, et cetera? And then, Lynn if I can clarify you speciﬁcally said that you did not yet plan for instance voluntary retirement programs as part of this $400 million number?","Yeah, I'll take that one. There is no assumption of a voluntary retirement program in the numbers, Julien.     And then on the shaping, Julien, I'd like to most of it to be in the second half of the year. A lot of our generation outage work will be in the fall generation season as our headcount freeze kicks and that kind of builds during the year. We had budgeted increases in workforce. We will certainly see some in each quarter of the rest of the year. But speciﬁcally, due to the generation outage work that will be a bit more in the second half of this year."
"Excellent, thank for the patient and time. Best of luck.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."
Hi guys.,"Hi, Mike. Good morning."
"Hey, a couple of questions on CapEx and O&M, so the Florida grid hardening plan, that you just ﬁled, is that already reﬂected in the ﬁve-year CapEx plan, I think it is. But I just want to conﬁrm that?","So, Michael. We updated in February, about 1.5 billion in the Florida, a Florida ﬁve-year plan and that is consistent with what we ﬁled in the grid hardening plan. You will see incremental capital beyond the ﬁve years because this has put forward a 10-year plan and we will provide those updates in the years to come.     That's right. In February capital plan was increased 12% and the Florida, Grid mod was a signiﬁcant part of the increase."
"All right. And just to be a dead horse on the O&M reductions, is there a ballpark estimate that you can give us for how much is deferral into the maintenance and how much more permanent, 25% is it more permanent, 50% permanent.","Michael, at this point, I don't have a range to share with you. I think that's been a topic of interest, and as we go into the second quarter and begin our more earnest planning for 2021, I think we'll be in a better position to talk about that. But our objective will be to make as much   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   sustainable as we can in this environment, but I don't have a speciﬁc on deferral versus sustainable at this point.     Yeah. And I think we want to look at how the assets operates and think about their performance under the revised operations and so forth where we're headed. And that will impact as well."
"A related question, Steve you mentioned, the idea that you have headroom from lower O&M, of the more capital improvement, do you see the opportunity to convert some of these OpEx cuts and once the crisis is over into a higher rate base and CapEx growth plan?","Well, we certainly always look at putting our ﬁnancial plan together keeping in mind impacts on customer rates. And so to the extent you can reduce O&M costs that those give you that headroom there, we have a robust dataset of capital opportunities, return capital away each year when we go through our budgeting process. So given our scope and scale, the breadth of our grid. We have plenty of opportunities to do those kind of things, Mike."
"And also, since the progress rate cases still has a record, that's still open, is it possible to incorporate some of this COVID cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms or anything else you're thinking about there, possible to incorporate that into that space.","So, Michael. We're looking at the appropriate way to handle the Carolinas in light of the fact that the cases have yet to get a hearing. I don't have anything speciﬁc to share on that plan right now, but we are reporting the cost of those for the North Carolina commission and to the state into South Carolina and we'll make the appropriate ﬁlings and incorporate in the rate case, if that makes sense or and/or whatever way makes sense, just too early on that one."
"Got you. Okay, that's all I have now. Stay safe, guys. Thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"I just want to come to the O&M side with a slightly diﬀerent I guess. If I recall, it seems like spending on items such as vegetation management accelerated in 4Q '19. So just trying to think through how much cost savings you kind of banked last year, that could be used against this year and was any of that contingency kind of already utilized in the ﬁrst quarter?","You're right, in 2019, our agility programs worked in the other direction. We had a favorable year and we accelerated some useful expenses into 2019. We have veg management is one area where we had about $0.04 that we pulled into 2019. As I recall, that was baked into our plans and our forecast and so forth. And the ability to do those kind of things is very useful to us. That's already baked into the numbers that you're seeing at this point, but that helps us achieve and get into our range, that dexterity between calendar years."
"Got it. That's helpful. That's it from me, thanks.","Thank you, Jeremy.  Operator  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions and answers. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Well, thank you, Derek. And thanks to all who joined today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. And I just want to take this opportunity to thank the employees at Duke Energy. I'm extraordinarily proud of the work that's underway with new safety protocols to do the business as usual, but also to serve our customers well.
