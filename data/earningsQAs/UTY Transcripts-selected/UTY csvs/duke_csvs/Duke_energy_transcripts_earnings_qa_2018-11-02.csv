Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Claire for Julien here.,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hi, Claire. And how are you?     Good morning."
Hi. Doing well. Thanks for taking my question. My ﬁrst is just on ACP. What is your expectation on timing to fund that additional CapEx need? And how will it be funded? And what are you anticipating in the returns on ACP now are [ph]?,"So Claire, I'll take returns ﬁrst. We expect this return to be consistent with other regulated investments. And so we're comfortable with where we are on return, and I would think about the ﬁnancing of ACP is being managed through the overall ﬁnancing of the company, and then we do intend to put project ﬁnancing in place at the time the project goes in-service."
"Okay. It doesn't really have much of a bearing on your FFO to debt metrics, just conﬁrming that?","We're committed to our FFO to debt metrics, Claire, and I think we've share this ranges with you in previous calls. The cost increase for ACP, our responsibility is about half of that amount and we believe we have tools within our companies to manage through that transition."
"Got it. That's helpful. And just turning over to renewables as well, at this point, what do you think -- what you'd you estimate the market out there to be a potential or expected proceeds? And how would your use of proceeds work?","Claire, we're very early in the process. What I'll share is that, there has been a strong interest. We've been watching this market for some time and are very familiar with it. The use of proceeds, I think we're too early to talk speciﬁcally about that. We haven't earmarked proceeds for any speciﬁc purpose. And of course, we'll update you as the sale process continues and give you a closer look at a ﬁnancing plan as we come to the street in February."
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. Would it be fair to just view it as oﬀsetting incremental debt issuances or any kind of other funding internally?,"I wouldn't be that speciﬁc at this point, Claire. We just launched the process, so we need to work through it in order to have a sense of where the market is, the proceeds, the timing and all of those things. So, that's where we are at this point."
Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
"Good morning, guys. Thank you.","Hi, Jon.     Good morning."
"Just one quick thing. It looks like, if I look at trailing 12 months numbers, the midpoint of the new 2018 range would suggest a slightly down fourth quarter. Can you remind us what type of things would support that?","I think, as we go into the fourth quarter, you're looking at milder weather and that impact there will pick up gas distribution business. I don't think there's anything unusual that we're looking at in the fourth quarter. Some of the variations per quarter are hard to predict, tax optimization eﬀorts as an example that came through in the third quarter, in certain years they've come through in a fourth quarter.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So I wouldn't look to anything negative that's occurring necessarily in the fourth quarter, Jonathan.     And the only special thing I'd point to Jonathan is, Michael, it's in the fourth quarter. The strong hit in October. So we'll be addressing Michael in the fourth quarter."
"Got you. And then, just on industrial growth you ﬂagged last quarter that you're expecting some of the temporary eﬀects to start working on to numbers, and it looks like that happened. But what do you feel is -- it's your underlying industrial sales growth number.","I think the underlying industrial sales growth number will continue to improve as we move out and lap, if you will, some of the unique probations there. We saw very strong industrial growth for this particular quarter as I mentioned across the entire enterprise of 1.8%. I don't know if we're going to see that as an ongoing mechanism -- ongoing number going forward, but we do see strength in our residential customers, a good bit of diversity across the enterprise. I don't have a full year number, I think the overall 0.5% is very solid but that combines residential with it and some commercial as well.  So no speciﬁc number yet on what I'd see industrial on a run rate but it's improving on the 12- month carrying. And I think, that will continue for a few quarters."
"Yeah. My question really Steve was, is the growth -- the improvement is just the lapping of the outages or is it actually underlying growth as well?","I think, we're seeing some underlying growth as well with it."
"Okay. And then, can you just remind us what is the sales growth assumption overall that underpins your comments on guidance and getting to the high end of 4% to 6% in 2020-plus?","Again, we're looking at 0.5% sales growth, weather normal across our footprint, and that's all customer classes. We continue to think, that's a reasonable number to bake in to our forecasting over our longer-term plans.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Great. Thank you, guys.","Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  Thank you. We'll now move on to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse."
"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Hi, Michael.     Hello."
So just a follow-up on Jon's question. It looks like growth -- sales growth is actually continuing to improve and we've seen that for several quarters now and you're thinking that it might continue going forward. At what point do you think you might start considering increasing the projected growth that's embedded in guidance from 0.5% to something little higher?,"Michael, I think we'll continue to watch. We've been surprised to the upside, which is a good thing. But we believe, 0.5% assumption is good -- really established the parameters around our cost structure and the way we manage the business. For every positive piece of economic news, there is something on the horizon, whether it's tariﬀs or rising interest rates and other things. So we're really comfortable at 0.5% now and hope to surprise to the upside."
"Got you. And the hurricane costs for Hurricane Michael and also for Hurricane Florence, is there anything else that's been going on? Those are being deferred right now and do you have a deferral order? Can you just remind me, sorry if I missed that earlier.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We will make application for the oﬃcial deferral order in the near term. We are in the third quarter. We incurred the costs associated with Hurricane Florence. And as I said, we've deferred $370 million of the O&M cost related to that, and the deferrals based upon past history and practice. We'll make those oﬃcial ﬁlings later this year."
"And as you get ready for next year's rate cases in North Carolina and also for -- talking to the state legislators about good modernization. Do you think that the, it would seem to me like an increasing frequency of hurricanes in your territory and throughout the Southeast. Is that being factored into the discussions or has that improved the climate for good modernization going forward?","Yeah. Michael, I would say, those storms have been a signiﬁcant issue here in the Carolina. It's just the impact on the Eastern part of the state and there is a lot of interest to invest in infrastructure to support that region and to mix more of investments to position the state for the future. So, I think hardening and resiliency is something that makes a lot of sense and we're of course developing projects that we believe would support the infrastructure and the state, taking lessons learned from these storms but also looking at other areas of our grid that we think modernization could beneﬁt customers."
"Thanks a lot, Lynn.","Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.     Hi, Greg."
"Good morning. I have a -- going back to a lot of questioning from earlier, you're doing well this year. The midpoint of guidance is $4.75 and then using a $4.60 base, and I'm looking at slide 11, you're saying you expect the compound annual growth rate to be 4% through 2019. And then the compound annual growth rate not the incremental growth rate but the compound annual growth rate to more like 5% or 5.5% as you get into 2022. I just wanted to make sure that I'm looking at that correctly. You're using a compounding function, not a year-over-year function, correct?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","That's right. And so, Greg, what we're talking about is 4% compound number for 2019 and then by 2020 we believe we'll be up in that 5% -- mid-to-high end of the range."
"And that's my point. That's my point, because 5% compound from $4.60 in 2017 to 2020 would put you $0.10 above Street consensus, $5.33 a share and it would puts you $0.15 above Street consensus in 2021. And so, I just and the Street has been consistently -- me included, to be frank with you more cynical about your growth opportunities as it pertains to your guidance. And so, what gives you the conﬁdence that the compounding eﬀect of the investments and the changes you're making in the business can get you there? And what do you think the diﬀerences between Street expectations and your aspirations?","Greg, I would say that the capital plan that we've put in front of the Street is well with the recovery mechanisms that go with that, give us the conﬁdence to deliver the results. And of course, cost management, load growth are also a part of that ﬁxture. And we believe, we've been consistently demonstrating the ability to grow the company. This is the second full year of the portfolio that we now operate. Historically we had some noise with international and other things. We're now two years in the rear view mirror.  And my expectation is, as we continue to execute, there will be greater conﬁdence that we will deliver what we've set out. And so we're proud of the fact that we're delivering what we set out in terms of commitments this year. We delivered last year. We've adjusted with tax reform in a way that has been constructive not only to investors but to the balance sheet. And so, our assignment is to keep executing in a way that it grows the company and maintain that balance sheet for the future, and that is our focus."
"Okay. And how necessary or important to the execution of your plan is, the grid modernization, capital plan roll out in North Carolina and getting recovery mechanisms even through a legislative guidance to the commission or from the commission that are a more contemporaneous return framework?","Grid investment is an important part of the strategy, Greg. And certainly North Carolina is important to the results of Duke Energy because of the scale of those utilities, both DEC and DEP. As we've shared with you, we believe, we have parallel paths to pursue a legislative path or increased frequency of regulatory ﬁlings in order to achieve our ﬁnancial results. We do believe with the value proposition that grid investment represents, including the storm hardening that we just talked about. But a recovery mechanism that is certain over a two year to three year period with predictable investment and predictable impact to customers with value that goes   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   with those predictable increases as a compelling business proposition. And we'll continue to pursue as I said in both the legislative and regulatory process."
"Lynn, thank you. Take Care.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen.     Good morning, Stephen."
I wanted to go back to the ACP process given that the cost is going up. I wondered if you can just talk through the regulatory process for potentially adjusting the required revenue upward? Or should we assume that it's relatively unlikely that revenue will be adjusted upward. I just wanted to circle back on that?,"Stephen, I think we are in discussions with customers in connection with this partial in-service, trying to establish interim pricing. And our objective always is to ﬁnd the right balance between meeting customer needs and delivering beneﬁts, and then returns to investors. We have raised that price once and received approval of those prices. We believe, this investment still represents the most cost-eﬀective solutions for our customers and we will continue to be in dialogue with customers as we go forward.  So our focus right now is on partial in-service and establishing interim prices and we'll just continue to stay in touch with customers as the project continues.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Understood. And then just further on system hardening. I think you've given us some good color as to how you're thinking about that. But I'm trying to get a better sense for the path to getting approval. So let's just say that you go through your assessment and you determine that an additional amount of capital is needed.  Could you talk a little bit more to the diﬀerent paths that we should be thinking about in terms of getting approval for that spending? It just, it seems like obviously there probably are needs for signiﬁcant additional hardening. How do we think about translating that into regulatory or legislative outcomes?","Stephen, I think, it depends on the path that we take. I think in a legislative path, a stakeholder process will be important to have discussions around the type of investment, the timing et cetera. You may recall, we've reached a partial settlement with certain environmental stakeholders as part of the DEC case that set a term, a cap, pilots for target undergrounding and then speciﬁc investments around batteries, EV et cetera -- self-optimizing technologies et cetera.  So I think as you think about a multiyear rate plan or if you were to think about some other method to establish a multiyear investment program, there would be some degree of sharing those investments and agreement. We don't contemplate that we would necessarily be required pre-approval on individual process, because we're tracking about a number of small things that accumulate every time. But we of course are early in the process of making those changes.  Under a pure regulatory path, you make the investments and demonstrate beneﬁts and those become a part of your cost of service and you would think about this in a traditional way. Let me just close by saying, we are in discussion around these investments and then beneﬁts they can deliver to customers both with regulators and with stakeholders, and that process will continue. We think those investments are very important to the state and to our customer base. And so those conversations will continue."
Very good. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Now we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Steve."
"Hi, Lynn. So just a question ﬁrst on the quarter. I think in a couple of the businesses you mentioned the impact of tax rate partially due to the tax law change. Could you maybe separate out tax law change versus other tax items just so we have an idea on that?","Yeah. What I might mention here on tax law changes is, as we had some ﬁxed price contracts at our wholesale business, gas and electric, whereby the pricing doesn't change necessarily due to tax changes. So that brings some beneﬁts in. And then there's just tax optimization working through the various structures that we have in place across our footprint and provides some beneﬁts. I don't have a breakout right now -- between those but those are the two factors that lead to it."
"Okay, that's ﬁne. And then I guess just on the renewables in North Carolina. My recollection is, those were not necessarily in your capital plan if you end up winning some of those but I'm not sure if anything else has kind of changed in the plan going back to really this year. So just, if we see you win a handful of projects there, should we think of that all being incremental or in the context of kind of the whole -- the plan, maybe something haven't gone away.","I would think about it more within the context of the plan, Steve. We did have renewable capital in our plan in February. And actually the way we approach this is, we put all of the capital on the commercial business recognizing that it could either be in the utility or the commercial business depending on how we win but we put the capital in the commercial renewable segment.  So given the timeline of 589 and the fact we'll know more after the ﬁrst of the year, we'll continue to update capital and share that with you in February. But I would think about it at this point as part of the overall capital plan that we shared with you."
Okay. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question Praful Mehta with Citi.
"Thanks so much. Hi, guys.",Good morning.     Hello.
"So maybe ﬁrst touch on the storms. I know, you're deferring some of the costs. But in terms of the cash ﬂow, is there an ability to fund some of that cash with securitization? Or if there is an -- how do you fund or does it put any kind of pressure on the credit metrics or diﬀerent funding GAAP given the storm cost that you're facing right now?","Praful, we are ﬁnancing in the short term with commercial paper, short-term ﬁnancing methods. And we will convert to longer term at the right time. We'll be ﬁling as Steve indicated for deferral at the end of the year and we'd like to match long-term ﬁnancing with the recovery mechanisms that are in place.  We were always mindful of the impact to customers. And so we have tools like excess deferred taxes that have not yet been fully dealt with in the Carolinas securitization. As you mentioned, it is always a tool. So our plans will continue to mature on this over the balance of this year into next."
"Got you. And does commercial renewable and the sale of commercial renewable, will that ﬁt neatly into it o does it happen to ﬁt into it or is there a plan to kind of use some of those proceeds for this?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We haven't earmarked proceeds from commercial renewable at this point, Praful. Early in the process, we don't yet know what the value is going to be, timing et cetera but you can think about that as a tool, right -- within the company at large, an inﬂow of cash. So we'll consider all of these things and really be in a position to give more feedback on speciﬁc ﬁnancing plans in February."
"Got you. That's helpful. And then ﬁnally just following up a little bit on Greg's question on long- term growth. I wanted to understand, you had mentioned earlier, the impact of tariﬀs and other macro factors that could impact your growth as you think about it longer term. I guess, to achieve your long-term target, what are the variables we should be thinking about or tracking on a more macro level that we think -- that you think could impact your ability to execute on the 4% to 6%?","Praful, those comments were within the context of, why not raise 0.5%? So we believe, 0.5% is a very good planning assumption as we look at the proﬁle of our business where we're located geographically, the attractive nature of the service territories et cetera. But large economic shocks if we were to ever get to that point would be something we need to check and adjust but there's nothing unique to Duke Energy as I talk about that.  So as I think about long-term growth, 0.5% is the load growth assumption, aggressive cost management will continue to be a part of the equation. And then the capital plan we've put in front of you with rate increases or recovery mechanisms that are in place across our jurisdiction will be the other driver."
"Awesome. Very helpful. Thank you, Lynn.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.     Hi, Shahriar.     Hi, Shahriar.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Hi. Good morning, guys. You touched on most of my questions, but let me just -- can you just elaborate on 589 real quick and sort of what's embedded in your plan? Because, I thought prior communication really focused on having a very little -- somewhat of a base assumption around what you could win. And I guess, the way I'm trying to come up with this is, there's 2.7 gigawatts potentially in the state that can be procured. This 30% that you guys can essentially win but there's no cap on how much you guys can acquire from developers that are likely looking to recycle their capital, right?  So if you kind of look at the opportunity -- it could breach well over $1 billion to $2 billion of opportunity. So I guess my question is, how much of this is embedded in your plan? Is it sort of a very little base assumption? I'm just trying to ﬁgure out the scale here, because I thought this was predominantly incremental.","Shahriar, I appreciate that question. We did put an assumption in but I think to use your terminology, it's going to be closer to our base assumption than it is to -- we buy everything assumption. And as I've said a moment ago, we're beginning to -- we're early in the process, the bids are in, the administrator will be reviewing this. We'll begin to have some visibility to this process in the ﬁrst quarter and that would be the time for us to update. We see the nature of the projects, we see the returns that are implied and I think they represent great opportunities for us but we'll be evaluating those returns against the other investment opportunities we have and making good decisions about it.  So to close, I would say that the capital was in there is more of a base assumption."
"Got it. And then just let me ask you assuming that the ultimate outcome is better than your base assumption. Do you see any need to -- for incremental equity as far as looking at additional opportunities around solar? So, i.e., if you do better than your base assumption, you acquire developers that are looking to recycle, is there any instance where you think you may need to raise equity as a result?","Shahriar at this point we're comfortable with our plans we put in front of you on equity. The equity raise we did this year are ongoing assumptions around about $350 million of equity a year. We think that positions the company really well, strike the right balance between balance sheet and growth.  And so, I would think about that incremental capital is being evaluated as part of our total investment plan and we'll continue as I said to provide updates on where -- what we think the future holds. But right now, I'm comfortable with the equity plan we have in place and our   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   ability to absorb upside on the renewables as we look at the total collection of capital that we are planning to spend as a company.     And I'd add that the use of tax, equity ﬁnancing and bank leverage and so forth helps on minimizing the investment on commercial renewables."
"Got it. Thanks, Steven; and see you soon.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Thank you. Good morning.,Good morning.
"Good morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify the race [ph] in the 2018 midpoint of $0.05, is that all primarily driven by better weather or was there something else in there?","Ali, I would say weather and volumes on the upside really being oﬀset by storm expense is the way I would look at it. So we've had very strong weather and volumes but we've also have the hurricanes to absorb."
"I got you. Okay. And secondly, next year, Lynn, when you all update your plans et cetera, is there a thought would you move your base year to 2018 to build out your growth rate targets? Or what are you thinking about there?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Ali, we haven't made a decision around base year, we've been working oﬀ of 2017. As you know we continue to emphasize that as outlined on slide 11. So we will make that evaluation as we go forward but you should be comfortable that we are talking about a range that works oﬀ of the 2017 base."
"Yeah. And then also in terms of the longer-term growth outlook, just remind us again sort of embedded in your long-term 4% to 6% CAGR, how much reduction if any in regulatory lag is assumed in there? Or is it sort of CapEx rate base driven with earned ROEs relatively constant. Can you just remind us what beyond ROE trends?","A couple of things, I'd point out. We've got a long history of earning well on our regulated rate basis -- 10%, 10.5% range through periods of having rate cases, not having rate cases, we've been able to utilize cost eﬃciencies, expansion of wholesale and rate cases to make that happen through various diﬀering circumstances. There certainly is an element of lag as you build your investment base between rate cases. That's natural to occur. It will vary depending on the regulatory mechanisms in place and the timeframes between rate cases. But we're working to reconstruct the regulatory recovery mechanisms and minimize lags as much as possible."
"Okay. Steve, so just to be clear, that ramp up -- the implied ramp up in growth from 2020 onwards, that's all being driven by the way you're looking at your CapEx proﬁle? You're not assuming a pickup in earned ROE, helping you in '20 and beyond?","Well. I was looking at the investment base growing and our ability to convert that into revenues in the regulatory processes. In addition to organic load growth and our renewables business, all of that combine. But on the regulated side, it's the investments and the ability to eﬃciently incorporate that into revenues at typical allowed types of returns as we have demonstrated our ability to do for many years."
Understood. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our ﬁnal question today comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I look forward to --","Hi, Michael."
"Hi, Lynn. I have an easy one. You ﬁled in South Carolina, can you talk to us a little bit about just your main request in South Carolina and whether you're actually trying to seek any kind of more structural change in ratemaking there? Or is it kind of a traditional rate case? And then B, how should we think about where you're likely -- the cadence of rate case ﬁlings between now and maybe the end of 2019 in terms of where you're likely to ﬁle?","Michael, I would think about the South Carolina cases as mirroring in many ways what we try to accomplish in North Carolina. So the same drivers and approach trying to focus on grid investment but also receiving recovery to historic investments that will be the same approach in South Carolina.  We did point out in this call that we were successful in achieving a deferral of the grid investments which we view as a positive step in South Carolina. And then in terms of other rate cases, Florida will automatically reset with the Citrus, the solar and the grid investment. Midwest also will continue to reset, but you can expect us to ﬁle cases next year. Piedmont potentially, Indiana potentially and then with the in-service date of Western Carolinas. That's a good date to watch for the Duke Energy progress case."
"Got it. Thank you. And I guess last one, how do you think about the cadence of O&M in 2018 relative to what you originally expect? And I'm trying to think about it excluding storm impact. And then, the opportunity set for being able to manage it down further in 2019.","In 2018, we're tracking to be right at our target for O&M exclusive of the storm cost. And again our broad target for our O&M is to keep it ﬂat throughout our planning horizon. And I think we have the capabilities to do that -- to do better than that as we advance capabilities and data analytics and rolling out digital technology capabilities across our footprint. With our scope and scale, I think we have great abilities to control O&M."
"Got it. Thank you, Steven. Thank you, Lynn. See you out in California.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","All right.  Operator  Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for additional or closing remarks.     Great, thank you. And thank you again for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming EEI Conference next week. So, thanks again.  Operator  Thank you.
