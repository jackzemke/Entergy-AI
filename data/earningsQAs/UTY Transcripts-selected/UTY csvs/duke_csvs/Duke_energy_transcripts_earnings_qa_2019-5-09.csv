Question,Answer
"Hi, guys, good morning.","Hi, Michael.     Good morning."
"With the one-time true up on the gas side, on the gas midstream investment side that would -- is that included in your -- are you including that in your ongoing guidance after $5 number 4% to 6% oﬀ that?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Yes, that's in our adjusted number. We often have adjustments and true ups in the tax arena with taxing authorities. We typically included them in adjusted earnings."
"And that would imply that there is some other positive oﬀset that's ongoing, right, that makes up for that, I guess?","Yeah, Michael, the point I would make is, this is the ﬁrst quarter of the year, we started with some weakness and weather in volumes. We expect those to turn around a bit in the second and third quarter as we look at the strength of the economy. So I would ask you to think about the full complexion of all the businesses we operate over the full year and we will have true-ups, whether it's in tax or in regulatory. These are things that happened over the course of the year and in developing our plans, we always assume that something will develop as the year progresses. So I'd put it in that context.     Yes. So we've typically not updated within the range till after the third quarter, when we get a feel for where things are going in the weather in that particular quarter."
Got you. Okay. What was the exact size of that?,It was about $0.06.
"Okay, all right, thank you.",Thanks.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Hi, Julien.     Good morning."
"Hey, so perhaps just to focus ﬁrst on the coal ash side of the equation, obviously you've had some developments of late, to which you've already referred to in your prepared remarks, I wanted to follow up a little bit on understanding the range of outcomes and the timeline for providing an update of the capital outlook just based on the appeals process that you described, the DEQ. It seems like there are some big decisions that have been made of late and obviously taken up seemingly by the governor, et cetera. Can you describe how some of these big variables could move and what that means for this incremental capital?","Sure. And let me break it down, Julien, see if this answers your question and we can continue the conversation. The appeal process for the order will take 9 months to 12 months, there has been a series of dates established by the hearing oﬃcer, the administrative law judge. We expect that those dates could move a little bit as people respond to whether or not they'll be prepared. But I think 9 months to 12 months is a good planning assumption for the appeal process. I think in terms of capital, we've already begun to do some work on the closure costs and as we look at the next ﬁve years, we believe the order, if it stands as written, would add about $200 million to $400 million over the ﬁve-year period. And the reason it is relatively modest is because it will take time for permitting, for ﬁnding the land, for constructing the landﬁlls and all of the other cost, dewatering and other things that would occur under any closure method. Those are already included in our capital plans.  So you should think about the majority of this impact being after the ﬁve-year period, giving us plenty of time to evaluate how that ﬁts into aﬀordability, reliability, customer rates and so on. And we'll just continue to update you as it moves through the legal process, and as we learn more moving forward ."
"Excellent. Just quickly back on the (inaudible) project, appreciate your prepared remarks there as well. Just wanted to understand a little bit on the timeline and process here. Obviously, you need to make strategic decisions and sourcing generation there or supplying and generation anyway, I'd be curious on the timeline there to -- that you need to come to terms. And then separately, just in terms of the -- with respect to the jeopardy argument and the Biological order here. How do you think about timeline and potential overlap with respect to permits and re- routing there as well, given the park permitting issues.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Sure. And you know, Julien, i would point to two things, maybe three things that we're monitoring. So the Biological Opinion Incidental Take hearing is today and as you noted, there are discussions around impacts to the Biological Opinion, this is Rusty patch Bumble Bee that you'll probably learn more about, [ph] Court renders their opinion and then a number of questions around the Incidental Take statement which are really challenges that are coming in front of the court for a second time. So these are species that we understand well.  We would expect an order within 90 days, and if there is work to do as found by the Court then we would expect that to occur over a 1 month to 2 month period. I'm just estimating that within the construct of what we've seen before from the Court, but we'll know more when the order comes out and have an opportunity to give you more speciﬁcs on that. So that's the one thing I would be watching for. The second is the Appalachian trail that is progressing, a petition seeking the Supreme Court review will be ﬁled this summer. We are optimistic the governor -- the government will support, and so we'll see milestones over the course of the summer on that item.  And then as you would expect, we are continuing discussions with customers, which are important part of this project, on the status, on the approach around phase construction, phase I, phase II Mountain, Buckingham South, revised timeline, revised costs and those discussions will continue over the course of the year as well. So we'll continue to update you on timeline, we understand, we've got some decisions to make depending on how all of these legal challenges play out, but we will continue to update you as we -- more and more and have more transparency on when construction will begin. We are planning that we'll be able to begin construction later this year."
Thank you very much.,"Best of luck.     Thank you, Julien.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Good morning, Steve."
"Hi. So on the -- ﬁrst of all, on the South Carolina orders that you referenced, how much coal ash was disallowed in those orders?","There was an amount mentioned in the order of $470 million for -- in the DEC order, I have not looked at the most recent directive. And again I would emphasize, I want to wait till I see the full order and that $470 million number is a system-wide number. So the allocation would have to occur to that number. I want to look at the full number."
Okay.,"And i'm seeing now that's about $330 million is in the DEP order. Again that's a system-wide number.     So you should be thinking Steve kind of in the 20% to 30% range for DEP and -- for DEC and, 10% for DEP."
Also those numbers.  Okay.,"That's right, that's right."
Okay. And then can the Commission still change it's view or they just -- before they put the written orders or the written order's just getting the detail around what they've already decided?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"So, we think about it this way, Steve. I think the order we're expecting to come out, kind of mid month, will be further documentation around the directive and then we have 10 days to ﬁle a request for reconsideration, which we intend to do. And then the Commission has about 20 days to respond to that request for reconsideration. So I think it would be that 20-day period where potential reconsideration of this -- the terms of the directive could occur. We are anxious to read the order because we have very limited information now on all of the elements here and the real depth of the legal reasoning that underpins us. So that is the work that remains, and we should expect to see those, as I said a moment ago, within a few weeks. After that reconsideration period, that's when we would evaluate appeal. And so then you'd move through an appeal process with a longer timeline, of course, to work through the court system."
"Okay. And I know this is not directly related, but maybe indirectly, does this aﬀect any interest you might have in Santee Cooper?","Look Steve, we've been a part of the process, the competitive process. I think we've talked about that before, we believe we have a lot to bring to the table for the state, whether it's an outright purchase or management of those assets we've operated in the state for 100 years. Legislation is moving through the state, which we believe will establish a process in a way forward. That would include additional due diligence and other things, but I think it's fair to say that we will closely evaluate further investment in the state in light of these directives. But those decisions are yet to be made. We've had a long history in South Carolina. It's been a constructive jurisdiction, but I think with this directive we need to learn a little bit more."
"Okay. And then one separate topic question just on the North Carolina legislation. Could you just -- is there any timeline for House ruling on it, has the Governor had a view, and just how would it actually then turn from a law and are being implemented in a case?","You know, Steve there is no speciﬁc timeline for the legislature in North Carolina. So, you can expect it to move through the House over the coming weeks. It's really hard to forecast how long that will take, we believe the strong bipartisan support and sponsorship has been favorable certainly getting it out of the Senate and moving it to the House. We have strong bipartisan sponsorship in the House. We believe the policy is very sound. So this is one where we will continue to update as progress is made, but it's diﬃcult to forecast a speciﬁc timing for the legislation. In terms of implementation, having a legislation in place allows us to include innovative solutions as we move forward with future rate cases, but the timing and approach for that is yet to be determined. So, more to come and we'll, as I said before, keep everyone updated as the session progresses.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Okay, thank you.",Thank you .  Operator  We'll take our next question from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Good morning and thank you.,Hello.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Caroline."
"Hi, Okay, great. I was just hoping, I mean Steve actually just asked a few of my questions, but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how the South Carolina PSC directives might impact your longer term outlook does it -- does it have -- does it push you to the lower end of the growth rate, if it were the 9.5% ROE were to be approved? I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that.","And you know Caroline, i think when we think about the scale that South Carolina represents to Duke, we believe we're still positioned to grow within the range of 4% to 6%, that ROE signal though does indicate to us an important factor in allocating capital as we go forward. And so when I talk about the growth capital and discretionary capital and other things, we will evaluate the placement of that capital based on where it's attractive to invest and that's a part of our ﬁve- year planning process and we'll have more to say about that both as this appeal progresses and as we share additional reﬁnements to the ﬁve-year capital plan.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"All right, thanks very much. And then I know you sounded a very conﬁdent tone on the ability to achieve your outlook for the Commercial Renewables business, but I was just wondering if you could just help us understand the -- the earnings trajectory this year, as how you kind of close the gap between the $13 million earned in Q1 and the $230 million targeted for the full year?","You know, Caroline, it's a -- that's a good question and a couple of things I would point to. So if you think about our renewables business between operating and wind assets, it's about 50% of what we expect. And there was a slow start to the year for wind resource. So the $13 million, you should not consider to be a normal run rate, but it was reﬂected or impacted by weather. And then we will bring projects on in the second quarter and later in the year, solar primarily that will impact those numbers. So you've got a shaping issue on Commercial Renewables that, you know really leads to the question that you're asking this morning. Steve, would you add to that.?     Yes, that's correct, Lynn. And Caroline, we're going to bring a couple of projects and they're going to boost the earnings this year, get it up above the $200 million level and we've got good line-of-sight as Lynn said to 2019 and 2020 earnings and good line-of-sight overall to 60% of the earnings. The projects we'll bring in the early part of our ﬁve-year plan, the solar projects are going to have income recognized in the one to two-year period. But just to give you a ﬂavor for it, we've got a lot of longer-term win proﬁle that we're building as well and a metric to think about is for us to keep the net income level above $200 million through the ﬁve- year plan, given on what we've already built in place, we need to close about 250 to 300 megawatts of solar per year and that's on the one to two-year recognition schedule. And I think that's very doable. When you look at the amount of megawatts that we've put together already in 2019 and the CPRE process that we''ll continue throughout, i think we have a good capability in earnings trajectory in Commercial Renewables."
Thanks very much. Appreciate it.,"Thank you, Caroline.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead."
Thanks so much. Hi guys.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Hey     Hi, Praful."
"Hi. So maybe just staying on Commercial Renewables. Congratulations on your asset transaction or the sale transaction. Just wanted to get a little bit more color in terms of, ﬁrstly, how competitive the process was, because there's a lot going on in that side? And two, why keep the tax assets, given you're unable to actually utilize them right now, given your tax proﬁle? Why do you decide to keep the tax assets as a part of that transaction?","Sure, Praful. A couple of comments here, it was a competitive process, we did seek bids and then narrowed it down to a shortlist and worked from there and Hancock became the best partner, providing the best overall value so it was quite a competitive process and a lot of interest from ﬁnancials and international global's and so forth. So we feel good about that process. And then regarding keeping the tax beneﬁts of these assets, Hancock does not have a tax appetite and what we found as you look out, the people that are pursuing the underlying PPA clash ﬂows, they're not looking for the tax attributes, people looking for the tax attributes are not looking for the underlying cash ﬂows. So, it's a logical matching here. So we'll maintain those tax beneﬁts as we move forward and we've utilized some of those tax beneﬁts to date, you can only sell what's remaining, so we'll still have those to keep in our portfolio."
"Understood. And is there any plan to do further sales in the Commercial Renewables side or do you think at this point, you kind of have the transaction done for at least the near-term?","Well Hancock has an option on some development projects that could provide further proceeds that have been deﬁned as part of this arrangement and we'll continue to look as we develop projects in the future, whether there is interest with our existing partner or others."
"Got you. Thanks. And then just ﬁnally on the eﬀective tax rate point, Q1 eﬀective tax rate was 9.6%, i'm assuming because of that one-time that you talked about, but just wanted to clarify that. And then also, longer term, do you still see the 12% to 14% as something that stays not just in '19. But going forward through your forecast or does that change over times?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","You're correct, Praful, the quarterly eﬀective tax rate of 9.6% was driven down by the booking of the tax adjustment and that won't recur in future quarters. I expect by the end of the year, we'll be within the 12% to 14% range. I don't want to try to handicap now all that's in front of us as to whether it's lower than that or where it would be, I'd stick with that for now."
Understood. Thanks so much guys.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Lynn and Steve, I apologize if you may have addressed this, I did come on a little late on the call. The ROEs that were set on the South Carolina, both the rate cases of 9.5% are below obviously what you previously had and below what your budget is for this year of earning 10% to 10.5% overall in Carolina ROEs. Just wondering how that impacts or what kind of headwind, earnings headwind does that create and what are some of the oﬀsets against that?","Ali the -- the ROE that you referenced, of course, was disappointing. There were constructive elements to the order, the equity pad [ph] at 53%, the amortization of excess deferred taxes, and so as we look at '19 earnings, we always plan for a range of outcomes and believe that the results of this case ﬁt within our planning. But as we talked about on the call and in some of the subsequent questions, we do intend to request rehearing on the coal ash and the ROE item as well as potentially some others and we'll also consider an appeal of the case and the ROE will have an impact on the way we think about additional growth and discretionary investment."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I see, and linked to that, Lynn, I mean from historical cases of precedence, do you ﬁnd that the ROEs that gets set in South Carolina, that you'll see much inﬂuence when North Carolina rate cases are resolved and ROEs are set, is that a good correlation between the two?","In my expectation, Ali, for North Carolina is that they will continue the good work that they've done over many years acting in an independent manner, reviewing the evidence in front of them and we would expect the commission in North Carolina to continue to behave in that fashion. So I think it's premature to reach a conclusion on cases yet to be ﬁled in North Carolina on how South Carolina is going to inﬂuence now."
I see. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our last question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Yeah, hey guys, thanks for taking my question.","Hi, Micheal.     Hi, Micheal."
"Hi, Lynn, Steve. Real quick, and you've touched on this, I think a little bit, the attorney general's lawsuit. I know you're probably limited in what you can say, given its ongoing litigation. Is that just dealing with the last rate case and how that rate case deal with coal ash recovery or is that dealing with the broader policy of what is the level, what is the process for coal ash recovery or is the coal ash recovery something that should be recovered at all? I'm a little confused about just kind of the maintenant [ph] of that case and whether it's just a one-oﬀ of the last rate case that got resolved by the commission or is that more kind of a policy-focused one longer term?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   It's the former, Michael. It is an appeal of the rate case. And so I would have you look at it in that context, because that's exactly what it is and we believe the order out of North Carolina was very well written, very strongly supported on the regulatory laws in North Carolina and we'll be vigorously defending that case as you would expect. The timing on that is -- brieﬁng will occur during 2019, we expect the hearing late this year, early next and then potentially decision in a six month or so time frame. You may remember the last appeal from the Attorney General in North Carolina was on ROE in our last case and that took about two years."
"Got it and then follow-up question, a little bit on Florida. Legislation just passed, it's sitting on the Governor's desk in terms of storm hardening, how do you think that would impact your capital spend plans in Florida if the governor signs? And given your rate agreement, now would you still qualify for incremental rate increases tied to that legislation in the near term, next 2 years to 4 years, or do you have to wait for the rate deal to kind of expire or roll oﬀ?","You know, Michael, the way I would think about it is it's a very solid policy and legislation that I think will serve Florida well, particularly as you think about storm hardening and resiliency. Our multi-year rate plan runs through 2021. So I would think about that legislation as being impactful to our business after 2021. It really gives us an opportunity to look at how to extend and continue important energy delivery investment. You may recall, we've got $1.1 billion being deployed through now and 2021. This would set the context for more capital spending beyond that period."
"Got it. Thank you, Lynn. Thanks Steve.","Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  And then I'll turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Thank you, Allie, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy, and as always, our team is available for follow-on questions and look forward to seeing you in the near future. Thanks again for joining.
