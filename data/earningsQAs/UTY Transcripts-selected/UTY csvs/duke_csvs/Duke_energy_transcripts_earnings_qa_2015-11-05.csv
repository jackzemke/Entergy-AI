Question,Answer
Good morning.,"Good morning, Shahriar.     Good morning, Shahriar."
"So this morning you reiterated your 4% to 6% growth but oﬀ a higher yet to be determined 2016 base year, and you did drop that footnote you had in the second quarter around DEI potentially being a swing factor in your outlook. Steve, is this sort of what like you meant when you mentioned that Piedmont would deal with enhance your growth trajectory? Is it less concerns around DEI or sort of what's driving this increased conﬁdence?","Well, I think, what I would refer you to Shahriar is the slide we discussed 10, where we look at our core businesses when you isolate International with our core businesses they have grown consistently at 5% from 2013 through 2015, and we would expect that to continue. The International business has been volatile, it's moved from a $0.60 per year business to a $0.30. And that's been the challenge we've had to deal with in 2015. That's diﬃcult to overcome. So we believe rebasing in 2016 makes sense in the light of what International has done."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. And it includes Piedmont, right?","We expect to close Piedmont, Shahriar, towards the end of 2016 into 2017. You may recall from our announcement a week ago that we laid out a calendar, we will work as aggressively as we can to close it, but I think a year is a good planning assumption."
"Okay. Got it. And then just one last question on International, it's good to see the currencies becoming a little bit less of an issue, the hydrology is improving. We haven't heard much on this lately. Is there any sort of incremental data points around the Brazilian government potentially looking at providing some sort of a retreat to the hydrogenerators or just sort of the – kind of the dead movement?","There's been a lot of activity in this area, Shahriar. Recently, there was a technical note that was issued by an arm of the government and that's really just a document that summarizes discussions to date, a number of discussions are occurring. The government is targeting, issuing eﬀectively an executive order this calendar year, it remains uncertain exactly when, but that's their target. And what that order might say is not certain at this point either. So there is more work to be done here. I would say that in general, the views of people in the government and the regulators have been constructive with regard to generators in our position. So there is more to come there. In the meantime, the injunctions are still in eﬀect and that has provided some relief to us."
"That's very helpful. Thanks, Steve and Lynn.",Thank you.     Sure.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse.
"Hi, good morning, guys.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Good morning, Dan.     Hey, Dan."
"Hey, just taking up on slide 11 when you guys – you made the comment about the dividend trending higher than target payout ratio, but also wanting to keep with the long-term EPS growth rate. Can you just maybe translate what you're trying to signal in those comments, that seemed to be a little bit in conﬂict?","Dan, I would go back to Steve's comments on slide 10 with the intent to rebase oﬀ of 2016 and move it 4% to 6% from that point forward. We see the dividend trending slightly above 70% in the very near-term. And so, as I look at the strength of the dividend, the dividend is really driven by the underlying core business, which is growing quite well and given the investments we've put in place, we believe it will continue. And so, we have conﬁdence in growing it at that rate and allowing the payout ratio to trend up modestly in the short-term we think is a smart decision."
"Okay. And then on O&M, obviously you guys have done a good job as far as bringing down cost into the Progress acquisition. What kind of reductions do you see from here, because part of that 2016 drivers, the idea of bringing costs down. Is it a substantial reduction 2016 versus 2015 or is it more just absorbing inﬂation at this point?","No, we are still at work, Dan, on our plans and we're targeting to absorb inﬂation plus. And we think that's going to be a combination of a number of things that we build a strong foundation on, but we're going after productivity and eﬃciency. And the company, as you said, has demonstrated a great ability to control costs and we see even more potential into 2016."
"Okay. And then, I guess maybe the last one is just on kind of just calibrating the Commercial business, not to get too far ahead 2016. Commercial is now coming in below where you guys thought that the normal base line would be. Do you still feel comfortable with $100 million as your run rate from residual Commercial?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   This year, we've been impacted by wind resources, Dan. I think that's a theme that you've seen with others that have signiﬁcant renewable exposure. So, we expect a restoration of that to more normal levels as part of our planning for 2016. And then, we do intend to continue to deploy capital in a way that meets our return expectations, so we would expect to see some growth. I think over the long-term, the tax credits and other things will have to be evaluated. But we see ongoing momentum around renewables.     And we have committed projects for 2016 lined up as well to keep the growth going there, and also in our Commercial portfolio as you move forward, we will start to see earnings from our pipeline investments kick in as well."
"Okay. Just one last one on the load growth trends, you're kind of – you're below at the bottom end or a little bit below where you thought you'd be, even though customer growth's been pretty good this year. Are you having to reconsider what that long-term growth rate is? Is it 0% to 0.5% or do you think there is some discrete usage trends maybe around multifamily housing or something like that that's explaining why usage has been that much of a drag relative to customer growth?","Dan, I think, we've been working with a 0.5% to 1% for some time. And I think, a 0.5% seems to be the range that we're in and I think it's all the things you talked about. It's energy eﬃciency, it's housing patterns and even volatility in industrial. We'd had strong industrial growth and then a dial back in this quarter. So, what we are focused on as we kind of link this discussion to our cost structure, is planning a cost structure that can absorb that variability and also be positioned for modest, very low load growth, if that's the direction things continue to head."
"Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jon."
"Hi. I'd just like to understand a little better when you're talking about this rebase on 2016. And Steve, I'm not quite sure whether I've heard you right. Are you saying you anticipate growing at the 4% to 6% in – through 2016 and then, also oﬀ of 2016 or implicit within this concept to where rebase seems to be, the idea that maybe you won't or you want to reposition the range a little bit. I just want to understand what you're saying on 2016, when you made that statement?","What we're looking at Jonathan is, we will set a base year anchoring year oﬀ of 2016. And then you would see 4% to 6% growth from there. And we think we've got to do that given the changes in International. We think it's stabilized, and it's moved from again a $0.60 business to $0.30 -ish business going forward. So we'll rebase with 2016 as the anchor, we see 4% to 6% growth there underlined by the strong core business growth in the track history that it shows and some potential modest growth in International from that new lower level.     And so what I would add to that, Jonathan, if you look at the slide 10, you see the Regulated and the Commercial portfolio, the blue bar, that's the bar that's growing at 4% to 6%. And then you have an International business that's about $0.30 in 2015, that would add to that, and grow modestly. So that's the direction that we're trying provide here with expectations for 2016. And then we think from that base, we are in a position to grow at 4% to 6% going forward."
"Okay. Understood. Thank you. Could you maybe just, do you have an expectation currently on how Pension will look as a driver for next year just speciﬁcally or is it a little early to tell?","It's a little early to tell on Pension, you got to take a look at the discount rate right at year-end. And who knows where that will go, if the Fed raises rates or something that could have an impact on it. I don't think there would be any huge change that we're looking at in pension expense at this point. But again, whether being so sensitive to the discount rate, we'd – it's a little early to say precisely."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. I think that's good for me. Thank you, guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.
"Yes. Hi, good morning.","Hi, Steven.     Hi, Steven."
"Hey, hey. Hey, Lynn. So, couple of questions. I just – these International pressures are not new, and in the past, you talked about trying to work on a plan and things to oﬀset the International pressures. It just sounds to me like you just kind of change to – they just are what they are, and we're just resetting the base and then growing oﬀ better, because these are just became too much, is that fair to say what happened?","Steve, I would say slightly diﬀerently and in 2015, I think the team has done an extraordinary job of oﬀsetting what is happened in International. We started the year with an expectation they would deliver $345 million, and they are delivering just north of $200 million. And that's an execution on strategic initiatives more timely and that's been running the business well and taking the advantage of good weather and other things that have developed.  As we look forward, we did not have an expectation early in the year of whether International would rebound, the depths of the currency issues were diﬃcult to forecast at that time, the economic implications. And so, as we sit here closing the year, we see rebound on water conditions and hydrology, but we continue to see headwinds on currency and economic growth. And so, we think it's appropriate in light of what we see today to establish a baseline of about $0.30 or $0.15 on International, and then we do believe it's stabilized, and we see an opportunity for modest growth from there. I think what's important is that the 90% of the business regulated and core has demonstrated strong growth over the period of 2013 to 2015   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   and we think it will keep going as a result of all of the investments we've put in place and our ability to execute."
Okay. And the updated guidance for the International year now are you using kind of current forwards for currency and oil and the like centrally?,Yes.     Yes.
"Okay. Great. And then just thinking about Piedmont in the context of the 4% to 6% of this 2016 base now, just would that – you talked on the deal announcement of that enhancing the 4% to 6%. So if there was no Piedmont would you still be 4% to 6% or not? Could you just kind of clarify now that you have this new base?","Yes. So the growth rate is not dependent on Piedmont. We believe the base business itself, the investments that we've outlined, the way the business is executing, it's capable of growing 4% to 6%. So we see Piedmont is incremental. It's incremental to the growth rate and..."
But still in the 4% to 6%?,Yes.
"Okay. And then just on the dividend growth and earnings growth comment, because you're saying: ""we're going to grow the dividend in line with earnings, but then we're above the payout ratio"". So kind of by deﬁnition you just would end up staying above the payout ratio is that's what you actually do? So could you just kind of clarify?","Well, I think that...   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
...your communication there?,"Our dividend is growing at about 4% now. I believe it will move above the 70% target level for a while, but as we grow the – we believe we'll return back to a target level."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thank you, Steve.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs and Company."
"Hey, guys.","Hi, Michael."
"Hey, Lynn. Real quick question, just when you about the renewable business, you've had the earnings beneﬁt in the last year or so. Can quantify and Steve, you touched on it, I want to make sure I understand it. Can you quantify the total EPS beneﬁt of the tax credits? And then, how you think about replacing that, if solar development slows post 2016, when tax credit roll oﬀ or PTCs don't actually get extended?","Michael, right now, a lot of the net income bottom line beneﬁts from the renewables, the Commercial Renewables business comes from the tax beneﬁts. There is some proﬁtability on the non-tax side in the, the ongoing margin, but the bulk of the earnings comes from the tax beneﬁts. So your question is, when these tax beneﬁts, when and if they expire, what happens there? I think based on what we've seen and heard now, there will still be a market for renewable power as no state are backing oﬀ RPS standards and that's a basis for a lot of the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   growth here is responding to RFPs to meet these requirements. The PPAs in the contracts may have to change, with the absence of the tax beneﬁts and the pricing may have the change. But we will still structure this business to provide proﬁtability here. I would also add that the cost of the renewables is going down and that helps – will help oﬀset some of the tax beneﬁts that exist."
Got it. And just how much were those tax beneﬁts as part of your 2015 guidance? Is that the full piece of Commercial of that $75 million or just some portion of it?,It's the majority of the $75 million.
"Got it. Okay. The other thing, can the O&M cost savings oﬀset the $0.17 impact of positive weather this year?","You know, Michael, we're not getting that speciﬁc on how each of these of these drivers impact. So, what I would direct you to is think about our O&M spend, and we are at work to not only oﬀset inﬂationary impact, but to drive those costs lower in 2016. So, I think about weather, we always start by planning normal weather and then we're building up with investments, earnings, as well as cost control."
"Got it. Thank you. And thanks, Steve, much appreciated.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Hi.,"Hi, Brian.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Hi. My question.,"Hi, Brian."
Hi. My questions have been asked and answered.,Okay. Thank you.     Very good.
Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is coming from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities.,"Hello, Jim.     Hi, Jim."
Hi. I'm going to put my debt hat on for a second here. Can you just talk a little bit about how much cash ﬂow is upstream from the Regulated Utilities to the parent-level every year on an annualized basis?,"I think we will probably take that question oﬄine. Jim, I'm not sure we've got a cash ﬂow statement sitting in front of us here.    Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Okay.,"Right. I don't have that with me, we'll have to work on that a bit, Jim."
Okay. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ali Agha.,"Hello, Ali."
Hi. Good morning.,Morning.
"Morning. Lynn and Steve, just listening to your comments, just so that I'm clear, with the normalized weather next year, International being modest, some cost savings and then the rebasing, just directionally, it appears that 2016 is pretty much ﬂat to maybe modestly down from 2015, and then, so is that fair?","I think we've given you the drivers, Ali. If you look at the slide, on slide 10 to grow the base business at 4% to 6%, add to it International with modest growth. And so, I think we've given you a pretty good sense of where we think it'll be. And of course, we'll give more detail in February as we ﬁnalize our business plan, so that you can understand more speciﬁcally how much of it's coming from O&M and how much is coming from each of the business segments."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Okay. Okay. And more near-term in 2015, when you lopped oﬀ $0.10 from the higher end of the range, is that all because of Commercial, is it International being worse, can you just kind of elaborate the change in 2015 guidance?","So, Ali, we've really been working throughout 2015 to oﬀset weakness in International and have been successful in doing that through a variety of things including favorable weather, as well as early closings on the Eastern Power Agency and the stock buyback. As we look to the fourth quarter though, we always plan for normal weather. We've started out with October being mild. We have storm expense sitting in October. We have slightly weaker currency as a result of some of the movement that occurred in September and then, we also talked about the extension of bonus depreciation. We don't know for sure, but it feels to us like that, we'll likely get extended and if it does because of our tax position, it results in a modestly higher eﬀective tax rate for the company. So all of those things considered, we think $4.55 to $4.65 is an appropriate range at this point."
"See, and on the bonus depreciation front Lynn, I mean the talk is that if it gets extended, it's a two-year extension, I'm just curious if that's how you guys are seeing it? And if so, can you just quantify just the bonus depreciation extension impact for Duke?","We have heard various guesses as to how long it will be extended. We think there is a good likelihood of at least one year. Two years is possible as well, and the impacts for 2015, for a one year extension is in the range of $0.04 for us. If we go beyond into a two-year extension, it could be a similar number, just depends on our overall tax positioning. The issue for us is we're toggling in and out of an NOL position, which makes us perhaps unique in the industry. If you're deeply within an NOL or outside of an NOL position, this extension doesn't have an impact, and it depends a bit on when we come out of that NOL position which depends on other factors. So it's a little hard to predict beyond 2015.     And of course Ali, cash ﬂow. Yes, cash ﬂow is possibly impacted if it is extended. So what Steve is giving you is earnings perspective."
"Absolutely. Last question, Lynn, so on the International operations, is the mindset now look sort of hunker down and sort of work with the portfolio ﬂat to modest growth. Is that sort of the planning now and not really be more proactive and saying, hey does this really ﬁt in the portfolio?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Our focus has certainly been this year, Ali, trying to run the business as eﬃciently as we can. We've focused on cost. I think the International team has done an extraordinary job in a diﬃcult market. We think it's stabilized and hopefully we'll see a slightly better picture in 2016. I think the portfolio is always under review. The fact that we added Piedmont is consistent with our view that we wanted more natural gas in the portfolio. So that's an ongoing review. In the meantime we're also taking advantage of the International cash as you know.     Yes."
thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is coming from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Good morning.,Hi Paul.
"In your release you indicate that for the quarter weather was a $0.09 pickup at the utility, and then when I look at slide 19 in the deck, I see that last year was $0.06 below normal, but this year is basically showing normal, just trying to reconcile that.","Yes, I think that's – that your statements are correct. There's some rounding in some of these schedules, I believe is the diﬀerence in your cents. But we've returned to normal weather this quarter. Last year, it was mild weather.     And probably the other thing I would note is share count is going to have a diﬀerence between 14 and 15 because of the share buyback.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Okay. And, then kind of given that the pending Piedmont acquisition, what's going to happen when it proceeds some securitization? Will that just sit on the balance sheet and then you use that cash and close the deal?","So, we would expect securitization to move through the process in 2016, Paul. So, it will come into the cash ﬂow of the company and be used for investments or foregoing debt in the short- term, but we do see it as a cash ﬂow item that over a long-term basis could be used for long- term investments, Piedmont being one of them."
When do you expect that cash?,We would expect to be able to close the securitization in the ﬁrst or second quarter of 2016.
And then just lastly your latest thoughts around ﬁling rate cases in your regulated jurisdictions?,We're looking at ﬁling in – I would say in the late teens. It depends upon investment plans and other factors there that we look at jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction but generally we're looking at rate cases in the Carolinas in the late teens.
"And then lastly just clariﬁcation on the payout ratio discussion. If you were to look at your 2015 payout ratio, what would you use as the numerator and denominator? I guess $ 460 million would be the denominator?",Yes. So...     I'm sorry. Ask that again I'm sorry...
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I just wanted to make sure how are you thinking about the payout ratio? What's – is that the indicated dividend at year end or is that the dividend paid during the year?,It's the dividend paid during the year as it grows over the annual earnings.
"So, it's a kind of mix of – a blend of two years of dividends, because you change in mid year?","Yes. So, there is nothing fancy about this, Paul, whether you use an annualized number or whether you use what's paid out, I think it's all a matter of small rounding. I would calculate payout ratio the way you typically do for every other utility."
Thank you very much.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. There appear to be no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for any closing or ﬁnal remarks.     So, thank you, everyone for joining us today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy.
