Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Hi, Shar.     Good morning, Shar.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Good morning. Lynn, obviously, it's been a little bit of a slow start to the year, obviously weather-driven, you're not alone. You reiterate guidance, but can you just talk about where you are within the '23 range, assuming normal weather? And how we should think about incremental levers, especially given where you are from an O&M perspective? I mean, clearly, in the slides, you show how eﬃcient you are and you've pulled a lot of levers already. So just curious if you could be a little bit more speciﬁc on how much cost mitigation is left for the year, especially if weather doesn't transpire. Thanks.","Sure. Thanks for the question. No question it's been a mild weather year. And as I look around the industry, there are other utilities who've experienced a trend similar to ours, Midwest and some in the Southeast.  We have put mitigation plans in place, as Brian talked about, Shar, so deferring non-critical work, third-party spend, all of those things that you would expect us to attack tactically in 2023. And we see those progressing. We also are on pace with the $300 million of O&M that we targeted to take out of the business coming into 2023.  So I look at all of that and the fact that we have the third quarter ahead of us, and we believe the range -- we can reaﬃrm the range. The range still represents the potential we have for 2023, and we'll update within that range at the end of the third quarter.  We did highlight July, we've already had a peak at July. So weather was strong in July, and we've got August and September in front of us. I think what's important to recognize here is that we are working every possible lever, including any contingencies that sat in the plan at the time we developed it. And I would just point to the strategic progress also, Shar, that we've made, because the fundamentals of this company remain unchanged. Strong capital growth, strong jurisdictions, and I think that represents a really solid investment thesis for the future."
"Got it. And then, Lynn, last one is, obviously, you reiterated the credit metric targets and lack of equity needs through '27 with the current plan. Maybe just a strategy question here is, I guess, how are you sort of thinking about inorganic opportunities? And more importantly, if a deal does present itself, should we assume that the only equity you'd be looking to raise would be the amount needed speciﬁcally for that acquisition? So should we be concerned around maybe an over-equitizing scenario with a potential deal to further rightsize the balance sheet? Or do you think that's not really necessary given your trajectory and the rating agency conversations you've been having? Thanks.","There's a lot in that one, Shar. Let me start by saying, what I would like you to take away and really investors to take away is that our growth story is an organic one. And I look at all the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   progress we've made in simplifying the portfolio, it has brought us to this moment where we're fully regulated with transparent, robust capital that will unfold over the next decade in constructive jurisdictions, growing jurisdictions. And at the same time, we've also put in place and worked through energy policy, modernization of regulations. So that gives us a high degree of conﬁdence that we can execute those plans and deliver returns to investors.  And so when I think about growth for Duke, our sole focus is on this organic plan that's in front of us. And so any idea about M&A has to beat what we have in front of us, and it is an increasingly high hurdle because of the conﬁdence we have in our plan. So this notion that we're going to over-equitize something to chase an asset and strengthen the balance sheet is just not a narrative that is supported by anything that we're focused on here at Duke."
"Okay. Perfect. That actually answered the question. Thanks, Lynn. Appreciate it, guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We have our next question. It comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
"Hey. Good morning, team. Thank you very much. Hey, look --","Hi, Julien."
"Just going back to Shar's question a moment -- hey, good morning, Lynn. Just wanted to go back to Shar's question on just back half trends, et cetera. Can you elaborate a little bit more on just how you're trending on -- versus rates? And then also, speciﬁcally, even quarter-to-date, if you will, July. I mean, it seems like weather may have been pressured again here. Just chiming in a little bit on where we stand even through the summer.","So Julien, let me give a try, and Brian may have heard more in that question than I did. So, let me start with 2023 ﬁnancial plan before we start considering the impact of mild weather. The plan was always back end loaded. So, if you think about, we are in the midst of rate cases in our   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   largest jurisdiction. We put interim rates into eﬀect at DEP June 1. Full rates will go into eﬀect October 1. The largest jurisdiction, DEC, interim rates will go in September 1.  So, the plan was always back-end loaded, and I think that's important for you to recognize. And then the mitigation that we've added to that is obviously going to be back end loaded. You'll begin to see some of it in third quarter, a stronger amount of it in the fourth quarter. And so, when I think about July, just consistent with what you saw on the front page of every newspaper, hot, hot, hot, it was hot in our jurisdictions as well. So, we had a positive weather story in July. And we'll be monitoring August and September and give you more on where we are in the range after the third quarter.  So, hopefully that answered it. Julien. I don't know, Brian, if you have anything to add?     No, thank you. You covered it, Lynn."
"Okay. All right. Excellent. And then, just also as a further follow-up. I mean, obviously just an intense amount of focus here. Just with the willingness to engage or any further thoughts on the willingness to engage in inorganic growth, has that changed at all in the last few months? You've seen the backdrop, right, whether utility valuations are at large, grown, et cetera, just any further thoughts around that backdrop.","Julien, I would leave you with our sole focus is on organic growth. Sole focus is on organic growth, because when we look at what we have in front of us and our ability to drive growth with the capital plans that sit in our jurisdictions, we believe that will deliver the greatest value to shareholders."
"Excellent. I think that was quite clear. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon, all right?","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Well, our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Hi, David."
"Thinking about the FFO to debt range and the target 13% to 14% for this year, I was wondering if you could give a sense of kind of where in that range you're tracking, given some of the pressures that you've been experiencing so far, and also just latest thinking on timing for when you can get comfortably above that 14% level.","David, I would say the primary pressure in '23 centers around deferred fuel. And we've given you a sense of how that is tracking. So we're expecting to collect about 1.7 billion of that in '23, which will strengthen the balance sheet. We also have the Commercial Renewable sale, where we'll see proceeds of about $800 million before the end of the year. That is also credit positive. But as you indicated, weak weather goes the other way. And so, stronger weather in July and hopefully a stronger third quarter will be an oﬀset to that. So we feel like the 13% to 14% range remains an appropriate consideration for '23, strengthening into '24. Would you add anything to that, Brian?     I would say the ﬁnal lap of the deferred fuel recovery in '24 will move us into that 14% range, coupled with the North Carolina rate cases that are going to be in place for the full year in '24. So those are big catalysts as we look forward. And the IRA beneﬁts will start nearing in larger quantities as we move into the middle part of the decade as well."
"Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then secondarily, with interest rates rising again, I'm wondering if that's representing an incremental headwind to your plan. Just how are you managing that exposure on some of your short-term debt outstanding, and also reﬁnancings and new debt issuances as they come up?","Yes, David, you're rightly focused on that, as are we. Interest rates higher for longer, weakness here with mild weather. So we are working through that using all the tools you would expect us to use to minimize the interest expense, but also looking at the levers we have within our ﬁnancial plan to oﬀset that as well.  So it represents something that gets a great deal of attention, and we're working our way through it. And I would again note that we're reaﬃrming our guidance range for '23 and continue to believe we can grow at 5% to 7% over the long term based on the fundamentals in   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   the business. And as we move through these rate cases, I would just also emphasize that interest rates are being reset, as we go through rate cases, and that's an important consideration as you know."
Got it. Thanks so much.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We have our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Jeremy, your line is now open."
"Hi, good morning.","Hi, Jeremy.     Good morning, Jeremy."
"I just wanted to come back to the drivers to this year if I could. And as you noted, weather, inﬂationary pressure, higher interest rates, all represent headwinds. But want to go to the load a little bit more. At the beginning of the year, you assumed 12-month retail load growth would be about 0.5%, I think. And weather normal, retail load growth right now is down 2.7% year-to-date. And you expect 2H '23 load growth to be ﬂat to 0.5%. So just wondering, for what trends you're seeing in load that are diﬀerent than expectations. Do you expect those to correct over time? And just any color that you could provide there would be helpful.","Yes, Jeremy, let me give a start, I know Brian will have something to add to this. As we look at the various classes, residential load is below our expectation for the year. But I would say to you, as we look at residential load, it has been weak in the months when weather has been mild. So I actually believe we've got some imprecision. We've talked about this. It's hard to ﬁgure out what's economy and what's weather. And so, we're talking about $0.30 of weather headwind,   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   but that could be a bit higher in that some of the volume weakness in residential is weather related.  Commercial has exceeded our expectation. And so, commercial is tracking exactly as we would expect. And then industrial, we've seen some pullback. We've seen pullback in a couple of sectors, but fundamentally, over the long term, because of all the growth we're seeing in our industrial and commercial sectors, we think the fundamentals there are strong. So residential, a little bit of a weather story. Commercial on track. Industrial, a short-term pullback is what I would leave you with. And Brian, how would you add to that?     Yes, I would say in the industrial sector, Jeremy, that we're in regular dialogue with our large our large customers. We talk to them. We understand that, with the uncertain economic backdrop, there's some prudent inventory management going on. We've gotten through a lot of supply chain challenges over the past several years, and inventory levels are at a healthier spot. So they're like, well, as we're looking forward, there could be some clouds coming, so let's just be prudent. So we've seen a slight dial down in usage, but we don't see that persisting into the long term in the future. So I would just take it at that. And the bottom line is that the economic development investment in our territories is strong, and it's going to produce increasing levels of demand for large customers as we look through the middle of the 20s and into the 30s."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just kind of coming back to prior questions and bringing a ﬁner point to it. There's been media stories talking about Duke's interest in PSNC. And so based on what you were saying before, Duke is not interested in PSNC, or would that ﬁt into your organic growth story?","Jeremy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on another company's process, but what I would like to emphasize and have you take away is that our sole focus at Duke is on our organic growth plan."
Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve, your line is now open.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Morning, Steve.     Hi, Steve."
"Hi. Hi. Thanks. I think my question -- main question was answered there, but one other one just on the North Carolina in terms of the DEC case. When might we -- if you're going to be able to settle that one, what will be the timeline for a potential settlement there?","Steve, we're scheduled to be on the stand August 28. Rebuttal testimony was ﬁled at the end of last week. So this is the time frame for discussions. And also in that time frame, we're expecting an order on the DEP case. So a lot of activity here in August. And we'll keep you informed every step of the way."
Great. Thank you. That's it.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We have no further questions on the line. I will now hand back to Lynn Good for closing remarks.     Very good. Well, thank you all for your questions today, your interest in Duke. We'll have a chance to talk with many of you after the call and even visit some of you. We have an active August in front of us, and we'll be anxious to share with you not only the results of the rate case but we have important integrated resource plans being ﬁled this month that again will conﬁrm and underpin the investment thesis here at Duke. So, appreciate your interest in the company and look forward to talking soon.  Operator   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.
