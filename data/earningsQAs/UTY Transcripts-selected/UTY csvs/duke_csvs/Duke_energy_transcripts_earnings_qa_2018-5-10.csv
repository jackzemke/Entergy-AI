Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning.     Good morning, Jonathan.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Steve, you may have given more on this than I picked up in the remarks. I apologize if that's the case. But I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color into the beneﬁts of tax reform that are sort of retained in the Utilities and Infrastructure segment this quarter, perhaps quantify how much that was, how's it arising? And then, whether -- to what extent, you expect it to be kind of incremental beneﬁt during the rest of the year?","Yes, what we saw in the quarter of looking AVA, we saw $0.06 favorability related to income taxes. Couple of things were going on there. I mentioned the accounting levelization rules requires smoothing of tax beneﬁts over the year and that accounts for $0.02 or $0.03 of that favorability. We also utilized some tax optimization eﬀorts that helped provide some beneﬁts in income tax as well. But there is the levelization that will turn around to the extent I described.     And Jonathan, maybe just to add to that, the overall guidance that we provided in February for the impact of tax reform, we are on track for that. What you're seeing is just some quarter-to- quarter levelization, resulting from the application of GAAP. But we are on track with the guidance we gave you in February."
"Yeah. And so that incorporates sort of some earnings pick up from the fact that the riders won't be implemented till they get implemented and the DEP happening in the next case, am I understanding that right?","So the cash ﬂow implications of retaining those beneﬁts would be reﬂected in the results. We are deferring in every jurisdiction, I believe, the tax beneﬁt. So, you can think about it as cash ﬂow ﬁnancing beneﬁt, Jonathan."
"Okay. So, what you're calling out as an earnings driver is purely the timing. It's not the -- it's not the cash beneﬁt.","Well, that's right. What is an earnings driver here is the levelization primarily that Lynn described. There have been some tax optimization eﬀorts that are there in the results that's separate from the Tax Act issue."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you for that. And just one other topic. Can you give us an update of how you feel about your goals that you've laid out in commercial renewables and just a sort of market -- state of the market, competitive wise there?","Jonathan, we're on track in '18 in the commercial renewable segment. The variance that you see in the quarter is more weather related, but the backlog of projects and what we expect to close in 18 remains on track. As you know, it's a competitive market and we expect it to continue to be."
Okay. Thank you very much.,"Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  All right. Next, we'll go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse."
"Quick question. The 15% to 16% for the debt target for 2020 to 2022 and 14% for 2018, how much would that be impacted if -- how much of that is dependent on the outcome of the DEP case, like what's the -- how could it change positive or negative as a result of the outcome?","Well, I think the DEP case was very constructive. I think it's, overall, in line with our expectations as a whole."
"I'm sorry, but the DEC case. DEC case.","Okay. Okay. Well, we modeled a number of scenario outcomes the DEC case will learn about in a few weeks. But I think we have a number of levers to pull to still meet our credit metrics overall plan.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Michael, if you like look at the DEP case, very constructive outcome, addressing all of the capital, substantially all of the deferred coal ash. We believe we put on a very strong case for DEC, and we'll know more on the speciﬁcs by May or June. But I think the person established in the DEP case is how you should think about DEC. And then tax reform would be the addition to DEC that I would point to. And we were speciﬁc in our recommendations around tax reform in our post-hearing brief that we ﬁled at the end of April.  Our intent has always been that customers receive the beneﬁt of the reduction in rates from 35 to 21. And we have proposed an amortization period for the unprotected, which we think strikes a good balance. So, as Steve said, we always model a variety of scenarios on these things. But feel like we're on track to deliver those metrics. And we're certainly committed to do that and if at any point there's a timing or shortfall, we do have levers, as Steve indicated, to make sure we remain on track."
"I mean, I just to -- just to follow-up on that. I mean the real question is, is the -- the current equity issuance of 2 billion target for this year, does that incorporate even your worst case scenarios for the outcome of the case, or is there a possibility there might be more?","Yes, it does."
Okay. Thank you.,"Michael, I think, the thing I would think about on tax reform, which is really the -- probably the most signiﬁcant open item because we don't yet have commission approval. It comes down to the treatment of the unprotected deferred taxes. And so, we're not talking about a wide degree of variability for our company of our size, and we're talking about amortization periods ranging from 5 to 20 years that we proposed. So, I think it's important to bound that uncertainty exposure as you think about our conﬁdence."
"Got it. But you've bounded now the possible outcomes on the unprotected tax refunds might -- are built into that equity issuance plan, right?",Absolutely.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Okay. Good. Thank you.  Operator  And next, we will go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Morning, Steve."
"Hey. Good morning. Good morning, Lynn. So, just ﬁrst, do you have any sense from Moody's on when they might revisit the negative outlook given the equity issuance you did and the like?","Steve, we can't predict with certainty what Moody's timing is. The one thing I would point to, though, is that their report earlier this year and their outlook action was really centered around tax form. So, I would expect, as we move through the resolution of the DEC case, you'll get a clear picture of North Carolina. We already have Florida dialed in, Kentucky is visible and we have dockets open in both Ohio and Indiana. So, I feel like more information is going to become available over the next several months around tax reform in our larger jurisdictions, and we'll certainly be anxious to share all of that with Moody's."
"Okay. Great. And then the 1.1 billion of refundable AMT credits. So in 2019 and '20, are you essentially getting tax money, essentially refunds from the government on taxes?",Correct.     Yes. That's correct.
Overall? Because you have also your NOL and other.,Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We're getting that as cash.
"Okay. And then just technically, the 1.1 billion, that's a direct number that's not like a -- is it -- do we tax eﬀect that or is that a direct?",That's a direct number. That's (Technical Diﬃculty)
Okay. Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you, Steve.  Operator  And next, we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch."
Hey. Good morning.,Good morning.     Good morning.
"So, I wanted to follow up on a couple things. First, if we can go to the modernization side of the equation, starting with Ohio. PowerForward, obviously that success on that front, did that change your CapEx at all? I mean, obviously, it wouldn't be too meaningful. And then, secondly, related to that, can you talk on the outcome of the latest rate cases in the Carolinas and to what extent that might shift things?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So, we're pleased with the results of the settlements in Ohio, Julien, but we need to get through a commission process. So, there are hearings in July, but feel good about the settlement we were able to bring to the table. I think the PowerForward part of that rider will include projects that will impact customer experience. So, our replacement of customer systems will be included in there, but we'd also expect the Ohio Commission, as they continue their work on their initiatives to perhaps identify some things that we could invest in. Those would be incremental to our plan.  So, overall, I would look at the result. The settlement in Ohio is being consistent with our plan with modest upside. And in the Carolinas, I think we've talked a number of times about grid investment being a priority in the Carolinas. We are -- we'll be watching closely the results of the DEC case and then, determining our strategy for the legislation in 2019 and beyond, to see if there is additional legislative certainty that we need to provide in order to set a pathway for further investment in the Carolinas. So, that's what I would share with you about modernization in the Carolinas."
"Excellent. And then turning back to the overall guidance. Not to wordsmith things too much, but just wanted to see what you are seeing about the '19 guidance. Last time I think you guys talked about being close ''within the guidance range by '19.'' And I think this go around, you talk about being back to the lower end of the 4 to 6. Is that something to do with the timing of the equity and within the plan or is -- am I just being too nitpicky here?","Julien, the message has been the same. If you go back and reference where we were in February, it has always been low end of the range in '19 and then, mid-to-high in 20 and beyond, as we see the rate base growth and the investment and so on. So, no change in message, but we'll be at the low end of the range in '19."
"Excellent. Sorry, just quick nitpicky thing on the tax side real quickly. Obviously, Ohio, that issue, I think got pushed out from the settlement conversations. What's the latest expectation on resolving that?","There is a docket in Ohio. I'd expect it to move through a process in '18, Julien. But I don't have anything more speciﬁc than that."
Excellent. Thank you all very much. Best of luck.,"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thank you.  Operator  All right. Next, we'll go to Ali Agha with SunTrust."
Thank you. Good morning.,Good morning.     Good morning.
"Morning. First, Steve, I wanted to just make sure I had heard something earlier. When you talked about ﬁrst quarter and some timing-related issues, one was tax levelization, as you clariﬁed. If I heard you right as well, I think you mentioned there was about a $0.04 pickup in O&M, also timing related that should reverse over the course of the year. Did I hear that right?","Yes, that's correct."
Okay.,"We've seen some favorable O&M in the ﬁrst quarter. But some of that is related to timing of purchases and so forth, so that may turnaround."
"Okay. Got it. And then secondly, when I look at the rate base, data that you've given us through 2022. At least just looking at that data, it appears that the growth in rate base actually slows down 2020 and beyond. So, I was just wondering how to reconcile that with the point that earnings growth should actually accelerate 2020 and beyond. So, how do we reconcile those two things?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Ali, I would ﬁrst think about 2020 as being the completion of a number of important project that will begin to see impact and then full impacts. So, ACP, Western Carolina, the step-in in Florida, the riders in Ohio and Indiana, environmental spend in Indiana. And then, as you get further out in the period, we will continue to drive investments in our strategic priority areas of grid, clean energy gas and renewables. And those plants will be more ﬁne-tuned as time progresses. What we've given you is ranges and expectations. But we will ﬁne-tune the numbers in '21 and '22 as we get closer."
"Got it. And last question, Lynn, remind us also, when is the next big rate case cycle that we should think about once we're done with the North Carolina cases now over this planning period?","So, as I think about jurisdictions were set in Florida, if the settlement is approved, Ohio is in good shape. We just ﬁnished the case in Kentucky. We have a number of trackers in Indiana. We continue to think about, is the time to come in for a full case? So, that's something that will be under evaluation. And then the Carolinas. We will be anxious to see the results of the DEC case and that will inform our timing.  But as we talked about a number of times, we believe the investment proﬁle in the Carolinas matched with great value and beneﬁts to customers is a good one. We're looking for ways we can modernize the construct. And in the interim, we'll be ﬁling cases to deliver returns to investors and match these beneﬁts to customers. So, we'll have more speciﬁcs, though, on the timing after we digest the DEC case."
Got it. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  Now, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs."
"Hey, guys. Thank you for -- hey, Lynn. Thank you, guys, for taking my call -- my question. I actually have a couple. The ﬁrst one is, can you quantify under tax reform and the tax law changes at a company-wide level for your regulated operating companies? And I'm just looking   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   for the total company level, not by subsidiary. What is the excess or unprotected add ﬁt that balance? Like, what do you estimate that to be, that's likely over multiple, multiple years will likely get recovered -- refunded back to customers?","We've got about 6.3 billion of excess deferreds on our books, Michael, total company. And of that, about 4.5 billion is protected and unprotected is about 1.8 billion."
"So the 4.5 billion should qualify under normalization and like we saw after the 86 Tax Act and go back to customers over a long life period and the other stuﬀ, it's kind of more negotiable.",That's correct.
"Okay. Thank you. The other thing -- and this is more of a regulatory or rate making question. When you look at your capital spend forecast over the next couple years, how much of that -- is there a rule of thumb of like how much of that capital spend is covered via trackers or riders versus covered via traditional, kind of historical looking rate case processes?","It will vary per jurisdiction, Michael. Certainly, we have a number of trackers in the Midwest that cover a lot of the capital there. We've got the multi-year rate planning in Florida that provides us very eﬃcient recovery. The Carolinas is the larger jurisdiction, which has a lot of the CapEx, has a fewer trackers at this point in time. So, it's hard to give a rule of thumb there for the enterprise as a whole."
Got it.,"Michael, Carolinas, modernizing has been a priority. So, you think about HB 589, we now do have tracking mechanisms in the Carolinas around renewables and we put in front of the commission grid tracking. So, our objective over the ﬁve-year period is to make progress in the Carolinas. But I think if you look at the Midwest and Florida, substantial, it's over 50%, 60%, 70% perhaps are covered by trackers in those jurisdiction."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. Thank you and thank you, Steve. Much appreciated.","Yeah.     Thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll go to Praful Mehta with Citi."
"Thanks so much. Hi, guys.",Hey.
"So, Steve, just to clarify and by the way, slide 23 is very helpful in terms of the deferred taxes. But just to clarify on that 1.8 billion of unprotected, what amount do we have clarity right now of the ﬁve years and what amount is uncertain in terms of the timing of the refund? And the reason for the question just to give you the context is just trying to ﬁgure out where in that FFO to debt range can your metrics vary depending on the outcome of the deferred income taxes.","Of the 1.8 billion of unprotected excess deferreds, about 1.1 billion is at DEC and about 300 million is at Duke Energy Progress. So the bulk of it is in the Carolinas. The main remaining portions are in Indiana and Florida. So the big piece of that is in the Carolinas.     And I think, Praful, as you think about this DEC case, we will get some visibility into the unprotecteds for DEC within the next couple of months. And we've put forward a proposal of amortization between 5 and 20 years, time that amortization period to the asset class, the nature of the items that resulted in the deferred taxes. And as I've said a moment ago, we'll learn more commission as we see the results of the DEC rate case."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got you. Fair enough. That makes sense. But just so, if there is push back or request for faster refunds than what you've currently assumed, I guess, in your metrics or FFO to debt metrics, does that put pressure on credit at all? Or do you think most scenarios that you can get back in terms of the rate case or the settlement are kind of incorporated within your current plan?","Praful, we are conﬁdent on this. If you think about a 1.1 billion over a ﬁve or 10-year period and the scale of the company, the amount of capital we spend, the regulatory activity that we have to generate cash ﬂow, we feel like we have scenarios and levers that we can exercise and manage variability. So, I'd leave it at that. Steve?     Right. I would echo that as well. We have eﬀorts under capital optimization, looking at our O&M spend that can help oﬀset this -- just a number of levers to pull."
"Got you. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on tax equity. I saw that, with one of your solar projects, you are looking at tax equity ﬁnancing. And you mentioned this will be a bigger part going forward. Sounds like it makes sense given your cash tax proﬁle. Is that -- how attractive is the tax equity market right now? How big a player do you look to be in that tax activity? I'm assuming that is a part of your FFO to debt strategy as well to kind of improve metrics. So, just a little bit of color around that would be helpful.","Sure. We -- the tax equity market is still very viable. It is, in fact, being used at our Shoreham facility, our solar farm in New York and we'll continue to utilize that. As you mentioned, our tax position puts us as a candidate for that and I think the markets there. It is an important part of our commercial renewables proﬁle. So, we'll utilize that as we go forward.     Praful, the capital that we've laid out with you in February is still a good planning assumption for commercial renewables. We just look at tax equity as a tool we'll use to put that capital to work."
"Got you. Fair enough. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it.","Thank you.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Sure.  Operator  Next, we'll go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners."
"Hey. Good morning, guys. My questions were -- hi, Lynn. My questions were just answered. Thanks so much.",Hi. Thank you.
"Bye, guys.  Operator  Okay. We'll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.",
Good morning.,"Good morning.     Good morning, Paul."
"Renewables, you were down a 0.05, which you attributed to wind resource. Was that a net number? In other words, did you have growth from incremental projects more than oﬀset by more than a 0.05 of poor wind resource?",Yeah. That's in that number.
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   What -- assuming wind resources had been ﬂat, what would the segment have done?","I'd have to look at that a little bit further, Paul. But the results were down a 0.05, and that's primarily due to wind resource and there is some additional resources. But it's not signiﬁcant."
"Okay. Thank you. And then back to Steve's question. The 1.1 billion of AMTs, so what net number will you be receiving from the IRS next year do you expect? The full 550 million?","Yes, in the range of that amount. 50% of the 1.1 billion we'll get that next year."
"And that's net of what you'll be paying IRS. In other words, you will be not a cash ta payer?","So, that's the amount from the AMT and we're not a cash taxpayer on any other front. And AMT is not tied to taxable income in anyway. It's just an amount you get regardless of where you are at on your tax return."
Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our last question from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan.
"Good morning, Lynn and Steve.","Hi, Chris.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"I appreciate the extra detail on Atlantic Coast. That was very helpful. Thank you for that. Just a couple clariﬁcations. Could you maybe give us a little bit more on how you're feeling in North Carolina about the grid mod rider staﬀ? Didn't like it, but did admit that they would prefer that it has a cost cap and some other conditions if they did approve it. So, how are you feeling there? And how much does the tax beneﬁts to the customers, in general, kind of weigh in on commission and intervener thinking there?","So, on the grid investment, Chris, I think what we saw in the hearing is just a continuation of a good discussion about the nature of the investments, the beneﬁts they can deliver, the impact on customer bills. And so, as we put together our post-hearing brief, we really addressed the number of the issues that were expressed during the hearing process and put in front of the commission. But I would call kind of a step-in for the rider, a three-year proposal with the cap that was responsive to the feedback that we received.  So, I would think about this as being continuation of our strategy to keep the conversation going about the grid. I actually think there is very little disagreement about the need for the investment. I think the beneﬁts to customers are clear, and we are trying to ﬁnd the right way to put that investment in place for the beneﬁt of customers in a way that makes sense to the commission and public staﬀ, et cetara.  I think tax reform represents a great opportunity because you have an opportunity to reduce impact to customers. At the same time, you're driving investment. So, I think they're complementary in that regard. And so, we look forward to continuing the dialog. And as we've shared previously, we have thought about the grid investments and modernization as being dual track, focusing on the regulatory process, certainly, but also having legislation is something that we would also consider as we continue our work to modernize regulations."
"Okay. That's helpful. I think we'll have to wait and see there. And then just two tax clariﬁcation questions. When do you expect to become a cash taxpayer again? And I guess, that question would exclude any noise from the AMT credit you're getting in the next two years. And then the second question is just on the South Carolina approval from the commission on tax reform there. Do you pay a return to customers on the deferred balance?","On the ﬁrst question, we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer in our ﬁve-year plan. So, it's after 2022 when that happens. And help me on your second question again on South Carolina?"
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So, you guys just got the okay a couple of weeks back to defer taxes and not have it addressed by the commission until your next rate case ﬁlings there.",Yes.
"In the interim, do you pay a return on that deferred tax liability owed to customers?","No, no, we are just deferring those costs at this point."
Okay.,And the commission will determine how to deal with that at that time of the proceeding. We're just deferring those beneﬁts right now.
"Okay. That's good to hear. Thank you, guys.","All right. Thanks, Chris.  Operator  It looks like we have no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn it back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any closing remarks.     I want to thank, everyone, for participating. Good questions today. We look forward to connecting with you over the next several weeks and appreciate your investment and interest in Duke Energy.  Operator  That does conclude today's conference.
