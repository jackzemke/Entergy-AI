Question,Answer
"Hi, Steve, Lynn. How are you doing?",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Good morning. Hey, great. Can you talk about some of the main things that you're looking at that will aﬀect the 2021 guidance and how you thinking about re-basing at 4% to 6% going forward like a bit oﬀ the bat you have already conceived the impact of ACP, is deﬁnitely a factor, COVID-19 how long that lasts is a factor, maybe the coal ash settlement for coal ash proceedings, that's probably a factor? How do all these things weigh in your minds right now as you're thinking about 2021?","Sure, Mike, and I appreciate that question. I think it's on everyone's mind. And we really worked hard in our remarks and with our slide today to give you some visibility into what we're thinking about. I think there are three important points that I would emphasize here. First of all, that the regulated and commercial renewables businesses remain on track and I think what's important there as we talk about rate case outcomes of coal ash recovery et cetera, we always plan for a range of outcomes that was contemplated in the projected $5.50, it's also contemplated in the projected $5.15 that Steve walked you through the math on.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   The second important point is that we are committed to mitigating COVID economic eﬀects as we did in 2020. We don't yet know how much they're going to be. We're looking at a range of economic forecasts, but our commitment is that the decline in load would be oﬀset with O&M.  And then the third thing, I think it's important as we've already begun to identify capital -- additional capital projects that will ﬁll in the roughly $2 billion that had originally been planned for ACP and we've reﬂected a few ideas for you on Slide 12. So we're trying to give you the sense that this is visibility, this is what we're looking at regulated utilities on track, COVID to be mitigated, capital plan intact.  And so over the balance of the year, we'll continue to monitor what's going on with the economy. We should receive orders from the NCUC on the pending cases. We're also going to be closely following the IRP and clean energy planned resolution and feedback because those two initiatives represent opportunities for us to continue to identify capital that we'll spend over the next ﬁve years in the next decade. So, we will give you more visibility on all of these things in the third quarter, including drivers and then of course the complete capital, cash ﬂow, earnings range in February as we historically have."
"Great. And one more on coal ash, if you were to receive, let's say, moderately negative order on coal ash or negative order on coal ash, would that require any additional equity, block equity issuance, or secondary equity? I know you said that you do not need it for ACP cancellations is one that's conﬁrmed.","Sure. And this is an important question and will really be the centerpiece of testimony on the implications to credit might those coal ash recovery. I talked about the earnings implications contemplated in our plan, but on cash ﬂow and metrics, we will be on the stand August 24, talking about the importance of a strong balance sheet, importance to our customers, not only for growth but for potential disruptions in the market. The fact that the customers lean on our balance sheet during hurricanes and COVID and other things.  And our hope and expectation is that given the magnitude of this issue to Duke, and the fact that we have a very strong, well-reasoned order from 2018 that we'll receive fair and appropriate treatment from the Commission on this item. The North Carolina Commission has been constructive over many years and we will put a very strong case in front of them.  But I think it's important to focus speciﬁcally on coal ash. And if we were to receive an order consistent with dominion and absent any other provisions within the order that would be credit supportive our balance sheet would be weakened. And really it has been very clear on the treatment of coal ash if there is no return that would be a direct reduction or deduction from FFO to debt.  And frankly, we believe there are no viable options to address over 100 basis point impact to FFO to debt, which is basically the impact that that ruling would have. It's too big to solve with equity issuances. It's too big to solve with operational responses. And I don't say that's likely.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We don't want this outcome. We don't think it's in the best interest of customers or the state. But is -- and I can never speak for the agencies, but I think the consideration will not only be the quantitative math I just walked you through, but the qualitative assessment of, is this order constructive and is the downgrade threshold for Duke at appropriate level.  So we look at this is an important issue, as I said, a centerpiece of our testimony in August. We have reached a settlement with the State on method of closing, we saved customers money, we're meeting all the deadlines, we're delivering consistent with the rules and regulations. And our hope and expectation is for a constructive order.  As you noted in your comments about equity, we believe the amount of equity in the plant is adequate to support our capital and our balance sheet and that's the way we're approaching it at this point."
"Okay. So just to be clear, it doesn't sound like you'd be inclined to issue additional equity even in the events of some kind of negative order on full ash recovery?","Mike, we will evaluate the whole of the order because I think it will be important to look at what else is in the order, are there any other credit supportive elements. But we stand by the equity that we've included in our plan is adequate to support our credit and our capital plan and we don't believe that equity will solve a potential quantitative and qualitative assessment on coal ash. So as I said, we'll put a strong case on. We expect and hope for fair treatment from the Commission and we'll continue to keep you posted as we move through these proceedings."
"Okay, Lynn. Thank you very much. I'll cede the ﬂoor.",Thank you.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Hey, it's actually Kody Clark on for Shar. Good morning.",Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Good morning.
"Just a follow up on the last question, just wanting to get a better sense of the moving pieces here. I know you aren't in the position to give 2021 guidance, given your capital spending guidance no need to raise equity yet, and healthy rate case outcome in the Carolinas, upcoming ﬁling for O&M levers and additional projects and move ACP, given your gas needs. Is there any reason to believe that when you issue that's 2021 guidance, that would imply growth, lower than the historical midpoint of 4% to 6%?","So what we are pointing to in the analysis is we were targeting $5.50. ACP is worth about $0.35. So the math points to about $5.15 and that implies the reg business and commercial renewables on track and sizable oﬀset any economic deterioration with O&M and also implies that we'll continue to rebuild the capital from ACP. So that's the way I would respond to it. Steve, would you add anything to that.     You know our rate base is growing at 6% for our businesses. So I think we're going to robustly grow in 4% to 6% range hopefully with potential behind of the range from where we reset in 2021."
"Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then quickly looking forward to the ESG Day, do you plan on providing the incremental long-term capital spending opportunity associated with the Carolinas IRP at that point. Or will you wait for a full capital plan update and February to roll in any CapEx?","I believe February is going to be better timing for that. And the reason is the IRP is ﬁled in early September. The Clean Energy Plan reaches its natural resolution in the form of a report to the Governor at the end of December. So I think what we'll be able to do is share some of the scenarios within our IRP, what the capital would look like in the scenarios for the impact to customer rates, and it will have everything from meeting at least a 50% carbon reduction to a 70% carbon reduction, which is the target that the Governor has said in his executive order.  But I think to fully reﬂect all of that in our capital plan 2021 February would be a start and I think we'll even more and more beyond February as the process continues here in the Carolinas. And I do think that ﬂeet transition is something that represents an opportunity for us to add capital in the Carolinas, that Steve referenced just a moment ago and we'll keep you informed along the way as we know more.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Great. That's all I have. Thank you and (inaudible).,Thank you. You too.  Operator  We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for the time.","Hi, Julien."
"Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up as the clariﬁcation to the capital spending plan and how is reconciled the IRP? I know you missed out a few potential items here oﬀsetting ACP, but that doesn't necessarily hit at the wider potential transition of the portfolio that you might be getting at in the IRP. So one, if you can discuss the scenario of the IRP?  And two, how that might reconcile with the revised $56 billion CapEx plan?","Julien, it's a very good question. And then what we've shared with you on Slide 12 for incremental investments really does not contemplate the full potential from the IRP and the Clean Energy plan over the next decade. And so, the scenarios that we just talked brieﬂy about in the slide deck, I'm kind of slipping here, it's Slide 8. We believe we'll accelerate realization of clean energy by accelerating coal retirements. It will have a range of replacement generation options including, of course, more renewables and battery storage. It will present an at least 50% carbon reduction which I think you know has been our goal across our system certainly here in the Carolinas as well. It will also present that it's necessary to get to at least of a 70% carbon reduction.  So those three transition opportunities are not fully reﬂected in our capital plan. But they will be, as we know more and as we align more speciﬁcally with the policy that will be ﬁnalized here over the next year and we'll update you as we go."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it. Just a quick -- can you clarify some of those scenarios when you talk about over the next year, what's the timeline to getting clarity here if I could ask you just a step further?","So we will take a stab at this, Julien, in February with our updated capital, but I would expect when the Clean Energy plan report is issued at the end of December. It's going to take a little time for that to ﬁnd its way in terms of ongoing policy, if legislation is necessary, is a Commission going to be involved. Our IRP similarly, we'll start to get reaction from it. We've been in stakeholder processes, but it will be ﬁled in September. And so I think it will take a little bit of time to see those ideas and turn that into more deﬁnitive policy and we'll take a stab at it in February, but continue to build on that, because what we're really talking about is a decade of investment through 2030 and then beyond."
"Got it. All right. So the clarity is 4Q, you're going to give us a ﬁrst stab at it, but after that it remains ongoing and potentially expansive?",That's right. I think that's a fair way to think about it.
Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Yeah, good morning. Hey, Lynn. Just a follow-up question on the coal ash issue, you mentioned in your rate order other credit supportive elements aside from getting a return on that like what have you proposed other credit supportive elements and what might those be?","I think it's cash ﬂow, Steve. We've reached a settlement at 9.6% and 52%. I think it would have to be higher than that and there is accelerated depreciation, which is a cash ﬂow element. So I think it would be a combination of things. But we feel strongly about the recovery of the return on and oﬀ the coal ash. We've received treatment in that regard in 2018, as you know, but I'm   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   just providing that feedback to say anytime you get an order from the Commission, you have to look at the whole of it to evaluate implications and we'll do exactly that."
"Okay, great. And then on ACP in terms of just thoughts on how you're actually going to replace the gas not the CapEx, but the gas that you needed. Do you have -- when will we know more about that?","Sure. Steve, we've been working on contingency plans for some time, for both the LDC, so this is the Piedmont system and the need to get more gas and more pressure into the eastern part of the state. There are a range of options. We'll be looking at the lowest cost option for customers and we believe some capital expansion will be necessary to achieve that and that's what's reﬂected on Slide 12.  For the electric business, the IRP will be the ﬁrst step in that process. We've been planning along the way. But the implications to replacement generation will begin to be addressed in the IRP and there are also we'll be weighing costs, completion risks, a variety of options that would be available to support the electric business. I think we've talked about the fact the gas supply into the Carolinas is currently constrained particularly in winter. So we'll need to look for ways to address that over time.  And as we ﬁnalize these options and the considerations we'll talk more about them."
"Okay, great. And then one last question in the slide in the appendix where you showed kind of your long-term renewables call, I think it's doubling for 2025 but could you just give more color like how much of that has to come through the North Carolina, the Carolinas IRP processes, or assumption for that, or are you assuming that you get half of what's there or is it coming from Florida commercial areas like that? Just a little more color on that number?","Yeah. And you know, Steve, that is based on historic IRPs, the Florida plan, the CPRE in the Carolinas. It includes some additional renewables, but we would intend to update all of that following the IRP and further work.     Right. I think there is signiﬁcant renewables that come on the regulated side through CPRE and in Florida and also including renewables that we cook up and just purchase from as well in the Carolinas as part of that number because we're important part there. And then the commercial business we've got through our ﬁve-year plan about $2 billion of capital and that represents landing about 300 megawatts a year. So that's a piece of it as well.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   But I think there is a lot of renewables potential continuing in Florida and the Carolinas.     And I think, Steve. This represents what we included in our Climate Report this year. It did not fully contemplate, what we're seeing in the IRP and the Clean Energy plan. So we will update this as we know more."
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator  We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question.","Hi, Michael."
"I hope you guys are doing well. I have two questions. One about Florida. One about the Carolinas. In Florida, do you see the potential to signiﬁcantly upsize the amount of megawatts or gigawatts of utility-scale solar that you built in Florida? I mean, if I compare year program relative to the other really large utility in the state, the size and scale diﬀerences are dramatic. I didn't know if there was something physical about the diﬀerent systems that drive that diﬀerence in between they rolling out 10 gigawatts over 10 years and you're doing a dramatically smaller amount? That's my ﬁrst question.  My second question is, what role does oﬀshore wind play in North Carolina, or in both Carolinas and how will you know whether oﬀshore wind is a component of your investment strategy?","So Michael, let me take Florida ﬁrst. So what we have shared with you in Florida is only a ﬁve- year plan. I mean there is a site plan in Florida to give some more visibility, but I would think about us as working within that ﬁve-year period giving you more speciﬁcs. We are well on our way to the 750 megawatts that we announced a year or so ago that -- year and a half ago. We've   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   also recently announced a Clean Energy Connection plan for another 750 megawatts and as you look at the growth that, Steve Fleishman, was asking about a moment ago, there's over 1000 megawatts of in total in Florida over that ﬁve-year period. I do think there will be more renewable opportunities in Florida. And so we will continue to update as we see more potential and as we roll out diﬀerent additional programs on behalf of customers. We are in a multi-year rate plan that will ﬁnalize the end of '21, Steve. So that would be another opportunity for us to provide updates on capital and so on. So I think I think renewables will continue to be a story in Florida.     And I would add part of our growth plan in Florida was the Citrus County combined cycles and that was two very large combined cycles that we have here into service. So that inﬂuenced the amount of solar that we needed during this period. I think as we go forward, we'll be ramping up the amount of solar that we're putting in place, as Lynn alluded to.     And, Michael, on oﬀshore wind. I think we will address oﬀshore wind in the upcoming IRP and where we think it might ﬁt into the portfolio. I would think about it as something that probably has greater potential towards the end, to the next decade. You may remember the history here in the Carolinas, there was a wind moratorium. So no wind through the end of '19. So it hasn't had as much visibility as I think it will coming through this IRP and the clean energy process. So it represents the future investment opportunity and we'll know more as this policy gets ﬁnalized and as we make further progress on the ﬂeet transition."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  We will take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.
"Hi, good morning, guys.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Hi, Jonathan.     Good morning."
"Just tying a couple of these things together, Lynn, when you -- do you think of the ﬂeet transition and investments related to it as something that extends your runway, or pushes you that or within the 4% to 6% sort of trajectory that you were talking to us about or potentially how higher than that? I just -- just curious, which is the other things that dial back a little bit on, just if you could speak to that?","Yeah, Jonathan. I think it does both. It certainly provides a long-term runway because you think about -- we're talking about ﬂeet and ﬂeet means long term. So we're underpinning generation in the Carolinas for decades. But I also think it has the potential impact to this ﬁve-year plan to provide more investment opportunities and we'll always look at investments within the context of price to customers because it needs to maintain -- we need to maintain aﬀordability. And so I do think it has the potential to inﬂuence both periods. One of the great things about the expertise that we've developed on cost is that gives us headroom for capital and we think about ongoing reduction of our cost structure as a way to continue to add capital for the beneﬁt of customers. So I would say it helps both things."
"Great, thank you. And then, Steve, you gave a little bit of a ﬂavor more to July view of how residential load was tracking, could you share a little bit more as it relates to the minute report out of C&I as well?","Yes. We continue to see C&I below. Again in July, we saw residential higher than last year's July by 6.5%. But we still saw the drops in commercial and industrial compared to last year in the magnitude of the low-double-digits, and that led to overall we were about 1.5% below last year's July. So that was boosted by the residential obviously. We have projected to be about 5% below last July, all-in, but we were better than that, primarily driven by residential. So we still saw a decline in commercial and industrial from last year. Industrial is climbing out of things. They're starting operations, as I mentioned, three-quarters of the larger customers are back in operations. Some are not fully at 100% but they're working their way there. Smaller commercials hurting a bit more. But overall, we're still tracking better than what we had initially forecasted and we'll keep an eye on it month-by-month."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   It is down 13 to 15 numbers you gave us for Q2 that's a little bit more lower double-digit towards the end of the -- beyond the end of the quarter, eﬀectively? But still -- was still double-digit, let's kind of call it?","I think that's correct. I don't have the C&I in front of me here, speciﬁcally. But they are obviously pulling down from the residential being up. So I suspect they are still down a fair amount. But again the larger C&I are coming up. And overall, you know it's less than a negative impact and we had seen again in July, as we saw in the second quarter. We'll keep an eye on it. We're projecting improvement, particularly in the fourth quarter. So we'll see how the second wave impacts the economy as we go forward."
Great. Thank you.,"Thank you, Jonathan.  Operator  And we will take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.     Good morning.     Hey, good morning, Lynn. Thank you for taking my question. Just maybe -- just where Jonathan left it oﬀ, these things are small, but your last communication was lower end of the 2020 guidance and now you're saying in the lower half. So am I right in assuming that you're trending higher than perhaps you were a few weeks ago? Am I sort of understanding that correctly?     That's correct. So it's really built on the success of the cost savings we've been able to generate rapidly, as well as the strength that we saw in the month of July, not only on weather normal volumes but on weather because you may recall, Durgesh, we had very mild winter weather that was dragging us early in the year and we've seen some moderation of that whether impact on a hot summer."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Understood. Super helpful. And then just broad strokes when -- and I appreciate more detail on the CapEx plan to come, but broad strokes as you think about you sort of ﬁlling the ACP CapEx hole, if you will. Fair to assume that the timing of that and recovery of that CapEx speciﬁcally, Slide 12 that is back-end loaded of the ﬁve-year plan?","I would think of it maybe ratably because as we think about the incremental LDC investment, we'll get started as soon as we can and we'll work towards completing it. So I would think of it kind of ratable, perhaps beginning as early as '21. The Florida solar investments, we were in front of the Commission actually today. We've reached a settlement, August 4, with OPC [ph] on that and we will begin introducing that investment as soon as possible after Commission approval.  And then I would also think about incremental investments in the grid whether in the Carolinas or other jurisdictions being ratable as well."
"Got it. So ratable broadly speaking for the ﬁve-year period. Understood. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Thank you.  Operator  And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Well, thank you. And I appreciate everyone's interest and participation today. We look forward to further discussions with you. And as always, the IR team is available for any clariﬁcation following today's call. So thanks again for joining us.
