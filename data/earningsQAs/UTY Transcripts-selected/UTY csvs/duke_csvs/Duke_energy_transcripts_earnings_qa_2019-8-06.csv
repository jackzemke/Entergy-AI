Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.",Hi Shar. Good morning.     Good morning.
"So, let me to delve into the Carolinas policy a bit and this maybe a question for Lloyd. So, in South Carolina, you obviously got a low ROE, a negative outcome for coal ash which is on appeal. How is sort of the dialog going in North Carolina. I mean, they're obviously seeing what's going and the two jurisdictions have been somewhat aligned in the past; you have a Piedmont case and you're eventually going to ﬁle a Duke and Progress in the state. So how sort of the conversations ﬂowing in North Carolina especially head into these GRC, should we be I guess, concerned that there is some read through to what we're seeing in South Carolina, just from a regulatory construct standpoint?","Sure. I want to be clear that we do not see a read through from South Carolina to North Carolina. North Carolina has historically been a very fair impartial regulatory jurisdiction that reaches decisions based on facts and evidence presented, follows the law and we would certainly expect that to be the case, as we think about regulatory outcomes moving forward."
"Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Senate Bill 559, obviously in the prepared remarks, it's still sitting at the House, it's not on the calendar for a vote, and you certainly highlighted   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   budgetary, the lack of a budget as being one of the items that's curtailing it. Is there sort of anything else you want to highlight that could be a push to take? Do you have any sense on sort of timing, are we going into sort of a special session. So any sort of incremental color on how the conversations are ﬂowing would be very helpful?","Yeah. Sure. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made with Senate Bill 559. We have strong bipartisan sponsorship of the bill. And as you indicated, we are in the Rules Committee really waiting for other priorities that the General Assembly has in front of them speciﬁcally the budget. I think it's important to recognize that the bill sponsors have continued to express support for moving this legislation and it is historically the case in North Carolina, the legislation is taken up after the budget or even during a budget impasse.  So, we continue to actively advocate for the bill. We think the customer beneﬁts and the policy involved embodied in the bill are very strong. Our customer beneﬁts reducing costs for storms in the range of 15% to 20%, and the policy allows for stakeholder settlements and engagements to develop an investment plan that delivers value to customers from storm hardening and resiliency to renewables and improvements in customer experience. And recently, in the House, we also added provisions to encourage low income investment. So we think the combination of good policy and clear beneﬁts to customers are very strong attributes of this bill, and we continue to advocate for it. I think in terms of timeline, we'll have to see how these other priorities continue to shape up. There is no speciﬁc timeline I would share with you but we'll continue to update as progress as made."
"Got it, thanks. And then just strategically, Lynn as the last question, I know you typically shy away from commenting on any strategic moves. But you've given us some sense on how you think about Santee Cooper and its ongoing process in South Carolina. If you sort of shift to Florida, is there any interest in JEA in case they pursue a privatization. I know the processes obviously start and the bids are due by September 30. Is there any interest there?","You know Shar, we evaluate opportunities as you would expect as we see things that are in our service territory that we think are ﬁt for us, but that would be evaluated within the broadcast context of our business plan and we feel like our organic growth opportunities are quite strong, and that would be our highest priority."
Got it. Congrats guys on a great start.,Sure. Thank you very much.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Thanks, good morning.","Hi, Greg.     Good morning."
"So, you guys had a really solid ﬁrst half $2.36 and I know that you're ﬂagging some timing issues, but even with those taking into account, adding back the assumption of normal weather and then -- to the points that some of -- some of the points Steve made with regard to things that were positive drivers in the ﬁrst half that should continue to be positive drivers in the second half. I mean, you only need to do a nickel better than last year in the second half to hit current consensus of $4.90, $0.15 to get to $5.00. So, I'm just wondering, if you're comfortable articulating a little bit more, where you think you'll be in the range given that it seems that consensus might be a little bit too low for the balance of the year, unless I'm missing some big negative driver that you haven't disclosed?","Greg. I'll take a shot and then Steve can follow. Our typical approach on resetting speciﬁcs within the range follows the third quarter, which is just the statement of the obvious about how signiﬁcant third quarter can be. So we will ﬁne tune the range as we historically have. But I think all the points that you're making around the strength of the start to the year, the way we're executing on our plan, the way we're controlling costs, the way we're working through our regulatory outcomes gives us a high degree of conﬁdence within the range. So, I think we're oﬀ to a strong start and the team is focused on delivering. And I would expect us to do that, waiting to see how weather in August and September plays out. So Steve, (multiple speakers)"
How about weather been through June and July relative to the North?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"So July has been hot. No doubt.     Yeah, July has been -- July we've seen some favorable weather. The only thing I would add in terms of the last half of the year is a bit about shaping. We do have, as I mentioned some renewables projects that are slated for the fourth quarter and we provided an exhibit there but in terms of the year as a whole, I echo Lynn's comments entirely."
"All right. But just to -- just to build on that statement, you do have a higher amount of net new megawatts coming into service in the second half at 136 megawatts of net increase even though that is shaped predominantly in the fourth quarter?","That's right. And you know, Greg, the other thing I'd point to in the back half, you may remember Florence and Michael in the third and fourth quarter last years. So that's another consideration as you think about O&M."
"All right. Well, congratulations. It sounds like you're setting up to have a good year. So congrats.","Greg, thank you. I Appreciate that.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning Steve. How are you?     Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Doing great. I wanted to touch based on North Carolina legislation, if the legislation is enacted into law, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on what kinds of opportunities, perhaps longer term in terms of additional capex, additional areas of focus and spending, if you get that kind of support that we've been looking for?","Steven, I would think about Senate Bill 559 as being an enabler of the capital plan that we have laid out over the next ﬁve years. You will note that we have more investments in the delivery system really is part of the transformation that we see in the industry. And Senate Bill 559 provides an investment mechanism that very closely matches the investment with the beneﬁts to customers. So I would think about it in that context. And as we think about, actually putting 559 into place, we envision a stakeholder process where the investment priorities over the multi-year period would be informed in a way that drives the policy in the state. So this gives us a great opportunity to tailor those investments in a way that drives customer beneﬁts. But I would think about it within the context of the plan we have in front of you. We think it's just very good policy at this stage of the industry transformation."
"Understood. And maybe shifting gears over to Atlantic Coast, obviously we had a -- an unfavorable ruling from the Fourth Circuit on the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement. In the unfortunate event that a revised BO and ITS is also vacated again, would you mind just talking at a high level to the range of options, whether that be other sources of natural gas, other approaches, generation needs, maybe just I know, it's premature to talk in detail about what might be done, but just as I'm trying to kind of think through the range of options, would you mind just speaking to that at a high level?","Sure. There are two points I'd like to make Steven on this. And the ﬁrst one is that we are evaluating this order working closely with project partners and also Fish and Wildlife, there has been extensive work done. We're in the ﬁeld now with surveys and our intention is to work with the partners and federal agencies to address the Fourth Circuit concerns and in a manner that withstand further challenge, that is our highest priority. But I think the question that you're raising is what about the longer-term implications. And I would go to the business case for this investment and answer to that question, because the business case remains extraordinarily strong. We need this infrastructure, Eastern North Carolina needs this infrastructure, not only for the delivery of natural gas, but for continued reduction in carbon emissions as we move away from coal. And so, we will continue to pursue ways that we can get that infrastructure into the state, but our highest priority, and we think the best business case for customers is Atlantic Coast Pipeline."
Understood. Thank you very much.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Steve, could you talk about the timing of O&M that was mentioned in the quarter? Just wondering what are the issues that were being -- that contributed to diﬀerent timing of O&M throughout the year?","Yeah. What I was referring to basically relates to some outages and timing of outages year-over- year. So, you will see some non-storm O&M timing that might turn around in the second half of the year. Lynn mentioned storms in the prior-year, if you look at storm O&M in the second half of the year, if we have a more normal second half of the year, you might see some favorable O&M coming from that. But some of the non-storm O&M may turn a bit in the second half of the year, just because of timing of plant outages in that type of work. So, I was just trying to give some ﬂavor for it. We're very pleased with our eﬀorts on O&M in the ﬁrst half of the year, in response to the mild weather we saw in January and February, we enacted some eﬀorts in our O&M agility is the term we use internally to help oﬀset some of the impacts of that and that's shown up is part of the $0.07, but some of it's timing as well."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Got it, got it. And on the commercial renewables business, you're above 70% line-of-sight for the ﬁve-year plan. Is -- does that -- I mean, is there a possibility that you might be considering increasing the $2.5 billion investment plan for that segment?","That will be something Michael we look at in connection with our ﬁve-year planning process, which is underway. But as we think about the ﬁve years, given all of the other capital investment opportunities we have, we're really looking for this segment to consistently deliver kind of at the level with that in 2019. And we have a high degree of conﬁdence and its ability to do that because of the 70% that we've already locked in on growth target. So, that's probably the way I would think about it at this point, but consistent with ﬁve-year planning, we will give every segment a review and make sure it has our best thinking as we come to the street with guidance in February."
"Got you. Hey, one last question on that, on Bloom Energy. How did you guys get involved with fuel cells what was the -- how did that decision process come about? Just curious.","Michael, we have a team that is looking at what I would call customer solutions. And so, this is a team that works with large industrial, large commercial customers and really is working to customize solutions that those customers need to meet their energy requirements. It can be renewables, it can be battery technology, it can be microgrids, it could be a fuel cell technology. And so, the Bloom Investment was consistent with the growth priorities that that team is focused on, and we believe this is -- this notion of customization of energy for large energy users is a trend that will just continue to grow."
"All right, thank you very much.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time.","Hi, Julien."
"Hey, good morning. So, Lynn, just going back to some of the comments you made earlier with respect to the coal ash order with the DEQ. Can you elaborate basically on next steps after the judge's actions recently and just some of the speciﬁc nuances of how you go forward on a fuels, etc?","Sure. Simply put Julien, we're moving forward on the appeal. And so, what we would expect as a procedural calendar to come out establishing discovery and hearings and so on. And so we will continue to challenge the underlying decision itself, the science and engineering, the cost considerations, etc. We would expect the hearing to be in 2020, and we'll know more as the -- as the calendar is established. So, I think..."
Got it.,...this is a partial dismissal -- yeah partial dismissal.
"Yeah. Absolutely. Indeed. And then just if I can turn the focus back to Indiana quickly. You talk about the ﬁling here. Can you elaborate a little bit, with respect to the planning process and generation decisions. I know you talked about some acceleration here, but just more of the speciﬁcs here, I know the state has gotten a good bit of attention, so I just want to perhaps dig in a little bit?","Julien, the team in Indiana has done a lot of very good work to think about a thoughtful approach around the generation mix in the state. And so, we've put together a proposal that shortens the lives of certain of the assets and then introduces more investment in renewables and in natural gas, which you'll see in the IRP plan. So, I think the ﬁrst thing to focus on is the rate case, which will run over the next 6 months to 9 months. And then, the integrated resource plan is something that will continue to be a topic of discussion and review in the state. We   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   believe, we put together a very thoughtful approach, we've had a very active stakeholder engagement, not only with customers, but with policy makers in the state and believe we put forward a very thoughtful plan for Indiana."
"Got it. But no timeline for a further acceleration rate, it still seems like that the accelerated -- the acceleration is pretty long dated the rate for the remaining asset life?","I think, I'd ask you to look at it, because there is a fair amount of acceleration on a couple of the units. And then, those will be a topic of discussion, of course, as we go through the rate case. And when I say we put together a thoughtful plan, I think that invites and oﬀers an opportunity for further discussion, both with the regulators and with other intervening parties. And our commitment is to develop a plan to make sense for the customers of Indiana, but also continues to lower carbon and we think we've started that conversation well, with the rate case and with the IRP."
Excellent. Thank you very much for the time.,Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll next go to Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
"Thanks, so much. Hi guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Good morning. So a lot of topics covered so far. So I appreciate that. Just wanted to get a little bit more on the North Carolina, the DEQ that you just talked about. The $4 billion to $5 billion spend, if you could just dimension for us what the risks are, if you don't, -- if you're not successful in the appeal. In terms of, is it all a customer bill impact and so that's the worry or is there some concern that some part of that $4 billion to $5 billion is not recoverable?","Praful, I would make a couple of comments on that. And the ﬁrst one is that the impact of the excavation order has a very limited impact on the ﬁve-year plan. So, to $200 million to $400 million falling in that ﬁve year period, because of the time required to secure permits and construct landﬁlls and other things contemplated by the order. So we're talking about a period of time that is outside of the ﬁve years and with full excavation could extend all the way into the 2040s for certain of the sites. And so, I think what it represents is a longer closure period that, in our opinion increases costs without a measurable improvement in environmental beneﬁts and that'll be the discussion as we go forward. The North Carolina commission has approved recovery of costs for coal ash, and so, I would ask you to look at that order in terms of the precedent in the state, and we will continue to make progress on these basins. Our commitment in DEQ is exactly the same, which is to them some safely and that's where our focus remains as we pursue these legal matters and some ﬁne-tuning of the approach over the long-term to close the basins."
Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just the same color on the South Carolina side in terms of appealing the cases there. Could you give us some color on the speciﬁc issues that you're more focused on and how you see that playing out?,"Sure. In South Carolina, Praful, we are awaiting a ﬁnal order on the cases. So we've gotten the directive, we've gotten the rehearing, but the actual order on rehearing has not yet been ﬁled. We would expect it in the next period of time, and then we have 30-days to appeal the order, which we intend to do, and we would appeal to the Supreme Court in South Carolina.  The disallowance of coal ash costs will be a part of that appeal. And I think it's important to recognize that the precedent between North and South Carolina is a long-standing one, where the beneﬁts between the two states are shared on generation and transmission, and remediation of coal ash would be a part of the decommissioning of plants and those plants have been share the beneﬁts of those plants with South Carolina customers over their entire life.  I think it's also important to recognize that both the federal and the state laws established safe basin closure methods and excavation is an option in both. And so, we would intend to continue to pursue this. I think the time frame you should think about is probably one to two years to work through the process, but the clock doesn't start until we get the order and then   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   ﬁle the appeal within 30-days. So we'll continue to keep you posted as it moves through the process."
"Got you. Thank you. And then just ﬁnally in terms of, clearly you're having a strong ﬁrst half, is there any assumption on incremental O&M being put forward given you have some budget or some room in your numbers to kind of maintain within the guidance. Just wanted to understand kind of any shaping on the O&M side for the second half?","Well, Praful, that capability to move O&M back and forth and toggle, it based upon results is a core skill set that we have. It remains to be seen in the second half of the year, dependent upon weather, storm activity and those kind of things, weather will pull those levers. But I mentioned, we pulled some of them in response to the mild weather in the ﬁrst couple of months of the year. We have the capability of redirecting O&M in diﬀerent fashion, when we see favorable results as well. But I don't want to give any ﬁrm guidance going forward, we still got the third quarter to go and weather and storms sit in front of us, but we do have that capability.     And Praful, the objective of all of this is to deliver on our commitment around the guidance that we've provided for the street and that's the way we will approach this."
"I understood. Thanks so much guys, and congratulations.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Hey guys, just wanted to ask about...",Hi Michael.
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   ... hey, Lynn. I wanted to ask about North Carolina renewables and can you remind us, A, what's already in your forecast for the amount of renewables you're building in North Carolina? We've already gotten approval through the RFP process. And then can you remind us what the limits are and how much do you think you could wind up doing kind of beyond what's already known or in your plan?","Yes, Michael, I'll take that. And regarding the limits to the HB 589 regulations, there is a limit to our bidding and winning bids to 30% of the tranches that are going to be bid over the next several years. There is no limit to subsequent acquisition of another bid -- winning bidders part interest. So, ultimately, we could own a higher percentage than 30% of the renewables assets from HB 589.  I think for planning purposes, we've got about 30% in our plan. We have typically thought about that being in the commercial renewables segment, but it could be within the regulated business segment or the commercial renewables. The ﬁrst tranche that was awarded of a roughly 600 megawatts between regulated and commercial, where we got about a third of that. So I think, that's a reasonable planning assumption going forward."
"So roughly, a couple of hundred megawatts a year install run rate or is that a couple of hundred megawatts over several year period?","It will depend upon how much is bid through the process. We saw 600 megawatts, initially, it was 680 megawatts, but it's only 600 megawatts was awarded. The -- if the tranches stayed at that level, and then it might be in the ballpark of 150 megawatts to 200 megawatts. The tranches going forward may be smaller than that as we grandfather other renewables into the process. But you can think about those numbers as a reasonable numbers to think about."
"Got it. Thank you. Much appreciate it, guys.","Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead."
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.,Hi Sophie. Thank you.     Thank you.
"Hello. I wanted to also ask a question on renewables and maybe from an angle that it's clearly been a very successful program for you and an attractive niche and is there a way to do more along those lines in addition to these tranches, maybe just strictly in the commercial renewables space and how -- what's your view on the probability that we're going to see some ITC, PTC extensions?","A couple of things here on the tranches of renewables that come through the HB 589, we'll continue to participate at that level. We think it makes sense, we know the service area, and we know the grid surrounding these assets. So, again, I think that will continue to be fruitful for us over the next several years. Regarding ITC and PTC extensions, again we've heard nothing about extending that speciﬁcally, they are set to expire and that is what we're basing our plans upon is that, those particular tax beneﬁts will begin to wind down.     And Sophie, we commented a moment ago on the strengths of the pipeline that sits in the commercial business, we feel very conﬁdent with our ability to deliver what's in our ﬁve-year plan, and have a robust pipeline to support that. I think, in terms of the congressional extension of the credits, there is some discussion underway about that, we have been supporters of Congress's bipartisan agreement to phase them down. We believe that the economic competitiveness of the resource is very attractive, and as a result, are supportive of that phased down. But I think, we'll have to see what plays out as the process continues in Washington."
"Got you. Thank you. And then maybe, if I may a quick follow-up on the coal ash in South Carolina. So, your appeal right now this is a State Supreme Court correct, but ultimately...",Yeah.
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   ... the issue is how this cost would be allocated between two diﬀerent states. And should we expect this litigation ultimately ﬁnd its way to the federal court?,"No. I would --I believe the South Carolina Supreme Court is where it will be decided Sophie and there is a great deal of precedent over decades around the allocation of costs between North and South Carolina. We run the generation and transmission system as a system between North and South Carolina and have very established methods of allocating proﬁts. And so, we will present -- be presenting very strong arguments on those costs and believe that it will be resolved at the Supreme Court level in South Carolina."
"Got it. Thank you very much, very helpful color.","Thank you, Sophie.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Our IR team will be available this afternoon as usual to answer any follow-up questions and we look forward to seeing many of you in the weeks to come. Thanks, so much.  Operator  Thank you.
