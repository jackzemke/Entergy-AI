Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Hi, Shar.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Good morning."
"So appreciate your prepared remarks around House Bill 951, Lynn. Where are we in the process as it stands today? Are you still optimistic? I mean, couldn't help, but notice some of the lack of bipartisanship going on. Should we be sort of concerned here at this stage?","Shar, the bill is moving and we are encouraged by what we're seeing. I think, you'd know that it passed the House, we've seen support from senate leadership, the energy legislation remains a priority and the governor has been clear for some time about his strong commitment to carbon reduction and to renewable investment in the state. So we're encouraged that the legislative branch, executive branch, and all of the broad stakeholders involved in this process will ﬁnd common ground. And that has been the long history in North Carolina of bringing diverse parties together in advancing energy policy."
"And just -- I want to just elaborate a little bit around sort of the common ground. And I know this isn't obviously a Duke Energy bill, and there's a lot of stakeholders involved. But passage of it is going to obviously impact your clean energy transition, right? In the state. Investors kind of want to know if there is a possibility of compromise i.e. between the draft bill versus legislators versus the governor's very vocal comments, right? It's not really your call, but could we see a faster coal retirement outlook, may be a little less dependency on gas, a bit more solar. I mean, the governor wants more. So do you see a path forward to kind of maybe bridge this sort of bid ask that's out there?","Shar, we do. And I think your comments around it's comprehensive, there are many elements to it, you have a broad range of stakeholders. It is natural and expected that there are going to be diﬀerent points of view in that conversation. And what HB951 does is it outlines a path to a clean energy transition, and the discussion is centering around that pace the cost, maintaining reliability, and we would expect that legislators and the administration will evaluate all portions of this draft bill to ﬁnd the right balance. So I think advancing clean energy transition remains a priority for the state and its leaders as well as its broad range of stakeholders, and we will keep you informed as the bill continues to move."
"Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. That's all I have.","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)  Thank you. Thank you, Shar.  Operator   Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.     Hi, Julien."
"Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Hey, thank you for the time.","We can.     Sure, we can."
"So at risk of asking more on the legislation, perhaps I can pivot a little bit more strategically here if you don't mind. And I'd love to hear if you have any latest thoughts with regards to undertaking any further review of the company. I know that there's been a lot of, shall we say, noise out there. And I would love to hear your latest thoughts therein. I'll leave it as open-ended as you'd like to comment.","Sure. Julien, I assume that's a comment about Elliott Management. And so let me just answer it in that context and then we can take it any place you want to go. We regularly engage with our shareholders, we regularly review our portfolio, our operations and business strategy. And it has -- our approach around engagement has been similar with Elliott, and we have been in discussions with them for over a year, comprehensively reviewing all of the ideas, engaging advisors when we need to and discussing with our Board all of these ideas. And it's not appropriate for me to comment any further on the speciﬁcs, but I would conﬁrm to you that we remain open to constructive engagement, we'll evaluate all proposals, act on those, that we believe, delivers value to our stakeholders.  And I would also say that we remain focused on the serving of customers, maintaining our assets, advancing the strategic priorities around our clean energy transition, and that remains unchanged as well.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the thoughts. Perhaps if I can pivot a little bit diﬀerently here, as you think about the non-utility side of the business, can you comment at all on just thoughts on scaling that or not? Obviously, it's not been too core of a focus of late, but given some of the pressures across the wider renewable businesses out there, would be curious what you're seeing, if that's impacting any of your timeline and/or aspirations in business put all together.","And Julien, we just crossed an important milestone of renewables, so 10,000 megawatts of renewables, which includes both regulated and non-regulated investment. And we see the growth of renewable energy is important to the clean energy transition. Our commercial team continues to deliver. They are forecasting to achieve $200 million to $250 million per year and have been consistent in accomplishing that. So it remains an important part of the company, it remains an important part of our commitment around carbon reduction or ESG story in general. And the team is on track to deliver in 2021, 2022 and beyond."
"Right, excellent. And just to clarify, and to the extent that which you would get this legislation done, I know, it's always diﬃcult to say. But any updated thoughts at the end of the forecast period, how that might change as you reﬁne your planning, might be a little bit early. And I know it's transient what could ultimately be included. But I ﬁgure, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask.","Sure. No. Julien, the plan that we've put in front of you, 2021 to 2025, is not dependent on legislation. We have a high degree of conﬁdence in the ability to achieve our 5% to 7% growth rate. But as we talked about in October of last year and we opened the horizon to what the back half of the decade could look like, we do see acceleration of capital, not only in pursuit of retirement of assets and building replacement generation, but also our grid investment as well. So we'll continue to update this in the ordinary course giving you a view in February of what we think 2026 looks like, but we continue to expect acceleration of capital in the back half of the decade."
"Okay. All right, we'll clarify that later. Thank you so much and best of luck here.",Thanks so much.  Operator  Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
"Hi. Good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan.     Good morning."
"Just on the North Carolina process, last quarter, then you sort of dissuaded us from being overly concerned about any particular dates. But could you just remind us sort of what the timing in the legislature is through the rest of the year? And if anything we should be looking out for -- procedurally or is it essentially open-ended?","Sure. Jonathan, what I would say is that the timing is diﬃcult to predict in these processes. It is within the hands of the legislative leadership, and we will know more as the bill progresses through the Senate. There was in fact a hearing this morning in the Senate. So we'll continue to keep you updated. I think you know that the long session in North Carolina does not have a statutory end date. So we will continue to monitor as it moves through the Senate process."
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then just, I noticed the comment on feeling that you are trending towards the top half of the sales or load forecast for this year. Does that sort of translate into how you feel you're tracking on earnings as well or are there other things that are weighing on the other side?","Jonathan, we will reset and give you a ﬁner look at where we were trending in the guidance range after third quarter. I mean, there's just so much weather volatility here in the Southeast, we have hurricane season underway. So we will continue to monitor that and give you an update third quarter. But I would say we're oﬀ to a strong start, strong start on the economic rebound, strong start on maintaining our focus on O&M, delivering on our key milestones around regulatory approvals et cetera. So I'm pleased with where we are, and also pleased to see the economic recovery. Those strong results on commercial and industrial are indicative of the economy opening up and I think that's a good thing."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Great. Thank you. Just one -- very quick one on -- the annual savings you talked about for the oﬃce reconﬁguration, were those sort of pre-tax or after-tax number, the $25 million to $30 million.","That's a pre-tax number, Jonathan."
"Great. Thank you, Steve.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Thanks. Good morning,","Hi, Steve.     Good morning."
"Hi, Lynn and Steve. So this may have -- I think, this may have been asked a little bit, but just wanted to better clarify the -- as we're watching the IRP and the diﬀerent scenarios that come out, how should we think about what's embedded in your current capital plan versus what might be incremental? Or is it just mainly focused on beyond the current capital plan?","So Steve, the capital plan is basically the base of the IRP. And so you should think about it that way, the six scenarios as you move further to the right and you introduce additional technologies in the timeframe. That's where the legislation begins to come in, giving us some ﬂexibility to move more rapidly on some of the retirements et cetera.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   So when we talk about the implications of how IRP ﬁts with the legislation, we've got a clear line of sight 2021 to 2025 based on present law, based on the present processes, present regulatory processes. And the opportunity really exists in the back half of the decade. So that's how I would respond. I don't know, Steve, if you'd add anything to that?     Yes. So I think as you move towards a more rapid decarbonization number then the capital increases, I think, within our current ﬁve-year plan, the upside would be at the back end of things, so to give that texture to it."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll hear next from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Excuse me.
"Hey, good morning, team.",Good morning.
Most -- good morning.,Good morning.
"Most of my questions have been answered, good morning, Steve. Just maybe big picture, Lynn, sort of what are -- sort of what are you and some of the other utility leaders are looking at Washington, the Infrastructure Bill sort of is being debated today, and then the reconciliation bill going into year-end. Maybe sort of -- what are sort of the top two or -- two or three things that you see coming out between now and year-end which impacts the sector?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Yes, Durgesh, I would say the infrastructure bill will continue to make its path. We're supportive of a bipartisan approach. I think, as an infrastructure builder, our success over many years has been in a bipartisan framework. We're encouraged by the focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure, as you know, that's been a priority for Duke. We have about a $100 million targeted on that investment, and there's certainly potential to expand it.  The President today also has been advocating for 40% to 50% of vehicles, electric vehicles by 2030. We are also pleased to see investment in zero and low-carbon technologies like advanced nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, because we believe those technologies are important for a net-zero world. So that's what I would say around infrastructure. I think on the remaining reconciliation process, tax policy, climate legislation are all being discussed. I think it's too early to tell how those shape up, but we are engaged with the administration and with congress, really talking about the tools that would be helpful for us to pursue our clean energy strategy, and see a lot of alignment over time. But as you know, in a tight Senate and House, it can be challenging at times to ﬁnd the right path, but we remain engaged."
Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll hear next from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.
"Hi, good morning.",Hi Jeremy.     Good morning.
"Hi. Just want to start oﬀ here. Thinking about the energy transition kind of from a diﬀerent perspective, I know, Duke has some irons in the ﬁre with regards to RNG investments. But do   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   you see any potential to kind of upsize this, increase this over time? Are there policies out there at the federal, state level that could be helpful in these eﬀorts?","We are getting started, I would say, Jeremy, on RNG. It's consistent with our overall climate targets, certainly our goals -- 100% methane goal, et cetera, and working actively to learn more about the technology, learn more about how it impacts our system and have made some very strategic investments. And so I do think there's an opportunity for it to develop over time, and the team is working actively with policymakers, with the communities, suppliers that would be relevant to this. And I think it will be a bigger story as we move forward."
"Got it, that's helpful. And then could you give any more color just kind of pivoting here on what we should be looking for with the IRP ﬁling in Indiana later this year? What are some of the considerations versus maybe what we saw coming out of the Carolinas last year?","It's a really good question, Jeremy, because we are in the midst of stakeholder engagement in Indiana as well, engagement with the environmental community, with our large customers, certainly, the regulators and other policymakers who are relevant to that process. The goal is decarbonizing, the goal is diversifying. And if you look at our last IRP that we ﬁled in Indiana, we had about 2,300, 2,400 megawatts of solar starting in 2023. We would expect that to grow.  And so we've got a couple of more months here in working through the stakeholder process. But we see this as a next step where we -- in the rate case, we accelerated retirement dates of coal plants, the IRP gives us a chance to expand that discussion on clean energy transition over the next 20 years. And I think, it's an important part of the ongoing conversation in Indiana on how the state will position itself for growth in the clean energy transition. So more to come on that. And as we look forward to November third quarter call, EEI, et cetera, we'll have more that we can share around Indiana."
Got it. That's very helpful. Just a real quick last one for me. We've very recently seen some utility peers beef up their corporate governance with certain actions. I was just wondering if Duke has considered taking actions like this?,"I think Duke has a strong track record on governance, Jeremy. If you were to look back at the feedback we've received from shareholders and the additional disclosures and adoption of certain practices that we've followed, we have been very open-minded about these and we'll continue to do so. So that becomes a key focus here in the fall as we engage with the shareholders, speciﬁcally focused on ESG topics. Our corporate governance committee is very   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   involved in that, the Board is very involved in some of the conversations with shareholders as well. So you can expect us to continue to be responsive to our shareholders in this regard."
Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.,All right. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We'll hear next from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hey, guys. Hey, Lynn.","Hi, Michael.     Hey, Michael."
"Thank you guys for taking my question. Just curious, how are you all thinking about the commercial power business and what the growth proﬁle of that business looks like over the next couple of years relative to investing in renewables in the regulated business? I guess to simplify, what's a better return on capital? Investing in renewables outside of the regulated utility or within the regulated utility, if you could allocate capital only to one of those alternatives?","Michael, it's a really good question, because we have -- we do a lot of work around capital allocation. Of course, what meets the needs of our customers, what ﬁts the policy of our state, what delivers the highest return, those are all key considerations. And our Commercial Renewables business has performed well against our benchmarks of what we expect from that business in terms of returns. But what you're suggesting is, as we see more opportunity in the regulated business, how will that impact commercial? And I would say that'll be very closely reviewed as part of our capital allocation plan going forward.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I think you also know that we entered a joint venture with John Hancock on the commercial renewable business recycling, that capital in a way that has been quite eﬀective and those are the types of transactions we will also evaluate over time. We like the business in the context of our ongoing ESG story and our pursuit of carbon reduction, but we'll closely scrutinize how capital is allocated."
"Got it. Also one follow up, a number of your peers, some of the other large caps, I think Exelon or AEP, have made investments in -- they're almost like venture capital like investments in various clean energy related companies, some of which have gone public in the last 6 to 12 months. Just curious, does Duke have similar type of investments? And have you ever made any disclosure? Are any of them material or something that would show up in kind of the income statement over time?","No. So Michael, we are active in this area and do make investments. Let me ask Steve to comment. We look at it from a couple of perspectives. Certainly, there's an opportunity to earn a return. But as importantly, there's an opportunity to learn about what's going on in various technology development and various methods of technologies to serve customers, technologies that could advance carbon reduction. And as part of our treasury corporate development organization, we are focused on investment in that area in a way that complements our business.     Yes. I would add that we have made investments in various venture funds, and we work closely with the fund managers to understand what the investment proﬁle is? And as Lynn said, it's aligned with our strategy, looks at things like EVs and new technologies. And we also ensure that there is communication among our operating folks with the funds in the companies that we invest in. So we can transfer learnings there, and we've had some good success there. It's not been material, but we're certainly learning a lot from it."
"Got it. Thank you, guys.","Thanks, Michael.  Operator  Thank you. We'll take our ﬁnal question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Steve. Thanks for taking my questions.",Good morning.     Sure.
"Just I guess a quick question. Earlier in the year, Duke had been able to resolve rate case in North Carolina, Florida. I think last year, you resolved Indiana. But just are there any other Duke properties or Duke utilities under-earning allowed and maybe creating more of a headwind than you thought versus when you went in the year? I think you provided some disclosure on the fourth quarter slide deck of maybe adjusted book ROEs going into the year. Just is everyone on target or is some of them maybe performing better than you thought or less than you thought?","Anthony, they're performing well. We do look over time at our allowed returns and we've got a good history across our footprint of earning at or even above our allowed returns. And they'll move around a bit as you're building a rate base for an upcoming rate case. So you'll see some movement around the return based upon some of those proﬁles. But we feel good about our regulatory cadence, and our investments around that cadence, and the execution has been good, and the Indiana case and the Carolinas case are coming through nicely and we're preparing for the future cases that Lynn was discussing and we think that process is working well.     And Anthony, I would just add Just add that Steve runs a tight process around optimizing capital to make sure it's getting spent at a time that matches with that regulatory calendar. So we do all that we know to do to minimize lag.     Right.     And the result of that is that we have a good track record of earning our return."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Great. And just a last one for me. You may have touched on it earlier, Lynn, in a question I think on maybe some stuﬀ going on in Washington. There's talk of maybe a nuclear legislation or some maybe a subsidy for nuclear plants. You're talking about license extension on Oconee. Just any thoughts to maybe your view on nuclear legislation that maybe part of the infrastructure bill, and will -- would it impact Duke?","So Anthony, we are strong supporters of nuclear as you know. And I think, as you look here in the Carolinas in particular, 50% of the power comes from nuclear across the entire enterprise, 80% of our carbon free generation is from nuclear. So we are very active. We intend to pursue second license renewal as you indicated. And the discussion in Washington has really centered more around the plants that are exposed to markets, commercial markets, so think about plants in PJM and otherwise.  But we have had discussions with a number of people about the importance of nuclear in the transition, and I do believe it is being recognized by the administration and by Congress. And so that's, important area of advocacy for us. Not only in existing plants, but on new technologies that would keep nuclear as part of the solution set for the clean energy transition."
Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a solid quarter.,"Thanks so much.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Let me turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for closing remarks.     Well, thank you, Cody, and thanks to all of you who participated today, for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. And as always, we're available for further discussion in the IR team, Steve, and I as well. So thanks again for participating.  Operator  Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.
