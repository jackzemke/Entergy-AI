Question,Answer
Hi guys. It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. How are you?,"We're good Jamieson, and welcome."
"Thank you. Well good morning and thank you for taking my question. Lynn at a high level. We were wondering, how should we think about the carbon plan that you'll be ﬁling in May versus what will become the ﬁnal version in the order required by December 31st, who's going to be weighing in on it or contributing to it? And as a follow-up how will it diﬀer from say a traditional IRP.","Well Jamieson, thank you for that question. And the work is already underway to develop the plan. We had our ﬁrst stakeholder meeting just a week or so ago. And there are additional meetings planned and I would share with you that it will be a review of the full range of existing and potential resources to achieve the objective. We envision putting forward multiple scenarios as we did in the 2020 IRP, so that we have a good discussion weight costs and beneﬁts of the various resource types. And it's also going to have good discussion about reliability and aﬀordability coupled with environmental achievement.  So I would expect it to be somewhat similar in concept to what we produced in 2020 Jamieson, because there will be a variety of portfolios, but as always well informed by our stakeholders and directed towards achieving what the legislature has set out for us which is 70% carbon by reduction by 2030."
"Got it. Got it. Thank you for that. And second question we had here was under the items to monitor on Slide 12. You mentioned supply chain constraint at EEI back in November, the take away that people seemed to have for meetings with both Duke and echoed by other large utilities, was that you weren't really seeing much impact at that time from supply chain constraints. What's changed since EEI and just another follow-up on that, how much of these supply chain constraints are speciﬁcally related to renewables. And then for the non-renewable portion, what does that consist of.  Yes, it's a good question because it's a dynamic area and I would say generally that the scope and scale of our company has positioned us really well on supply chain considerations. We've done a very good job of expanding our horizons to look at demand leveraging long-term contracts, leveraging what we maintain an inventory. So, we have not seen an impact on the   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   majority, if signiﬁcantly, of the capital plans that we have in place. But we have experienced some impact from solar panels and you'll see us, we talked a little bit about this, in the third quarter call evaluating what it might mean, so we are pushing some projects and commercial renewables in particular to 2023. We've been able to achieve all of our dates of regulated renewables however. So I would leave you with the fact that it's a dynamic area. There are areas where lead times are increasing, but we feel well positioned given the scale of the company and the approach that we're taking to manage what our customers require.  Got it, thank you very much for that and appreciate you taking the time. I will hop back in the queue.",Thank you.
"Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America, please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning. Thank you so much.",Hi Julien.
"Hey, thank you. So maybe if I can -- I mean maybe the ﬁrst question is perhaps two parts. First '22 guidance, you have a lot of interesting tailwinds here. O&M, load growth, both accelerating obviously disappointing on the renewables, but that seems to be pervasive. Can you talk about maybe latitude within this guidance range? Certainly, considering that accelerating load growth, really is a meaningful driver. And then secondly just related to that and I suspect this is perhaps part of the reason for the guidance range. Can you talk about your conﬁdence on the ability to cut a $100 million in costs with the backdrop of inﬂation admittedly elsewhere in the sector.","Yes. So I'll take a shot and I'm sure Steve will have something to add. Julien, I believe what we've put forward for 2022 is a very strong growth story. It's built on Florida, the Carolinas, Midwest, gas rate cases, load growth, O&M cost management all the things that you referenced.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   I also believe that the increase in capital that we put forward should give you conﬁdence that we're going to keep going and have the investment portfolio to drive 5% to 7%.  In 2022, though I also think it's important to recognize we have some foundational work underway, in the Carolinas legislation was a hallmark in 2021, but we're in the regulatory process in 2022, we're waiting for guidance on the performance-based ratemaking, we're waiting for guidance on securitization we have a carbon plan to ﬁle and so that will be additional important work in 2022 that will set us up for the future.  In terms of inﬂation, we are seeing labor inﬂation as the one thing I would point to and if you look at our trajectory, we're recommending ﬂat, we will go at it as hard as we can but we will also make sure we have the talent and capability from line workers to our software engineers to do what this business requires and our customers' demand.  So I feel like we've taken all of these variables together and not only put together a strong plan for 2022 but also a strong plan for '23 and beyond. Steve how would you add?     I might add a couple of things on the cost side. We took 200 million out sustainable as we had promised. And we've delivered on that, we've got 2,000 less employees at Duke Energy than we did a year ago. We retired ﬁve coal units, and that takes out some O&M there but we're going to keep moving forward our scope and scale allows us to do this. We've completely redone our real estate footprint, taking advantage of COVID immediately. On the real estate savings, we're going to continue to drive out eﬃciencies. And utilize technology to displace the need for other costs, and we've had success for the past ﬁve years of doing that, of driving O&M down. We put plant O&M into our trajectory in response to what is inﬂation there. But we're going to continue to hammer away at it and we've got the tools to do that. We'll see where that goes but out of respect for the trends we see on cost we ﬂattened it out, but we're going to be driving hard at it Julien."
Excellent.,"And I think when you step back and look at guidance, maybe just one comment on guidance Julien. We feel like it's a very strong growth story. You may remember that, we've reset the 5% to 7% for the ﬁrst time oﬀ of 5.15. We believe this is a very strong start and we'll be working hard not only to hit these numbers but if circumstances are such we can exceed them, we'll do that. But we believe this is a compelling growth story."
"I hear you loud and clear on that, last comment. And in fact, if I can ask you this little bit reverse. I mean, clearly you're hitting these '22 numbers considering commercial renewables being a little lower and some of that being delayed. Does that actually conversely mean that '23 and '24   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   could actually be sort of a bumper crop year with respect to some of the renewable contributions and especially relative to your historic 200 to 250 guidance.","Julien, we are evaluating capital allocation on renewables. In Steve's comments you might have noticed we said as we ramp-up further investment in the Carolinas and in Florida around renewables, so we will make the right decision on where we invest, the renewable capital. I think the planning assumption of $200 million to $250 million is still reasonable for commercial but know that we're also going to be adding a lot of renewables on those regulated businesses."
"Understood. Excellent. I'll leave it there. All the best, speak to you soon.","Thank you Julien, thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead."
Hi. Good morning.,Hi. Stephen     Good morning.
"Good morning, I was interested in your latest thinking in terms of some form of federal clean energy legislation. I know there has been a lot of dialogue. You all have been very involved. I know in dialogue there, so just curious your latest take on the prospects for passage at the federal level.","Stephen it is hard to handicap because we don't have a vehicle yet. There are a variety of other topics being discussed within that construct of what the administration would like to move. But it is our conviction that the clean energy tax provisions would be very helpful not only to   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   support the transformation that's underway at Duke but throughout the industry and also allow us to lower the price of that transformation. For a regulated company those tax incentives, have a direct impact on our price to customers. So we are strong advocates for it. We actually believe that nuclear is a great recognition of that resource. Some of the modernization around solar to introduce PTCs the opportunity to have direct pay. All of these things we believe could be helpful in this transformation that we're pursuing so aggressively."
"That's helpful. Thank you. And then I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions on renewable supply chain, I wanted to drill in on solar a little bit -- a little bit more, wondered if you could provide any anything speciﬁc in terms of just the rough magnitude of cost increases you are seeing and also, if you could speak to just physical availability of panels and in '22 and the outlook there, just curious for a little more -- little more color there.","Yes, and Stephen I would point to availability as the ﬁrst and most gating item because of some of the restrictions around trade and other things. There has been an issue around availability and certain suppliers have said, we can't meet the timeframe. And as a result of that you then begin looking for alternatives and those alternatives can be more expensive.  So we have made a decision to push some of our projects into '23. We're very conﬁdent in our projects that we have identiﬁed for '23 that we have appropriate supply and are ready to go. But that's what I would share with you, the gating issue has been availability. And then, as you pursue alternatives, price can become an issue."
"That's helpful and maybe just following up on that and then I'll pass it to someone else. Just on the magnitude of push back of projects in terms of sort of gigawatts, what sort of rough magnitude are you thinking that you want to push into '23?","Stephen as I look at what we have put forward as guidance, we're at $150 million for the commercial business. We had been targeting $200 million to $250 million. So I would think about a couple of projects that are being pushed from '22 to '23.     So it, might be in the neighborhood of 400 megawatts, 500 megawatts something of that nature. And then we'll look at again '23 as we approach it to see what makes sense based on the projects that are there and the returns, as we move forward. But I still think around the $200 million to $250 million as the reasonable planning assumption for what we'll do.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And Stephen a moment ago I also noted we were able to complete all of the regulated renewable projects and have secured supply for them for 2022. So, we're doing some balancing here and believe that the net result of all of this puts us in a strong position to achieve our objectives."
Very clear and very helpful. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research, please go ahead.     Good morning, Steve."
"Hi, good morning. Hi Lynn. Just -- can you just conﬁrm whether you're still expecting to get the multi-year rate plan proposal out today? The performance-based ratemaking and just what are the key items that we should be watching in that?","Yes, and we expected this week, I guess we're sitting here on Thursday, Steve. It could come out today. I think the 10th was the plan. We are expecting it and we'll get something out from Investor Relations when that rulemaking appears."
Okay. So just to see what it has to say.,"Yes, we're back in constructive rulemaking."
"Great. And then in terms of when you -- you kind of referenced both in the upside drivers for the long-term plan and I think Steve's comments on things that could lead you to look at equity needs, the tax policy. Could you just kind of give a little more sense on what you're referring to   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   there? Is it -- that if we get favorable renewable tax policy, you might invest a lot more capital and thus with that also have some equity needs or is it something at beyond that?","Steve, it's actually a reverse of that. Because if we get constructive tax policy, think about direct pay, think about nuclear PTC that is very favorable from a cash ﬂow standpoint. And that gives us an opportunity to consider potentially additional capital but you should think about that as an infusion of cash, into the plan in a way that could be quite helpful."
"Makes sense. So then when you talk about tax policy as something that may have equity, does that more the corporate tax changes.","Yeah, there's the linkage of tax policy and equity needs is not what as you're thinking about it Steve. We included that to say, that could be a reason to reduce the need for equity even beyond '26."
Got it,Depending on what is happening. So there are positive and negatives on that.     Yes. We were looking at cash ﬂow changes as well as capital changes and the tax policy is very beneﬁcial from a tax standpoint.
Okay. I thought those were things that would only create equity needs not the ones that would alarm. That's why it didn't make sense to me.,Yes
"Okay, great. Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)",I'm glad we had a chance to clear that up. Thank you.
Yes.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan."
Hi.,Good morning.
"The last quarter you were talking about 2% to 2.5% sales growth for the full year and I felt like you were sounding more conﬁdent towards the upper end perhaps and came in at 2%. And then looking at the release, if I'm reading it correctly you actually had weather normal sales go down in the fourth quarter and industrial tick-oﬀ about 5%. So I just can you give us a little color on what was behind and I wasn't necessarily expecting to see a down fourth quarter in industrial I guess quite yet.","Well, I think when you're looking at a AVA for the quarter, the fourth quarter of the previous year was starting to pick up quite a bit. So there's some comparative things there. I think, as we move forward, what we're really projecting here is that we're going to catch up by the end of '22 to where we would have been prior to COVID hitting, when you just take 2019 and extrapolate out.  So, I wouldn't look at any one particular quarter comparison to another quarter as you could have shutdowns at certain industries and that nature that might impact the stats. But looking   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   broadly across a, what we see is returned by the end of '22 to where we were at prior to COVID. And then we've got pretty ﬂattish load growth assumed from that point forward. We feel good about '22 growth across the board, we've added a lot of customers as we alluded to. And customers moving into the area, that'll drive commercial, education healthcare retail, that picks up. And then when we look across our industrial base and talk to our industrial customers, we've got such a diverse body of industrial customers, no one customer SIC code is greater than 10%. We see them optimistic about further growth in '22. So I'd think about that a bit more than just a quarter versus quarter examination."
"May I just ask you, can you talk a little bit about how the pathways to sort of integrating North and South Carolina around the carbon plan, given some of the recent developments in the South, and I guess you were trying to pull, have a joint proceeding, but that looks like it may not happen now. So this was -- how do we bring this forward on a dual track maybe.","Sure. And Jonathan, North and South Carolina have found a way over decades to work together and have developed a joint electric system that delivers aﬀordable and reliable power, but they've also beneﬁted from infrastructure investment in both states, six nuclear power plants, three in North Carolina and three in South Carolina.  So we are optimistic that we'll be able to develop resource plans that meet the needs of both states. There are of course diﬀerent but both are interested in clean energy, clean energy transition renewables et cetera.  The joint hearing that we suggested and work toward was an innovative idea, we thought it would be an opportunity for the states to engage, but it's not the only way. And as we think about the future and the number of proceedings that will unfold over the next several years with resource additions and potential retirements, there will be plenty of opportunity for the states to work together in a way that makes sense for their policies.  We'd also expect South Carolina to be at the table in the stakeholder meetings over the course of 2022, I know they are not only interested in what it means for customers around aﬀordability and resiliency but also what it means in terms of investment. And I think there is a lot here for both states and we're anxious to work towards something that makes sense for everyone."
Okay. What would be the next data point in South Carolina. What is the path there?,"Hey, Jonathan, I would I'm not going to point to a speciﬁc milestone but rather say that we will update you on these stakeholder engagements, we'll update you on the carbon plan as that gets ﬁnalized, to the extent there are ﬁlings that we might make in South Carolina. We'll of   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   course, give updates on that. So you could expect this to unfold not only over the course of '22, but into '23 as well. And South Carolina will be at the table every step of the way."
Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI India, please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions.",Good morning.
"Good morning, Lynn. Just can I clarify in terms of O&M savings target for 2022? I heard you say, $200 million in savings in 2021. What is embedded in the 2022 guidance is it ﬂat O&M '22 to 2021 or are we modeling decreases further from the 2021 levels.","We've assumed ﬂat O&M in '22 compared to 2021. The $200 million was taken out in '21 and is sustainable. So, it'll be in there but we're assuming it's ﬂat in '22 and throughout our plan. But what I would point to is we have a strong track record of ﬁnding O&M savings across our footprint and none of that has stopped and we've got inﬂationary issues that everybody has heard about. So we ﬂattened it out but we're certainly continuing to drive to ﬁnd the opportunities to utilize that capital technology to take out variable O&M and that goes on every day."
"Got it. Thank you, Steve. And then just in terms of your comment the potentially higher growth rate in the back half of the plant in the upper half of the 5% to 7% is that driven by basically you getting regulatory approvals. Perhaps even, stronger-than-expected customer load, what gives you sort of what would drive that higher growth rate in the upper half, in the back half of the plan.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","I would think about the work that's underway in 2022 Durgesh around the Carolinas. So we have -- legislation has been passed but we have regulatory proceedings underway to set the course on the performance-based ratemaking and on the plan. That of course will begin to be executed in '23 and '24. So there's going to be a sort of back half approach around the capital and the regulatory modernization in the Carolinas. And then further in Indiana, the IRP was ﬁled in December. We're anticipating RFPs and potentially CPCNs to be ﬁled in 2022. That would begin the execution of the next phase of the transition in Indiana as well. So those are a couple of things that I would point to. That are important as you think about the end of this ﬁve-year plan, the remaining years in this decade."
Got it. Thank you so much. Appreciate the color.,"Thank you.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan, please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning.",Hi Jeremy.     Good morning.
"I just wanted to touch on ﬁnancing a bit more if I could here and just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on the 2022 hybrid security funding. What kind of -- what could that look like what type of size could that part B? And then separately looking forward, we've talked about the robust capital opportunities that you've highlighted throughout the call.  How should we think about equity needs over the course of the ﬁve year plan and beyond and I know you talked in the script about alternatives and look it just looking for a little bit more color.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   What the alternatives could be, could this be other DI-type transactions or maybe monetizing commercial renewables just trying to see what possibilities are out there.","Yes, a couple of things there. When we look at our ﬁnancing plan, I don't have any speciﬁcs on what hybrid security might look like, but we always consider those. There are times where those can certainly make sense when the value they can bring in the price makes sense to us. So we'll always allude to that as a possibility there but nothing speciﬁc on that front. When you think about the ﬁve-year and we put together a plan here that we do not believe, we need any incremental equity beyond the $1 billion of the second tranche of the GIC deal, that will be coming in within the next 12 months.  We think we've got regulatory constructs in place across our jurisdiction that are very eﬃcient. And we have regulatory plans to make those investments and through those regulatory constructs, we've also got a great ability to control costs. We've shown that. And that helps the bottom line metrics as well. So no equity ﬁnancing plans through the plant.  Now, as we move through the decade for the circumstances that Lynn had described, we could see needs coming at us, we'll utilize the most eﬃcient form of raising equity, and we've shown great ability to do that through traditional methods through non-traditional, through monetization of businesses, we'll look at all of that, we're well aware of our portfolios value. It's good to have that optionality."
"Got it. That's helpful there. And then kind of pivoting here. You talk about carbon capture, hydrogen nuclear. Just wondering how far are these technologies from being widely adopted in your view here and are these items that can drive upside to the 10-year outlook or are they kind of longer-dated and then speciﬁcally with CCUS just wondering what stakeholder views are like there and what discussions have been like with the regulators on CCUS in your jurisdiction?","I think this is an important discussion to progress in this decade. And so the awareness around hydrogen, the awareness around advanced nuclear the awareness around what might be possible on CCUS is something that is a part of our conversations with all of our regulators. And you begin to see even oﬀshore wind part of the conversation with regulators. It's a mature technology in Europe, but relatively new in the U.S. and the good news is we believe we have runway with existing technologies to achieve the majority of our aspirations around clean energy transition over the next ﬁve years or so. And so you're getting into the 2030s when those technologies would be more important to get to Net Zero in the next tranche of carbon reduction.  And so, I think time will tell on whether they get to commercial scale. We began to see some demonstration projects like an advanced nuclear and the 2028 time frame but I would also point to the amount of money that's in the infrastructure bill to really pilot and develop and get   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   these technologies to scale. So it's possible, it occurs even more rapidly, but we will be thoughtful working with stakeholders and our regulators before we can begin introducing any of these technologies, so that we have a common view of what we would like to achieve and invest in to meet our goals."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.,"Alright. Thank you.  Operator  And our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Market, please go ahead."
Good morning everybody.,Good morning     Hi Jim.
"Thank you. Thanks for the time and none -- I didn't want to really kind of beat a dead horse. But just regarding the acceleration of your growth rate in to the upper half of the 5% to 7%, maybe Lynn or Steve, should we think about this in the context of the current 2022 to 2026 plan or as you look farther out into the kind of 2030 timeframe given your capital plan shows some signiﬁcant acceleration in that kind of 27 through 30 timeframe.",In the back half of this ﬁve-year plan Jim but certainly continuing in the back part of the decade.
"Okay, perhaps. Thank you so much for that color.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","All right. Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  And that concludes today's question and answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Lynn Good Chair President and CEO, for any additional remarks.     Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining. I know these calls in February are always full of information, not only in what we have achieved, but where we're going. And so we're available to answer any follow-on questions and look forward to talking with many of you in the weeks to come. So thanks again for your interest in Duke Energy.
