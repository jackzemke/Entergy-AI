Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan.     Good morning."
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Thanks for reiterating your prior statements on the guidance range, which we were wondering where that was in the slide deck.","We appreciate the feedback, Jonathan, you're ﬁrstly reviewing the slide deck. (Multiple Speakers)"
"Yeah. And then -- can I ask about the industrial sales. Steve, you mentioned you've been seeing curtailments, by which segments is that in? Why are you -- well, can you just give us some more color into your conﬁdence, so there's going to be a rebound second half?","Well, I think there will be, we've seen a few customers about three customers that have had some closings or some outages, I don't want to give any customer information that speciﬁc. We've seen that in the Midwest and then in the Carolina, so I will give that information. But we think these are singular, we think the economic health of our service territories are good, good places to do business, and we are seeing economic projects landing in our footprint. And I do think that as we move forward we'll be lapping if you will, quarters where these outages began. So I think we'll see some uplift in the industrial load as we move to the last half of the year because of just that fact."
"Without naming names though, can you share what -- which industrial sectors we are talking about?","We've seen some textiles, we've seen some paper, and we've seen some metals."
"Okay. Great. Thank you. And then the other question, we had was on the -- you said you're going to come out with the winners in the 589 RFP shortly. Can you remind us sort of what you have in the plan for the utility in terms of renewables, the owned renewables and then maybe what's currently in for commercial renewables?","Jonathan, we put all of the renewables capital in one place in the ﬁve year plan, so it's under commercial renewables and it's about 1.5 billion over the ﬁve year period. The 589 RFP will close September 11th, so in the third quarter or fourth quarter we should have more clarity on that. And we will be bidding into it, as I know, others will we have the opportunity to win up to 30%, but also have an opportunity to buy beyond that if we think the economics work for us.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"So we should think of the base holder and commercial is potentially being partly in the utility, eventually, but it's just all there at the moment.","That's right. And I think the other point to note on that Jonathan is because it's in commercial, we would expect investment beyond North Carolina in those numbers, right? So as we continue to pursue commercial developments. So everything is in there and as we get more clarity on how the RFP plays out, and so on will of course update those numbers. So there could be some upside potential. But I think the 1.5 billion is a good planning assumption."
Thanks very much.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,
"Hey, Good morning, this is actually Claire stepping in for Julien.","Hi, Claire.     Hi, Claire."
"Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. So my ﬁrst actually has to do with the South Carolina rate case. So I know there's been bit of political situation down there. Just your thoughts on timing and your prospects on the case.","Yeah, so Claire we're evaluating the case in South Carolina, and as you know from our history we typically have investments impacting both of our jurisdictions similarly. So you can think about a South Carolina case perhaps later this year towards the end of the year that within -- be -- go through the process in 2019.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Got it. Anything more than 3Q, 4Q event or just generally send half of the year?","I'm sorry, could you repeat that we had a trouble hearing you a little bit?"
No problem. Any speciﬁcity besides end of the year maybe 3Q or 4Q or are you just saying for now end of the year?,"I would target fourth quarter for ﬁling the case, so it won't be sooner than that."
Got it. That's helpful color. And turning to North Carolina here. Do you have any color you can give right now on the grid mod rider strategy for the legislative session for next year? And anything we should be watching in the ongoing state elections?,"Clearly, we have talked about our strategic priority on grid for sometime, and described that as being a parallel process between the regulatory and the legislative arena, we have a number of options that we're considering. And our objective is to continue to advance the dialog, we think they're great customer beneﬁts, economic beneﬁts, and our goal will be to continue to engage with customers and stakeholders to build momentum for what we're trying to achieve.  And so, I think what I would leave you with on this is our strategic priority around this has not changed and the work continues and as we have more clarity about speciﬁc tactics that we'll pursue, we'll discuss them with you at that time, but it remains front and center priority for us here in the Carolinas."
Thank you for that.,Thank you.  Operator   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   We'll now take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
Hi. Good morning. This is Maheep on behalf --,Good morning.     Good morning.
"Hi, Maheep on behalf of Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the ACP, could you discuss any potential upside opportunity at Piedmont from the pipeline?","The ACP is an important investment into the Carolinas to support the Piedmont system, and we have capital in the plan in connection with that expansion that is part of the ordinary course business of supporting the Piedmont system. So, I don't have anything speciﬁc that I would point to, but our hope and expectation is that with that additional mainline pipe into the Carolinas that we will see further expansion opportunities with industrials and new customers in that Eastern part of the state that will continue to drive investment."
"Sorry about that, that was on mute. Thanks for the answer. And just on grid mod rider, could you just talk about how these rate case settlements have helped you getting support for an in-grid rider legislation?","I think about the partial settlement in the DEC case is being an indication of our ability and willingness to sit down with stakeholders, to come up with collaborative approaches. I think it's particularly important as you think about policy and investment strategies and you've seen us in the Carolinas with Renewables, with HB 589 and South Carolina with store [ph], with Senate Bill 236, you saw the partial settlement in the DEC case and I think engagement of stakeholders is an important part of progressing any strategic objective and our approach here will be to continue to advance the dialogue in the Carolinas around grid investment. We have a number of options, more frequent rate cases, regulatory arena, legislation and we will be focusing on all of those. The strategic priority of achieving an outcome remains key to us and our work continues.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
Thank you for answering the questions.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll now take our next question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.
"Good morning, Lynn and Steve.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Appreciate the reiteration of the 4% to 6% and getting back into the range. I wanted to know given some of the positives that you've received over the past three or so months on the regulatory front and on the credit agency front. Has anything, kind of, changed underlying that 4% to 6% range for better for worse or is the kind of makeup of how you're going to grow into '19 and '20 changed at all?","Chris, it hasn't changed. Our assignment here is to execute the plan that we've put in front of you and that's exactly what we're doing. And I think the track record we've demonstrated here in '18, whether it's on rate case execution or tax reform resolution or the balance sheet and credit metrics, we've executed across all of those things and that process will continue. And so, we look into '19 with investments and rate activity, Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We have a number of things that are in front of us and I would summarize our job is to execute and that's where our focus is."
"And then, my second question is on cost cuts, kind of, underlying the plan. Clearly, you're planning on ﬁling in the Carolinas to support the growth and you have riders in most other   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   jurisdictions, but how important is cost cuts to, kind of, any lag catch-up or preventing any lag from opening up during that time period?","Chris, keeping a focus on productivity and cost while maintaining a focus on operational excellence and serving customers is our job every day. And as we look at what's in our plan, we're planning for O&M to be ﬂat over the period, and have demonstrated our agility around O&M over the last several years, as we have responded to impacts in our business, and we feel like we have a good track record of doing that, and we will exercise that agility if need be. And as I said a moment ago, that's part of execution in my mind.     Yeah, so I would add that controlling O&M cost is essential every day, and it gives us headroom to make more capital investment for our customers that are beneﬁcial at lower rates. So, we work at that every day."
And we should think about that ﬂat over the time period as ﬂat in every individual year or is that just an average?,I would think about it every year.
"Okay, excellent. Thanks guys.",Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citi.
"Thanks guys. Hi, guys.",Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Hello.
"Good morning. So on the FFO, congrats on the improvement or, at least, the earlier kind of hitting your target.",Thank you.
"So wanted to understand, what does that mean from a capital allocation perspective? Is that creating headroom for something you could do incremental in terms of CapEx or on the Commercial Renewables side, just wanted to understand what's the implication of that for the story?","I think capital allocation is something Praful, we look at every year in connection with our ﬁve year plan. And we do have some opportunities coming up with HB 589, the Commercial Business [ph] always remains. But our commitment to that balance sheet strength is also critical and maintaining within those targets is the way we manage the plan and so, we'll provide an update on capital allocation and optimization when we come to you in February with guidance. But I wouldn't share anything more speciﬁc than that at this point. Steve, any further thoughts?     I agree. We'll look at our capital plan. We have an extensive capital optimization process where we look across jurisdictions and functions and try to ﬁnd the optimal placing of capital. And we'll continue that process, but we'll have further updates later."
"Got you, thanks guys. And then just stepping back I think like you said Lynn, you've had a very good trajectory in 2018 with some good rate case outcomes or regulatory outcomes. Clearly your credit pressure is now behind you or mostly behind you. How are you now looking forward strategically, I get the execution is still the focus which clearly is great, but strategically is there anything else in your radar that you are thinking about that needs to be done either M&A wise or anything else from a portfolio management perspective?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Nothing speciﬁc on portfolio management Praful, but demonstrating organic growth is -- I just would like to emphasize that as part of execution, so this is getting this grid investment to work, it's delivering the beneﬁts to customers, delivering returns, continuing to grow the dividend, that I would put at the top of the list of strategic priorities for the company."
All right. Great. Thanks guys.,Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  We'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil.
"Hey, good morning everyone.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Before I get to my question, I'd just want to clarify if I heard you right. For grid modernization, are you suggesting that the rider would have helped, but it's not the only way and would you move forward with accelerating some of those initiatives without a potential legislative ﬁx?","So, the grid rider is not the only way Andrew, I would say, and we will always pace our investment in a way that makes sense for the recovery strategy. That's part of capital optimization that Steve talked about a moment ago. And so, our work continues here to pursue appropriate next steps. We'll keep the dialogue going, bringing stakeholders together on the way forward. But we'll look at capital relative to the tactical plan around recovery and make the appropriate adjustments that we need to make.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)"
"Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then a two part question on renewables. First under HB 589, you mentioned there's that 30% cap that you could acquire beyond that cap. When might deals like that potentially be announced? Would it be at the time of the RFP decision, during construction or maybe after it begins operations?","I believe they would be after bids have been selected and winners of bids have been selected that some of those types of transactions might subsequently occur.     When I think about September 11th, RFP closes, there'll be some reviewed analysis. I would assume following that, winners would be announced subsequently. Then, we have an opportunity to perhaps purchase some. We'll see where we performed in the RFP. So, this will play out over the next couple of quarters, it's the way I would think about it Andrew."
"Great. That's helpful. Then lastly, if I understand correctly, Shoreham was your ﬁrst tax equity ﬁnancing. How would you describe your appetite for more tax equity deals going forward? And how would you describe the market for it?",We do have an appetite for using tax equity in our deals. Shoreham was the ﬁrst that we've executed on. And there is a market out there for tax equity. There is the tax appetite there and that's useful to us in our Commercial Renewables business. So we'll continue in that direction.
Very good. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  That concludes today's question-and-answer session.
