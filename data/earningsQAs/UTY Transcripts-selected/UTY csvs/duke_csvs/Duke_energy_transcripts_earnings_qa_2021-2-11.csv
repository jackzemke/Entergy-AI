Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"So a couple of quick questions here. When -- obviously you highlight some factors that would provide upside to the base plan like through acceleration of clean energy, federal legislation. So to the extent that these items require incremental CapEx would you kind of consider monetizing additional stakes at your OpCos like Indiana, similar to the GIC deal versus maybe tapping traditional ﬁnancing like equity. Obviously, the demand is there for these strategies and the transaction multiple was certainly healthy versus where your stock trades?","Yes. So, Shar, thank you for that question. And as we looked at the $60 billion, $59 billion, $60 billion of capital in front of us, we saw this transaction as an attractive investment that gave us an opportunity to eliminate common stock. As you said, the valuation that was attractive to our investors and frankly recognize the value where we operate in Indiana.  I would say if you look at this ﬁve-year period, we feel like we've got a pretty strong capital plan. There may be some upside in the back part of the plan, Shar, but I look at the clean energy transition that's underway. We have some work to do in 2021 and 2022 that laid further groundwork and so that escalation will be towards the end of the ﬁve-year continuing over the rest of the decade. We will always look for attractive ways to ﬁnance growth, and I think we've demonstrated that with this transaction, but don't have anything in the near term that I would point you just reinforce that ﬁnding attractive low-cost capital to underpin growth is always an objective and we're really pleased with what we were able to accomplish with this transaction."
"Got it. And then obviously you highlight the higher growth rate and the movement you're seeing in North Carolina, and obviously, there has been recommendations provided by working groups in the state. I'm wondering how sort of the North Carolina clean energy legislation could impacts sort of this updated growth trajectory? Should investors sort of look at it is simply as extend the runway scenario or could it actually be accretive to that growth to maybe accelerated spending opportunities, less regulatory lag? I mean, obviously, we're assuming you   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   get some ROE bands, PBRs gets approved. But -- so how do we sort of thinking about the legislation in light of the updated growth?","Sure. And you know, Shar. The ﬁrst thing I'd like to do is express the conﬁdence we have in achieving 5% to 7%. It has been grounded in not only strong franchise group, the regulatory certainty we've been able to achieve, including the recent settlement with the AG. The investment opportunities, we talked about on decarbonizing, and then our ability to control costs, coupled with the transaction with GIC eliminating equity gives us a really solid foundation for 5% to 7%.  So I look at what we've put in front of you is a capital plan and a strategy with a high degree of conﬁdence to achieve 5% to 7%. I think the ability to reach that top end, to keep going would include faster acceleration of generation transition. Perhaps faster economic recovery, I'd put in that list also, Shar, we're seeing such incredible customer growth in the areas that we serve because of population migration. That could be another item, that would be a surprise to the upside in a good way. Sustainable cost savings, as we continue the digital transformation, continue grid modernization, continue retirement of the coal ﬂeet all of those things will give us an opportunity to continue to drive O&M out. And I do think regulatory lag, if we can ﬁnd a way to lessen it, the growth is going to be strengthened.  And so, I come to this discussion with a lot of conﬁdence. And we have a plan that we'll achieve the 5% to 7% and we'll continue to work on the legislation and regulatory reform in a way that will complement the growth, and perhaps enhance it if it moves more quickly."
"Terriﬁc. And just lastly from me, in your discussions with stakeholders, are you ﬁnding sort of an alignment with the Governor and key legislators here, and what's kind of the next data point we should be watching out for?","We have been at work on this, Shar. We talked about for some time, and have been engaged actively with stakeholders really building alignment around the common goal, common objectives, and those objectives include moving away from coal, carbon reduction, regulatory mechanisms that incent that move. And then, of course, increased investment in renewable all within the construct of maintaining reliability and aﬀordability. So I think the common objective is really to provide a really strong foundation to move forward. So we're working to advance those objectives and we will continue to provide updates along the way in the session that is underway right now. There will be some milestones in April around the potential introduction of bills. But what I would point to is the common objectives, with a desire to create momentum on carbon reduction, I think that alignment provides a great foundation for moving forward."
Terriﬁc. Thank you very much. Congrats. And I'll jump back in the queue.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity),"Thank you, Shar.     Thank you.  Operator  And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley."
"Hi, good morning. Hope you all are doing well.","Hi, Stephen. Yes, as you are."
"Yes, thanks, Lynn. I wanted to talk about the prospects for further Federal legislation supporting clean energy. I guess we're growing more optimistic that we may see kind of round two of legislative support the summer into the fall where Congress might further extend the duration of tax credits for wind and solar and potentially add a new tax credit for energy storage. And as you think about that -- those kinds of elements that support, how do you think about that in terms of your longer-term resource planning, could that have an impact in terms of just kind of thinking through the economic cost of renewable energy?","Stephen, I think it will. And I think all of that to the beneﬁt of our customers in our regulated jurisdictions. And so if you look at even the integrated resource plans that we shared in the fall, those were predicated on the tax policy that existed at that time, and so extensions could be valuable. I think credits around battery storage, electric vehicles, all of those represent opportunities to continue the clean energy transition. So I would say we'll watch it closely."
"Okay, very good. And then maybe just think about oﬀshore wind if the decision was made at the state level to start to sort of at least explore or pursue oﬀshore wind, how do you sort of think about next steps, I'm just not familiar enough with sort of the technical feasibility of oﬀshore wind, what kind of early steps you might take if the decision was made that state wants to go in that direction?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Stephen, we've been working on the potential for oﬀshore wind for some time, not only in terms of the obvious issues around leases and location of leases but also transmission infrastructure that we need to accompany that. We are -- in the Carolinas, in particular, the load centers are further west than the coast. So ﬁnding an appropriate transmission path would be important. I think there is more conversation in the Carolinas, the Governor has joined with other Mid-Atlantic governors, signing an MOU to say, let's spend more time ﬁguring this out. There's a study underway to look at the impact to economic development.  And so I would say we're monitoring all of this closely. I would think about it as maybe late 2020, 2030 opportunity in the Carolinas, but nonetheless, we are supportive of ﬁnding ways to bring wind into the state as a complement to the solar and nuclear resources that we have that are carbon-free. So I think, more to come on that, Stephen, as some of these exploratory processes bear fruit."
"It's well taken, it's long lead time to kind of think through these issues for oﬀshore wind. Maybe last question just on the commercial renewables business. I was just curious, your latest thinking in terms of the competitive dynamics in renewables, are you seeing any sort of trends in terms of increased competition or just anecdotally some degree of increased competition and I'm just kind of curious what you all are seeing on that side of the business?","Stephen, we see it as competitive. It's been competitive for some time and starting to delineate. Is it a little bit more competitive? So from our standpoint, we stay very disciplined on the cost of capital, the returns that we want and have a combination of development around the US, but also really focused on how we can go renewables within our own jurisdictions. But I think it's a fair comment. There is a lot of interest and investment moving into renewable energy and that I think it will create competition."
Very good. That's all I have. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Steve."
"Hi, Lynn. Hi, Steve. So just wanted to go back to a prior question, which I'm not sure was answered on the North Carolina Governor's kind of discussions and the like and just next steps. Is there still going to be kind of a report that comes out from that and then when would we likely see legislation proposed?","Sure. And, Steve, on a speciﬁc question of the report, there were two processes. So, the regulatory reform report is out. This is the one that talked about multiyear rate plans performance incentives, really a strong endorsement that regulatory reform is important to incenting movement. So that one is out and discussions of course continue on that. The carbon policy report, which is the one that's been led by the Nicholas Institute, should be coming anytime.  And I would think about it, Steve, a data point, they will be considered in the legislative session along with our IRPs frankly that has garnered a lot of stakeholder discussion. We don't expect that carbon policy reports will include speciﬁc recommendations. But we believe it will be a discussion of retirement of coal, carbon pricing, clean energy standard et cetera. And the stakeholders that have been involved in all of these processes integrated resource plan, clean energy, policy discussions, the Governor sponsored regulatory reform. All of the stakeholders have been working together quite well over the course of the year.  And when I talked about common objectives. So I was really speaking to the common objectives that has come out of all of that, common objectives around retirement of coal, common objectives around increasing renewables, regulatory reform, et cetera. So it's that bringing together of those common objectives that if they worked on to try to advance where we go from here. And I'm optimistic that you know a number of very informed and stakeholder groups that have common views of positioning North Carolina for the future, and I think progress will come from that. There is also a keen focus in that group on reliability and aﬀordability, which we also strongly endorse and come to the conversation with very low prices with international averages and we'll be working actively to make sure we make progress within that construct as well."
"Okay, that's good. And then just on the -- ignoring in the event that law passes and if we're doing regulation in the Carolinas as we have it now. Could you just give a sense of just how you would manage this kind of maybe increasing spend on the regulatory side, is it just the annual rate cases or how would you...?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Steve, I think it's important to maybe step back to a moment. When we put forward the integrated resource plan in the Carolinas, there were six scenarios. The base scenario, the one that's on the far left is one that can be accomplished without any changes in regulation or legislation, et cetera, and the capital plan that we've put in front of you is really predicated on that base plan. So we believe the grid investment, the investment in generation that's included in our plan for the Carolinas can be executed. You can think about the overlay of legislation, and perhaps new tools and maybe acceleration being incremental to what we've put in front of you. We thought it was prudent to put together a plan that we have a high degree of conﬁdence to achieve under a variety of scenarios, but we work actively as we have over the last year-and-a- half with stakeholders to ﬁnd a way to meet those objectives."
"Great. One last quick one, just the -- I think I heard Steve say the 5% -- when you look at the 5% to 7% growth rate, it's kind of consistent over the period kind of roughly, is that fair?",That's right. That's fair.     That's correct.
Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America."
"Yes, good morning. Congratulations everyone.",Good morning.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)      Good morning.
"Perhaps just to follow up on this because I want to understand. So you talk about legislation and having worked for years to try to get the stakeholder at the curve, but at the same time, you talked about this IRP pending before the Commission. Can you talk about how those two processes work as best you understood right now? I mean, let's say, for instance, there'll be a legislation. How does the IRP proceed in that case and perhaps the overlapping timing critically, as you think about April versus the IRP (Technical Diﬃculty)?","Sure, Julien, I would think of these things as being complementary. The stakeholder group has been involved in the IRPs, the stakeholder group has been involved in the clean energy policy discussions, there is a high degree of overlap. And so let's talk a little bit about the IRP because we haven't discussed about that in this call. North Carolina will review the IRP comments are due at the end of April, and we would expect an order from the North Carolina Commission this year, probably in the fall, and the North Carolina Commission yet doesn't approve but rather provide comments, perspectives on what they've seen. And so it becomes a data points, right, not only for the legislative process but also for the Commission on how we're thinking about the future, and stakeholder parties will have an opportunity to weigh-in and discuss.  In South Carolina, the IRP will be approved or reviewed and an order will be issued by the Commission. This is consistent with Act 60-Q, which you may remember being a requirement in South Carolina. We believe our IRP conforms with those requirements, extensive stakeholder engagement, and analysis of coal retirements and analysis of rate impact. So we should expect to hear from the South Carolina Commission in June. The legislative session -- the bills would be introduced in this legislative session in April, process later in May. So the legislative session is also running, Julien, in the ﬁrst half of the year.  And so I would think about all these things as complementary. The same people at the table talking about the same objectives lowering carbon, building renewables, grid investment, regulatory reform. And we will keep you informed along the way as milestones are achieved and feedback is received, but I'm optimistic about informed group of stakeholders coming together with shared objectives."
"Okay, got it. Excellent. Thank you. And perhaps...",Thank you.   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)
A follow up on the consistency of the 5% to 7% if I can quickly?,Sure.
"Can you comment about on the earned ROE trend across the year, I'm thinking Carolinas, obviously you guys have a range established this year, is that range broadly the same range through the forecasted period or how would you characterize that?","Yes, I think broadly it's just going to be similar. We have a settlement proposal at a 9.6% ROE, but we've got a long track record in the Carolinas and across our entire footprint, being able to earn at or in some years certainly above our allowed returns through cost management, through working on wholesale type transactions as well. So I think there are a number of mechanisms that are going to allow us to earn similar to what we've earned in the past on our regulated jurisdictions."
Okay. Excellent. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  And we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi, guys.",Good morning.
"Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   Hey, Lynn. Good morning. On the same topic, could you comment a little bit about the ROE projection, you guys have in there for 2021 for Indiana and Ohio and Kentucky as well. Both, looking pretty low trending towards lower numbers going forwards sub 9%, sub 8% in Kentucky?","Yes, yes. I have a couple of comments there. In Indiana, we just ﬁled the -- we got a rate order in August in Indiana, and that was a catch-up rate case. So what you see when you got a big base rate case that's built up and in Indiana we haven't had a base rate case in quite a while, so you're building up a lot of investments there. And prior to that buildup up, you're going to see the ROEs drop a bit, and then you have a catch up and we got the solid ROE in Indiana going forward. We'll be able to optimize around that and earn very well there. Ohio is a similar situation when you have a base rate case, we'll build up investments up to that point, and then the new rates will -- we'll work on the return.  So you'll see some movement around a rate case like that. But over a broad period as you've seen in the work across our footprint, we've been very capable of earning our allowed returns on the growing rate base. And we've done that through periods where we've had more frequent rate cases and periods where we've had less frequent rate cases. And that's where you utilize your capital optimization between rate cases and cost control to keep the returns solid. So we'll continue to have those capabilities."
Are you planning on having a base rate case in Indiana is that -- I didn't see that...?,"Not in the near future.     No, not in the near term. We caught up those investments -- most of our growth will be coming through TDSIC from the environmental rider. So it's a very eﬃcient jurisdiction going forward there."
"So, you think you think it will improve after 2021 basically the ROEs in the state.",Yes.
Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And how is the 5% to 7% growth CAGR weighted? Is that a steady growth rate throughout the period to 2025 or is it back ended?,I would think about it as a steady growth rate.
"And dividend growth. I know that we're still on that slower than EPS growth period is that expected to continue, given the high CapEx program that you have?","I think certainly in the near term, Michael. And then, we'll evaluate it, as we get deeper into the ﬁve-year plan. The growth shows up, the payout ratio comes down a bit. So we understand the importance of a growing dividend and we'll continue to look at that right balance between the growth of capital and growth in the dividend."
"Great. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","All right, thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Vertical."
"Good morning, guys.","Hi, Jonathan."
"Hi. Just to revisit this question of what's in the plan and you said pretty clearly that the low end, the left-hand end of the Carolinas transition, the IRP proposals is what's in your plan and your CapEx, does that apply to -- how would you sort of tie that to the second half of the decade where you've got this $65 billion to $75 billion 5-year spend for '25 through '29. Just curious if that's still the case or is that you're starting to dip into acceleration there?   Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)","Well, what we reﬂected in that second half of the decade, the range of $65 billion to $75 billion represented, again, the low-end scenarios of carbon reduction versus the higher, more aggressive carbon reduction. So as we learn more about the pacing that the state wants to go through, I would project that we'd be somewhere in that range depending on that pacing of $65 billion to $75 billion as you move into that second ﬁve-year period.     And Jonathan, even the base plan of the IRP includes over 50% carbon reduction and includes quite a bit of transition of generation, retirement of coal and renewables. And so, as Steve indicated, we'll learn more around pace, in particular, as we go through the next few months and hear from commissions et cetera. And the $75 billion would be the more aggressive kind of to the 70% type range, but even the base plan has a very healthy growth rate within that range."
"Okay, great. Thank you for clarifying there. And then, obviously, '25, you already have a number out for that $65 billion to $75 billion implies quite a material step-up to really in the back -- very closer to the back end of the decade. Is that the right way to think about it, or is sort of '25 a number that could be in play if things decided to move faster, I guess?","I think '25 could be in play, Jonathan. I think about it in this way, take a little bit of time to develop site permits, generation. But as we think about this is 2021 by the time 2025 rolls around, we will have a clear picture on that, and coal retirements go along with it. And so we'll be into a deeper amount of coal being retired in that back part of the decade. And so you'll be building generation to replace in that way. So we'll know more, and of course, update these expectations all along the way."
"Okay, thank you. Just maybe one other thing, it looked like there was a fair step-up in what you're categorizing as maintenance CapEx in the ﬁve-year plan, a couple of billion versus last year. Is that a categorization issue or is it a diﬀerent spend or what's going on there?","Nothing, singular there. I just think we're looking at the maintenance of the nuclear facilities and the grid facilities as we modernize the grid. There is more CapEx of maintenance nature in those areas, in those two speciﬁc areas.      Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   And, Jonathan, we did do a little bit of a -- changing our proﬁle around maintenance outages and other things in 2020 because of COVID. And so I believe some of that will also be movement of outage and investment that goes with it into '21 consistent with the challenges of the year."
That's fair. Okay. Thanks a lot.,Thank you.  Operator  We'll go next to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.     Good morning.
"Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hopefully, two quick questions. One, Steve, just can you remind us the tax optimization in 2020. You mentioned this in your drivers when you went over '20, what is that tax optimization any color on that front?","You know what we have done in 2020 we had worked on various eﬀorts that lower the eﬀective tax rate a bit, and that falls through and was part of the mitigation that was put in place. And that was probably around 0.5% on the eﬀective tax rate reduction, might have been in the range of $0.04 to $0.05 or so of mitigation that we got out of income taxes.     Durgesh, I would share with you that the tax team is always looking for ways to optimize taxes, whether it's state-level property taxes, federal tax, tax credits, research and development, et cetera. And so we were quite eﬀective in 2020 with a variety of projects, but we are always looking for eﬀective tax planning ideas."
"Got it. Sorry, I was on mute. Understood. So it's more like a 2020 event, you're not modeling that going into 2021, but there may be opportunities, right? Is that the right way to look at it?","Duke Energy Corp (DUK US Equity)   There are opportunities in 2021, but we expect them to be a bit less than what they were in 2020."
"Understood. Perfect. And then just maybe quickly on the FFO to debt metric, if I have this correct, 2020 or the year we're targeting 15%, now it's going to 14% for the next ﬁve years. And you mentioned there is some question versus sort of what agency thresholds are to kind of predict your rating. Can you just provide us a little bit of what is the ﬂoor? So how much cushion do you actually have versus the credit rating agency metrics?","I'll jump in, and Steve can follow on. The FFO has seen the impact of COVID. We also have seen the impact of our coal ash settlement with some near-term beneﬁts that we oﬀer to customers. And so as we look ahead and speaking to S&P, in particular, the range is 12% to 16%, we believe we'll be very solidly within that range. And continue to believe a strong balance sheet and our commitment to the balance sheet is important and you see that with the recent GIC transaction. So I would talk about some of those near-term items that I referenced here. And, Steve, how would you add?     I think that's exactly right. We certainly as we look forward, we've got COVID impacts that will continue into 2021 that will aﬀect the top-line revenues. The coal ash settlement we restructured in the past will help customers there, but we think we can operate very comfortably within this range at the new rating and we'll get very adequate access to capital."
"Excellent. Thank you so much. Lynn, thank you.","Thank you.  Operator  And that concludes today's conference. I would like to turn it back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks.     Hannah, thank you. And thanks to all of you who joined the call. We've had a lot of news here in 2021 all directed at building a strong foundation for growth in the future, and look forward to engagement with you in the weeks and months ahead. And, of course, the IR team is always available this afternoon if there are further questions. So thanks for your interest and investment in Duke Energy.
