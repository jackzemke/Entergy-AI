Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what you're seeing in the competitive environment in retail, just in terms of churn and any changes in market share as you're experiencing higher margins there?","Good morning, David.     Dan, I'm going to -- Dan covered a bit of this in his prepared remarks and I'll let him elaborate.     Hey, good morning, David. I would say that we've continued to see a strong market backdrop for our commercial business, both on kind of the C&I side we talk about a lot and also on the load auction side. Margins have been strong this year, particularly strong earlier in the year. Market volatility created opportunity for us, as we saw some competitors pull back and get less active, as you saw them put a higher price on risk capital for them to be involved in the business. So we've done a good job of maintaining and in some areas expanding our win rates where we've seen opportunity at yield, quite strong margins relative to history.  I would say probably in the last few months as the year has moved on, we've seen a little more pressure on margins, so well above historical norms, but kind of oﬀ the highs we saw earlier this year as people start to engage a little bit more in the markets. And as I said, in the load auction side, there hasn't been a huge amount of activity, but we are seeing more participants show back up again now than we had seen in the past. Again, all margins better than history, but we're keeping a close eye on that trend as we go through the rest of this year."
"Got it. Yes. That's helpful color. And just the latest guidance update, does that kind of fully reﬂect the patterns that you're seeing so far in 4Q? If the dynamics that you experienced in 3Q continue here, are there further opportunities to kind of bolster the outlook into 2024?","Yes. As we continue to add business, I think we've taken a reasonable approach to our expectations for margins next year. As I said, we're assuming the world stays better than it has been historically, but we have embedded some moderation in margins from what we're seeing, which I think probably makes sense given kind of movements and making sure that we meet our expectations for all of you. As we go through the balance of this year, the fourth quarter is an important one to watch. We'll see how much more we can add to backlog for '24 and '25, so we're hopeful we'll continue to ﬁnd opportunity.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)"
Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the color.,"Thanks, David.  Operator  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.     Hi, Steve."
"Yes. Hey, good morning. Good work, Emily, with your cell phone there. So just on the remaining IRA things that we're kind of watching here, the hydrogen PTC rules, and then, of course, the nuclear PTC, could you just give us latest thoughts on timing of those? And then also maybe more color on how much we should interpret the hydrogen hub announcement as kind of hinting at where the hydrogen PTC comes out with respect to nuclear?","Steve, I'll take the last question ﬁrst. We're obviously in a lot of dialogue with other stakeholders, directly with the White House, quite a bit. I'm very happy with the way the conversations are going. But there's a lot of detail that needs to be in the rule and be right in the rule. So I would say, I'm cautiously optimistic. I think a big part of that isn't just the Hub Awards, but the fact that I think they're realizing that really jumpstart this hydrogen economy, we're going to need reliable time-matched clean energy to get both the environmental beneﬁts on the grid side as well as produce hydrogen in the most economic way and transition the economy.  So look, I'll leave it at that. I think the conversations have been really constructive. We've spent a lot of time on them, but we've got to kind of land this thing. In terms of when it will land, I think there's an understanding within the administration that a lot of people are waiting on the hydrogen rule and they need to come out with some guidance. Again, not just for the hubs, but generally, we indicated in article in Bloomberg that I was interviewed in that we are slowing down on a lot of contract signings and other things pending this. And obviously, we're not alone in this ecosystem doing the same thing. So I think they're working to kind of get this all nailed down. There just -- there was a ton of work that needed to come out of Treasury for the IRA implementation.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   And so, look, I don't -- I hear the rumors that they're delaying things and all that. I'm not sure I believe that. I think they're working diligently to get this thing done. I don't think the nuclear PTC piece of this is really at least, insofar as I could detect, controversial in any regard. But it also only applies to a limited handful of players like us that have nuclear assets who doesn't have the broad application of hydrogen or domestic content rules and some of the other things that have taken Treasury's time. So I think, those things -- the production tax credit for nuclear is going to come in, as we expected, but I wouldn't be surprised to see that come close to the end of the year or even in the ﬁrst quarter. I am hopeful that we will see some guidance before the end of the year on hydrogen, and that it will categorically address the use of existing nuclear to make hydrogen in the right pace."
"Okay. Thanks. And then one other question just on the 24/7 clean product and the like. Just how should we think about kind of pace of adoption here and interest levels you're seeing and this part you probably can't really answer, which is just the type of premium that you might be getting for this type of product versus just normal power sales? Yes, thanks.","Yes. I think just normal power sales volatility and everything else we factor into the sales of the power. We've talked about historic margins of $2 to $4 and we've been clear that we're towards the top of that as this kind of market has reset itself. The sustainability oﬀering is going to be considerably north of that because it's a new product and provides new value to the customer. Beyond that, for competitive reasons, we haven't really gone into the details of how big the margin is. And I think at the end of the day pace is something that we yet to fully understand in terms of adoption.  We've got 180 million megawatt hours of power, so we've got a lot of this to sell. It's not all going to be deployed through CFE. There's going to be other things like hydrogen, hopefully, data centers that will take on the load. The customer piece of this is going to be a big part, but policy is going to play a role as states and others think about how they want to procure carbon- free time-matched energy. And at this point, I think we're just -- we're hitting every opportunity and pushing everything, but it's hard for me to sit here and say that we have enough data to talk about how quickly we're going to be able to deploy all of it or a signiﬁcant chunk of that 180 million megawatt hours. So it's -- I would say, it's an incomplete at this point."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.     Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. The EBITDA, obviously, was raised again, but we didn't get sort of that update on free cash ﬂow guides or incremental buybacks. Dan, I guess, can you maybe just provide some sort of an update; why not move on incremental buybacks? I mean, we got past the key quarter. Is there any sense on -- are you saving anything for dry powder, et cetera? Just maybe a little bit of an inkling would be great.","Yes, Shar. We had a $1 billion program in place. We've gotten through $750 million of it, and now, without a decoder ring, you can kind of see it's been about $250 million a quarter thus far. And so we still have some money to deploy. You can imagine we'll be having conversations with the Board as far as our updated budget plan and how strong, '23, '24, and the forwards look beyond that to inform kind of the next wave of capital allocation. Getting STP done was a great deployment of capital this year and kind of looks better by the day with ERCOT prices having moved as they have. Then we want to keep looking for opportunities like that and other things along that way to deploy meaningful amounts of capital if they come available. So we do want to keep dry powder, but we certainly understand that as we get this program worked down, we've got a lot of capital still around and getting it back to our owners has always been a priority and we can't ﬁnd investments that exceed that double-digit unleveraged return."
"Got it. And then another quarter of obviously outsized marketing portfolio gains, right? I mean, can we just maybe unpack that $760 million year-over-year gain a little more? I guess what percentage is durable margin expansion versus maybe opportunistic trading or more one-time e-items like ERCOT Sparks? Thanks.","Yes, I mean, I think it's probably hard to dismantle that as much as you would like to have, to be totally honest. If you think about how we run the portfolio, the commercial business becomes responsible for managing our generation business once we get in the calendar, right? So working with the team on dispatch, how we set up positions will change. It's kind of hard to say who is a generation dollar or a commercial dollar at some point in time, the way you're thinking about it. But obviously, the Texas plants running as well as they did this summer, with prices where they were, we have outpaced our production expectations. So there was some real contribution we got in the quarter or really in the year from ERCOT. So that's going to be a piece of it.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   But a piece of it is the fact that margins have been quite strong, right? I think part of that is we've seen outsized margins. We talked about the load auctions, right? And we've seen in the ﬁrst half of this year what I fairly say is unprecedented margins in that business. And so that's been great. We would expect that in normal courses, those moderate (inaudible) time, and we're seeing a bit of that, right? So there's some that was going to be situational to this year. On the kind of the C&I markets and the mass markets, we've seen very good margins this year that are going to sit in the book for this year and next year and carrying into '25. But as I said to David earlier, we expect some moderation in those margins as we think about what has not yet been committed or was not in our pockets at this point in time.  And then the last part and it's not going to fully get into, but as we have had with volatility, there's been opportunities to maximize our portfolio in the physical markets and we've done well on that front again this year to our size probably this year and last year."
"Got it. And then lastly, again, for me. I know you realize you guys are still working through your capital planning before the next roll, but there have been a lot of recent data points around upgrades for, in light of like the IRA, especially for BWRs. Can you just get your updated thoughts here on sort of maybe the quantum of opportunity and potential timing there? Thanks.","Sure. I think we've basically said that we think the total universe is less than 1,000 actionable, somewhere between 500 and 1,000 megawatts that make a lot of economic sense. Bryan and his team have, pretty much at this point, identiﬁed every opportunity we see. We're recosting those. I think they'll roll into the ﬂeet by the end of this decade and some of them will drag out even a little bit longer. But we'll announce those as we complete the work and start ordering the parts for them. But we see opportunities certainly beyond that, which we've already announced. We just -- we don't have an update on that, but this is one of those where the duck looks calm on the surface, but there's a lot of paddling underneath in Bryan's organization, and we'll continue to work those opportunities. We think they're pretty good opportunities, spectacular results."
"Fantastic, guys. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.      Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)  Good morning, Julian."
"Hey, good morning to you. Thank you, guys, very much for the time. Appreciate it. Maybe I can go back to where some of the last questions were going and speaks to the timing and holding back on hedge commitments, et cetera. I mean, to the extent to which you get a thumbs-up, thumbs-down or what have you on hydrogen, could we see kind of an outsized pace of commitments in the start of next year and whether that's tied to data centers or whether that's tied to capital allocation in terms of buybacks considering maybe the hubs do or don't move forward, et cetera? So just want to try to, like, piece together the diﬀerent pieces here both on timing? And then, also are you eﬀectively waiting for clarity on hydrogen in order to pursue more of these ﬁrm commitments, if you will, on solar power?","Yes, sure, Julien. Look, I think hydrogen will occur for us in two diﬀerent ways. One will be what we've called the behind-the-fence-line clean energy center opportunities where we'll make the gas. And what we're looking for in those circumstances when we make the gas behind the fence line of the plant is people that will take 100% of the oﬀtake of that gas, so that we don't become somehow merchant hydrogen gas players. So certainly continuing those conversations and there are opportunities beyond LaSalle. But we'll probably focus on optimizing LaSalle and adding more megawatts there ﬁrst, if we can. But I think that opportunity exists for a number of plants. The other way hydrogen will evolve is through what we've called hydrogen -- clean hydrogen by wire, right, where we're providing a contract very much like the Microsoft- and ComEd-type contract to a customer who will then use that contract to justify they are getting the tax credit for hydrogen production. And those are a lot of players kind of around the country, including many that exist in our customer base.  I would say that we've added a great deal of focus in talking to those customers and seeing what the opportunities can be. I don't know yet how fast they will be able to buy electrolyzers and integrate those electrolyzers into those facilities. So I can't tell you this is a '25 or '26-type of thing in terms of actually producing the energy and producing the gas in those systems. And it could be '27. I think if the rules end up the way that we are hopeful they will end up, you'll see a ﬂurry of contracting opportunity for us. And you'll see us begin to scale LaSalle and look at the opportunity to do behind-the-fence-line hydrogen production at a lot of other places. We haven't stopped the discussions or the work. And in a certain sense, I would say this and data centers probably are enormous inbounds into the company right now, but both require, in the case of hydrogen, clariﬁcation from Treasury as to whether those projects will move forward. In the case of data centers, those just tend to be enormous things that require a great deal of discussion and we'll update them.  I think if the rules work out the right way. I expect we'll have an exciting '24 and '25 around that, and I'm hopeful data centers will play out the same way, but it's just -- it's too early for me to describe pacing, number of megawatts, impact on the ﬁnancial outcomes of the company. I'd just say that in 25 years of being in this business, these are the most exciting opportunities we have, and I think they'll have great traction, but we've got to get the work done, and then we'll announce it to all of you and you'll see for yourself.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)"
"Right. But it's not as if you're waiting for one or the other here on, let's say, 4Q, right? Patience is a virtue as they say. And '27 is out there. And more to the point, it's not as if you're holding back on data centers or capital allocation ahead of a decision on hydrogen, just to set expectations?","No. That's right. I think you've described it well, and I've said it in response to Steve's question, it's not like we're yet confronted with a scarcity of the clean megawatt hours that we produce. We've got 180 million of these things, so that gives us the luxury of exploring multiple channels at once. There will be a point in time where we'll be looking at kind of the ﬁnancial value of one channel versus another, but I think, in the early going year, we're going to be wide open and we're certainly working every angle and none are mutually exclusive at this point."
"Got it. Excellent, guys. Best of luck. See you soon.",Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.     Good morning.
"Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question on the asset generation. Year-to-date, it's kind of been around that 80%, 83% range that hasn't moved. Last year, I was just looking at the Q3 2022 deck. For the next year, that would be 2023 back in Q3 2022, you were like 90%-ish. So this is just nuclear PTCs and sort of your willingness to stay more open? And next year, maybe you can just comment on that and how should we think about your hedging practice going forward into, like, '25 and beyond?","Let me start with that. I think the early questions we got last year, frankly, after the passage of the IRA is whether we'd stick with the hedging strategy that we had deployed for so many years at Exelon and in the early days at Constellation. It's been kind of generally described as a third, a third, a third. And what we've done is we've explored all the -- we're exploring all of the   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   options that I just talked to Julien about. But we're not tethered to any kind of ﬁxed hedging strategy where we're trying to get oﬀ a certain number of megawatts in a given year. We have the freedom now to explore diﬀerent opportunities, to be patient and we have been. And I think, over time, the percentage of the ﬂeet that's hedged and the disclosures that we've historically used will become less relevant because we've changed the hedging strategy.  And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the year and as we update for next year and we look at these diﬀerent opportunities. But at this point, the IRA eﬀectively gives us the ability to wait and realize the $43.75 at the bus that we're entitled to under the policy. And so anything we need to do here has to be incremental for that opportunity. And that's the way we're looking at the business. That means -- that may mean we're holding on to more power or selling more power. It'll depend on how these channels ultimately work, but it's the ﬂexibility that we have now and frankly the value that we oﬀer to our owners is to get the best ﬁnancial results for this ﬂeet we have.  And look, I'll add -- it's already been a long answer, but I'll add to it. I just think the value of clean, reliable energy is just going to go up over time, and that causes me to want to be patient. Without commenting on the technology, I see obviously what's happening with oﬀshore wind and I think all of our owners could appreciate just how diﬃcult it is to add clean energy, let alone anything that resembles the reliability we have. So that encourages us to be patient as we walk through the transition, and the IRA gives us the policy support to be patient and get the best opportunities for us, for our customers and for the country."
"Understood. I appreciate that color, Joe. I did have one more question. You guys have talked about a diﬀerent or added reporting metrics, not just EBITDA. Just any thoughts or additional color that you can share there?","Yes, we're still working through that, right? I think our plan is, at the year-end update, we'll probably provide a whole host of new measures and disclosures for all of you. We've had these hedge tables, I think, for going on something like 15 years. Moving out of the world of a third, a third, a third, as Joe mentioned, and getting into the structure where the PTC provides a very diﬀerent revenue dynamic for us, it's going to make sense to refresh everything. I also think that with the PTC being an after-tax revenue stream, us probably talking about earnings on an after- tax basis will make more sense for all of you guys."
"Understood. Thanks, guys. Congrats.","Thank you.  Operator   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks.     Well, thanks, operator, for handling the call. And I'll just end the way I started. I want to thank our folks here at Constellation. When we -- when you separate companies, there's this kind of Harvard Business School thing that one of the values you get is that the management team has a good focus and is focused on one line of business as opposed to many, and that brings value. But kind of having lived it, the enormous value that it's brought to us is a clarity of mission not only for the management team, but for our employees. And super excited that they feel passionate about the business, the results we present are theirs, and I just want to end again by thanking them and thanking all of you for your interest in the company. Look forward to talking to you at the end of the fourth quarter.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program.
