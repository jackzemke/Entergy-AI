Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Good morning, Shah."
"Joe, maybe we can start with an update just on the market for the nuclear assets now that IRA has kind of been digested, couple of processes going on. What have you been seeing in the market? And is M&A just more or less likely at this point based on recent dialogues you've had? And then, do you have a ﬁrmer date in mind on when we could see a capital allocation update, if inorganic opportunities don't meet your threshold at least in the near-term?","Yes, sure. Let me answer that last part ﬁrst. I think, these inorganic opportunities will play themselves out by the time we speak again on our fourth quarter call. So, my view is we will know whether this stuﬀ is going to be actionable for us by that point in time. But we are looking at some stuﬀ right now.  I think the fact that the IRA got resolved gives us some sense -- gives everybody some sort of uniform sense around the forward price for these assets and that's very good. It doesn't resolve every evaluation question and each asset is very diﬀerent. I spoke frequently about the importance of the size of particular nuclear assets and why we went two units a lot better than we like single-site units, so those variables are going to exist as we look at any particular asset going forward in theory.  I think I could speak to obviously there was a talent process to look at the sale of every asset that was a very complicated situation because it wasn't just a nuclear sale, but involves some fossil sales. So, any involvement we would have in that would require us to marry up with another buyer that would tend to fossil assets and talent announced recently that they didn't have any conforming bids that would buy all of the assets. As other things come on in the market, we will take a look at them, we've talked to all of you about that, and we're going to take a look at everyone.  We're going to be very disciplined. We think the business will consolidate, but we don't have the time frame that we're necessarily looking at, right? It's owner's willingness to transact that's going to drive it. So, I don't know, Shar, if it's going to resolve and that the ﬂoodgates certainly starts to settle a little bit in evaluation, but in the short-term looking to to the extent that we're looking at things, I think those will resolve by the time we're having the fourth quarter call, and then we will be able to return to a discussion of what capital return to shareholders should look like."
"Okay perfect. That's what I wanted to level set. So, if something inorganic doesn't transpire, it takes some time. You're not married to having to disclose capital allocation before year end, so we can maybe expect it around the February call, when you report year-end results.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes, I think, look, I think on the last quarter earnings call, I indicated that we would like to provide that information to our owners by the end of this year. And we were aiming for that. But things happened that we don't control and opportunities developed and we're going to explore those."
"Okay, perfect. And then, lastly, I don't know, this shouldn't be a surprise. But I mean, obviously, you guys like everyone else are seeing labor and material inﬂation. We're getting a lot of questions on it this morning. Have you seen -- Joe, have you seen any moderation more recently at a high level? How should we sort of think -- should be thinking about maybe the potential pressures in '23 and beyond as it relates to your initial guide you guys rolled out with the Analysts Day earlier this year, which was just shy of $4.5 billion per year?","Yes. Look, Shar, I don't think we're seeing anything unusual in this business. What is unusual about our business is the protection that we're aﬀorded through the IRA. So, we wanted to spend some time at the top of this call, because I don't think it was necessarily focused on the price escalator that's built into the IRA in the event we're in an inﬂationary environment. But let me give it to Dan maybe. Dan, maybe you can unpack something there.     Yes. Thanks, Joe. Thanks, Shar. It's a good question and I think Joe kind of hit oﬀ on the point. We are having the inﬂationary protection of the IRA. If you think about this year, right, the inﬂation environment has really been good to us from power crisis and moving higher inventory levels we haven't seen in the real long time, which is clearly helping the business. When I look at the cost, you want to indulge me for a second, I'll kind of break down our costs a little bit more for you, I mean overall O&M and budget perspective.  First oﬀ, a little bit under half of our O&M spend is associated with labor, right? So without half labor, half supplier and contract work. Of that O&M bill for labor, about 25% to 30% is going to be for our workforce that's going to be the representative population, our longest labor contracts go out until 2027. So, we have pretty good visibility on labor inﬂation rates on that piece of our labor bill, kind of in the 2.5% range.  On the non-union private things, we saw some of that this year with the hiring and recalibrating some of our pay levels. We are seeing upward wage inﬂation just as you are seeing everywhere else in the economy kind of top to bottom, so that's something we're keeping an eye on. Our focus is making sure we pay our people fairly and well, and so we're managing that for that something that's kind of the reality of the world in which we operate right now.  If I go to the contracting and supplier side of the equation, and really, this is predominately nuclear and power-related set when we get to this side of our dollars. About half of that spend is kind of what 20 major partners, so large partners to the company are big providers. We generally sign multiyear contracts with them with inﬂation caps or bands around them. That's helped to manage some of that inﬂation in the 2%, 3% range. Obviously, there's some news in   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   sensitivities we go through renewals and there are some causes for things like (inaudible) escalation and things like that. It hasn't been a huge drag so far, but something working in an island. And now, on the other half of the supplier, right? These are going to be a wider range of suppliers, smaller, shorter contracts, things like that. So far, we've managed that inﬂation pretty well and certainly well below we've seen in the market, but it's something we'll keep an eye on.  Given our size and how we buy, we get beneﬁts of both buying. We also buy an inventory. So we spaced out some of those costs they roll through particularly when we think about nuclear inventories or things like that which will help us to manage our costs.  A couple things that I called up in my script today when you think about for kind of next year. The growth spending that we had this year, I think you should expect us to continue to make some investments in growth. This is an important opportunity for us in putting money to work there to help fuel that opportunities important on the stock comp, which was fairly notable amount of money this year. That the tails on that are pretty small, to be honest. Most of that gives time to this year just on how the true-ups work. So, there's a little bit there, but in the scheme of, what our own understand is, it's pretty, pretty tiny. So, that's probably how I think about O&M as you kind of look at your model and our plan will be to refresh all these numbers for all of you on the fourth quarter earnings call in a normal course."
"Perfect. Thank you guys. Very, very helpful disclosures. Thanks. Bye.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open."
"Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks. So, just on the -- Joe, one of the growth avenues you mentioned is operates of nuclear. Could you talk to what the operate potential might be of the ﬂeet and any timing on that?","Yes, Steve. First of all, good morning. So, as we dug into the IRA a little, one of the things that we're saying is that the way we interpret this on and I think as everyone interprets, the bill is that for incremental carbon-free megawatt shift, this isn't perfectly accurate, but you basically get a double PTC for those incremental angle loss[ph]. So, Bryan Hanson, and our Chief Nuclear Oﬃcer, David Rhodes have kicked oﬀ across us to look at diﬀerent upgrades that might be available to us. Also, we've looked at these for a number of years, so we're not starting from scratch.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   We'll be looking at the economics of those upgrades over the fourth quarter. I think what we're in a position where we will start to be able to provide an update on the fourth quarter call. I think it's fair to say, it could be hundreds of megawatts, but we need to look at the economics to see if they make sense. What's good about that, right, is that, when you increase the output of the machine, you're not adding people, so they are operated without incremental O&M cost associated with running machines. And in some cases, it involves adopting technologies that actually allows us to become even more eﬃcient from an O&M perspective. So, we need to get cost from vendors and we need to study the implementation cost. But that's something I think that's going to be available to knit us now and we'll be able to talk on the fourth quarter call. I don't think I'd give you more color than that right now."
Okay. And a double PTC would essentially be kind of one for being like a new carbon-free megawatt and then another for being nuclear PTC essentially.,"Yes, let me turn it over to Kathleen Barron, who's here with me to explain how it works.     Hi, Steve. Yes. Joe's talking about the tech neutral credit that is for any carbon energy[ph] resource that goes into service at the end of 2024. So, you would no longer be eligible for those incremental megawatts for the existing neutral PTC you would transition into that, new carbon-free tech neutral credit that's roughly double the value.     (inaudible) 45-megawatt credits, right?     That's right."
"Yes. Okay, thank you. And then just going back to the prior question on O&M, I know you don't want to really deﬁne all that at the moment. But just with respect to the part that's related to growth initiatives, can you give us a sense of kind of how much you're willing to size that? And then to degree that you start moving forward with projects, would it get capitalized into those? So, it's kind of temporary. Just how to think about how big the (inaudible).","Yes, Steve. I don't know. I don't want to put it too ﬁne a point on us. We're still trying to understand some of these opportunities. It's killing us. I don't want to give you an exact number, but it's going to be less than 1% right now of our O&M is going to that kind of spend   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   just by context. Okay? So, that's probably I would think about it. I don't think I'm seeing or getting any number above that if that's helpful.  As we look forward, as we go from kind of this work to moving forward on projects, you're right, we will start to capitalize them once we have sizable projects with a plan and a business commitment to move forward. I think we'll probably have some level of O&M spend to capitalize on growth for maybe several years to come or longer, because there's always going to be work on trying to develop the next project even as one gets underway, right? So, one hydrogen project could go and it would be the work on the next one or the other behind the meter opportunities, they will have some sustaining growth O&M there, but it has been moved to commercializing a project that would be capital.     And Steve, it's kind of everything. If the hydrogen starts, we started from a position earlier in the year where frankly, we just needed to learn a lot before we can do this track. The hub work, the work is investigating upgrades and other growth opportunities, all that stuﬀ as a starting company essentially that hasn't done a lot of those investments over the last few years required us to bring in some talent, some consultants and other experts to get smarter about that. And that's at a cost this year. It's smart, it's good investments. It's what we need to be doing."
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Good morning, Paul."
"Hi, thank you. Good morning. Just to kind of pull together this stream of questions. Could you give expectations on all in how much you expect O&M to change year-over-year into 2023?","Hi, Paul. As I said, I will give that -- we will give that update on the fourth quarter earnings call when we can give a comprehensive view of all the pieces put together including the rolling forward of our various margin outlooks. There is probably a lot of it early, I think it gets kind of fair when you think about some of the things enumerated on a prior question with Shar that we are seeing some pressures where we do our best to mitigate that as we can but I think you're fair to understand that there are some challenges out there in this inﬂationary environment.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)"
"Okay. Understood. And then separately, could you just elaborate a little bit on how the change in interest rates inﬂuences the plan for capital allocation, more speciﬁcally the right level of leverage perspectively? Just kind of how you think about that, whether it's on a quote, unquote ﬂoor from a PTC level of EBITDA or the higher market levels as well?","Yes. I think we're comfortable with where the balance sheet is right now. I think the ﬂexibility that aﬀords us is attractive, right? And we saw the support of the agencies, which we're happy about. We also kind of look at the balance sheet as a tool we can use when we look at some of these potential larger investment opportunities. The idea of using the balance sheet to support them is going to be available to us. So, we're good with where the leverage is right now and in the ability to ﬂex it, when opportunities come up.  When I think about the return on capital as we make new growth investments or a threshold we look at for M&A or anything else we talked about, a double-digit unlevered return at the Analysts Day that is still our North Stars, we're evaluating opportunities and projects internally, and I don't see that changing at this point in time. So, that's pretty well where we are."
"Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.     Good morning, David."
"Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. On hydrogen, I was wondering what's the current state of commercial discussions with partners or suppliers. Wondering, if any of the diﬀerent kind of business opportunities by wire or co-locating fuel cells might be farther ahead than others at this stage.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   We're -- look, we're in kind of (inaudible) space with a lot of folks here. So, I would say that there have been very expensive conversations on all fronts, in both the co-location as well as providing energy to customers who want to produce hydrogen at their own site. And what we were hopeful is that by the ﬁrst quarter, we will be in a position where we're going to be able to start to announce on commercial deals and commercial activity. The hub proposal is going to take a little bit longer. Kathleen, if you want to share a little bit of your thoughts on the timeline for that work. But that also has some commercial contracts that will be a signiﬁcant part of that work. So, in a sense, that stuﬀ has to be done before the deal we can grant, that's funny.     That's exactly right, Joe. It is a deployment hub. So, the announcement that went out last week about the MachH2 Coalition in Illinois, and the breadth of that demonstrates how many commercial parties are involved to create a bid to the DOE that demonstrates all the diﬀerent potential production pieces and use cases and the midstream sort of connection between the two.  So, as part of that announcement, we have a number of diﬀerent hydrogen producers, transportation companies, clean fuel producers, national labs, NGOs, and a number of governors and senators expressing support for the alliance as announced. The next step will be to get the bid together for the DOE, which is due in April. And then, later in 2023, we will ﬁnd out where DOE is going to direct that $8 billion of government matching dollars to get the hubs into development and ultimately into production later in this decade.  But as Joe said, we have had some really great conversations across the hydrogen value chain just to pull together that -- just for that alliance to be pulled together, which is making folks at least in the Midwest super excited about the potential there for building out the clean hydrogen economy."
"Okay great. Thanks so much for the color there. Then, I was just wondering in the quarter on the unplanned outages that you saw, wondering if there were any common kind of underlying causes there or any need that you might see for additional kind of spending related to the issues like maintenance CapEx or anything that might be lingering beyond last quarter.","Yes, it's nothing unusual and nothing that we think is going to aﬀect future operations or projects. We have some one-oﬀ issues and probably the longest outage which we had a vendor provided part that didn't perform up to expectations and missed the speciﬁcations for that part that created an issue for us. The reality is these sorts of things happen every year. But every year, we're not talking even in the Exelon days about outages, but at these very high prices, you lose 10 days or a little bit more at Nine Mile, which is one of the outages that occurred during the quarter and it becomes a signiﬁcant drag, it adds up quite quickly.  So, let me ﬂip it over to Bryan Hanson to see if there's anything else he wants to share here.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      No, I think you covered it, Joe. There's nothing extraordinary about any of the issues we had. We will provide some more vendor oversight to make sure the quality of parts that we get meet our standards. And again, we have very high expectations of how we operate these plants. And so, when a piece of equipment isn't performing right, we'll take the plant down, make the repairs and restart them. And I'm just so pleased wrapping up our refuel audit season here in the next couple of weeks with four outstanding refuel outages this fall, and we're on track to make, like Dan said, better than a 94% capacity factor for year end, which would be industry- leading as always."
"Okay, understood. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our last question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.",
"Hey. Good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time here. Just -- Hey, Dan, just wanted to check in, on the Analysts Day, you had this free cash ﬂow -- unidentiﬁed free cash ﬂow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion. The gross margin is tracking higher since then, but then you have some O&M related to towards some growth projects. So how should we think about where are we tracking in that range? If you could just update us there.","Yes. We're not refreshing that speciﬁcally here. I would say on the year, our EBITDA has done well, our CapEx is tracked online, and I think our performance this year is certainly consistent with our expectations that we have in that line that page in the Analysts Day. I think about next year and we're always going to go through budgeting process. But the price outlook in the market conditions have improved for next year. Obviously, we had a cost discussion that was going on today, but I think we feel good about the numbers we shared with you in the spring."
"Awesome. Thanks. And then, just maybe a ﬁner point. On the Q4 call, what should we be expecting? Should we be expecting 2023 guidance looks like, but could we expect a longer dated EBITDA guidance? Some of the investors have talked about perhaps providing a ﬂoor. So, in addition to the capital allocation update, how should we think about sort of pro forma EBITDA guidance ranges?","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Yes, I think we will give you this '23 guidance for sure. We will give you some gross margin disclosures and hedge disclosures certainly through 2024. There's a little bit of complexity as you're well aware without clariﬁcation from treasury on how gross receipts are going to be calculated. That does have a bearing bolt on EBITDA and free cash ﬂow and how they're going to look. So, I think we want to get through that process and have little more clarity there before we probably extend beyond a '23, '24 look. That could also complicate a little bit how we talked about a base EBITDA number, but it's something we're trying to get our arms around as we know that you guys would like to see it. But we also want to make sure we have a well-reasoned number that's supportive of (inaudible) treasury."
"Understood. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference back to Joe Dominguez for closing remarks.","Well, thanks everybody for joining us today, and like I said, at the outset to many of our new owners for their interest and involvement in the company. It was a terriﬁc quarter. We knew -- look, we knew walking into this call, folks were looking for us to probably increase guidance and we've talked a little bit about the inﬂationary pressure of labor, but yes, that's a piece of it, but there's growth costs that we had this year as we investigated opportunities, their stock compensation issues, because our employees are enjoying the outside that many of you have enjoyed already.  And we've had a fairly signiﬁcant shaping situation with our contracts. Contracts that we like very, very much and happy to have been able to do that business, and then, we had a few extra days and unplanned outages. But other than that, the business is performing just to all of our expectations, and we're very excited about the future. So, look forward to entertaining you again on fourth quarter call, and until then, be safe, take care of yourselves, and (inaudible).
