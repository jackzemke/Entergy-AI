Question,Answer
Hey. Good morning. Thanks so much.,"Good morning, David."
"Morning. Appreciate the update. Joe, you mentioned that you're exploring the potential to locate next-generation nuclear units at your site. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that, just maybe what technology you're looking at. Where does that stand overall?","Yeah. So, David, here's what we've done so far on that. There was an RFI that was issued by three companies, Google, Microsoft, and Nucor Steel. And what these companies were looking for is power today, but also some role in building new clean power supply in the future. And so what we outlined in our response to that request for information is exactly what I said earlier on the call, that we think our existing sites are an incredibly valuable resource as we consider new ﬁrm clean energy, in particular, from nuclear energy.  And so we proposed a structure, kind of a multi-tiered structure, where we could begin ﬂowing power today from our existing power plants on a long-term PPA. As part of that long-term PPA, we would work with our customer to begin to evaluate opportunities to add new ﬁrm energy. Now a big part of that is subsequent license renewal of plants in our ﬂeet, then up-rates and other opportunities that we have organically to add additional megawatts in our ﬂeet.  And then ﬁnally, to investigate diﬀerent technologies for SMRs and actually, other technologies as well that could be cited at our locations. And what we would anticipate doing over time is having some work with the customer to select that technology, and then the customer, through increases in the PPA, would begin to fund site development work, construction, ultimately scaling up to the point where the PPA absorbs the full cost of an operating new unit.  And so we would anticipate operating the unit for the owner, because obviously it would be on our site, and we would have a slice of equity given our contribution in land and other things of   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   value to the owner. So this is in the beginning stages, but what I could tell you is it's of great interest to a number of clients in this space that not only want to have immediate access to power today, but want to have more clean power in the future.  And so that's how we're walking through it. In terms of the technologies we're looking at, I think folks know generally that we have a small equity position in Rolls-Royce, so that would be a technology that we would look at. But we would also look at other competing SMR technologies, and we'd work with the owner to ﬁgure out which technology best meets their future need at the cost that's appropriate. So that's the work in that area.  But again, look, I want to emphasize that the most important thing right now that customers could do in this space is make sure the existing ﬂeet we have right now is ready and funded for subsequent license renewal. These contracts allow for that, and that's an important sustainability objective for our customers. Then upgrades and other opportunities, and ﬁnally new incremental clean generation, which I think could be brought online somewhere closer to the middle of the next decade."
"Perfect. Yeah, that's really helpful color. Very interesting. We'll stay tuned on that -- on how that opportunity develops. And then I was wondering, as you're thinking about, or talking to hyperscalers, big data center developers, are you seeing any discussions or opportunities evolve related to something like a supercomputer, a major multi-gigawatt data center, like the Stargate idea we've seen in the media, something that could potentially use power from multiple nuclear plants? Is that an option that you're seeing being explored at this point?","I think we're just going to be careful here in terms of that, because there's just a lot being reported about that in the press, and we don't want to be, kind of, linked to a particular project until it's time to announce something. But I think what I am comfortable saying is this, David. We're seeing interest in developing projects that are on a size and scale that presently don't exist, but will be needed for training systems and other things to kind of build out and support the need for all of these foundational models.  I think there are up to 170-plus now foundational models that are going to require training data centers. These are things could be aerodynamics or pharmaceuticals, but essentially these very, very large computers that would do nothing more than train for a period of time on all of the learnings in every country, in every language, from the beginning of time until now, be positioned to answer the questions of the future to advance these diﬀerent industries.  So we're seeing signiﬁcant increases in the number of those training modules that customers need. It's our understanding that in order to support the training, we're going to need data centers that are of size and dimension from a megawatt standpoint that is far beyond what currently exists out there in the market."
Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Excellent. Very helpful. Thanks so much for all the color.  Operator  Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.,"Good morning, Shar."
"Hey, guys. Good morning. Good morning, Joe. Maybe starting oﬀ on the disclosures. I mean, obviously, Dan, we've seen some major moves in the curves in recent weeks. You guys didn't really update the ranges on the enhanced gross margin for '24 and '25. I obviously realize you guys gave wide ranges, but I mean, where are you relative to those curves -- these curves?","Yeah, sure. We gave a huge amount of disclosures, as you -- captured on the last call. Our approach to updating those is really going to be when we do a more comprehensive revisit of our guidance, right? What goes into enhanced is more than just a power price. There's a lot going on in the commercial business and other positioning. So, I think when you see us, as assuming we update our earnings guidance or our range as the year goes on, I think that's a good opportunity to refresh the disclosures we have, including our expectations for enhanced in 2024 and 2025.  I think when you look at the curves, and Jim can share more thoughts on this, right, but there's been a lot of movement depending what day you pick, there's the price has been a lot of diﬀerent prices. The near end of the curve, particularly in our markets, has been probably more muted, right? It's the back end where you're seeing a lot of the moves, largely. So, I don't know that within the range you laid out that there's a lot of movement of what we shared with you for '24 or '25 at this point. Jim, do you want to talk about markets?     I think you hit it. I think that if you look out at more the '27, '28, '29 time frame, the market run up we saw during the ﬁrst quarter has kind of held on and maybe gone a little higher. The '24, '25 - - '25, '26 time frame has been a little bit more volatile in both directions, and that volatility is what Joe spoke to, right? When we see the continued base load, retirements, and renewable penetration with energy demand, we're going to see volatility up and down.  The out-year strength, I think, is certainly reﬂective of some of this increased demand that we're talking about. It's not real liquid out there. There's not a lot of trading volumes that can be done out in that time frame. And as Dan mentioned, in our last call we provided, the attribute value   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   slide. I think that's a good proxy for how price movements, whether it's energy prices or attributes or whatever, could be picked up in some of our enhanced earnings.  So, there's some data, I think, from the last call that you can pick up there."
"Okay. It's perfect. So, I guess for '26, '27, '28, whatever, are you still within that 10% to 20% of consolidated range as a general rule of thumb?","I think we use that as a rule of thumb, and I don't want to mark to market. But sorry, if you go back to the slide we had on attribute value in '28, you had $10, which is like the curve might have moved depending on market in that range.  You can see those numbers get bigger and inevitably push you out of that 10% to 20% if you're just going to mark that one variable right now."
"Okay. Perfect. And then, Joe, lastly.","It's Joe. I just want to reiterate the point that, I think, Jim and Dan are making. There's deﬁnitely - - we're certainly seeing upside if you were to freeze this moment in time in terms of the power prices later in the decade, but they're not all that liquid right now.  So, we'll see how it kind of evolves over time. And the right point for you to look at us is when we talk about guidance ranges, again, as we get through the year, we'll provide some more data points on that stuﬀ. But I think it's exciting to see all of that, it also is an illiquid market out there."
"Yeah, no, I appreciate you addressing that because, I mean, that's one of the key questions coming in to us is why didn't you mark like some of your other peers? So, appreciate the color there, Joe.  And then just a note, lastly for me, there's been a bunch of industry chatter on this. Are you considering a TMI restart at this time? If so, can you maybe talk a little bit about the capital involved in that and the timeline? Thanks.","Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Sure. What we'll say is that, we've obviously seen what happened with Palisades. I think that was brilliant. Brilliant for the nation. Saw great support out of Michigan, great support out of the federal government. And we're not unaware that that opportunity exists for us.  So, we're doing a good bit of thinking about a number of diﬀerent opportunities and that would probably be certainly one of those that we would think about. But we're not there yet to start disclosing capital and other things relating to that opportunity. A lot of exciting things for us to do in uprate space as well.  And I think you could kind of -- if these things fall into place, you could kind of see where Constellation might be the nation's leader in adding ﬁrm, clean energy to the grid. And so, these things are huge, chunky things that really position America for the future.  So, we're going to stick with that until we have something more speciﬁc to report."
"Yeah. Fair enough and looking forward to it. Thank you, guys, appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Morning, Steve."
"Hey, good morning. I'm a little more of a peanut butter and chocolate Reese's fan, but I like the peanut butter and jelly reference. Just on the data center opportunity, maybe you could just give us a little more color because there's a lot of utilities talking about data center growth and even some of the companies talking about data centers related to gas plants.  So, just -- ﬁrst on just to touch on the demand that you're seeing, but then maybe more importantly, any sense of kind of timing and just other things to execute beyond just customer demand? Like, are there hurdles you need to get through on permitting, citing, other things that set timing here?","Yeah. Steve, I think the interest is like nothing else we've seen in 20 years in terms of the number of clients that are coming to us, the size and scale of the opportunity. So, I would say that kind of the -- what you're hearing in the market is certainly accurate in terms of the inbounds that we're getting from an origination team perspective and frankly some of the outreach we're doing. So that's all seems to be right.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   Right now it's focused on nuclear because the clients we're dealing with aren't interested, as a general rule, in emitting technologies. They have sustainability goals, they have 24x7 clean goals, and they want to stay on that path. So we're focused right now on the nuclear plant opportunity and monetizing the value of the attributes that we have. And -- but these are, as I mentioned earlier, very complicated.  What's apparent to me is that our prospective customers in this space are all in a hot competition, one against another, to grow this kind of capability. And there is a clear view out there that those companies that move most quickly will be the companies that get a durable advantage in this space. So there are incentives to move very quickly, and we are too. We want to get this business going and to show the results to our owners.  With that said, Steve, there is complexity to these transactions. These are transactions that are longer in duration than any of the power contracts that we're used to talking about in this business and involve notional values that are quite a bit higher. So there's work that needs to be done, diligence that needs to be done.  In terms of things that are connected in front of the meter, and if we're going to talk about PJM, for example, there's a load integration process that people have to get through in order to site a data center on the grid. And this is a network integration service study that could take months at best and years at worst. So a number of these customers are looking at co-location opportunities to hasten the speed in which they can become operational.  So if you're looking behind the fence line of the plan or a co-located opportunity, there's a necessary study process. It's another PJM process, and PJM was clear in its amendments to its documents most recently that you could go either on the grid or behind the fence line, but there's a diﬀerent process.  We have become quite good at using the tools that PJM uses in their necessary study work, so that we could look across our ﬂeet at places where we think we could add the load behind the fence line. We went through a necessary study process at LaSalle, and as it so happens, we were doing that in the case of the hydrogen hub that was intended to be built out there, so we did a study for 900 megawatts, and we were able to match up very closely our ability to model PJM's work and be able to simulate that here at Constellation.  So, I would say that we know very well where we could co-locate data centers and get through the PJM process. But that's a necessary study process that could take anywhere from six months to a year to resume. And once you have that, it goes through, I don't want to say perfunctory, but a fairly routine FERC approval process. And that would be the starting point. So, if you have a necessary study done, what you're really talking about is having the transformers and the infrastructure, but you could kind of break ground pretty quickly. If you don't have a necessary study done, you're going to have to wait a year to ﬁgure out where you could co-locate.  And then on the data company side, they also have the time that they need to build out the shell, the infrastructure, supporting all of the equipment inside, cooling and likewise, and then actually build out the servers inside of it. So you have to anticipate a ramp rate.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   So from my perspective, this isn't something you're going to see people plop into service in '24, '25 towns ahead of others because they started earlier. But this is more stuﬀ that begins in '26, '27, '28, and it ramps over time as data centers are built. No one is plopping down a 1-gigawatt data, and I've read reports of this. No one is plopping down a 1-gigawatt data center in six months. To believe that completely and thoroughly misunderstands the amount of work needed to get this stuﬀ done.  So the contracts have a scaling component to them. You saw kind of an example of that in the Talon, the Susquehanna deal that was done. That's similar to ramp rates that you would see in other things, and that's why I'm pretty conﬁdent we'll be able to manage the energy demands on the system because you likewise will ramp into this load. So that's what I'm seeing here.  A couple of years before you're able to really start delivering the megawatts, and then it ramps steadily after that. What we're trying to do is get the contracts done that lay out the gross amount of megawatts that are going to be needed, the timeframe over which they're going to be needed, and allows us to begin necessary infrastructure work with an understanding that we're doing the PJM study and other things on a parallel path, even as we speak here this morning."
Okay. Is it -- do you think you'll be able to have something to announce by the end of the year?,"Look, I'll stick with this. We are working fast. Our clients want to work fast. I -- for competitive reasons, I don't want to lay out when we think announcements are going to come, and I don't think it would be fair to our clients to do that either at this point.  There's work that is underway. We've got a lot of folks thinking about it and working on it, again, as this call is progressing. So I'm conﬁdent that we are going to be able to get to the ﬁnish line on these things, but we still have some work to do, and I don't want to lay out a time frame for announcements."
Okay. Just one other quick question. The law that passed on the Russia limits on nuclear enriched -- nuclear and then investing in U.S. enrichment. Can you just talk about your nuclear fuel -- update on your nuclear fuel positioning and the impact of that law?,"Yeah, Steve. I think on this one, there's not a whole lot more to report. In eﬀect, when we took the actions we took a couple of year -- over a year ago now, we were anticipating the passage of a ban as we reported at the time.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   It took a little bit longer to get through Congress, but it's now there. It's now realized. So I think it just simply supports the strategy that we put in place a year ago. We think we are in very solid position, kind of industry-leading solid position with regard to fuel.  And we also are happy to see now investments in this domestic supply chain, which means that after this period of time where we've grown inventory, we're conﬁdent that we're going to have available and reasonably priced fuel to run this ﬂeet for the next decade."
Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.     Good morning.
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for giving me time. Maybe just -- you obviously authorized additional $1 billion in share buybacks. I know there is no direct answer to this, but can you just help us kind of think through what is your calculus when you're thinking about incremental investment opportunities versus deploying capital on share buybacks and then considering M&A in the future?","Yeah, I don't mind talking about it at all. It really is a summation of everything we've talked about in the call. We think we have a very good strategy here. We think as we compare that to M&A opportunities, the unrealized value in Constellation seems to be the best place for us to put our investment dollar right now. It has -- we've been buying we've been buying shares of this company since we were, what, in the $80, and we saw a little bit of a drop in prices. We had some kind of negative, I would say, analyst reports at that point in time. We didn't believe it.  We told you we didn't believe it. We told you we'd buy the company all day long. We still feel that way today because what we're looking at is the potential growth in our business, the opportunities that we're working on, the fundamentals and power markets and sustainability goals that I talked about earlier. I think that unrealized value is the best thing out there to go   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)   buy into. And so when we have extra cash, we're going to buy into that, and that's precisely what we're doing.  The only thing that we'll like better than that is making ourselves bigger and better. So these uprate opportunities or other things where we could add megawatts of scale give us a great positioning and are actually supportive of the work we're doing with the data companies. So that's where I think you're going to see our deployment in capital. We'll continue to look at reinvesting in ourselves and investing in these organic opportunities.  Presently, I don't see an M&A opportunity on the horizon that is at a scale that is going to enter into this conversation. Because I don't think those opportunities provide equivalent value to our owners as investing in ourselves or the organic growth opportunities that we have here."
"That's very clear, Joe. I appreciate all that color. And then can I just switch gears and quickly follow up? In regards to the nuclear PTC guidance, what are the key items for us to look there? Is it the deﬁnition of gross receipts? How do you see that playing out? Anything you can share there?","I wish I could. We're waiting for Treasury guidance. As we've probably said this on four calls, but it is not as near as we could tell a high-priority item for Treasury, because it has narrow application out there. It's really just nuclear owners that are looking for it.  We think spot is most likely going to be the thing that prevails. So the spot price over the year at the bust of the plant, that's going to be energy and capacity coupled together, are going to be the measuring stick that the Treasury will use for the application of the PTC. That's kind of consistent with the vast majority of the comments in this area.  Certainly, we think that's where they're going. But we just don't know yet because they haven't announced anything and we're waiting on that. But our planning is based on that spot interpretation as we've outlined previously."
Excellent. Thank you for giving me time. I appreciate it.,"You're very welcome.  Operator  Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back over to Joe for closing remarks.   Constellation Energy Corp (CEG US Equity)      Well, again, Towanda, thank you for kicking us oﬀ this morning. Thanks to all of you. We very much appreciate your interest in Constellation. I want to thank our women and men for a fantastic quarter. We look for more to come as the year goes forward.  We're working on a lot of diﬀerent things here at the company. The wind is at our backs. We feel very conﬁdent about the future and the fact that our best days are ahead. So look forward to catching up with you again on next quarterly earnings call.  With that, I'll close the call.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.
