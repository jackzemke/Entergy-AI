Question,Answer
"Good morning, everyone. Actually this is John [ph] from Michael.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Good morning. Sir, quick questions we see on the merger. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what conﬁdence you have in terms of synergy and business opportunities in that merger, given the physical distant between the companies?","Yeah. The way we look at this is, we look at opportunities for revenue synergies between our unregulated businesses. They have customer lists, which can beneﬁt the combined new business mix, so that creates revenue opportunities we have with any corporate public merger of this size, you would obviously have opportunities for streamlining and eﬃciencies. And if you look at just the number that we put in here as a placeholder of $50 million to $100 million of pre-tax, that's a fairly small number compared to the revenue elements of the unregulated businesses as well as the combined O&M budget of the two companies. So, we think this is very achievable."
"Right. Okay. Thank you. So on the total FFO to debt, can you remind us what kind of range of the combined entity, you indicated 15% upon the closing of the merger, and what range will be -- you will be comfortable and plan to improve that ratio in the future?","That's right. Subsequent to the merger on a forward-looking basis, we see 15% FFO to debt, as calculated by the rating agencies, and that should gradually improve over time."
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yup.  Operator  Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI.
Thanks. Good morning. Great quarter in the core business. Congratulations on a good start.,Thank you. Good morning.
"Sorry to circle back on this, but frankly you guys have paid a pretty signiﬁcant premium to have the opportunity to merge with Vectren and the business is -- core utilities are excellent businesses, there is no question about that. I'm just less familiar with their unregulated businesses and since the secret sauce here in terms of earning back the merger premium seems to be in the synergies, you think you can generate in the unregulated segment, could you just please, if you can, talk about what sort of the natural industrial logic is to the synergies there? And why you believe that combining those businesses your current Energy Services platform and their VISCO and VESCO businesses creates that type of opportunity?","So, Greg, I think to your point, it's a mix of revenue opportunities as well as eﬃciencies from combining two companies. So it's both of those pieces, but the piece you are asking about speciﬁcally is the opportunities associated with these unregulated businesses. They have a -- Vectren has an infrastructure business that works with utilities from around the country, they're in over 30 states. We have a gas business that also interfaces with similar types of LDCs as well as other companies across similar number of states, but not exactly the same states. The ability to bring in services to the utility that's both infrastructure and gas sales oriented is presented by the combination of these businesses. Further when infrastructure -- the infrastructure business goes in to do work for replacement of pipelines, sometimes there is need for continuation of service to customers, we have a group within our Energy Services space that can continue to provide gas service while that repair or replacement work is being done. So we could combine opportunities in that regard as well. Those are just a couple of examples."
"Great, thanks. And it dons upon me just looking at the algebra here that you're targeting 5% to 7% long-term earnings growth, but the math here, if you were to hit the high-end of the synergies, would obviously be signiﬁcantly above 7%. So is that -- am I missing something there, because it seems really obvious? And then second, what are the underlying assumptions you're using with regard to Enable earnings contribution when you think about that guidance?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Well, as you know, Enable only gives guidance for the year. So we've incorporated a range of possible outcomes for Enable beyond the current year, as we think about this growth rate. You are correct though, that if we were to hit the high-end and you did the math, the growth rate would actually be higher than the 5% to 7%. What we were trying to illustrate is that, with respect to our current guidance of 5% to 7% per year growth for the next two years, this merger creates the opportunity for us to be accretive to that."
Great. Thank you very much. Have a good day.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Ali Agha from SunTrust.
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. Scott or Bill, as you're looking at ﬁnancing for the Vectren transaction, can you give us some sense on how are you thinking about the equity portion of that, Bill, and the timing we should be looking at in terms of any milepost in your mind?","Ali, all I can say on the timing is, in advance of closing the acquisition and in the respect to the forms of equity, as I said in my prepared remarks and as disclosed on the slide, common equity and consideration of other high equity content securities such as mandatory convertibles."
"Okay. And then on the CES business, as you mentioned, you beneﬁted from some spikes in weather, which caused a very strong result this year, it's caused you to raise your guidance, what's the visibility or conﬁdence level that -- of that higher base you can continue to grow or   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   do you think, I mean, just given the nature of that business, does that include or create a level of volatility, even though just small piece but a level of volatility to your earnings. That's diﬀerent from your base core utility business?","Ali, the way we look at is, we look at it is opportunity presented by some variability that we think is more normal or natural in the market. So to that end, as we think about the projection we provided for this year, we look at the business as being able to outperform that next year."
Outperform the next year. Okay. Thank you.,Yup.  Operator  Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merill Lynch.
"Good morning, everybody. It's Josephine on the line for Julien.","Good morning, Josephine."
I just wanted to follow-up on -- you mentioned more equity issuance in 2019 and 2020 to fund the growth. Would that be for incremental CapEx opportunities from the combined unit or would that be CapEx already in the plan?,"Josephine, good morning. It's Bill."
Hi.,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We've discussed in our call in February that due to our increase in rate base investment, we should think about more equity in our capital structure and our view would be that that could be provided by sales of Enable units in 2019 and 2020. For the purposes of the model that you have in front of you in this presentation, we've just assume that that's common equity."
"Got it. And then in regards to Energy Services' strong results this quarter, I was just wondering as part of the restructuring in the capital structure where will Energy Services sit? Is that going to be part of CERC or is that going to move separately?",I think that is to be determined.
"Got it. Okay, great. That's all in my end. Thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche.
"I think you guys hit most of my questions. Yeah, just the Energy Services. But I would like to probe a little more on -- the level you all now talking about for 2018 is sustainable going forward. And in the prepared remarks it sounded like you were talking about being the result of volatility in the market and how do you say that's -- what you now see is more normal? I mean, it's a very signiﬁcant uptick in business that have been going along at a certain level. I just want to understand a little better. You know, if we do (multiple speakers) Go ahead.","Jonathan, this is Scott. Let me try to clarify that a little bit. A component of why the business did better was related to what we think is a more normal volatility. The majority of the improved performance was, what I would consider base business that has to do with the addition of customers and improvements in margin. And that is the result of eﬀectively integrating the two acquisitions we made, the most recent one having been AEM. So that's what is the primary driver of the improvement, which we think is sustainable going forward. There was an element in here though that was caused by some weather-related volatility that we were able to take advantage of.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Okay. So mostly sustainable eﬀectively?,Yes.
"And then in terms of how you're thinking about the guidance, the 5% to 7%, it's that now sort of formally oﬀ of the high-end of 2018 or is it still oﬀ of some other number?","You can think of it. You can think of that as oﬀ the high-end.     Jonathan, in the slide that we used to develop the 2020 EPS, it was oﬀ the high-end."
"Yeah. I see that. Okay, great. I think that's all I got. Thank you very much.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Insoo Kim from RBC Capital Markets.
"Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Insoo."
"Going back to the 2020 potential accretion in the earnings potential, obviously the earnings beneﬁt from the commercial opportunities and cost savings is pretty meaningful, at least, from our view. And I think you've reiterated the fact that beyond 2020 you expect this deal to be   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   even more accretive, does that mean that this 50 million to 100 million pre-tax number could be higher in 2021 and 2022?","Yeah. I think it's possible that there will be -- in fact, we would expect to see more beneﬁt in the out years. We were just providing a picture of what it would look like if we were to accomplish two levels either at 50 total beneﬁt or 100 million total pre-tax beneﬁt."
"Understood. And then maybe a question on Enable. Obviously given Enable has been performing well as of late and they expect to reduce exposure of your portfolio after that VVC acquisition. Does this make you rethink in anyway your strategy of divesting it, in general?","No, our views about Enable are consistent with how we've been showing them in the past. We think that Enable is well positioned. They are performing well in their space. You saw their call and their operations. We've just said that if we see constructive markets and an opportunity to redeploy some proceeds from a sale into a constructive market that we would consider doing so. But we still very positive on Enable's performance. Our view to reduce exposure is simply about reducing exposure to the Midstream space."
Okay. So there was no real deﬁned timeline of when you're going to be out of the Enable stake?,That's correct.
Got it. Thank you very much.  Operator  Your next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe.,
"Good morning. Wanted to follow up on that same question. So, Scott, you said in your remarks that Enable is -- you think Enable is undervalued based on the latest numbers they provided. And I guess arguably one of the main reasons for the stock hasn't done as well is because everyone knows CenterPoint may sell overtime. So, I guess, a question here is, how do you kind   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   of stop that feedback loop and use your communication a little bit diﬀerent from the standpoint that you're not necessarily -- it does require constructive markets to sell Enable, you're not just going to it because it strategically you want to shrink the exposure.","Yeah. Steve, I think you're absolutely right. It's about ﬁnding a right opportunity in which to reduce our exposure. It's not about a need to have to sell our position down. My comments about being undervalued, I think, are certainly with respect to Enable. If you look at their performance, I think, unfortunately, I think the whole sector is suﬀering similar pressure as Enable at the moment. That's just a lack of a constructive market and the ability to attract investors at the moment. So, my comments are about the -- both Enable and the industry. And I just want to reiterate that as we look for opportunities to reduce our ownership, we need to be very thoughtful about and do so on a coordinated fashion with Enable, so that we don't have a negative impact on Enable."
Okay. And I guess one could argue we are having Vectren would further diversify your mix without having -- you having do sell any Enable for a while too?,It does have an ancillary beneﬁt. I think we show that on one of the slides. I even think referenced it on one of my comments.
My other question is on the synergies. Is it -- can you give us a rough sense of the mix on the synergies between commercial revenue type synergies versus cost synergies?,Yeah. We're not far enough along to be able to do that. What we attempted to do here was put in some numbers that are very reasonable and very achievable. The exact mix between all of that is yet really to be determined.
Okay. Thank you. Yup.,"Steve, I will just add one additional comment there. Remember the corporate cost savings or corporate G&A that we might have, that gets spread across all of our unregulated and regulated businesses. So, we'll be keeping a good percentage of those savings.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. So the synergies that you're selling there, that would only include the synergies you would expect to keep?",You're right.
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Charles Fishman from Morningstar Research.,
"Hi. I think my question just got an answer. But let me make sure on -- the Steve was referring the slide 19 of 50 million to 100 million potential commercial opportunities/cost savings, that's strictly unregulated in the holding company. Anything that's associated with the regulated utilities is up in the second line and is incorporated into the 6% to 8% growth, is that correct?","No, that's partially correct, Charles. And that the -- it's associated with the regulated businesses, that's going to be for the beneﬁt of those customers, but it is not captured and the ﬁrst two lines which forecast CenterPoint and Vectren's net income."
"But the 50 million to 100 million, that's cost savings and unregulated, cost savings at -- any -- because you got two holding companies that you can spread out over more operations. And obviously, I think, it was referred to earlier, the secret sauce of expanding the commercial opportunities with its certainly real and can be determined, but that's all that's included in that 50 million to 100 million. There is nothing -- you are not anticipating any cost savings eventually ﬂow to the regulated utility customers.",Those will go to the customers.
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. That's what I thought. Just want to clarify -- make sure. Thank you very much. That's all I have.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Larry Liou from J.P. Morgan.
Thanks for taking my question.,Yeah. Good morning.
Could you just give us a little more clarity around the internal spend. How much that you expect to raise at the new entity? And how would you go about kind of paying down that debt at CERC to get to the 48% debt ratio?,"Right. So the -- I'll begin with the ﬁrst part of the question. Internally, we have allocated 3 to 4 times EBITDA as the debt to that entity. And the EBITDA is simply the distributions to CenterPoint, which were $297 million in 2017. So, we will be working with the lending community as to what's the right amount of debt that those distributions can support. You are also correct in that we will be paying down some debt at CERC to get to the 52%, 48% equity debt element and that we have at this point in time a higher dollar amount of ﬁxed rate debt relative to the rate base. So, we'll be looking at various ways to do that in the liability management structures."
"Thanks for that. And just one last follow-up. There was a tax basis change for Enable, because of the spend?",It does not.
Okay. Thank you.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator  Your last question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila.,
"Thank you. Just kind of curious on the Enable. You can't be selling Enable in the market, because you can't get the right price. And according to what Steve said and you agreed to, it's kind of a negative feedback loop, everybody think [ph] that CenterPoint is going to sell. You don't needed to ﬁnance Vectren and you may or may not needed to ﬁnance internal utility projects. So why not spin it to CenterPoint own shareholders and let then shareholder decide what they want to do with Enable, that gets me to another negative feedback loop, it provides value to each individual shareholders, they can realize earnings [ph] they want. Why even talk about separating Enable into a separate unit and doing all this other stuﬀ, just spin it oﬀ to your shareholders.","Lasan, good morning. It's Bill."
Good morning.,"We did review an external spend as part of our strategic work on our Enable investment and we close that out in the middle of last year. The statements we made at that time remain true today. If that were spun as a separate public entity, we did not want to put so much debt on that entity as that would be -- and its ability to service that debt or its ability to look forward for other opportunities. And with the limited amount of debt that we could put on that SpinCo, we would had too much remaining debt at CenterPoint. So we terminated our discussions and are thanking on that for that reason and that remains true today."
"Bill. I apologize, I wasn't talking about an external spend, but spend to your own shareholders, dividending out you shares to your own shareholders.",And that's what I mean by an external spend.
Okay. All right. Thank you.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Thank you.  Operator  I would now turn the call back over to Mr. David Mordy for any closing remarks.     Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming AGA Conference. And that concludes our ﬁrst quarter 2018 earnings call. Have a great day.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.
