Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.","Good morning, Shar.     Good morning."
"So two -- just two questions here separately related. Could we ﬁrst touch a little bit on sort of the pushes and takes with your utility growth guide of 5% to 7%, when you're kind of factoring ongoing dilution and rate base growth that's around 7.5%, I guess sort of what are the drivers there that's oﬀsetting that dilution. I have to imagine O&M is deﬁnitely a lever you guys have to pull, but I'm kind of trying to get a sense on how much under earning to be able to pull that lever and I have a followup?","Yes, Shar. Most of the dilution -- most of the dilution from 7% and 7.5% to 5% to 7% is driven by the equity issuance as we outlined. We do know O&M has lever. We are very focused on ﬁnding ways to allow the utility to earn at allowed ROEs but we also have, as you are aware, in some jurisdictions we have the embedded regulatory lag that we will have to work through, but mostly it's driven by equity."
Got it.,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   As Xia indicated, we plan to very closely control O&M for us to maintain that ﬂat or near ﬂat. We do have very good regulatory mechanisms in states to avoid regulatory lag. But we do have some regulatory lag. But the primary diﬀerence is exactly what Xia pointed out, which is we're strengthening the balance sheet as we're moving through this time period."
"That's perfect. And then just on the new equity guide, does this update sort of account for like any kind of a draconian scenario for instance if Enable cuts its distribution. So, I guess, another way to ask this is, how much sort of balance sheet cushion does a new equity guide provide especially as you're de-risking the business. So, what's the capacity there? Did you over-equitize in order to prevent a situation that maybe you haven't accounted for?","We project to maintain a low to mid-14% FFO to debt and we think that provides the healthy cushion in case of unanticipated events. So, we feel good about that, the FFO to debt coverage ratio."
"Terriﬁc, thanks guys.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Our next question is from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse."
Hi guys.,"Hi, Michael."
"Just to follow up on Shar's question, is there a, other pricing, is there any pricing for oil and gas that you're watching in terms of Enable's earnings where the guidance depends on the pricing for oil and gas being above a certain point, I mean, is there, are the limits there that you could discuss?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We don't typically comment on behalf of Enable. I can tell you that we are very focused on cash, on their cash coverage, on their balance sheet, on their internal O&M management, their maintenance capital and how they recycle their cash ﬂow. So, they do have a 1.3% cash distribution ratio and they're one of the few midstream players with an investment grade credit quality, the management is doing a good job of trying to manage internally. So, we will continue to work with them to -- to focus on the cash -- cash coverage.     Yes, as Xia pointed out, 1.3 times coverage on the distributable cash ﬂow compared to their distributions is solid [ph] to their credit metrics and the history of even when we saw lower commodity prices down closer in the $30 range, they have a history of being able to maintain that because of the strength of that business."
Right. And would you say going forward as part of that 5% to 7% is -- are the -- is that most of that growth coming from the gas utilities now after Houston Electric settlement at this point?,"I think they both -- all the utilities are growing at a healthy rate. We outlined that on the slides that you could see. The gas LDC businesses are growing faster. So, right now, they're about -- the gas LDCs and Houston Electric both have a $6.7 billion of rate base and as we continue to grow capital a little bit faster in the gas utilities eventually they -- the gas utilities will have a bigger piece of the pie, but they're all growing at a pretty healthy level.     Yes, if you just look at how we're allocating capital, it's about 50% to the gas utility for rate base and then 40% Houston jurisdiction, 10% in Indiana, so, capital allocation is pretty evenly split between the two."
"Okay, great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs.","Good morning, Insoo."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you. Good morning. Just ﬁrst question is in your guidance for whether (inaudible) ﬁve- year plan, how do you think about what's embedded in terms of Enable preferreds and any timing on your assumption about when they are called?","Yes, we said, the base answer is we expect Enable to make the best decision possible for their unit holders. So, we are working very closely with them. And in terms of developing our equity needs and the guidance range, we took into consideration the timing of possible redemption of the preferreds, but just from a FFO to debt standpoint, we wanted to make sure we have enough cushion to accommodate either way and, from earnings standpoint, our range will cover whether or not they call this year."
"Understood. And when you gave you updated utility CapEx for the ﬁve years, what are some upside or downside items we could potentially consider or, and then capital that's potentially nine your plan that may show up later this year?","I mean, capital -- the capital decision we make that on a daily basis. We have a -- we have a budget for all the utilities, but they are on the ground trying to make the best decision possible every day. We do have a pretty rigorous capital allocation process in place such that we take into consideration the rate case ﬁling timing, the recoverability -- we could -- we have a portion of the capital we could pull or put just being based on each jurisdiction situation. So, we feel really good about how we manage through that. And then on top of that, you have rate relief last year, like John said, we received approval of over $100 million of rate relief. And so we think that will add the growth engine for us and also the growth from the jurisdictions from a customer addition standpoint is another factor taking into account consideration.     And then we have weather variability which Xia mentioned earlier but with normalization and with some weather hedging, we can minimize the impact but we still have impact of weather. And then we have the upside of being able to do what we did last year as part of the integration and that's very, very focused management of O&M costs."
Understood. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Antoine Aurimond from Bank of America.,CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Good morning.
"Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.","Absolutely, go on."
"Hi, question on the balance sheet front. So, does the $500 million to $700 million equity issuance bring you to the low to mid-14% FFO to debt you highlighted, and more importantly, given that these levels are still sort of below Moody's 15% downgrade threshold, are you conﬁdent this allows you to stay in the mid triple B level, and do you remain committed to debt rating?","We remain in close conversation with our rating agencies as we make decisions on -- business portfolio decisions and we remain very conﬁdent that the recent divestiture of Infrastructure Services and Energy Services as well as our execution on the utility front, our ability to earn allowed ROEs, all those things will play in the decision by the rating agencies. We remain very conﬁdent that they will see the recent decisions and execution favorably."
"Got it. And then just in terms of timing to get to that low to mid-14%, is it this year after the issuance or was it more later in the planning period?","So, you do -- I do remind you that we are expecting $1 billion of net proceeds from the divestiture of those two businesses in the second quarter. So, we have tremendous ﬂexibility in terms of getting to the desired FFO to debt ratio throughout the year."
"Okay, got it. Thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning.
"Yes, hi, good morning. Hey, Xia. I guess this question is for John, maybe you could just give a sense of how the Board and you are looking at timing of kind of a permanent CEO and what you're looking for there and I guess also was there any consideration of just, is CenterPoint's structure as it is today kind of set up okay or does it need to be kind of part of a larger organization?","Yes, you have asked a number of questions all in all in one question, Steve. But, yes, the, our Board is very focused on exactly what we're focused on, that they see the value of our utilities, they see the value of investment in rate base, growing those earnings, they very much supported over this last time period simplifying the business, the sale of Infrastructure Services and Energy Services and so that strategy is what they support and what they believe is appropriate moving forward, and we believe we have a very good platform as CenterPoint as a structure today to do that. So, that strategy is very much in place, very much what we plan to move forward with.  On my own personal issue, I am Interim President and CEO. I have no timeline or no time limit. I am here, very proud to be here, very focused on executing on the strategy for as long as is required until the right transition to a permanent CEO at the right time is made and I'll focus on the real obvious things which is operational excellence everything from ESG performance which includes safety, compliance, reliability, managing O&M cost to achieve these outcomes, continuing to strengthen our regulatory relationships, we have a history of good regulatory outcomes, we'll make sure we continue to strengthen those to have the best outcomes. Moving forward, we're going to focus on the balance sheet to make sure that we strengthen the balance sheet and meet that objective that Xia talked about this year through the combinations of things she talked about, and we're going to focus and what I would expect when a new -- permanent CEO comes in, I'm going to focus and will continue to focus on meeting with our investors and understanding your concerns, needs, make sure that our plan is transparent to you, that we communicate what our expectations are to you and then work -- and then we consistently meet those. So those are kind of our priorities and I hope I answered all your questions, Steve."
"Yes, I know that was very super helpful and I apologize, I have one other question for Xia. Just any color you could provide on timing of the equity issuance in 2020?","Sure. And you are fully aware that the current market conditions are volatile and we believe it is very important to be patient and yet poised to act when market conditions present themselves. As I said just now that we are anticipating $1 billion of cash inﬂow from the divestiture of the assets in the second quarter so that we could reduce debt in 2020, support our coverage ratio. So, we have ﬂexibility to execute our plan and so we are just remaining opportunistic, but,   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   regardless, we might likely set up the ATM and turn on the drip to start contributing the equity needs, but we will remain opportunistic at this point."
"Great, thank you. Thank you very much.","Thanks, Steve.  Operator  (Operator Instructions).Our next question is from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates."
"Hey, how are you doing? I wanted to sort of just follow-up a little bit on Steve's question. I mean, it does you guys have a great opportunity that you're outlining all these things -- all these opportunities and the value of your properties quite well, but I'm just sort of wondering in terms of the potential for a strategic, additional strategic options, are those oﬀ the table, I mean, I just wanted to get a sense as to whether or not what the potential might be in terms of given the management changes and everything whether not we might see some additional exploration in that area?","No, that is not our plan. Our plan is to execute and really focus on execution as I just talked about when I answered Steve's question. So that is what management will do, that was what the Board supports and that's what we're going to move forward with."
"Okay, thanks so much.","Thank you, Paul.  Operator  Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, just following up on a few diﬀerent things, real quickly here, ﬁrst Enable strategy, I was, and I think I hear what you guys, say, but I just want to be extra explicit about it, given your focus on execution, you sold several businesses already, there is no deviation from the commitment on Enable, and at the same time on the rating side, you've gotten assurances that despite having still some unregulated piece here that low 14% [ph] works from the agency?","Julien, we don't speak on behalf of the rating agencies. When they're ready, they will let you know. We do know that we have been remaining in very transparent conversations with each of the agencies and they know exactly what we plan to do and the fact that we executed what we shared with the rating agencies would give us a lot of credibility from our perspective and at the same time as you are fully aware, the largest, the largest unregulated businesses are they Infrastructure Services and Energy Services businesses. Post divestiture, we will be 82%, projected to be 82% Utility and 18% Enable. So, essentially, we don't have anything else. We have a little bit of businesses, but they're not material at all."
"Got it. And if I can move back to the core businesses in brief, just to clarify your earlier comment Xia around earned ROEs and through the forecast period. Just to clarify, very speciﬁcally, what kind of improvement in lag are you baking into that, I think that goes back to Shar's question about the reconciliation between earnings trajectory and rate base growth, again, speciﬁcally on the lag? And then also related to that in reconciling that, how much equity are you thinking on an ongoing basis through the full CapEx period that you've disclosed rather than just three [ph] years of ﬁnancing here? Just to be clear about that.","Yes, I mean we have a slide we laid out in the appendix to show you the thinking around that. So, I'll answer the second question ﬁrst. First of all, we are fully focused, very focused on the FFO, then the generated FFO including Enable's contribution. We're mindful about our dividend, dividend policy and the Board will consider going forward. We're very focused on the capital program and wanting to provide a robust regulated growth. All of that take into account -- we take all that into consideration, then we decide how much external funding we would need to maintain our balance sheet. So, that's basically the thinking process. The reason we didn't provide any guidance beyond the three years is because when you get outside of the three-year window, you would have to take into consideration rate cases and other regulatory decisions and some other things that we might not foresee right now. So, I don't want to get ahead ourselves from that regard.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay, all right, fair enough. On that, a little bit on that lag piece to be extra clear, are you assuming, any willingness to share a little bit more of the (inaudible), I know that rate cases matter with their support?","Yes, sure. I would be happy to. Yes, I did forget your ﬁrst question, so (inaudible), so Houston Electric is about 40% of the business, their allowed ROE is 9.4%, so the team is highly focused on ﬁnding ways to get close to 9.4%, that includes revenue opportunities as well as O&M, very disciplined O&M management. So, then the rest of the business, the gas utilities they have a range of allowed ROEs of 9% to 10% on average. I'm generalizing, each jurisdiction is diﬀerent. So, our goal is try to get closer to the top end of the of the range in the planning horizon."
"Got it. Okay, fair enough. One last quick detail, in the CapEx budget, what are you assuming in Indiana Electric with regard to the RFP process and just generation procurement I know that might be sensitive?","Yes, I don't think we're ready. They'll ﬁle in the next couple of months. So, once that is ﬁled, we will be happy to share any details you might want."
"Okay, fair enough, thanks guys for the time. All the best.",Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.
"And just on a housekeeping, Slide 30 that $1.2 billion internal note, I mean, that's always been out there, you're just -- you are listing it as a line item now where you haven't in the past, is that correct or is my memory oﬀ?",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   You always knew that there was $1.2 billion of intercompany loan from the parent to the midstream.
"Okay. So it's just a question, you're just listing it now as in your guidance.",Correct.
"I mean it's always been there though. Okay. And then, the preferred is in the $0.29 to $0.34 correct? Your preferred position in Enable?","It's $360 million and a 10% rate, so that is the parameters of --."
"And that's -- but that is included in the $0.29 to $0.34 not, and it's not an oﬀset to the corporate and other or anything?",I'm sorry I misunderstood your question. And you were asking the 30 -- I'm sorry can you ask the question again. I'm sorry.
"I messed it. Well, you have, you still have this preferred, I think, it's Series A Investment in Enable, okay, and you've had that for a couple of years now, but that's included. If I look on Slide 30 that's included in the $0.29 to $0.34, correct? You are not treating that as corporate and other line as an oﬀset or anything?","No, we didn't. That's outside of Page 30."
Okay. Got it. And that's it. Thank you.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Our next question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc.,
"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. It may be a little housekeeping question here. Are there any non-utility businesses still left in the corporate and other segment. I believe there used to be something there.",They are very little. You do know we have the Energy Services Group as part of the Vectren acquisition. They represent about 1% of the business. We have a small home warranty business but not anything major.
Should we expect those to be sold in over the course of the year also?,"No, we are not considering those right now."
"Got it. And then so on the, when you, when I look at the corporate and other guidance and what's embedded in it, so it's mostly, I guess, corporate level debt right on preferreds, what do you assume as far as how long that remains outstanding right throughout the year when you come up with this guidance?","I'm not sure I followed your question, what is lasting throughout the year?"
Your corporate debt -- corporate level debt?,"The corporate debt - the parent company debt. So, we have, that's on our balance sheet."
All right. So how long do you believe it's going to continue to be outstanding throughout the year when you come up with the guidance what's baked into the guidance for that?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),The current parent company debt level that that we have on our balance sheet is embedded in there.
"All right, thank you. And maybe could you talk a little bit about the O&M eﬀort right and we know historically, the O&M did not, maybe grow faster than inﬂation for CenterPoint and you've been working on identifying ways to ﬁght that. How close are you to understanding what the drivers they are and what particular programs you are looking to bring their O&M down the growth way? Thank you.","I'll start. I'm sure John has thoughts. The part of the big piece of the O&M eﬀort is through our merger integration. So, we achieved, we over-achieved our synergy target last year and through not only headcount reduction on year one but throughout the year, I'm sorry on day one, but throughout the year. So, day one we removed a certain amount of head count and that momentum continued throughout the year and then we also had about close to 300 diﬀerent initiatives to try to improve programs, consolidate functions, and with continued improvement processing in mind. So, and then, on top of that, we are looking at our organizational design, looking at a strategic alignment and using more data analytics and so forth. So, it's a combination of a lot of initiatives together.     And I'd just add to that. The good news you talked about, a head start on this, what we're doing, the process of the integration gave us a real good understanding of many of the cost levers that we can focus on and we had success in implementing a number of those, but there are others that we have identiﬁed in areas like supply chain areas like how we use contractors and manage those issues. We will focus on all items related to that. At the same time, we're fully committed to make sure we spend what we need to, to maintain reliability, safety, compliance with those items, and I've been a part of companies that have managed tightly those issues for a number of years. So, I look forward to getting involved and really focus on the right way to manage our costs."
Got it. And would you be able at some point to commit to a more concrete annual O&M reduction targets?,"I think we essentially did because as I said, both John and I said that last year we achieved the annualized reduction of $100 million, if we essentially maintain that level, so that's a pretty good target, we should think about.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      And then hold it as we move forward ﬂat or near ﬂat and the reason we phrased it that way as we absolutely will make sure we spend the dollars we need to in areas like safety, but my history has always been that when you ﬁnd areas that you simply need to spend money and for those reasons, you also work hard to ﬁnd other areas where you can reduce costs. So, that is our target, and I think that's a pretty straight, straightforward expectation that we have for ourselves."
Got it. Thank you. That's all from me.  Operator  Our last question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.,
"Hey guys, thanks for taking a quick follow-up from me. Just on, Xia, can you just followup question from what Julien was asking was, can you without going into details at least conﬁrm that in Indiana you're not assuming any outcome from the IRP, i.e., there is not a placeholder amount that's in that number?",There is a placeholder amount. I don't want you to think we didn't put in placeholder. The placeholder amount is embedded in the Indiana numbers.
"Okay, great, thanks guys. That was it.","I believe that's our last question. Thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will now conclude our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Have a great day.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call.
