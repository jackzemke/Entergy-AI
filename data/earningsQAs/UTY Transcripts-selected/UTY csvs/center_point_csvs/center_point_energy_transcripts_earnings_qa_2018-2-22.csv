Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, guys.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Good morning, Michael."
Hey. I understand no equity for 2018. Maybe you could comment on how ﬁnancing will shape up in terms of equity and debt going forward through 2022.,"Bill, you want to take this?     Sure. Michael, good morning. It's Bill Rogers."
Good morning.,"With respect to 2019 and beyond, I think it's – let's begin with, we have a commitment to our capital investment on our utilities, we have a commitment to our credit quality, and we've spoken about our dividend. Therefore, I think it will matter what the forward-looking credit metrics are at that time and how much debt we can reasonably take on and whether we should consider sales of Enable units as a source of ﬁnancing and/or sales of common equity. In any event, if we were to consider the sale of common equity, it would be modest."
"Got you. And one just follow-up question on Enable. Now that you'll be holding onto it a little bit longer than, I think, the original plan would have been if you had been able to sell it through a direct sale. I'm just wondering if this changes your view on M&A. In other words, is there a view that the company needs to acquire more regulated utilities or more regulated exposure, considering that you'll be holding on to Enable probably longer than you initially planned?","Michael, good morning. I don't believe the status of where we are with Enable impacts our views with respect to M&A. Our comments in the past have been that we've got a very large capital budget, as you've seen, $8.3 billion over the next ﬁve years that we can invest organically and can grow our core utility business through that investment with known returns. To the extent we were to look at anything outside of that, we have to weigh the returns available against what we can get internally. So perhaps opportunistic, but our core attention remains on the investments in our core business.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Understood. Thank you.,Yeah.  Operator  Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey, good morning. Congratulations.","Thank you. Good morning, Julien."
"So perhaps just to follow a little bit up on the commentary on the balance sheet impact and the cadence of the Enable share monetization. How are you thinking about that through the forecast period? I mean, obviously, you commented that – I believe I understood that no sale for this year, but how are you thinking about the future years against the backdrop of where you want your balance sheet to be from an FFO to debt perspective?","Julien, good morning. It's Bill. Just to clarify our prepared remarks, we said that we do not require the sale of Enable units to support or strengthen our balance sheet and credit metrics in 2018. With respect to the cadence of any sales, I think there are two points for consideration. One is capital markets considerations in the sector and Enable, so we'd want to be doing that constructively in the marketplace. We also want to be respectful of any capital formation needs that Enable might have. And then the second consideration is our use of proceeds and strengthening our balance sheet to redeploy that into our utility businesses."
"Maybe to help provide a little bit more certainty around this. What is the FFO to debt that you're thinking about through the forecast period? Obviously, you're talking about a 300 basis point impact on 2018 metrics. Would you expect us to support that at kind of a roughly consistent level, net of the drop here?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Should be at that level, if not higher."
"Right. So from a modeling perspective, it would be probably a good assumption to backﬁll monetization of units to kind of keep you there?",That would be one way to approach it.
Excellent. Thank you all very much. Best of luck.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. Scott or Bill, when you look at your CapEx plan, which you've laid out to us through 2022, and the rate base growth assumption that goes with that, does that provide you also visibility or conﬁdence that this 5% to 7% growth rate through 2020 could actually continue through 2022, which is kind of the timeframe for your CapEx plan?","Yeah. Ali, I think one way to think about this is we've provided growth guidance in earnings for a shorter period than we provided CapEx for, and that's because of visibility around Enable, primarily. But as you can tell from our spending that the impacts associated with earnings coming from the utilities would conceptually continue given the CapEx that we're spending throughout the entire plan period.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. And on Enable then, Scott, I understand you talked about the balance sheet issues, to keep an eye on the capital markets, et cetera. But just strategically, coming back to your original premise, that you don't want that commodity exposure as part of your business mix or earnings proﬁle. So from a strategic perspective, when would you like to have that exposure eliminated from the overall CenterPoint portfolio?","Ali, we haven't speciﬁed a timeline. What we have done, as you know, is go through the process of considering options that were more rapid exit from this investment and, as you know, none of those worked for us. So having completed that, we are now in the mode of focusing on selling units in a constructive fashion over a longer period of time to reduce our exposure to the commodity space. And as we've outlined, we don't have any speciﬁcity on what that looks like, other than to say, over a period of time, we intend to reduce our exposure and ownership here."
"Right. And lastly, just to clarify, I believe it was in the slides, but the 2019 and 2020 growth rate number that you've laid out for us, that does not assume any sale of any units of Enable, that just assumes your current ownership continues in those two years as well?","I'd say the fairest way to say that is we are committed to targeting that growth rate over this period of time, and we've considered a number of options for ﬁnancing on how we could get there."
I see. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with RBC Capital Management (sic) [RBC Capital Markets].,
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Insoo.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"In terms of the sell-down of Enable units, would there be a possibility for you to pursue potential private placements, instead of at-the-market type of transactions that will enable you to sell a greater portion of the units at a faster pace?","Insoo, good morning. It's Bill. You're correct in that remains an option. Our only constraint there is in our partnership agreement we are limited to selling no more than 5% of our current holdings to one buyer."
"Right. Right. I remember that. Okay. And my second question is – I might have missed it, but is the proposed $250 million Freeport project included in the ﬁve-year forecast that you laid out or is it not?","Yes, it is now included in the new $8.3 billion total."
Got it. Thank you very much.,Yeah.  Operator  Our next question is from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research.
"Thank you. Bill, I'm having a little bit of trouble circling the square here. 8.3% CAGR growth in rate base, but only 5% to 7% earnings growth in next – 2019 and 2020. So, does that mean you're expecting a higher growth rate past 2020, or is there something else? And then I'm assuming that Enable stays oﬀ – stays as discontinued operations. Are you expecting, for example, CES to drag down earnings going forward?","Good morning, Lasan. It's Bill.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Good morning.,"I think you're right directionally in that rate base growth should translate into EPS growth with adjustments for regulatory lag and any common equity that the utility company might contemplate. We have visibility into what our midstream segment will produce the next three years. Our midstream segment has publicly said only what 2018 looks like. So suﬃce it to say, until we get better visibility over the longer-term period, we're not able to stretch out that growth rate beyond 2020."
"So what you're saying is that – what I think you're saying, actually I should say, is that while you expect a certain outcome, you're not going to commit to it until there's more visibility from the midstream sector?",I think it's fair.
Is that all right?,Yes.
"In other words, you're being conservative.","We think we're providing a reasonable view of growth through the three-year window that we are providing, given the visibility that we have to the various business components."
"Fair enough. Thank you, Scott.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay.  Operator  Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research.
"Thank you. Bill, I just want to conﬁrm – I appreciate your comments on the dividend payout ratio overall, but your dividend policy has not changed, in other works 60% to 70% payout of the utility and, I think, it was 90% of cash ﬂow from Enable, is that correct?","Charles, good morning. The way we express this is ﬁrst thing, the board takes a look at our dividend every quarter on our capital needs or strength of our ﬁnancials and so forth, and then decides whether to declare a dividend. With respect to the trajectory of the dividend, we are intending to grow the dividend. We have deliberately shared that it grew 4% in each of 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. We recognize that is a lower growth rate than our earnings per share growth rate, but that allows us the ability to retain earnings and reinvest that capital in our utility business."
"But at the end of the day, I mean, because of Enable, you still – and I realize Enable's only going out this year on their guidance, but it does puts you in a position to be at the upper end of that 60% to 70% and the board would still feel comfortable potentially, correct?","I won't speak for the board, but I think we're certainly comfortable with the dividend payout ratio we have today."
Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I had.  Operator  Our next question is from Ryan Levine with Citi.,
Good morning.,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning, Ryan."
What's driving the large increase in your load growth electric CapEx for 2018 through 2021?,"So, to make sure I understand the question, what's driving the investment need over this period?"
"Yeah. Page 7 of your presentation, the increase from $302 million to $419 million and beyond?","I'll make sure I get the right – oh, you're talking about the growth in CapEx during the middle part of the plan?"
Yeah.,"That is being impacted heavily by this single project I referred to as the Bailey-Jones Creek Project. It is incorporated – that $250 million is a discrete project that's incorporated essentially right in the middle of that plan, with the majority of the spend occurring in 2020."
But there is a big increase between 2018 and 2017. So is any of that in the 2018 number?,"Yes. Part of that is in 2018, but we've also – as we rework our plans for growth and investment needed for growth, we've just updated the amount of spend that we associate with related to load growth, and that's what's being categorized here, is a recognition that the spend would go up from the $300 million range to $400 million for load-related investments as a result of the planning exercise we do each year."
Okay. And then how does tax reform impact the basis that you have in Enable?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Well, as I think you're aware, we have a negative basis at Enable. Tax reform does not impact our basis. Tax reform does impact the capital gains rate that we pay, if we were to sell any of our investment in Enable."
Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.
"Hey. Good morning, guys. It's actually Durgesh on for Greg.",Good morning. Good morning.
"Good morning. Just if I missed this, the 5% to 7% EPS growth target in 2019 and 2020, could you tell us what are you assuming for Enable in that growth, is it ﬂat, is it high growth, or is growing or is it actually deteriorating?","We have not speciﬁed what our assumption is there. We take into consideration a range of options, and incorporating that with the capabilities and the options for the rest of the portfolio. We're comfortable that 5% to 7% growth oﬀ of the prior year is a very doable target."
"Okay, excellent. And then the $8 billion roughly CapEx, the total CapEx through 2022, high level, what percentage of that CapEx is actually covered through like existing mechanism, so you don't actually have to go in for like a major rate case ﬁlings?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So I'll give you the answer in pieces. So on the electric business, it's approximately 95% that can be achieved recovery achieved through mechanisms. On the gas side, it's virtually all of it, with the exception of Minnesota, which does not have these mechanisms, but has a forward-looking test year and also utilizes interim rates. So those two features in Minnesota mitigate regulatory lag."
"Excellent. And just one last follow-up for Bill. The actual cash tax rate, Bill, how does that look like through the forecast period versus the eﬀective tax rate, so what actual cash taxes you'll be paying?",Right. Our cash tax rate should approximate or be below our provision rate of 21%.
"Perfect. Thanks, guys, and congrats.",Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan.
"Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have...",Good morning.
"...been answered. I just wanted to get a sense if you guys could classify your revision of your deferred tax liability. You already gave us, I think, the $1.2 billion for the utility piece, but what's the total amount, how is it classiﬁed, and what are the ramiﬁcations on your subsidiary capital structures?","The total amount of excess deferred income taxes was $2.4 billion, $1.1 billion of that was associated with income from non-utility regulated investments, and so that went through the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   income statement and strengthened the balance sheet in 2017. $1.3 billion of that $2.4 billion was recorded as a regulatory liability, which will be amortized over diﬀerent lives, depending upon the assets associated with those liabilities and depending upon the jurisdiction. Then do I have it right, your second question was on the balance sheet?"
Yeah. The ramiﬁcations for that at subsidiary level balance sheets?,"Got it. So the $1.1 billion recognition that went through the income statement strengthened the consolidated balance sheet from 35% to 40% equity to cap after adjusting out securitization bonds. And some of that beneﬁt ﬂowed through the balance sheet for Houston Electric and for CERC, where those balance sheets are close to 45% at year end and at 50% at yearend 2017. Now, to get those balance sheets at that level, because they add more equity content as a result of tax reform, there were dividends from both of those entities to CenterPoint, Inc. at the holding company."
"Okay, great. Thank you, Bill.",Got it.  Operator  Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I want to come back to regulatory lag, and I asked this seeing in the K that O&M at the Houston Electric was actually up a good bit year-over-year. On a net income basis – let's not worry about the ﬁnancing and share count, but on a net income basis, how much regulatory lag do you think you have electric versus the gas LDC business? I mean, do you think you can earn authorized? Do you think there's just some natural lag on O&M that you can't recover, so you earn something below? If so, how material? How do you think about that or what do you assume kind of in your multiyear outlook?","Michael, it's Bill. Let's begin by assuming that O&M growth stays with volume – sales growth on the residential side, so that we have an oﬀset, if you will, to that element of regulatory lag. Now the real regulatory lag is how quickly our mechanisms allow capital expenditures to go into rate base and earn a return. The TCOS mechanism allows for ﬁlings twice a year and is relatively   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   quick when that gets into the revenue requirement, and so that regulatory lag can be as short as six months.  The DCRF mechanism is ﬁled once a year, that's in April and that's oﬀ of books that close at year end. And our experience in the last ﬁlings is that then gets reﬂected in revenue requirement towards the end of the third quarter. So, if you assume that we had an average spend on distribution investments in the prior year, you get a regulatory lag of as short as nine months, but it could be up to a year."
"Got it. A follow-up, tax follow-up, very simple one. Do you assume you're a full cash taxpayer at all during the next four or ﬁve years? Like, when I think about the backend of the forecast, are you still not a full cash taxpayer out there?",We don't expect to be a full cash taxpayer.
"Got it. Finally, just a regulatory question, what's the process for the proceeding that's coming up in Texas regarding the Commissioner's memo and the rate review for CenterPoint Houston?","Michael, so we have agreed recently to ﬁle a rate case before April 30 of 2019. So sometime before then, we're obligated to make our next full rate case ﬁling."
Using a historical test year with kind of six months of known and measurables type of deal?,"It's a full historical test year. And we've not speciﬁed exactly that what that test year would be. But it, obviously, has to be sometime between now and when we have to ﬁle."
"Got it. Okay. Thank you, Scott. Much appreciated, guys.","Yeah. Thank you, Michael.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator  Our next question is from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie."
"Thank you. Actually, just two follow-ups. So, given the tax law changes and the lower tax leakage that a sale of your stake in Enable would entail, would you potentially reconsider strategic options for that business? I understand that the tax leakage was a big adverse eﬀect of potential sell-downs of the assets in the previous review, but now with the tax law change, does it change your perspective?","Angie, this is Scott. No, we are not – it does not change our perspective on it. You are right, it gets better, but it's still very challenging to do and accomplish our ﬁnancial objectives. So, it doesn't change our intent in terms of how we plan to reduce our exposure there."
"Okay. And separately, on potentially incremental transmission CapEx in ERCOT we're seeing ﬁnally some inﬂection point in forward power prices in ERCOT north probably more so than in Houston. Have you identiﬁed any potential additional transmission projects that could be necessary, given the recent wave of retirements?","We have not, but our operators continue to study this. And depending on how the system's performing and what the needs are with respect to capacity to move power as demanded by the system, it could give rise to additional investments. We look at this annually. We adjust our plan annually based on how the system is operating and what the most recent projections are. But as of now, we've included everything that we have in situ."
Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Will Zhang with LNZ Capital.,
"Hi. This is Reza, actually. Just a quick question. What is the portion of Enable earnings within 2018 guidance?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Reza, good morning. It's Bill. If you were to take the midpoint of Enable's net income guidance that they put out last year, and then translate that into CenterPoint EPS, you would get $0.46 per CenterPoint share. And the way to do that is to take the midpoint of their guidance, the eﬀective tax rate, state and federal, associated with our Enable investment is 24%. We own 54% of Enable. And then after you've done that, add $0.07 per share for the accretion."
"Okay, got it. And then just to clarify, there's no Enable sales contemplated in 2018, but in the three-year CAGR timeframe, is there Enable unit sales contemplated in that?",What we've said is that our 2018 plans doesn't call for the sale of Enable units in order to support our capital investment. We've also said that this multi-year view that we've given you contemplates a range of scenarios to include a range of ﬁnancing alternatives.
Thank you very much.  Operator  Our last question is from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research.,
"Thank you. Bill, CES has a $900 million credit facility, of which $899 million was used through February – or as February 9. Is that an indication that CES is doing a lot of business or is there something else and would you be looking to increase the facility going forward?","Lasan, are you speaking to a speciﬁc credit facility for CES?"
"I was just looking through the 10-K and it said that CES had a $900 million credit facility outstanding, of which $899 million was used as of February 9.",That is the credit facility for CERC.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"I apologize, CERC.","And CERC include CES as well as all of our natural gas distribution utilities, and those companies, along with our other companies, share a common money pool."
"Right. So what's driving that? It's really pretty close, you've only got $1 million cushion left there, I think that's kind of tight. So what's the...?","Well, as I've shared on our call, we had a run-up in gas prices right at year-end, and in our disclosure you'll see that we went from receiving marginal collateral at year-end 2016 to posting margin collateral at year-end 2017. So that's the price impact. And then we had to purchase gas at higher prices, put it into storage, which we then provided to our customers, so that was a..."
Understood.,I characterize it as a temporary swing and we're beginning to see that cash ﬂow come in as our customers pay their bills.
Got you. So it's not something that's critical or needs attention.,"No, sir."
Thank you very much.,"With no additional questions, thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will now conclude our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Have a great day.
