Question,Answer
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. Scott, I believe it was as recent as the last earnings call at which you had reiterated a consolidated long-term growth rate of 5% to 7% for CenterPoint oﬀ the '18 actual base. Is that no longer operative now?","Ali, we have postponed talking about the growth rate until we get clarity on the earnings or on the CEHE rate case. And I think Xia also indicated that going forward, we intend to talk about growth excluding Enable. So, those are the two pieces that have entered into the equation now. But of those two, the biggest is really getting clarity on the Houston Electric rate proceeding."
"Okay. And on the rate proceeding, can you at least give us -- I know you laid out some markers in the slide deck. But to put it in some context, can you give us some sense of if this proposed decision does become ﬁnal relative to expectations, how big of a negative it should be?","Yes. It's -- clearly the PFD is not a good outcome. We've tried to communicate that. Maybe one way to think about it is relative to current rates, we've assumed that we would at least be recovering the additional investment, the $1 billion plus of investment that we have already put in service that is not yet in rates. If we just recovered that piece so that would be an increase, if you will, in rates from where we were whereas the PFD has suggested a decrease. So, that's a sizable or a notable diﬀerence. Additionally, the reductions in FFO were not anticipated as well. We will be in a better position to describe the actual impacts of that as we get clarity. And I just want to reiterate while the PFD is challenging, the commission has yet to weigh in on this and we remain conﬁdent in the process and hopeful that the commission will reach a more balanced decision as they look at the facts."
Right. And just one quick follow-up. Are you still committed to all the non-utility businesses? Are they still considered core as far as you're concerned?,The non-utility businesses are a source of cash generation for us for our utilities. That's how we look at them. We mentioned on the last call and I'll just reiterate that our regular cadence of activity is to continually evaluate each of our businesses to ﬁgure out if they are providing the maximum value possible to shareholders and we continue to do that on an ongoing basis.
Thank you.,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you, Ali.  Operator  Our next question is from Michael Weinstein and Credit Suisse."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"Could you a comment a little bit about your strategic plans for the non-regulated businesses, particularly the infrastructure services business? Going forward, are you -- do you intend to hold on to them long term or are looking at a full divestiture at some point?","I think the best way to answer that is maybe a reiteration of what I had just mentioned to Ali and that is we see those businesses today as a source of cash for investment in our utility businesses. And as part of a regular course of management, we evaluate whether businesses are providing the maximum value to shareholders as they possibly can and we look at that on a regular basis as does our Board. So, we continue to think about our businesses in that context with an eye towards value maximization."
"For Xia, just wondering if -- looks like you found about $100 million worth of O&M reductions so far and I'm wondering if just generally speaking ahead of the fourth quarter review, are you pleasantly surprised with what you're ﬁnding? Are you optimistic about the future? How is the review going so far?","It's going very well. The -- part of the $100 million is what we expected, which is synergies that we set forth a target of $50 plus million this year. So, we are ahead of that. I think the team has done a really good job from day one getting costs out and continuing to focus on basically turning every rock to see where we can ﬁnd additional synergies. So, the team has done a really good job this year improving processes and achieving synergies. At the same time, we reiterated our focus on overall O&M eﬃciency focus. So over the past several quarters, we have seen the results from the continuing to focus on that. I think all businesses have made their commitment in looking at the overall spending plan and make sure we are basically doing everything we can to become more eﬃcient. So, I'm very optimistic about the future about our   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   continued focus on that aspect. At the same time, I think it would allow us to continue to focus on capital deployment and grow our utility infrastructure."
Thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question is from Shar Pourreza and Guggenheim.,
"Hi, good morning. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. I just wanted to congratulate you guys on a good quarter.","Thank you, Constantine."
"Couple of questions here. Understanding that it's an early outlook on the capital plan, but can you kind of give a little bit of color on any moving pieces that you've kind of seen that you can address at this time versus prior expectations? And how does that early outlook kind of correspond to keeping the utility growth intact or is there anything incremental?","Yes, sure. As I shared Just now, we expect about over $100 million increase from -- for 2019 compared to what we previously communicated with you for the year. And for the 2022 to 2024 period, we expect the overall aggregate amount to be similar to what we shared with you from the prior ﬁve-year plan. The timing of it could be diﬀerent and that one key factor is the IRP. We're ﬁnalizing the IRP in Indiana so the timing of that will be incorporated as well as the continued need from our legacy utilities and from the new acquired gas. So, I would say that overall from an aggregate standpoint, we see we will maintain at a similar level for the next ﬁve years."
"Perfect. And so kind of as this kind of plan gets formulated, can you give a little bit of color how it ﬁts with the kind of strategic objectives that you outlined of kind of growing the utility earnings? Does that have kind of a purely organic objective at this point?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes. Grow utilities, continuing to focus on O&M management and try to be smart about allocating capital and try to achieve closer to our allowed ROEs."
"And just want to quick follow-up on that. So with kind of the O&M management kind of that you highlighted on this call. So, it looks like some pretty good numbers from kind of where we're sitting. Is there kind of speciﬁc program going forward that you see going on and kind of how deep do you see that pool and just if you can any kind of statements on that kind of recurring nature of the savings program going to, moving past 2020?","I think the best way to answer that is we're very pleased with where we are so far. And we're pleased about the projected year end numbers and we think that will be a good starting point going forward. And as we apply a similar discipline, we expect the momentum to continue into the future years."
"Perfect, thanks.  Operator  Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin Smith and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",
"Hey, good morning team.","Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, so a couple of follow-ups here. On the strategic decisions here, how do you think about the balance sheet into 2020 and potential need to raise capital against. Also, I think if I can square it, your slides also speciﬁcally say a ﬁve-year utility outlook obviously ex-Enable, but I just want to make sure I understand, I mean, are we to think about the other ex-Enable businesses being potentially on the table here to address balance sheet needs or how are you thinking about them at this point? And I have follow-up.","So, Julien the way I would think about it is, what I've said earlier. Right. Today, the non-utility businesses and the not Enable non-utility businesses are a source of cash for us today. So, when   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   we talk about providing a look going forward, it would be for the portfolio, excluding Enable. That's one way to think about it. You had another part to your question.     The balance sheet.     The balance sheet. I'll let Xia talk to the balance sheet.     Yeah. Julien, the CEHE rate case will be a very important component of that decision and that's part of the reason why we are not ready to share the equity ﬁnancing number yet because like Scott mentioned the FFO reduction, that in itself would impact the ﬁnancing needs, not to maintain similar credit metrics. So, we're not quite ready to address that yet, but we are fully aware that maintaining our credit line very important, continue to ﬁnd ways to strengthen the balance sheet is another priority."
"Got it. All right, fair enough. And then again, you kudos on the cost cuts this year, indeed. Can you talk brieﬂy about how you think about that going forward. I mean obviously we've got a big pending rate case. I understand that. At the same time, how do you think about narrowing that gap going forward? How do you think about earned returns across the utility business, this year and into next, and potentially continuing to narrow that gap?","Yeah, Julien, I'll start maybe Xia want to add. We have every intention of continuing our discipline around expense management, I would say that the driving force that allowed us to make a sizable move this year was the, was the merger, but we think of the savings that we have to date as a new starting point from which to manage our expense equation going forward. And we will continue to be very focused on managing expense the actual numbers associated, we're still working those out, but we see the gains that we've made to-date as establishing a new level from which to work."
"But to clarify brieﬂy if you can, what kind of gap are we talking about today versus prospectively that we can achieve, if you will.",From an O&M perspective?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"Yeah. As in O&M return perspective, how much of a gap is there to narrow in your mind, given some of the cost reductions that we're talking about?","Yeah, Julien, trying to, I think this year, we are, we closed some of the headroom related to from the expected returns versus the allowed return. So, particularly our natural gas businesses are doing a really good job and just focusing on every dollar isn't the same. So where do we deploy, make sure that we provide safety, reliable service at the same time being really smart about where to deploy that next incremental dollars.  At CEHE, the timing of ﬁling TCOS and DCRF that in itself will continue to have a lag for instance, the time you ﬁle TCOS versus this time we receive the revenues, there is a 3-month delay and DCRF is ﬁling in April and getting rates in September.  So, the inherent regulatory lag will continue to be there, at the same time, I think the continued focus on O&M will give us at some ability. I don't think we could close completely the gap to the allowed ROE but that deﬁnitely is a focus for us going forward."
"Got it. All right, fair enough guys, I'll let you be. Thank you.","Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Our next question is from Insoo Kim and Goldman Sachs."
"Thank you. Maybe starting with the CEHE rate case. I understand there's a lot of moving parts that will go into the 2020 guidance that will be provided in February. But, Scott, when you mentioned that just when we're trying to put some pieces together your original guidance, which had been 180-to-mid point had about I guess the $1 billion of spend that you weren't getting the recovery in return on and the PFD would result in $27 million of operating income decreased from the current rates.  If I just take the rate base math of the $1 billion and then also the small diﬀerence in the operating income in the PFD, I would calculate something like a $0.12, $0.13 diﬀerence, all else being equal, if that's the way I should think about just how CEHE amount was included in the original guidance on what the PFD would imply?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Insoo, I think the math and the way you're thinking, is the right line of thinking, a couple of things though. That doesn't include the impacts associated with the reduction in FFO, that's just the kind of the earnings side. Xia talked earlier about a signiﬁcant reduction in FFO, could accelerate the need for equity, for example to maintain the current metrics.  So, it doesn't include that nor does it include what I would consider management response, because depending on the outcome, we would consider what actions we can take to help mitigate the negative eﬀects of an outcome. That's why I said, there is a lot of moving parts here and while we're trying to provide clarity about what the PFD says, I just want to reiterate, the processes and over and the Commissioners have not yet opined on this and we are very hopeful that the commissioners will have a diﬀerent view of what's appropriate.     Insoo, I'll just add quickly. In the original guidance, we also had expectations on Enable. And the other non-utility businesses and you're aware about the development, particularly related to Enable, the guidance the lower end of this year and they just issued their 2020 guidance. That was another component in the original guidance range."
"Yeah, I totally understand all the other moving parts. I just didn't want to open up all kind of worms and all the moving pieces. I appreciate that. Maybe. Secondly, related to sticking with CEHE if the results of the PFD do hold with the associated disallowances, how does that impact your thoughts going forward on future capital spend at the utility and what type of investments you may make or may not make given the current rate case decision?","Well, I'd say, look, we still have an obligation to serve the customers in our service territory and the needs of our customers ultimately, are the ones that drive our thinking about, about capital. There is a little bit of discretionary capital from a timing perspective, but by and large the capital we spend is needed to serve the needs of the community.  So, we would have to, for example, if there were disallowances upheld, we would have to get clarity on views around what is acceptable spend before we go down the path of making the spend. That's one example of some management action that we would need to take here, but the capital itself would be driven by primarily by, it's going to be driven by the needs of the community as opposed to necessarily the outcome of the proceeding."
Understood. Thank you very much.,CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Chris Turnure and JPMorgan.
"Good morning. The only question that I had left for you guys was on kind of where you're at right now with Houston Electric credit metrics. Just kind of where they're at, including outlooks, when you last got an update from the agencies and if these have been part of the discussion at all with the intervener so far in Texas?","Our rating agencies are fully aware of where we are from the CEHE rate case standpoint. We keep the communication very transparent and open with them. I think they are, just like us, eager to ﬁnd out what the ﬁnal outcome will be from the PUC ruling. So, one thing is, we are aware of the PFD recommendations, but the other thing, like Scott said a couple of times, we remain hopeful that the ﬁnal outcome is a more balanced and constructive outcome. So, depending on the outcome, I think the rating agencies -- we'll communicate again with the rating agencies about where we are.     Chris, I would also add, I think the interveners are certainly very aware of the views of the rating agencies about the condition that CEHE is in relative to the rate proceeding, as well as the commission and others. The information and views around this have -- and concerns, quite frankly, have been shared as part of the process."
Okay. Because certainly some of your peers have had that as part of their discussions in recent rate case processes there around the (multiple speakers) equity layer and other things.,"Yeah, it's absolutely part of our discussion."
"Okay. So, it sounds like certainly part of the discussion, but also nothing has changed there in terms of the focus or lack of focus on that versus prior discussions for other rate cases in Houston.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Well, again, the only information we have so far is the judge's view of PFD. That's the only piece of information that's come out about how to think about this. The Commission has yet to weigh in on this particular issue. But we made it very clear going into the rate case and throughout the periods in which we can respond to comments and provide our own comments of the issues associated with the subject around credit metrics is caused by diﬀerent factors. So everyone is very -- all the key parties are very aware of this issue.     Chris, to your point, the recommendations from the ALJ didn't take that into consideration."
"Okay, helpful color. Thank you, guys.",Yeah.  Operator  Our next question is from Charles Fishman and Morningstar Research.
"Thank you. Scott, on Slide 8, you seem to imply a decision might not be reached next week. But it seems like everything is queued up for the commission to make that decision. Is there something they are still waiting on? Or what is your -- why might they not make a decision next week?","Well, it could be a number of things. It could be that they -- there's a number of issues that we're asking them to opine on. There is a full agenda, for example, at the meeting on the 14th. There are just a number of things going on. And while we would perhaps like them to work through every one of our issues and debate and make a decision, it may be from a timing standpoint that they don't get through everything and it just gets pushed to the following meeting. They're not obligated to kind of make a decision at this upcoming meeting. So, that's why we think it's possible they could begin dialog and push it to another meeting. It is also possible they could get to an endpoint. But nothing other than just the number of issues to be debated and the size of the agenda that will make us think it would be pushed."
"It sounds like administrative then more than any other technical thing. Okay. And then the second question. On Slide 24, ﬁrst nine months on the operating earnings or guidance basis, earnings $0.29 from the utilities, positive from the utilities acquired in the merger, $0.14 from the Energy Services business. If my math is right, that's $0.43. And you had $0.48 negative from the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   merger ﬁnancing. Is that being unfair to say this transaction looks pretty dilutive for the ﬁrst nine months? Or should some of that $0.07 O&M management be credited towards the merger?","Yes, some of the O&M management should be credited towards the merger. I think the merger ﬁnancing itself is around $0.48. If you add the pick-up from the acquired jurisdictions, Indiana Electric year-to-date added $0.16, legacy Vectren gas added $0.13, the Infrastructure Services added $0.14, and then some of the O&M management should be credited to the variance. You should compare those moving parts to the merger ﬁnancing."
"Okay. So at this point, at least through the ﬁrst nine months, if I take some credit for the O&M management, the transaction is roughly a break-even?","Yeah, that's a good way to think about it."
"Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Ashar Khan and Verition.",
"Good morning. Good earnings. Can I just ask that you said you will be providing the take-up for the utility business based on the forecast for this year 2019. And if you can assume we are at the upper end, how much would utility earnings come out to be in that scenario? I wanted to start oﬀ with the base and just wanted to get a good idea. So, under your current guidance for '19, what would the utility guidance be?","Roughly 75% of our earnings is expected to be from the utilities. Keep in mind, there are several moving parts in there. We had some favorable weather in there, and we also had a favorable -- some favorable income tax items that might not necessarily repeat itself. But roughly, the way to think about it is, the utility is 75% of the earnings expectations, and that's based on today's CEHE regulatory construct. So the outcome..."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So if I pick 75% or $1.70, it's a $1.27. And how much would you say is weather and the tax items? Could you just quantify those? Year-to-date, how much would those be?","Yeah, happy to. So, year-to-date weather roughly $0.03 positive, a little over $0.03. And the favorable tax item for this year alone is roughly $0.05."
"Okay. So, we are running approximately $1.20 base this year normalized for taxes and weather as -- for the utility. Would that be a fair number?","Yeah, close to."
Okay. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our last question is from Anthony Crowdell and Mizuho.,
"Hey, good morning. Hopefully, an easy question. What's the process on the motion for rehearing in Houston, like the time frame, and how long like -- I guess the clarity on the motion for rehearing?","Jason, you want to come down here and answer this for me? And bring our regulatory expert down here to make sure he doesn't have to correct me on the timing.     Good morning. It's Jason Ryan. So, the process for rehearing is that a couple of weeks after the order issued by the Commission, motions for rehearing are due. And then the Commission has up to 100 days from the date of their order to rule on motions for rehearing or they're just overruled by the passage of time."
Do you have any like historical preference in Texas of maybe when orders have been changed through rehearing? Is that something you guys have or can disclose?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),So motions for rehearing are granted and denied depending on the issues that they raise. Sometimes the motions for rehearing are granted to correct a purely administrative item versus changing a substantive ruling. Sometimes there are changes to the substantive rulings.
"On Slide 8, you stated that the new rates go into eﬀect 45 days after the PUCT order becomes ﬁnal. If you ﬁle for a motion for rehearing, when is that ﬁnal date? When the motion for rehearing is either granted or denied, is that the ﬁnal date?",Yes.
"Got it. That's all my questions. Thank you.  Operator  And at this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn it back over to David Mordy for any closing remarks at this time.","Thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you at the Edison Electric Institute conference shortly. We will now conclude our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Have a great day.
