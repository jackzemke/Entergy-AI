Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Just two quick topics here. First, it sounds like you guys have a really good handle on the storms. As it kind of relates to policy decisions in Austin, are there sort of any potential opportunities for CenterPoint as we think about the plan as presented this morning? And just remind us, is there sort of any impact to CenterPoint if ERCOT large retailers or generators run into sort of ﬁnancial diﬃculties?","Yes, well, I appreciate it. Let me take maybe the ﬁrst part of your question, Jason can take the second part. As you can imagine, there's a lot of dialogue going in Austin even as we speak here. The legislature is in session, so everyone in the political sphere is in Austin at this point in time. But I guess as I look back at it from a CenterPoint standpoint, obviously, our number one goal is to serve our customers to the best way we can.  If you think about last week clearly for us more control over some of our assets in our grid would have been a positive. So we're thinking about looking at opportunities, which we of course would have to get through the legislature of things like getting batteries and fuel cells and the like actually into our rate base, so we could provide sort of more in territory, stability to the grid if anything like this ever happened again.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So as I said, the gamut of things being discussed in Austin right now is pretty wide. I think everybody is looking for the right solution for the State of Texas, so this doesn't happen again it will be part of that dialogue. Jason, do you want to handle the second part of the question?     Sure. Thanks David. Good morning, Shar."
Good morning.,"I really think that there's a low risk of that of any ﬁnancial impact associated with any ﬁnancial challenges with the generators or retail energy providers. The state law here in Texas is very clear that we have the right to recover any delinquent accounts from retail energy providers as a regulatory asset. We also have and do collect from the retail energy providers on a daily basis and so have a good handle on those that continue to perform with respect to their obligations.  And maybe the ﬁnal point that I would highlight is that, to the extent that any of the large generators or retail energy providers experience ﬁnancial challenge, it will likely be a reorganization event. And one of the ﬁrst areas of focus in the ﬁrst day motions of any reorganization would be the continuity of business that will allow the retail energy providers to continue to pay the associated T&D charges. And so, in short, we see this as a really low risk issue for the company."
"Got it. And then just lastly on the Midstream exit, can you just remind us, Dave, on sort of the various exit options you're thinking about i.e. exercising your demand rights the most viable path versus the slow dribble or piggybacking. And I know the exit is going to be obviously satisfactory to utility investors which clearly highlights a more rapid exit, but you're still kind of sticking with that minimizing language versus an outright midstream exit. Are you just simply alluding to holding on to that preferred in the near-term or is it something else? Thank you.","No. I think a good question and I'll let Jason clarify. But before you can exit, you have to minimize. And so I think what we've done with this transaction, it's allowed us to sort of minimize our exposure and now and when the transaction closes, we'll pivot very quickly to exit. And believe me, it's top of mind in terms of the discussions we're having every day, but I'll let Jason elaborate a bit.     All right. Thanks, Shar. I'm not going to be speciﬁc in terms of timelines as I communicated in our prepared remarks, but let me sort of talk about quickly the tools that we have available.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   With respect to the Series G preferred, there are no registration rights needed for that security, and so upon transaction close, we have full ﬂexibility to sell that security. There's an active secondary market and we have a tax basis that approximates fair -- face value of that security. So we have full ﬂexibility to exit that security on transaction close.  There will be a short delay upon the close of the transaction for the common units to be registered, but I think you've highlighted the two tools that we will look at. There is ample liquidity in the volumes of Energy Transfer units. And so we will likely utilize some form of a durable and opportunistically where it makes sense, we will exercise our demand rights for potentially a larger block. But just to close and re-emphasize what Dave articulated, it is our commitment to exit our exposure to Midstream and we're going to do so in a manner that we think will make our shareholders happy."
Terriﬁc. Guys congrats on execution. Appreciate it. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.,
"Thank you. My ﬁrst question is with respect to the Texas weather event. First, I just wanted to conﬁrm your comments that the guidance for 2021 does include whatever drag is associated with the ﬁnancing to recover the costs immediately? And then just related to that, when we think about your thoughts on the recovery and the recovery period over the various -- in the various jurisdictions, does your analysis show a -- I guess path that achieved the right balance between the potential impact of customer builds and your ability to continue to make the investments that -- to hit the growth rate?","Yes. Let me answer the ﬁrst and then I'll let Jason answer the second one. It Seems like we have a routine work in here. But absolutely the guidance we have out there does include the drag of the storm. As I said in my prepared remarks there'll be some extra interest pressure on there, but I view that as a headwind to manage. We have a very talented ﬁnancial team here at CenterPoint and we've got some buttons to push and levers to pull and we're going to do that and we already are doing that and so we'll have zero impact on the guidance that we've given.     Let me also amplify Dave's remarks on that point, several of the jurisdictions that we operate in allow us to recover the carrying costs, so that does help sort of minimize the -- any drag from the incremental debt. But I think you touched upon an issue that obviously we are working with regulators and policymakers on and that's balancing the ﬁnancial health of the utilities with the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   impact of collecting this on customer bills. I think we've seen some very strong signals come out of the various jurisdictions, we have the privilege to operate in.  As I highlighted, the Texas Railroad Commission made it clear that these are recoverable costs. And so, I think what we are all doing and I use that term sort of Broadly because this is not a CenterPoint issue but a gas LDC issue, is we're working to ﬁnd and strike that right balance of short-term recovery of these costs while not unnecessarily burdening the impact on customer bills. More work needs to be done. Hearings are underway this week, but I am conﬁdent, we will strike that right balance here."
"Understood. And my only other question is in -- for 2021 guidance and the assumptions that are embedded in it, it seems like there's nothing major related to any COVID-related items, is that correct?","That's correct. As we articulated towards the end of last year, it's our responsibility to manage the ups and downs, the headwinds and tailwinds of this business. COVID remains a small headwind, but we have every conﬁdence that we have the tools to manage through it. And one of the other things that I would just continue to emphasize is, I think we are also fortunate to serving communities of high growth. And so we continue to see residential growth that oﬀsets some of the reduction in electricity consumption from the commercial segment of our business and so in short we have full conﬁdence in our ability to manage whatever remaining COVID headwind exists."
Got it. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open.,
"Hey congratulations team. So perhaps just to stick with the cost question and cost allocation question coming out of the Enable transition here. Can you speak a little bit to how you're thinking about that evolution here a little bit more speciﬁcally? Just a cadence of addressing and minimizing that element, when you think about presumably reallocating those costs back to the utility over time.","Sure, good morning, Julien. I think given the negative tax basis that we have in our current Enable units that will transfer over to the Energy Transfer units. I think it's fair to characterize about 50% of the proceeds that we would receive upon sale of those common units would   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   result in -- will be paid in taxes. And so as you think about sort of both the tax bill as well as the allocated debt that we have to the Midstream segment, we are timing our exit from Midstream, so that as Dave pointed out we are not impacting our utility segment.  That 50% sort of rule of thumb for the tax component of the Enable sales is what I would consider to be a status quo rule of thumb. We are working on various tax strategies to help improve that position. In addition, whatever remaining debt that exists after disposition of those units paydown of the associated tax paydown of the associated debt, we believe, we have suﬃcient O&M levers to oﬀset which is why we are fully conﬁdent that as we exit Midstream, we will be able to do so in a manner that has no impact on our stated 6% to 8% utility growth rate."
Got it. Okay. So fully oﬀset on a go forward basis.,Yes.
"Okay. Thank you for conﬁrming that. Can you elaborate at least preliminarily on how you think about winterization options coming out of the deep freeze here? Clearly, some of your earlier comments on the call suggested the bulk of improvements seemed to be more on operations. But curious, as you perform your task being a wires utility and the gas LDC, how do you think about winterization opportunities that might emerge there in the form of CapEx and actual investments here and obviously funding tied to that?","Yes. Let me take that one on ﬁrst. I think there has been a lot of dialogue across the state about a lot of the reason the generation went down is because it was not properly winterized and that includes both the sort of wind, solar and gas generators. But in fact, at one point the big nuclear plant SPP also went down at one point last week.  As you know, the state's sort of electric grid is constructed for sort of peak summer air conditioning time and therefore this concept of winterizing your equipment, winterizing the generators, it's going to be diﬃcult to do, because obviously by enclosing them and insulating them and winterizing them, it means you just put more stress on it during the summer when it's really hot. So I think there are ways to do it and companies are going to have to ﬁnd ways to do it, because I suspect that's one of the things that's going to come out of Austin from a regulatory standpoint.  But speciﬁcally to your question, we actually have winterized our equipment, it really protected it from both the hot and the cold weather. But there are some incremental opportunities for us to do certain things really more as a resiliency and hardening our system standpoint. I wouldn't think of it as winterizing it It's more or less hardening and making the system more resilient and   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   of course, we'll be able to get that into rate base. And I would view it as sort of a slight potential increment to our capital spend."
Okay. Got it. It Doesn't sound too material. Excellent. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.  Operator  Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.,
"Thank you. Hey, Dave, Jason and Tom. is it possible that you could break out the $2.5 billion by states?","Sure, I'll give you, the three top states kind of in Texas, we have about $1.25 billion of incremental costs, in Minnesota about $500 million, and in Arkansas we've got about $350 million and then the rest is spread fairly evenly across the other jurisdictions."
"Okay. And then when you talk about the regulatory mechanisms for timely recovery, could that potentially include securitization of some of these costs?","I think it's really kind of early to get ahead of the regulatory process, but securitization has been discussed. And so whether it's securitization following -- the current recovery timelines are about 12 months, in some of the jurisdictions, particularly those three that I mentioned. A year to recover maybe too much for customer bills That may extend the time lines 18 months or so. And so there are a number of tools being discussed, securitization is just one of those at this point."
"Okay. And then, I guess maybe a question for Dave. So just for the layman person, it might be hard to kind of separate CenterPoint as the utility versus the generators or ERCOT or others. So I'm just, I mean, it's encouraging to see that the Mayor made you the head of this fundraising campaign. But just, could you give a sense of just to the political leadership and others kind of know how you ﬁt into the system here and how much political heat are you getting? Or they kind of get this?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   No, I would say generally I think everybody gets and understands the roles that the generators, the T&D companies and the retailers basically play within Texas. We were very aggressive in our communication last week, putting out sometimes always one and sometimes two press releases every day, trying to inform people about what the state of play was. Clearly state-wide, there was a lot of frustration. As you can imagine there is ﬁnger pointing going on, but I would say that we did a pretty good job getting out in front of the story and really essentially what we told our customers is, listen, when we get electricity, we will begin to restore it.  Our system is resilient which it proved to be. We got power back into the homes of our customers very, very quickly after we got it. And the reality is, that this was a sort of a system- wide failure across the state as has well been written. And so as I said earlier, there will be something that comes out of Austin on this. But I think people have done a good job understanding our role in it. That doesn't mean that ultimately some ﬁngers don't get pointed here and there, we'll just have to address those as they come at us."
Okay. And then ﬁnally just I know in the past you and the other utilities have proposed adding batteries on the utility grid. And I'm not sure that would have helped here or not. But just is that something that could come up as a potential thing in the legislative session?,"Yes, I think, right now almost everything is being considered up there. But I think our pitch would be in an event like this, absent having your own generation, which we don't want to do, we were at the mercy of ERCOT. But I do think that around the edges and for sort of incremental ability to react to short-term things like this batteries, fuel cells and those kinds of things would have been helpful and I think that if you look at things that we would like potentially to see in any legislative changes, that would be a dialogue we would wholeheartedly get into the middle of."
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from James Thalacker from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please proceed.,"He may be on mute.  Operator  James Thalacker, your line is open.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Okay. Thanks, Jim. Why don't we do one more and we'll wrap up.  Operator  Thank you. Our last question is from Sophie Karp from KeyBanc Capital Markets."
"Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. A Lot of questions about Texas and other pressing issues have been answered. I just wanted to ask you about kind of organizational morale. It seems like you guys are very focused on the O&M reductions And perhaps you asked lot of people within the organizations to do things diﬀerently. And I was just kind of wondering if you could comment on the overall morale within the organization. How much of a buy-in is there from employees on all levels and how you're handling this? Thank you.","Yes, I mean, obviously this is a biased view and a personal view, but I think morale is really, really great in CenterPoint right now. And I think if you got to look back over what this organization has gone through in the last 12 months and it's been a wrenching change. I'm the third CEO within a year. Jason is the third CFO within a year. We had issues around dividend, we had the activist investor in us, we had COVID, we had a hurricane that skirted us last summer.  And I would say that I think people are really bought into the new CenterPoint and certainly in my engagement with and I think I can speak more broadly for our executive team, their people are motivated. They like what's happening. They did not like what happened early last year. And so I think they see a really happening company, a management team that is taking the organization in the right way. They're excited about it. They understand that everybody has a part to play.  And I think the other thing is a focus on O&M isn't always a focus on people reduction. As Thomas has said, it's a focus on doing things better, it's getting your vendors to participate with you in doing things more eﬃciently, buying things cheaper and that kind of thing. So I think at the end of the day, morale is really, really good here and I expect it to even get better."
