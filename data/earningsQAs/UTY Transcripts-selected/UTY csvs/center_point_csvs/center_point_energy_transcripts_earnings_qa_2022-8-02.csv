Question,Answer
Hey. Good morning guys.,"Good morning, Shar."
"Dave, sort of the guidance raise today for '22 as you call out is now kind of implying 9% growth in '22, does that kind of imply a stronger trajectory for future years despite you just reiterating 8% in the near term? I mean, you obviously showing some conﬁdence in the raise despite sort of the broader backdrop and appending GRC ﬁling potentially at the end of '23. So what's driving it. And then any placeholders there with your internal planning assumptions for resiliency now in there.","Now, I think, yeah, ﬁrst of all, we wouldn't express the conﬁdence that we have in continuing to grow our earnings if we didn't believe in it. So I think that needs to be your ﬁrst take away. Second is we do have a lot of tailwinds in the business right now. I think the great thing for us is that almost all of them are customer-driven tailwinds. We clearly have the organic growth that we highlighted, the jobs growth 2%, residential growth quarter-over-quarter, certainly weather is helping us at this point in time and helping us really because the margin we are getting from that will allow them to pull O&M forward from '23 to beneﬁt our customers in '22. And then clearly, we continue to have the 1% to 2% long-term O&M reduction. The increased capital is clearly showing up in earnings and we'll continue to show up in earnings. So as I said, if we weren't really conﬁdent in where we were going, we would say that. I mean maybe the beneﬁt I get as CEO is focusing on the tailwinds. There are some headwinds out there and maybe Jason can hit on those.     Sure. Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the question, Shar. I know the industry has been talking a lot about rising interest rates and pension expense. I think we're in an enviable position on both of those from an interest expense standpoint. We're really one of the few utilities that signiﬁcantly paying down parent company debt and ﬂoating rate debt. In over the last six months, we paid oﬀ $1.1 billion of parent company debt with a weighted average coupon of 3.4%. And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, we're prepared to pay down $1 billion of ﬂoating rate debt   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   as soon as the Texas securitization proceeds are received here in the second half of the year. And from a pension expense, we're really fortunate to work in constructive regulatory jurisdictions. We get to defer about two-thirds of our pension expense. So we're in a good spot. And maybe not necessarily headwind, what I do want to remind folks of is the fact that we increased capital already $500 million this year. And so that provides further tailwinds to address anything that comes up and sort of central to your question, Shar, the guidance raise and resulting increase in subsequent years is before the addition of the resiliency now capital. We will provide a comprehensive update as it relates to that incremental capital on the Q3 call.     Yeah. I think that -- the key point that Jason just said, we're not going to front run our Q3 conversation on incremental capital. So the increased guidance were given is -- we gave you today is essentially from the capital that we've already communicated to you in the past."
"Got it. So the incremental capital to be incremental to your guidance. Got it. So that -- then we'll look forward to that in the third quarter. And then just -- Dave, just looking at sort of that interest rate backdrop, I guess, does that kind of prompt any potential reconsideration of the M&A outlook as we think about the value of potentially monetizing more LDC asset? Any change here versus your prior thoughts? It sounded like from your prepared remarks you may be comfortable with sort of that electric gas business mix as you comp closely with other premium names now. So just curious how you're thinking about it just given the change in the Capital Markets? Thanks.","Well, I think, as Jason alluded to, we've got plenty of cash ﬂow at this point in time. And if you recall what we've said almost from day one or I've said from day one, I mean our Northstar is no further issuance of equity to dilute our shareholder base out. So that's sort of the stake in the ground. As Jason said in his prepared remarks, we've got certainly a lot of cash ﬂow from the prior LDC sales, the Enable sale. We've got some upcoming securitizations as we reﬁne sort of the tax exposure on some of the transactions. We're ﬁnding additional capital there. So at the end of the day, we're going to wait until Q3 and we'll give a comprehensive update to not only the incremental capital that may come out of our resilient now and master energy plan, but how we intend to ﬁnance all that without additional equity issuances. So just sort of hold that thought."
Okay. Perfect. Congrats guys on the results. Appreciate it.,"Thanks.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.     Hey, Steve."
"Yeah, thanks. Hey, good morning. Great update. Just curious, I know it's very recent, but the -- curious on how you think the company is positioned on the corporate minimum tax that's part of the proposed inﬂation act from last week?","Yeah. I'll let Jason take that one.     Hey, good morning, Steve, and I appreciate the question. Maybe before turning directly to the minimum tax, I do think the real opportunity here is the opportunity for incremental margin associated with transportation electriﬁcation. As we highlighted on our Analyst Day, every electric vehicle that's connected to our grid is about $80 of margin a year. So we are excited about the continued support of electriﬁcation. And then in addition, the extension of the tax credits will help us more eﬃciently execute our coal transition up in Indiana. So we think those are deﬁnitely tailwinds for the company. As it relates to the minimum tax, it's going to likely be a very modest headwind for the company that we will be able to eﬃciently overcome. We've been historically cash taxpayer. And as you cut through kind of all the one-time transactions as we've been executing on our strategic reset and the timing of the unrecovered natural gas costs, we generally paid federal cash taxes at an eﬀective rate of about 10%. So we see the introduction of a minimum tax that will likely be reduced from the credits that will be generated from the coal transition in Indiana as a modest headwind, but again I would emphasize, this is something that we will be able to eﬃciently overcome. And I think that candidly that we're in a much better position than many of our peers, who haven't been paying federal cash taxes over the years."
"Great. Thank you. And one other question just, we've had a little bit of a tougher market environment in terms of capital markets. And I know you just said that you don't really -- you have a lot of cash available. But in the event you were to pursue another gas LDC sales, do you feel like that the market is still there to sell a strong price somewhere in the ballpark of last time?","We do Steve. We continue to get a signiﬁcant amount of inbound from the market and clearly rising interest rates are having what I would say sort of a modest impact. But what I think is more than oﬀsetting that is I think comfort and a much higher terminal value for gas LDCs. I think a   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   conﬂuence of events, whether it'd be Winter Storm Uri or the war in Ukraine has kind of led to sort of better comfort for a long-term diversity in energy supply. And so as we get kind of inbound interest we're seeing again much more comfort with a much higher terminal value for gas LDCs particularly mid-continent where we're fortunate to operate ours. But I just want to sort of emphasize what Dave already mentioned. We've had a number of incremental improvements to our cash ﬂow forecast since our last update at Analyst Day. Couple of things that I'll quickly point out is we were really conservative as it related to the tax basis for the gas LDC sales. So we've lowered taxes there than we expected. And a theme of continued to optimize our tax position, we were able to minimize some of the taxes on the sale of the energy transfer common units. We've got about $100 million more of incremental proceeds from the securitization up in Indiana. And so what I would say all in all, we have a signiﬁcant amount of positive cash ﬂow developments that will help us eﬃciently fund our capital update that we plan to provide on the Q3 call.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"Just wanted to come back to the DC package if could -- just wondering on the tax credit side, is there anything particular there that's catching your interest that you're closely watching that could present more opportunities for CenterPoint.","I think for us the core beneﬁt of the extension of the tax credits in and of themselves some of our peers are talking about transferability, we're not necessarily in a position to really take advantage of that just given the fact that we have a fairly modest coal transition program. We're talking about eﬀectively one gigawatt of generation up in Indiana. So we'll utilize those credits to kind of optimize our current tax position. And so I think the key beneﬁt is just the extension of the tax credits. We'll look at the opportunity maybe a lot of production tax credits for solar, but ultimately what's going to govern is sort of what's the most eﬃcient way for us to complete the coal transition for our customers up in Indiana."
"Okay. Got it. So maybe this doesn't impact generation replacement in Indiana it depending on how things fallout here, but just wondering if there's any more details on that side speciﬁcally that you might be able to provide.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Well, I think as we've talked about, I think we're well on our way to transitioning and retirement of two of the three coal units up in Indiana. I think what the extension of the tax credits is they put us in a better position with this third and ﬁnal coal facility that will be addressing in our integrated resource plan that we will ﬁle in early '23. But I just think with the certainty around the extension of the tax credits, we're just going to be in a much better place to eﬃciently execute on the retirement of that third and ﬁnal coal facility."
"Got it. Just a real quick last one. As far as the capital update, I know you're not going to front run it here for 3Q, but should we be thinking this is largely Houston-focused or could there be other elements of size?",We're not going to front run the conversation. Sorry.
Got it. Thank you very much. Happy going.,"Thanks.  Operator  And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open.     Good Morning, Andrew."
"Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. First, just a couple of questions on the summer heat waves and how you're managing that. I think you said you only use the commercial load management once. Can you remind us the relative sizes of the voluntary demand response program versus force load shedding? And can you speciﬁcally comment on the role that crypto currency miners played in terms of curtailing demand. And if you view that to be a real and reliable lever to pull going forward.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. Our oﬃcial load management program was roughly call it 125 mega watts and that was the oﬃcial sort of use of the commercial loan management program. That was one of the day where we curtailed load on a very minor basis using a reduction in voltage. But just to get again to give that to size, it's roughly about 125 mega watts versus our peak demand of call it 19.5 gigs. So kind of a fraction of the overall demand on our system. As it relates to Crypto Mining, what I would say is I think parties are still trying to kind of understand how eﬀective of a lever that is. We're not seeing directly as much mining in the Greater Houston area. As we've talked about historically we represent about 2.5% of the geography of Texas, but a quarter of the energy demand. And so we're sort of short power requiring a signiﬁcant import from out of state. As a result, that and land is more expensive here. As a result of that, we're seeing crypto mining more located kind of in the Texas Panhandle closer to the generation sources. Some of that is really ﬂexible and I think has been a lever that ERCOT has used. Some of that is behind the meter and is maybe a little less visible to ERCOT. So I think there's opportunity around embracing sort of economic development of crypto mining for the state. It's one that will require continued focus to make sure that we can balance demand and supply as we see some of these peak events. Yeah. It is fair to say that it is on the radar screen of the PUC because the last time we visited with a number of the PUC Commissioners, which was just a few weeks ago, it was really top of mind at that point in time, but as Jason has said there, everybody is trying to get a handle on how much of it really is behind the meter right now and how much of it is addressable if the state continues to get tight on power."
"Okay. Great. And then maybe more broadly after being tested so intensely through July, how do you feel about the condition of the grid? Has it kept up with the strong economic and population growth in recent years? I'm talking about the wire speciﬁcally, not the supply piece, which is beyond your control. And then can you just remind us how much of the $40 billion plan relates to Houston reliability or resiliency before the update in a few months?","Yeah, Jason, do you want to take that?     Yeah, I think is the grid itself -- so the transmission and distribution system held up remarkably well. We build our system here in the Greater Houston area to withstand these peak sort of heat events that we experienced. And as we said, our system stood up well. Our focus is on making sure because adequacy of this energy supply, but very proud about how our system held up, how our crews responded when we had some outages from storm-related events that Dave mentioned in his prepared remarks. Of the $40 billion CapEx program that we outlined in 10- year CapEx plan for the entire company, about $22 billion of that relates to Houston Electric. And what I would say currently about $8 billion of that $22 billion is really sort of resiliency spend. Think about $11 billion of that is really sort of growth enablement connecting new customers, increasing capacity of their system. The rest is sort of capital that's used to kind of support the overall business. And so as we think about our broader capital update and ensuring that our system remains resilient in the face of more extreme temperatures, more extreme   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   weather events, we likely will see increase in that resiliency component. But again we'll provide a comprehensive update on the Q3 call."
"Very good. Then one more if I may. Jason, I think you said you're starting -- you're thinking about pulling forward expenses from future years into 2022. Has that already started? I think you mentioned pre-trimming, how does the hot summer weather impact your ability both physically and in terms of aﬀordability in the context of inﬂation? And then how are you thinking about the timing of O&M is relative to the Houston Electric rate case you intend to ﬁle in 15 or 18 months or so?","Yeah. Let me handle sort of the front end and then I'll let Jason handle the latter part of the question. I think to put it in context, if you remember back to our discussions last year where we did reduce our O&M 1% year-over-year, even though we brought forward $20 million plus of O&M from '22 into '21, basically to attack things like vegetation management and opportunities like that. And we really are sort of in a rinse and repeat year here in '22 taking advantage of the margin that the hotter weather has provided us to pull some O&M forward from '23 to '22 to address the very exact issues that we've talked about, more vegetation management and really spending that money for the beneﬁt of our customers, while still being able to reduce O&M 1% to 2% over the 10-year average that we have. So again, it really is the beneﬁt of the fantastic market that we have in Houston. I know you probably get tired of me harping on it, but the beauty of organic growth and the ability to invest ahead of that growth is just a luxury that other utilities don't have that we have here in Houston. And so every decision we make is made through the lens of how can we beneﬁt our customers sooner rather than later. And that's the decisions that we're making."
Great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.,
"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Good morning, Dave.     Hi, Dave.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
I'm wondering if you could talk to load growth for a minute just what you're seeing in terms of weather normal load growth and speciﬁcally on the industrial growth side of things. I am also curious if you're seeing just any indications or early indications of any softness in the industrial low levels?,"No, I think the -- the industrial load growth continues to expand. I think if you just look at who our customer base is down and or basically if you take so the port facility in Houston through reﬁnery, grow through the petrochem complex and the amount of ﬁnal investment decisions that have been made over the last few years, expanding capacity in basically the whole petrochem complex. So we see that as a continued growth engine for us. And I think the short answer is I don't think we're seeing any indication of any slowdown in industrial demand on our system at this point in time.     I would add, from a residential standpoint, we're continuing to see just north of 2% increase in new customers. On a weather adjusted basis, what I think is really interesting is at least through the ﬁrst ﬁve months of the year so through May, we saw usage on a weather adjusted basis outpacing customer growth. We didn't see that as much in June, but June was as we've talked about sort of a record month with weather. But I come back to the sort of usage trend that we're monitoring to see how this unfolds. There could be what I'll call maybe a new normal in terms of residential usage with more of a work from home model as we see customers spending a couple of days working from home, while also at the same time businesses are welcoming the employees back, we may see on a longer-term basis a trend with a slightly higher usage on a weather-adjusted basis than we're seeing in terms of just new customer connections. So base business remained strong as David continued to highlight in terms of new customer connects weather it's been great, but we're also seeing a modest uptick in usage.     Yeah. And I would say the other thing that we're looking at as another potential tailwind and Jason hit on it a little bit earlier. As we said in our last Analyst Day, Houston is one of the least penetrated EV markets of a major city in the US and with the Inﬂation Reduction Act, basically being very supportive of the electriﬁcation of the vehicle ﬂeet. We see a big potential for the City of Houston and the need for us to continue to enhance the grid just to handle the needs that are going to come out of there. Jason mentioned $80 per margin, per car, per year from an electric vehicle. I think another way to think about it is the stat that we gave at our last Analyst Day where it could be another 1% organic growth driver on top of the 2% organic growth we have at this point in time, which really would be sort of extraordinary baseline growth in your organization all point into why for the beneﬁt of our customers. We would have to continue to upgrade the resiliency and hardening of the grid. So it's a really good place to be right now."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. That's really helpful color. It sounds like continued strong fundamentals on that basis. And then I was wondering if you could just talk to any transmission growth opportunities that emerge, such a power market in Texas recently this season? Wondering if any transmission related solutions have popped up, whether it's congestion related around the city of Houston and whether that could be an element of the CapEx upside -- their CapEx update that we see.","Yeah. I think we're continuing to work on a number of transmission opportunities. As I highlighted it kind of we're short anywhere between sort of 40% and 60% of kind of power (inaudible) in the Greater Houston area just kind of given our proﬁle. So there is a strong focus on increasing the number of import transmission lines sort of available to bring power in kind of reducing congestion. I think it was really in customers' interest, the state passed and put into law last year the opportunity to build new transmission from an economic dimension standpoint. So on an economic basis, reducing kind of the congestion charges, we're working with ERCOT and the PUCT to develop those projects. And there may be some incremental transmission updates that we provide as part of the Q3 update, which will be a comprehensive capital update at that time. So continues to be an area where we think that there is incremental investment opportunity and we will say sort of quantifying that update until we will provide a comprehensive CapEx increase on the Q3 call.     Yeah, I think if you look at what came out of the change in Texas law at the end of the last session so that move from reliability based, economic based transmission lines, we're waiting and I know that PUC is focused on getting their regulations that hopefully here by the end of the year in and around how they're going to approach the deciding and putting in of new transmission lines. So as Jason said, we're excited about it. We think that we can make the case for economic transmission lines. We've just got to wait for that process to get itself completed."
Okay. Great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.  Operator  Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.,
"Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time.","Hey, Julien.      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Good morning, Julien."
"My pleasure. Just ﬁrst oﬀ on the solar update, just can you give us a little bit of a sense of the timeline for those projects now. And the CapEx that was moved around and pulled forward to oﬀset the impact of delays previously, does this kind of imply a higher step up in '24 and '25 than previously expected? Or how should we think about the latitude created and or exactly where sort of the status of solar projects are today as best you see them.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Julien. I think we are seeing a lot more comfort from the developers that we're working with in terms of panel supply. Our original 10-year plan assumed our ﬁrst solar project coming online at the end of '23. That may move into '24. But I think as I said, overall, we're starting to see a lot more comfort with panel supply. So I think that we will largely be on sort of schedule for the build out and ownership of the solar component of the plan. As you pointed out, we -- on a net basis over the ﬁrst ﬁve years of 10-year planning, increased our capital expenditures $400 million last quarter. That gives us the opportunity to overcome any potential delay if that for solar project shifts from '23 to '24. As we get back on schedule to your point that up $200 million and becomes incremental earnings power for the company. So we'll give sort of broader update on that as well as the incremental capital from resiliency now and other opportunities on the Q3 call. But think about this as just a stronger sort of set of tailwinds for the company as we move forward."
"Got it. All right. This is just a slight shift in earnings still. Alright. Excellent. Let me come back to your O&M commentary, I just want to make sure I understand this because you guys have been had you put forward on this 1% to 2% for a while here but, what's the gross level Ii you could speak of it this way of inﬂation that you're seeing out there? And how much of an incremental spike are you having to put up here to oﬀset that impact? I just wanted -- I guess that you guys nicely package it into saying we reiterate our commitment on the reductions. I just wanted to understand how much of an inﬂationary pressure you are otherwise having attract against here to maintain that commitment and obviously cognizant here of the pull forward into '22 here to de-risk '23 as well.","Yeah. Thanks Julien for the question. We're not immune to inﬂation, but I think we're relatively well positioned. We're seeing the impact of inﬂation more on the capital side, more on sort of materials that we are necessarily on labor. As it relates to sort of a broader kind of labor costs, our crews and our contractors that we use relates to sort of a broader kind of labor costs. Our crews and our contractors that we use all sort of follow our union agreements. These are multi- year agreements that have stated annual increases in labor costs. And so we have set those -- those have been sort of in place. And I think what that does is that provides certainty to our workforce in years where maybe inﬂation is lower, our workforce is getting a beneﬁt in terms of a stated increase and in years where maybe inﬂation runs a little higher. Our customers are getting the beneﬁt of kind of a stable overall cost to labor. So for that reason we're not   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   necessarily seeing the cost impact of inﬂation on O&M quite as much as one may think. And so at the end of the day, it really is kind of a little bit more pressure on supplies on the capital standpoint."
"Interesting. And so just as equivalent you have third quarter update here. Would you expect there also sort of cascade for that inﬂationary impact on your core plan in addition to some of these other factors you talked about before? Or are you thinking about just simply shifting out projects in order to keep your sort of critical core plan in fact, if you will, just given those inﬂationary pressures on capital?","Yeah, I know it's a good question and I want to provide context. As we look at kind of a $19.3 billion ﬁve-year plan of $40 billion CapEx plan over 10 years, the incremental inﬂationary pressure is not that signiﬁcant. It's not going to be one of the growth drivers. We are focused on executing our projects, right. It's important to modernize our gas system, improve the reliability of our electric system. So it's about executing work sort of test directly answer to your question then. Yes, it will be a comprehensive capital update inclusive of new project work for resiliency now, inclusive of the potential for some inﬂation, but I wouldn't necessarily do. Thank you.     Operator. We're going to --     Of any CapEx increase."
