Question,Answer
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Good morning. My ﬁrst question, Bill, I mean, I wanted to just get a sense, any further thoughts that of the $2.5 billion equity in terms of the mix that you're looking at, are we still thinking that the bulk of it will be common as opposed to mandatory or some other form and just some sense of how you're thinking about the timing?","Ali, good morning, it's Bill. I think you said it correctly. The bulk of it is $2.5 billion and it's a combination of common equity, mandatory convertibles, or other high equity content securities. With respect to the timing, we have said, we intend to complete the permanent ﬁnancing for the acquisition of Vectren common shares before we close on the merger."
"Okay. And I guess my second question, Scott, to you, looking at the numbers you've given us on slide 20, which breakout the rate base growth rates for each company separately. On a -- if I look at just the CenterPoint component of it, you're growing at about 8.1%, the Vectren numbers are 6.6%, so the combined gets to the 7.6% that you pointed out. I guess the question being that on a standalone basis your rate base growth which is a good proxy for earnings growth in my mind is actually higher. So again, I'm not quite clear what Vectren would bring to that table given that it's actually diluting your rate base growth rate.","Yes, Ali, the way I would respond to that is, they still have a very strong growth rate on their rate base given their capital plans. Their plans, as they have shared them, where their expectations involve growth in both of their regulated businesses and their unregulated businesses. And when you look at the growth opportunities for that complete set matched up with our set, we think they are nicely complementary to our growth rate. So this is just taking a look at the utility side.  I will also say that each year, both companies or all companies update their capital plans based on requirements going forward. But, as you pointed out, their growth rate is technically lower than ours on the utility side, but they anticipate other growth in some of their non-regulated business units."
Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.,
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hey, good morning.",Good morning.
"Hey. So wanted to follow up on the sale -- basically the ﬁnancing composition here, can you perhaps elaborate a little bit on your latest thoughts on Enable just in the context of ongoing equity needs independent to the sale and also with respect to the sale of the composition of equity and equity units, if you have any further thought process in how exactly you want to structure it?","So, Julien, I don't think we have any more to share on the composition piece in terms of our equity other than what Bill just shared a minute ago. And with respect to Enable, look right now, we are focused on the ﬁnancing of this transaction. What we have said is, following the transaction, we will have some modest equity requirements to fund the capital requirements of our businesses going forward. And at that time, Enable may be a source of funds for that. But at this point, we're focused on completing this transaction and the necessary ﬁnancing for it."
"Got it. Understood. And can you elaborate a little bit -- I mean you just discussed a little bit already around the accretive nature to rate base of the Vectren acquisition. Can you comment a little bit more speciﬁcally around the electric versus gas versus non-reg contributions to that future rate base or let's keep it with electric versus gas, just to keep the focus on rate base speciﬁcally? But all together, I mean, I know that this is perhaps separate than the $50 million to $100 million pretax that you've talked about, but just getting a little bit more of a sense as you have had more time to look at the business.","Yes, Julien, I don't think we're prepared at this point to comment on the rate base growth deltas by business unit at this point. We are -- for context purposes about three weeks into our integration planning exercise. So, we are at the front end of understanding more information about the speciﬁcs that we will pursue once the deal is closed."
"Got it. Or maybe let me specify a little more carefully. Electric on the Vectren side historically has seen a little bit more rate inﬂation and so therefore, I suppose, has had a little bit more of a diﬃcult time accelerating their growth. Could you see merger related beneﬁts accruing such that electric could see a disproportionate growth again or we talking principally about the sizable growth at gas and just continue to accelerate on that front?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Well, again, it's probably premature to be talking about their capital plans, but they do have appreciable spend in both their electric and their gas businesses, if that's helpful."
Alright. Fair enough. Thank you.,Okay.  Operator  Your next question is from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse.
"Hi, guys.","Good morning, Michael."
"Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the Freeport plan and the reasons for the substantially increased cost? I am just looking at the 10-Q and I see that some of that's related to environmental and I'm wondering if maybe Hurricane Harvey had something to do with that or - - and then also as a part of this question, maybe address the -- how you think regulators might react to this -- to the extent you've already talked to them about these increased costs?","So, Michael, to your ﬁrst question, the driver for the increase from the original estimate of $250 million, that estimate was made early on when we were considering at a high level of diﬀerent routing options. During the time between that estimate and the one we just provided, we were able to do much more reﬁned analysis about routing options and the structures needed to be able to withstand certain win tolerances as well as recognition of environmental wetland type areas that are in this region of our service territory .When you couple the design requirements, including all of those factors, we end up with a cost for this line that has gone up from the $250 million, up to the number that I speciﬁed at around $630 million. So that's really the driver. It's structure and environmental related routing issues, that would be the short answer to that. Go ahead.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Yes. And on regulatory commentary on this so far, I mean, presumably you already have [ph] some talks here.","Yes. So, this is something that is just now entering the process with the Commission. We will be presenting that to them as we make our ﬁling. But one point to note. This is a investment that was deemed necessary by ERCOT as a result of reliability needs in the region. So we still see this as a solution to solve a reliability related design issue and still believe it's the most cost eﬀective solution available."
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.",Yes.  Operator  Our next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.
"Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about Texas and on the electric side, can you talk to us a little bit about demand trends that you're seeing speciﬁcally -- weather normalized obviously. But speciﬁcally across the customer classes, what's coming in a little bit higher than maybe what you had baked in, what's coming in a little bit lower than maybe what you anticipated and maybe what the drivers are?","So, Michael, good morning. What we're noticing around the Texas area is really strong ongoing demand in the commercial and the industrial sectors. That's what tends to be driving overall throughput along the system as well as some weather related, but you asked for kind of weather normalized. Those two segments tend to be weather normalized automatically. We still continue to see strong demand with our residential sector. They are essentially on a use per customer basis holding ﬂat, which is what we've seen for several years now. You will note that we have seen a slight downturn in the growth rate associated with residential addition. We believe that's associated with hurricane Harvey and the impacts that had on residential meters. And I think we're going see noise in that growth rate until we pass the period in which Harvey occurred, which would be in the fall. So that's creating some noise.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We also had a surge in the most recent period of completing multiple multifamily units and multi-family unit construction has slowed now, while the inventory is being consumed. But our additions in, say, a more of a suburban setting continue to be strong. One of our indications for that is we have joint trench crews, these are crews that go out and put in the infrastructure ahead of development build. These crews are operating at a level that is higher than last year, for example. So we see good fundamentals that even though the residential count is lower that the residential demand is still very strong."
Got it. Can you talk to us a little bit about what is your kind of all in demand growth that you embed in your multi-year guidance?,We think about 2% overall.
"Got it. Thank you, Scott. Much appreciated.",Yes.  Operator  Your next question is from Greg Gordon from Evercore.
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Greg."
"Two questions. One, it doesn't seem like that big of an issue, but through the $3 million delta quarter-over-quarter in the Energy Services businesses now you're obviously still pointing to conﬁdence in your guidance range for the year. So I'm sure it's inter-quarter [ph] volatility, but can you just go into little more detail as to what caused that?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes, Greg, there was a little bit of volatility in the quarter. But as you pointed out, it's a low quarter anyway. So, any amount of volatility gets exacerbated. We did -- we made some adjustments. There were some adjustments that we made on the balance sheet that had an eﬀect and fairly minor in nature, but again, since the number is small on this quarter, it got ampliﬁed. Obviously, the fundamentals remain very strong in this business. Customer account is up, our throughput is up, margin is staying very healthy. So we're still very, very bullish on this space."
"Okay. That's the answer, there was no shift in underlying fundamental trends in the business?","No, there was not."
"Okay, thank you. Second question is, unless I'm mistaken, I don't think you've announced the full suite of who is going to be your senior management for the pro forma company other than you deﬁnitively being CEO, is that correct? And if that is, when will we get a fuller sense of who the management team is going to be?","That is correct. I have not announced it. And as for timing, waiting until later in the process, I'd like the decision-making to be informed by our integration planning process. So it'll be a little later in the process before I get to that point."
"Okay, thank you.","Thanks, Greg.  Operator  Your next question is from Zach Prince from Merrill Lynch."
"Hey, guys, it's Antoine actually. How are you?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning, Antoine, we're ﬁne. Thank you."
"Quickly on the -- and apologies if I missed it, but the -- where you guys are in the restructuring of CERC?","I'll let Bill answer this.     Antoine, good morning. And as we've said, we should be completing that at year end this year where our investments in Enable Midstream that are held at the CERC level get moved to a separate entity, we call it CenterPoint Midstream and then we put leverage against those investments and use of the proceeds from those borrowings will be to pay down debt at CERC and to pay down debt at the holding company."
Got it. And for CERC there will be supposedly to reach the debt-to-capital ratio?,"Yes, the target debt-to-capital ratio for CERC is the weighted average debt-to-capital ratio that we have for the utilities and CERC."
And would Energy Services to be included in that?,"For this time, Energy Services will remain part of CERC."
"Got it. Okay, thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.",
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hi , good morning.","Hi, Steve."
"Old investor, not new investor. So just on Enable, so if you go back to, I'd hope, last 12 months or so, obviously, it's been a tough environment and you've mentioned a few times in terms of thinking about monetizing. There has been some signs of that changing. So maybe just from that standpoint, does that ignoring that you don't need it for the merger or just is there -- is it a better environment now for you to think about monetization of some of the stake.","Look, clearly, Steve, with the strengthening in the market, that space, that is a positive sign. We like to see that. We can continue to monitor that market for strength of investors. But I would answer the question by saying, look, our near-term focus is around ﬁnancing the acquisition and keeping our attention on that. And then to the extent that there would be opportunities for Enable, it would be down the line when we're looking at equity requirements for our ongoing growth capital."
"Okay. And then one other question on just the 2018 guidance. Wanted to clarify, you're still using the midpoint of the Enable range, and also, did you -- are you including any of the good July weather, which I guess we pay attention to on the power side?","Steve, it's Bill. Our guidance at the high end of our $1.50 to $1.60 incorporates Enable's guidance when they say they're at their midpoint or higher. With respect to July weather, yes, it's been somewhat warmer than normal weather. But to-date, we haven't updated for third quarter activities. This is just through second quarter."
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you, Steve.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Again, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn it over to the leaders for any closing remarks.     Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will now conclude our second quarter 2018 earnings call.
