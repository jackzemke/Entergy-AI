Question,Answer
Good morning.,"Good morning, Jeremy."
"Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just had a couple of questions, and I apologize in advance if I'm crossing the line here as far as the discussion that you want to have with the strategic review, but I was just curious if you could tell us whether the re – consideration is just with the electric assets, or is the gas assets part of that process? And is there anything that you   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   could share with us as far as what steps or factors are being considered in this process, and how – any factors that you can share with us in the evaluation of the restructure?","Hey, Jeremy, I hate to disappoint you, but given that we're really at the front end of this evaluation, we're not really prepared to make comments on the strategic reviews at this time, but our plan remains to update everybody once we have something to share, or a little bit later in the year."
"Okay, great. I appreciate that. That's it from me. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Neel Mitra from Tudor, Pickering.",
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Neel."
"I was curious, the $3.7 billion capital spending plan at Houston Electric, how much of that is contingent upon the 2% customer growth that so for you've been seeing? If that customer growth does come down, is the capital plan aﬀected meaningfully?","Neel, I'll make a quick comment, and then I'll ask Tracy to expand on it. The short answer to your question is it's not linked very heavily to the customer addition number that we've talked about. And that has to do with the various categories in which we are investing for growth, and it goes well beyond just the addition of new meters for the residential sector. Tracy, if you'd like to add to that?     I really don't have much to add to that, Neel. You know that we have to plan into the future for this, for this grid, and while we're fairly conﬁdent that we're going to continue to see strong customer growth, these capital numbers, as Scott said, are not directly linked to that.      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Neel, for example, we're investing a lot in transmission-level infrastructure, substations, that type of thing, and those are not – that type of growth is not linked to a residential customer addition."
"Got it. And then, in regards to the strategic review, just a very general question. Is there a reasoning or thought process behind setting an expectation for the, speciﬁcally the second half of the year, for an update? Can you maybe provide any color on that?","We don't have a speciﬁc timeline, but we think that there is a reasonable window in which we would expect to get back to folks with some information or conclusions from the work they we're doing. So, we feel that towards the end of the year, we've got a high degree of conﬁdence will be at least able to update, if not to provide conclusions."
"Okay, great. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.",
Thank you. Good morning.,Good morning.
"First question. Big picture, Scott, just to understand what you guys are looking at, the strategic review, are these mutually exclusive events, thinking about exit from Enable and the REIT? Are they somehow linked? And also, again big picture, consistently you've been telling us that the Enable exit is very complicated by the fact that there's a huge tax liability that would suddenly come due. Has that issue been resolved, or is that still part of this review?","So, Ali, going to your ﬁrst question, these are independent analyses, ﬁrst of all, so, to answer that. And then secondly, with respect to the question about the tax issue, the tax issue is still very much there and part of our consideration. Doug (32:40), I don't know if you want anything to that?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)    Ali, one way. I think, for you to think about the tax issue is to take a look at our deferred tax footnote in our 2015 Form 10-K, where you'll see an accrual estimate of a deferred tax liability of $1.2 billion. That's derived from our accrual balance sheet estimated value of Enable of $11.06, which we just described relative to the basis in Enable."
Okay.,"So maybe that's more information than you wanted, but that's one way you can think through what that might be if we were sell the units for cash."
"Right. That's helpful. But my second question, again, to the 4% to 6% EPS growth guidance, since you originally articulated that the Enable outlook has gotten worse, and I think your rate base growth numbers have come down as well from previous numbers, so what has incrementally gotten better that you are still in that same guidance with the lower rate base growth number and a worse outlook for Enable?","Bill, I'll ask you to answer this.     Certainly. So, I reviewed some of this in the prepared remarks earlier where we went from $0.79 to the mid-point of our $0.88 to $0.92 for the utility operations. The three components of that which I addressed were $0.05 better operating income, lower interest expense of $0.02, and $0.04 from the preferred. The operating income is achieved through increase in revenues associated with various rate ﬁlings as well as the O&M discipline, which both Tracy and Joe mentioned, but we're expecting a strong year out of both utilities. Tracy or Joe?     I think that's right Bill. We've had good track record in our gas utilities, and of course with the addition – or the better performance at CES over the last couple of years, and the hopefully closing on the Continuum acquisition, we continue to see growth in operating income at our gas business that is very close to the rate base growth.    CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Ali, suﬃce to say it one more time, this strength in the 80% of our business covers oﬀ the challenges in the 20% of our Enable Midstream portion of our business.     And Ali, I'll add one other comment, just remind you back when we were ﬁrst talking about this growth rate, we had indicated that we had done our own evaluation in terms of stress testing, Enable's performance in our ability to hit that 4% to 6% growth rate under a number of conditions."
"Great, Scott, but just to be clear, I mean your rate base growth numbers have come down. I was looking more in the ﬁve-year outlook, not just the 2016 outlook. So what has changed in your thinking that with a lower rate base growth, the release will actually grow at a faster pace than previously thought?","I think Ali, if you take a look at it, the rate base growth and the operating income and EPS growth are all converging together within that 4% to 6% range. So there are a variety of factors. One is thinking hard about the capital we invest after coming oﬀ of a record year and Joe and Tracy described why it was record year. The regulatory lag and the fact that in this current plan over ﬁve years, we see a very modest amount of equity as part of our capital formation."
Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.,
"Hey, good morning, everyone.","Good morning, Steve."
"Couple of questions. So ﬁrst, just a clariﬁcation, Bill, on the comments from the 10-K on the Enable deferred tax of $1.2 billion.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes.
"Pardon this, but just, is that basically your negative tax basis in Enable? Is that equivalent to that, or is that basic – yeah.","Right. So, I'll answer that Steve. So that number is derived from the accrual value that we have on our books, less our basis, which you're right to suggest that it's negative, and then multiplying by 35%."
"Okay. Okay. And then just on the Texas economy and the impact of the energy collapse and all that stuﬀ, obviously didn't seem to aﬀect you at all in 2015, and so far things still seem to be growing. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color overall on just kind of whatever data points or color on how the economy is likely to hold up, given what you're seeing?","Steve, I'll give you one piece of color. It took me about an hour and 20 minutes to get into work this morning because of all the traﬃc, which is a one sign that the economy is still robust. But I'll ask Tracy to make some comments about what we look at it in terms of our views on how the economy is performing.     Good morning, Steve."
Good morning.,"As I mentioned in my comments, the Greater Houston Partnership is projecting some 22,000 net new jobs this year. It's obviously not in the energy industry, but we realize and beneﬁt from a more diversiﬁed economy than what we had 30 or 35 years ago, the healthcare, construction industries; if you see the Houston skyline, you still see cranes all around the downtown area.  So we still look at 2% growth this year. One of the notable metrics that I look at is, what are we doing with customers on a month-over-month basis, and then for January, we saw healthy residential customer growth, and that's a sign that, that the economy, while it may be slowing down a little bit, it's not appearing to slow down very much. So, the jury's still out, we still have 10.5 months to go, but so far so good in terms of what we're seeing with customer growth.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)      Steve, you've heard me comment and, I think Tracy's commented as well in the past about the number of crews that we have out putting infrastructure into subdivisions ahead of the builders coming in and building homes. We track those crews and that activity. This – right now, we have more crews working now than we did a year ago. And the – we also track housing inventory in the area, to see if there's a rise in the housing inventory, and that number has stayed very, very healthy at – being a low number, it's about three-and-a-half months of inventory against what many consider to be a more balanced market of about six months, and that number is really not changing that much either.  So, we're still seeing a lot of indicators that suggest the housing sector is still very strong and that we're not building up inventories of homes that are sitting around."
"Okay. Great. And then just I guess lastly, just the – is the dividend strategy the same, to kind of tie into dividend growth to earnings growth, through 2018?","Yes. It is. Our messaging around this is that we're going to have dividends follow earnings, and our earnings growth target is, as we've shared with you, 4% to 6% over this period."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,Yup.  Operator  Our next question comes from Faisel Khan from Citigroup.
Thanks. Good morning.,Good morning.
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. Just want to make sure I understood sort of the – sort of modest amount of equity needs with the growth in rate base. So it sounds like that could all be sort of taking care of, into the GRIP program, but does that also sort of – does it require the distributions from Enable, or is this sort of independent of the Enable distributions?","Faisel, it's Bill. So, I said modest over the ﬁve-year horizon. If you wanted to take today's equity market cap of CenterPoint and sort of derive what modest might mean, it would be low single- digits, as a percentage of today's equity market cap, over ﬁve years, so not in each of the ﬁve years, over ﬁve. To look at it in another way, if we were to use our GRIP program and other ongoing programs in any given year, if that were maxed out, that might be $200 million of equity. We didn't use it last year or prior year, nor are we looking at it this year.  With respect to how we think about distributions to Enable's and how that ﬁts in, as Scott mentioned in his opening comments, Enable's contribution to our cash ﬂow was less than 20%. So it's important to us, but it's not a driver in terms of our thinking about capital formation. Certainly if there were a reduction in that cash ﬂow, we'd have to take a hard look at our credit metrics and see if it would be appropriate to issue a little bit more equity."
Okay. That's very clear. Thank you guys. I appreciate the time.  Operator  Our next question comes from John Edwards from Credit Suisse.,
"Yeah, good morning, everybody. And my parking garage in downtown Houston has more spaces than it did before, so anecdotally there's – looks like some impact, just to your comment earlier, but thank you for your commenting on the customer growth environment. So my question then would be just on Energy Services business, I'm just curious, how you envision the Continuum acquisition, how you envision leveraging that, maybe if you could give us a little color on the, kind of the longer term growth outlook and plans for that?","Joe, do you want to take this?     Sure. Yeah. John, we plan on integrating that business fairly quickly after we close, and as we've pointed out, it adds about 30% to our C&I customer base. Their business is in very similar service territories to what we have currently. So, we plan to take advantage of the scale and the reach that we would have by adding those customers, and continue to really deliver on what we've been delivering on, we feel, over the last few years in that business. And so that we – for   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   example, we retained on average 92% of our customers over the last three years, and with the addition of Continuum's customers, we can oﬀer better products and services, perhaps more competitive pricing to our customers, and just continue with the success that we've enjoyed the last few years.  So we're excited about this opportunity and think that the performance of the business in the last couple of years demonstrates our ability to continue to grow that business as a complement to our gas utility."
Okay. That's helpful. Could you just comment on perhaps the kinds of additional products and services that you'd be contemplating?,"Well, we have – we're going to get – once we get the business integrated, we're going to look at some of the things that they've been doing compared to some of the things that we've been doing, and just take the best of both in terms of giving additional services and pricing products to our customers. For example, in this low price environment, we're starting to see a lot of customers interested in locking these prices, given the low levels, and so with the bigger size of the business and some of the things that both companies have been doing, we will take advantage of that and stabilize those margins over an extended period of time."
"Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.",
"Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question.","Good morning, Michael."
"Just want to – I 'm thinking about the utility in the parent EPS growth for 2016 from 2015, and then longer term. Because the growth from 2015 to 2016, going from $0.79 to almost $0.90, if I use your 4% to 6% EPS growth longer term, that implies a much lower growth rate after 2016. I'm just kind of doing back-of-the-envelope math. Am I missing something here, or is that or is   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   that fundamentally the way we should be thinking about this? Right, because 2015 to 2016 is almost 10% growth, so I'm just trying to think about what the growth rate is beyond that?","Right. So Michael, it's Bill. I'll start with that, and Scott may have additional comments. We – ﬁrst, the income from the preferred investment, that should continue on. The savings from lower interest expense, that should continue on, and in fact there are more opportunities in 2017 and 2018 to take a look at interest expense management. And ﬁnally and most importantly, I think you'll see an acceleration of the – or could see an acceleration of the year-on-year operating income delivered by electric and gas, as they execute on the strategies, which Joe and Tracy has mentioned and as the rate base comes into revenue requirement."
"But why wouldn't that lead to a higher growth rate, if you're doing 10% in the ﬁrst year? Because you're capturing the beneﬁt of a lot of that stuﬀ, the ﬁnancing – the initial ﬁnancing savings, the Enable preferred, you're capturing that in a10% growth this year. I'm just curious why it wouldn't, if there are other incremental things that are going to happen in 2017 and beyond, and you are doing 10% in the ﬁrst year, why your long-term growth rate wouldn't have been a higher number?","Michael, I think one way you can think of this is, the items that have – that we've executed, like the preferred for example, that just provides a step change that continues going forward. But the base business, we're still committing to a 4% to 6% growth. So if you've had some things in here that provide a step change like a Continuum or like a – like the preferred, then we would intend to grow oﬀ of that higher base that's established by those new levels of earnings, or those new earnings amounts."
"Got it. One another thing just on cash ﬂow, when I think about the CenterPoint dividend, how much of that dividend comes from cash that is being up-streamed by either the Houston Electric T&D business or the gas distribution or Energy Services business, and how much of that dividend is either coming from the Enable contributions or from things like parent debt or other items?","Right. Michael, that would vary from year to year, beginning with a recognition that the cash distributions from Enable come into CERC, which owns the LDCs as well as our CES, CIP business, and Enable. So when we take a look at CERC's balance sheet and determine what's the appropriate strength of that balance sheet and through its earnings, cash ﬂow, determine how much we would dividend out of CERC in any given year. We could – as I said, after the impairment and then pro forma for the dividend distribution associated with Enable's paying down debt owed to CERC, their balance sheet is at 55%.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So we'll start with that balance sheet. On the Houston Electric side, again, it depends upon their sources and uses of cash, as well as their earnings for the year, but we target to maintain a 45% equity of the capital, and then dividend funds after that. Now, going to the dividend, which clearly is paid out of the holding company, the sort, the – whether there's borrowings from the holding company or whether it's fully sourced from CERC and Houston Electric will depend on how much dividends they make and the borrowings that the holding company make after that."
"Got it. Yeah. I just – I asked that question only because if I look at what happened in the MLP world over the last six months to nine months, the dividend yields of certain stocks sometimes send a signal to the market implying a potential dividend cut of the MLP. And what I'm just trying to think about, and I look at this across all the utilities we cover that own MLPs right now, is there the risk that if there is a distribution cut at the MLP level, what that means for the utility holding company's dividend level?","Well, Scott mentioned this, and I included it as a response to an earlier question. Remember that Enable is less than 20% of the cash ﬂow of CenterPoint. Our utilities are strong and increasing their cash distributions. Second point I pointed out is that I mentioned really very little in the way of net incremental debt in 2016, and that's associated again with the strong cash ﬂow of our utilities.  So while, if you're suggesting that there is going to a change in the distribution from Enable, if that were to happen, I don't think it has a meaningful impact on us in the near term, given the relative amount of that cash ﬂow and the strength of our balance sheet."
"Got it, Bill. Thank you. I appreciate your taking the time and going to that level of detail with us, and I'll follow up afterwards.  Operator  Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie.",
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Andrew."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Just to follow up on that last line of questioning, if you were to divest or spin oﬀ your stake in Enable, how would you think about the dividend under that scenario?","If something like that were to happen, I think you'd have to rethink the whole picture. But again, it's too early to really provide any thoughts or any commentary on what that would look like, other than to say you would have to reconsider it in a more broad base."
"Okay. Well, let me ask it this way then. Could the CenterPoint Energy without Enable support the current dividend, and maybe would you consider taking on additional debt or use potential cash proceeds to sustain the current dividend?","Andrew, I think there's a lot of theoreticals there. So without Enable contemplates we've done something with our Enable ownership, but doesn't yet contemplate what the use of proceeds from that might be."
"Well, I guess it's essentially what I'm asking.","And as Scott has said, we will be back to you as we conclude these reviews in the second half of this year."
"Okay. Understood. My other question is, it looks like the 2016 through 2019 CapEx plan has come down quite a bit from what you guided to a year ago. That, in addition to the bonus depreciation, is obviously what's driving the lower rate base numbers, but on the CapEx itself, can you give us some commentary as to why the forecast has come down so sharply?","I'll give you some commentary. I'll ask these other gentlemen here, if they would like to add into that. Each year we sit down and go through an exercise to assess how much capital is needed in the out years, and 2015 was a very high year. Some of the spend that was perhaps looked at for outer years had been pulled forward. And we've had reductions in other areas, public improvement, that type of thing, and then Joe mentioned earlier, we have completed some projects that are no longer going to continue into the future years.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So it's really driven by the needs of the system, and I will say that as you look further out, there's less clarity about what that speciﬁc value looks like, as you get out towards the end of the plan. And as we update the needs on an annual basis, you could see that number out there ﬂuctuating based on needs for the system. Joe, Tracy, do you want to add any color to that?     Andrew, I'd point you to pages 27 and 32 in the appendix. I think those are the best graphical representations with the answer to your question, and to make a more complicated story shorter and more digestible, two categories stand out. They are the categories in the red and the categories in the blue. They are the public and system improvements, and load growth, and both of those represent the majority of the change in the capital structure. And I would just point out that it's not that all the rest of the years are anomalous, it's that 2015 was unusually high, the way I see it. So, I think that's the best answer to the question, but Joe may have additional to share.     Andrew, a very similar answer for gas. 2015, there was almost $70 million in there between our advanced – the completion of our Advanced Meter project, public improvement that we don't expect to continue at that level, and other expenditures such as some work we're doing on our new facilities at our Porcaro Tech Leak Detection technology, et cetera. So, 2015 was somewhat of an anomaly from the standpoint of the level of CapEx, and we'll go back to more normal levels.  In addition to, we've done a good job and have worked hard to prioritize our capital, especially in the near term, but we're meeting all of our needs in terms of integrity management, CapEx, et cetera, and have an aggressive strategy still to replace cast iron with bare steel and so on.   Andrew, it's also – it also can be very diﬃcult, both of these gentlemen mentioned, it can be very diﬃcult to forecast public improvement dollar spend, as that's something that is inﬂuenced by other activities around us. So that's certainly one of the categories. I do want to highlight too, though, that while the spend is reduced from prior plans, and the rate base growth is impacted by not just the spend but by bonus deprecation, we are essentially working hard to optimize and maintain the earnings at prior levels that we've been talking about."
Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you.,Yup. Thank you.  Our next question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"If I could just follow up on the last question though, I mean, yes, 2015 is higher, but if I can compare your new ﬁve-year plan with the old ﬁve-year plan, 2016 through 2019, the CapEx numbers for both T&D and gas distribution are down 15%, 20%. So is that all coming from this public improvements area? I haven't had time to look at those slides in the appendix.","Charles, those are major contributors to it, but they are not the only, there is also some reductions as our folks look at the system, particularly on the electric side; some reduction is associated with estimates around the growth capital that's needed to ﬁll the needs of the system over this period. And Joe, was there another – was there any other point for the gas business, other than the public improvements?     I think as we've looked at prioritizing that capital, and especially replacing old pipe and old infrastructure, part of what we are doing is taking advantage of our risk-based system that we've had in place in the past, but really ﬁne-tuning it to be very systematic in the way we go about that. So in other words, we want to replace the riskiest pipe ﬁrst, and so as we've gotten more clarity around how that occurs, it's actually – we've actually determined that it doesn't need to be as much capital as we thought just a year ago. So that's another factor in our budget."
"Scott, when you went into the annual planning process, did you ask your key people, because we're not as certain about what's going to happen with distributions to Enable, to reduce -- to essentially extend out some of these projects that you had originally planned a year ago? Is that some what's going on?","No, this is driven primarily by the assessments that boil up from the organization about the CapEx that's needed for things like maintenance, reliability, growth. And those requirements and those inputs change year-to-year as the engineers are looking at the demands on the system and projects that are coming and going, where they're being sited. And as you look further out, I think it becomes less clear as to exactly what's going to occur in those particular years, and as we revise this again this coming year, you could see some ﬂuctuations in those out years just like we've seen here. But we build this based on the operators' input of what's needed to run these systems safely and reliably."
"Well your plan going forward, then, is to update the ﬁve-year plan every year, just once a year?",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes that's been our practice.
Okay. Thank you.,Yep.  Operator  Our next question comes from Kamal Patel from Wells Fargo.
"Good morning, everyone. First of all, thanks for adding slide 33. Provides some clarity on the rate case timeline. Bill, this question is probably more for you. Trying to get an idea of some of these debt numbers, the reﬁ of $600 million at Houston, I'm guessing that's reﬁ'ing of short- term debt? And then the debt maturities at CenterPoint and CERC, is that going to be reﬁ'ed or is that pending some clarity on the strategic review?","Sure. So, right. Today, we have approximately $1 billion in short-term debt outstanding, against just over $6 billion in total debt. So we have a conservative interest rate risk proﬁle. Having said that, we recognize at Houston Electric, it's appropriate to term out some of that debt. So the $600 million that we're terming out is just that, it's largely terming out existing short-term borrowings, plus Houston Electric will be a borrower this year; it has a sizable CapEx program.  And then the maturities, we have one maturity this year at CERC, and then we have maturity next year at CERC and at the holding company. We'll take a look at how those might be reﬁnanced as they come due and in the context of our balance sheet. As I said in my prepared remarks, inclusive of our pending acquisition of Continuum, we only expect to have incremental borrowings this year of $150 million. Does that help?"
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Our last question comes from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.,
Good morning.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Good morning, Paul."
"You know, you guys have answered a lot of questions. I really have one very simple one, and I apologize for not getting this clear. But the $2.6 billion of – that's associated with the current carrying value at Enable. What is the tax basis on that, if you could – I mean, if you break that down to me, what would be the equivalent tax basis vis-à-vis the $11.06 or $2.6 billion?","Paul, this is Bill. Just to clarify are you working to connect the impartment relative to the tax?"
"I'm working to sort of ﬁgure out what you guys are currently carrying at Enable, in terms of – on a tax basis, if you were to actually do a taxable transaction associated with it?","Okay. Got it. So the impairment of our investment in Enable is related to taxes that we might pay, should we sell Enable for cash, in that they are accrual estimates, right? So that we took an impairment charge based upon year-end factors and brought down the balance sheet investment in Enable to $11.06, and then when we took down that balance sheet investment, it was – we needed to update, and within our deferred taxes, what that deferred tax would be. So both are accrual estimates, and the deferred tax estimate is based both upon the balance sheet number, as well as our current tax basis in Enable. And on an earlier call we were asked if that's negative, in fact it is.  And we can help you through that math, but those are the factors. The actual tax obligation, should we consider a cash sale, would be based upon the proceeds at that time, and the basis at that time."
And the tax basis is what?,The current tax basis?
Yeah.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"The way to derive that is, again, take the $11.06, the $1.2 billion in the tax footnote, and 35%, you can derive a tax basis that is negative several hundred million dollars."
Okay. Okay. Thanks so much.,"Okay, Paul."
Sorry for the clariﬁcation request. Thanks so much.,"I believe that was our ﬁnal question. Thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
