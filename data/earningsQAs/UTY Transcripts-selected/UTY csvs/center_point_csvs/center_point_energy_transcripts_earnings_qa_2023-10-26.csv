Question,Answer
"Hey guys, good morning.",Good morning.
"Good morning. So just on -- I wanted to just touch on the conﬁdence that's going into '24 and obviously growing at the top-end from the raised guidance. I guess, how are you kind of maybe addressing the headwinds like interest-rate pressures on about $1 billion of the maturities, and you do have, in addition you can talk about this. You have rate cases, right, in Texas, Indiana and   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Minnesota that you have to get through which could also create some lag. It's a lot of moving pieces, so, I guess where the levers, and just talk about your conﬁdence level in these cases is welcome that it will dictate '24 and beyond.","Sure, Shar. Thanks for the question. I think there's probably three things I would focus on. I'll make sure to hit the rate case piece with that, while Jason maybe give you some color there. And there's probably three things that give us the conﬁdence. First is the thoughtful capital planning, where we're now seeing some of the beneﬁt with improved regulatory mechanisms.  Second is O&M discipline that we're starting, really continuing to improve on. Third would be just really looking across the plan for incremental opportunities as we go. So an impact each of those. On the capital side, we're now experiencing some of the beneﬁts that are layering in over the increases that we've put in over the last 18 months. And on top of that, we've got the Texas legislation that passed earlier this year is going to help reduce the regulatory lag. And we'll start to see some of the beneﬁt of those investments in '24 and '25. And so we think that ability to ﬁle two DCRFs per year, in particular and that incremental recovery of incentive comp can help us reduce regulatory lag by about half.  On the O&M side, really as David said, in particular, we continue to be focused on reducing O&M 1% to 2% on average. And you heard that now that we're looking back and really 2021 forward, we're now looking at a 12% reduction, which is pretty substantial. Then lastly, I was getting out looking really across the plan. And so there, although not really O&M speciﬁc, we're looking at exploring some savings opportunities with respect to income tax.  And since we divested all those non-regulated entities within the company that have any real material size, we've been looking to ensure that there is an eﬃcient state income tax structure that exists beyond that. So we're looking here in the near-term for some potential tax savings as well.  Maybe I'll just kick it to Jason for more color on the regulatory cases.     Yeah, thanks Chris. And sure, I would say that the extension of the ﬁling date for Houston Electric will not create any additional regulatory lag, want to be clear about that. As a quick reminder, you know, we have access to the DCRF entity cost, the capital recovery mechanisms up to the date that we make that rate case ﬁling. So we don't see this extension in the ﬁling date creating any additional regulatory lag."
"Got it. Okay, perfect. And then just lastly, obviously, appreciate the CapEx increase and the, you know, modest step-up of equity. What's left in the upside CapEx you've highlighted in the past versus what you put into plan? And is there -- I guess is there any reason even track that anymore given the incremental opportunity. It's obviously not something you guys have highlighted on the deck, so.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah, thanks Shar, and I think you hit it. At the end of your question there. Candidly, I don't think there is a reason to continue to track, you know, what we had originally in our last quarter articulated is at $2.6 billion. Set capital opportunities are -- were outside of the plan. You know, candidly, as we've gone through our planning process for '24 and looking at our long-term plans, the pipeline of additional CapEx opportunities above are now over[ph] a $3.9[ph] billion CapEx plan remains signiﬁcant, well in excess of that $2.6 billion. And so, I think it just becomes a confusing factor to reconcile that. I think we've earned the conﬁdence in track record that. You know, the pipeline of opportunities is deep, and as we see the opportunity to eﬃciently execute them, eﬃciently fund them and eﬃciently recover them, we will continue to put them in for the beneﬁt of our customers."
"Okay, perfect. Jason, congrats to you on, on Phase-II, and obviously not a surprise to anyone. And Dave, congrats to you on your next phase, and if you're not Board of the utility sector, I'm sure there's other utilities that may need your help this year's. Thanks.","Yeah, I'm[ph] that Board of the utility. (multiple speakers) Thanks, Shar. Thanks.  Operator  Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open."
"Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks. First, my condolences on the Astros, but more importantly, congrats to Dave on a great job and very happy for you, Jason.",Thank you Steve.     Thanks Steve.
So I --,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   No, I'm, I'm thanking you for the Astros, and thank you for the (multiple speakers)."
"Dave, you can win every year in the utility business, but you can't in baseball, so.","Yeah, so, so true."
"Not to give[ph]. So the -- I guess just could you give a little color on the $250 million of equity, of just kind of should we expect that to be kind of largely done, kind of during the year, next year. And then is there anything to just read into it about, you know, in the past you talked about, you know, kind of asset sale potential and things like that, is that just less likely now given that the market environment. Or, is it maybe just the needs are not enough to consider asset sale, as you kind of feathering this in the incremental CapEx. Thanks.","Sure, Steve, happy to hit it. I, I think if you just look at what we updated today, we took the plan from $43.4 billion to $43.9 billion. And really, you know, fairly, you know, relatively small amount of the CapEx increase, but one that we thought was reasonably funded with the, the modest movement in the ATM of introducing a 250. Stepping back going-forward, if you -- If you look at kind of how we articulated previously, we'd probably be putting ourselves in a position to talk about the longer-term CapEx plan and the associated refresh, really once we get through the key rate cases that are in front of us at this stage.  Pointing to kind of the last factor that, that you mentioned, we're going to consistently looking at it, look at the most eﬃcient way to fund our equity going forward. But it's going to be clear that we are talking about at this stage, you know, any future considerations on an ATM would be incremental to the $43.9 billion, right. So there will be growth centric beyond the $43.9 billion that we're talking about today. And again, we're looking to do that larger capital refresh once we can work our way through these cases."
"Okay, great, thanks. I'll, I'll leave it to others for questions. Thank you.","Thanks, Steve.     Thanks, Steve.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator   Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open."
"Hey, good morning and congratulations, guys, well done. Jason, good morning.",Good morning.
"Yeah, absolutely. Alrighty. Just wanted to pivot back to that last question a little bit. I mean, you know, incremental resiliency spending through some of these ﬁlings in Texas seems like a pretty clear opportunity. I know it's preliminary. Can you elaborate a little bit more about that upside relative to the 2%[ph] to 6%[ph], you guys have articulated earlier? I, I get that there's kind of a, a quote big opportunity. But just a sense of, of what you guys are seeing out there and the and the sum out there are are really putting on some big numbers.  And then relate it if you can, how does that timeline square up with the Texas electric case here, if at all, to the extent to which that, that drove some of that timeline consideration. And then maybe lastly I'll throw in this, it's just related; how do you think about the merits of further LDC asset sales versus ATM, considering this upside in the plan, you know, tied to resiliency or, or what have you.  Again, I, I get that, you know, that the, the modest size of ATM is sort of tied to the modest CapEx increase. But as you think about these, these bigger chunkier increases, is that still on the table or is it little bit in the backburner considering the backdrop today.","Yes, thanks Julien. There's a, a lot to unpack there. You know, on the CapEx side of things. Let, let me just say, you know, last quarter we had talked about pipeline of opportunities of $2.6 billion outside of the plan, you know, as we've gone through our planning process. It is well, well in excess of that. I think those opportunities are in all kind of aspects of our business. I mean, you hit on it. I think the resiliency opportunity here at Houston Electric remains signiﬁcant. I think it's a real question around the pace of work and we're in the middle of preparing that ﬁling that I'll come back to in a minute, but resiliency is clearly a key driver.  But I equally see an incredible amount of opportunities on our gas side as well, particularly given all the growth that we've seen here in Texas for our Texas gas business. So, I would say they're equally weighted, they're well in excess of the $2.6 billion we used to track. We're just moving away from tracking that because it becomes confusing, what's in the plan was out of   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   and how does it adjust quarter-by-quarter, but suﬃce it to say, it remains a deep pipeline of, of opportunities.  With respect to the ﬁling timing, you know, we are waiting for the ﬁnal set of rules to be voted out by the PUCT, likely in December here. We will then, and we are now currently preparing our ﬁling which will likely be sometime, kind of late in the ﬁrst quarter for that, that resiliency ﬁlings. I think this is a incredible piece of legislation, and we're excited about proposing plans to really enhance, continued to enhance the resiliency of our Houston Electric business.  And, so more to come there. I think as it relates to the timing of the ﬁling will likely come in maybe a month or two or so before we ﬁle the Houston Electric rate case. So it will be a busy regulatory calendar for, for the Houston Electric business next year. But roughly kind of the same time, as I said, end of ﬁrst-quarter for their resiliency ﬁling a little bit after that for the, the Houston Electric ﬁling. And then sort of more broadly on assets, as look, we, we love the businesses we run. It's a privilege to serve all of our communities. We constantly receive inbound interest on, you know, all of our assets. And as we think about additional movements increases in our CapEx plan, I think we were in the conﬁdence, we will ﬁnd the most eﬃcient way to ﬁnance that incremental growth. So I would say, we, we will make the right decision to maximize value for, for all of our stakeholders, as we look to funding this incremental capital pipeline that I articulated."
"Got it, excellent. Nicely done. And then just quick clariﬁcation. You made an allusion to some CapEx timing shifts in, in Indiana based on the renewable project. Just, what's the backﬁll plan, if you can elaborate a little bit more?","Well, some of it's already underway. I mean I think some of the capital that we've announced today, you know, we're executing that capital, putting that capital into service that will allow us then to begin to seek recovery of it next year and fully year in on it in '25. And so, you know, this, this pattern of looking out in the plan and seek re-sequencing capital has been something that I think we've built a track record for. You know, originally, when the Department of Commerce opened up its original investigation, that moved the timing on a handful of our original solar projects.  We seamlessly accelerated some capital, particularly here in Houston Electric to oﬀset that. And eﬀectively, that's what we're doing today with this CapEx increase. So yeah, I think the important part about these renewable generation projects up in Indiana, I think it's important to reemphasize, it represents less than 10% of our total CapEx for the company. And so it gives us a great deal of ﬂexibility as we see the potential slowdown in, you know, operational dates for these plants, we can accelerate either in the other electric or gas portions of our business."
"Congrats again guys. See you soon, right?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Please standby for the next question. The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan Securities. Your line is open."
"Hi, good morning.","Hey, Jeremy, good morning."
"Congratulations again to Dave and Jason here. Great to see. And maybe just kind of picking up with this point. Obviously, Dave is a big ﬁgure in the City of Houston, very ingrained in the culture there. I was just wondering, Jason, if you could maybe speak a bit, I guess, you know, having moved to Texas, how you feel your relationships with, you know, local community stakeholders, you know, have evolved over-time, you know, being somewhat newer to the City?","Yeah, thanks for the question, Jeremy. I appreciate it. Obviously, incredibly big shoes to ﬁll, from the standpoint of Dave's status in the, in the community here, but you know I've been working since I hit the ground here with a variety of organizations outside of Houston Electric and, and, and obviously our greater CenterPoint family.  So I'm deeply involved in the community, serving a number of diﬀerent interests. I would say that Houston is a very welcoming and transitory community with a strong civic focus, and I've been able to tap into that to build a broad network. My focus are, isn't just on Houston alone. It's incredibly important, and I think the activities, you know, outside of my, my day job here at CenterPoint reﬂect my commitment to the community, but, you know, even this week we were up in Minnesota, meeting with the Governor and other elected oﬃcials around priorities for our Minnesota gas business. I continue to make my way around our full-service territory. And so, I think and, and hopefully you have seen -- I understand the importance of being involved in our communities. Houston being obviously our home base, but we have the privilege to serve six states and want to be active in all of them.     Yeah, let me just add little something to that, it's hard. As you know Jason is a humble guy, and he ﬁnds it hard to pat himself on the back, but I think he's done a great job in three-plus years   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   he's been here in the Houston community and, and the broader places that CenterPoint serves. And I think he's doing a great job there. He is embedding themselves in the community. I'm not going anywhere. And I think it's going to be all easily handled, and I don't think there should be any concern at all about it."
"Got it, that's, that's great to hear. Thank you for that. And then maybe just pivoting over towards Minnesota, if I could. I think you touched on the potential to change the structure of the ﬁling to two-year forward looking rate case, instead of one years, one year, and just I was wondering, would that raise your earn return expectations in the jurisdiction, if this does come to fruition? And is this a, a beneﬁt to CenterPoint's outlook if the Commission approves for the, the two- year test look there.","I think just the overall sort of smoothing rate increases for customers. And sort of consistent with the common theme around a lot of our regulatory update today sort of simplifying our rate case schedule. I wouldn't really look at it as much as a, you know, earned return. Minnesota is the one state that we operate in that has a forward-looking test year.  You know, historically, what I used to say was that, you know, in even years we would see a revenue increase and, and in odd years, you know, we wouldn't see any increase until we have to overcome that regulatory lag on, on odd years. This ﬁling for a two-year for test year begins to address that proﬁle. And so, again, starts to reduce a little bit of regulatory lag, snooze rate increases for our customers and overall reduces the administrative burden. So we're excited about making that ﬁling next week."
"Got it, that's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  The last question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David, your line is open."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question, and congrats to both Dave and Jason as well.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you, David."
"You know, I was, I was wondering just on the Houston Electric rate case ﬁling, appreciate the color there. And just wondering if you could dig a little more into, have there been any changes in your expect, expectations in terms of the size of the revenue requirement ask. Does it gives you an opportunity to capture any kind of chunkier capital projects that might have been, you know, completed in the fourth quarter this year or any O&M savings, things like that as you head into that second-quarter timing.","Yeah, David. I appreciate the question, and the short answer is no, I don't think the extension was for that reason. Really with the fact we have now two, the opportunity for two DCRFs and two TCOS a year, the rate case at Houston Electric largely becomes a rate case that centers around cost-of-capital around depreciation rates at any diﬀered regulatory assets and liabilities. You know, as I mentioned, we have the opportunity to seek recovery of capital that we're spending now and through the fourth quarter up until the time we ﬁle that rate case through the DCRF and TCOS mechanisms. And so, I wouldn't really look at this extension as opportunity for us to address any capital, is going to be a case that involves revolves around cost-of-capital O&M and regulatory assets.  And back to sort of the ﬁrst part of your question, no, there is no fundamental change, I think we're looking at the potential for a small revenue decline, you know, potentially ﬂat revenue increase. When we -- I've been clear that we're going to advocate for a higher cost of capital, but as we forecast what that calendar year test year is going to look like, we have reduced O&M more than the increases that we would propose from a cost of capital. So I think that should put us in a standpoint of ﬁling for a revenue requirement. Again, relatively ﬂat, potentially modest decrease as we've communicated in the past."
"Okay, great, thanks, that's helpful. And maybe just on the ﬂoating rate debt that the $1.8 billion you still get out there, do you plan to continue to reduce that and term it out going forward, or is the level it's at now the comfortable balance overall, as you think about capitalization?","Sure, David. I think ﬁrst of all. I got to give some credit to the team for working down even what we walked into this year was 27% ﬂoating rate debt as a percent of the total, we're now at about 10%. So really good progress there. As we look at near-term ﬁnancing, even looking into earlier next year, just as an example for what we think, you know, how we think this is manageable, we're looking at roughly $700 million at CNP. And just to give you a feel for that, that component of our outstanding ﬂoating rate already sits at 5.8%. And so as you can imagine, given where things are right now, we think it's pretty manageable, in fact, you know, we might be opportunistic in going after that relatively soon.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So just give you an example of where you looking here and then laid out kind of the next couple of years for you, in terms of what's in front of us and think it's manageable at this stage, even with the longer for higher kind of macro theme that's going on right now.     Okay, before we go oﬀ the call, I would just want to thank all of our shareholders and analysts that are on the call that have believed in me and our story, and just stick with us because the best is yet to come. Thank you.  Operator  And we now --     Thank you operator.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation.
