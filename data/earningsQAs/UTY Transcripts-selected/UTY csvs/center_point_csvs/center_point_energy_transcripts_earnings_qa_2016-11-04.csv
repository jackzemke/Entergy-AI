Question,Answer
"Hey. Good morning, guys, it's actually Durgesh on for Greg. Can you hear me?","Yes. Good morning, Greg, we can here you."
"Hey. Good morning. So just, the question was related to...",
"Yes, actually I'm here Durgesh. I've got it. Thanks. Sorry.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So our question is, given the signiﬁcant improvement in the outlook at Enable, why are you not reassessing sort of the consolidated 4% to 6% growth rate in the context of a sort of a no transaction scenario? I mean, it seems that your expectations that underpin 4% to 6% would be a scenario where Enable would be sort of range bound in terms of its earnings and cash ﬂow contribution, and it appears that there are poised to see signiﬁcant potential growth in earnings and distributions.","Yeah. Greg, I would say the answer to this is more of a timing issue than anything. We are going through now the process of ﬁnalizing our own plan for the utilities, as we speak. Our Board approves our ﬁnancial plan in December as we get near the end of the year. Our time for providing updated forecast will be at our fourth quarter call, but I think your observations are valid certainly and what we've seen from Enable as well as the work we're doing with our utilities will be reﬂective in the new guidance that we provide on the fourth quarter call."
Thank you very much. Have a great day.,Yeah.  Operator  The next question will come from Insoo Kim with RBC Capital.
"Hey. Good morning, everyone.",Good morning.
"Just ﬁrst, given you comment on the spin option, are you currently awaiting a response from the IRS? And if so, do you have any expectation on the timeframe as to whether you will get a conﬁrmation that will be a largely tax free transaction?","Insoo, good morning, its Bill. We have not shared whether or not we have ﬁled or will ﬁle with the IRS. What we have shared in my comments in the call is, we must conﬁrm that we have minimal tax leakage associated with a spin should we continue down that path.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Understood. And then the third option of keeping Enable – and I think you've mentioned reducing the volatility associated with that, does that – would that just involve Enable or working with Enable to increase their fee-based contract structures?","Yeah. It is working with Enable. The dialog between governance and management is a constructive one and management's focused on this is, as evidenced by the renegotiation of some contracts that they've been working on to accomplish that. So that comment about trying to reduce commodity exposure is with what management will do at Enable."
"Understood. And ﬁnally, just regarding the Atmos Energy Marketing acquisition. Is the strategy for the Energy Services business to continue to make ongoing acquisitions to grow that business?","Yeah. Let me characterize the strategy this way, we see it as an important part of our business mix. It's a great complement to our gas utilities, and we continue to – we will continue to look for opportunities organically through the management team for growing that business just as we're growing our Utilities. I would characterize any thoughts around M&A as opportunistic as oppose to a stated strategy in that direction. Our goal, though, is to continue to grow that business just as we're growing our Utilities."
Got it. Thank you. And I'll see you in a few days.,Yeah.  Operator  The next question is from Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank.
Good morning.,CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning.
Is your new 2016 guidance – is that the new base for the 46% growth from here?,"Yes, it is."
Okay. And can you comment a little bit more on the dividend growth? I heard you mentioned the goal to decrease the payout ratio. Is there any targets for dividend growth from here?,"There are no speciﬁc targets with respect to dividend growth. And, of course, at the end of the day, it's Board of Directors' responsibility to review a number of factors prior to their declaration of a dividend. Having said that, we do intend to grow the dividend, it just may not be at the same robust pace of our earnings growth. And this will allow us to grow the dividend and bring down the payout ratio at the same time."
"Right. Okay, that's it.  Operator  The next question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust.",
Thank you. Good morning.,Good morning.
"Scott, I just wanted to clarify, in the past you had mentioned that your plans for what you want to do with Enable, you'd ﬁrm them up and communicate to us in the second half of this year. Am I hearing it right that the time may slip given some of these things playing out and maybe it's more early next year we will hear from you, or is it still by the end of this year we should deﬁnitely hear from you?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yeah. Ali, as Bill said, the process is taking a little bit longer than originally anticipated. I can't tell you when the process will speciﬁcally end. As Bill said, we still are in conversations with third parties. And should those dialogs continue past the end of the year, then I guess, it's technically possible that it goes on into the following year. But as long as, we're having these dialogs, the process will continue."
"I see. And second question, just so that we're clear on the conversion from the Enable numbers to yours, I know, there's basis diﬀerential, et cetera. But if you just took their 2017 net income guidance. What is that translate into for CenterPoint, just taking their numbers as they publically stated those?","Ali, this is Bill. They conﬁrmed that, you know, around the midpoint of their guidance, and that number would translate into $0.21 per share for us on an annual basis plus another $0.07 due to the accretion for a total of $0.28. That's why in our prepared remarks, we said, we should be at the high-end of the guidance that we have provided."
"Right. But they've also put out their 2017 net income number as well, I was more focused on that?","So they've put out their 2017 net income number. We have not translated what that might mean into earnings per unit, and from that, earnings per share of CenterPoint."
"Okay, but the basis diﬀerential, well, we should assume is roughly the same as it is for 2016?",That will be unchanged.
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   The next question will come from Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.",
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Neel."
"How do we look at the sale option for Enable after the 120-day period has passed since you rejected OGE or its partner's oﬀer. At that point, would you preclude the option of the sale or would you restart the process and how would that work?","Neel, good morning. It's Bill. I think to be clear, we haven't commented on OG&E's oﬀer. What we said in our prepared remarks is we remain in discussions with other parties and should those discussions continue past mid January then for our partnership agreement we would need to give OG&E another right of ﬁrst oﬀer or ROFO."
"Got it. Okay. And, you know it seems like you're evaluating the possibility of a spend more. And it seems you're getting a little bit more comfortable with that, if I'm reading right. How do you consider the possibility of that trading as a standalone C corp versus the MLP aspects that OGE and the public cloud would own?","All right. So, when we announced the strategic review process, we said we would be on concurrent paths of thinking about either a sale or a spend. So, I wouldn't want to imply that we're weighing one or of those more heavily than the other. We are attentive to what I refer to as capital markets considerations, including where -- how that C corp would trade and how portfolios mangers would think of it as a security."
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  The next question will come from Nick Raza with Citigroup.,
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you, guys. Just a couple of quick clean up questions on the Atmos acquisition. Are we to assume that it's a similar multiple as the prior acquisition of the Continuum acquisition?","So, when we take a look at the internal rate of return, and the return on equity from the total investment..."
Okay.,"...so that's why we evaluate them. With respect to a multiple we haven't disclosed that, but it's $40 million for their business plus working capital."
"Okay. And then in terms of just coming back to your response on Enable about managing the commodity volatility, and sort of working with Enable to essentially to ﬁx some other contracts, is there sort of an appetite to get rid of some of that volatility by doing more preferred issuances?","Well, I think that's probably a question better set for Enable than for us. Are you asking about it from our perspective?"
Yes.,Yeah. We – our – the preferred investment we made was essentially taking an amount of money that we had invested as debt and investing it as preferred at a time when that would helpful for Enable. Our stated objective as we have stated for quite some time is that we see Enable as a source of cash rather than a use of cash and I think that general theme still holds.
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.  Operator  The next question will come from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),
"Hi. Good morning. Tracy, I didn't, unless I missed it, I didn't hear you mention Right-of-Way revenue which is always a nice little earnings stream in your segment. Can you like update that?","Good morning, Charles. We anticipate for 2016 that our miscellaneous revenue including Right- of-Way will be in the range of $10 million."
"Okay. So, it's continuing to have that lower trajectory, as you stated in the past, correct?",That's correct.
"Okay. And then the second question I had on the Atmos acquisition, I assume just because Atmos is based up in Dallas, that maybe their concentration of customers was heavier in the Dallas and North Texas area than your existing business, is that what made it such a good ﬁt?","This is Joe. Actually, they are based in Houston for this business and they have two primary oﬃces: Houston, Texas and Franklin, Tennessee. So we have some overlapping service territories, but in this acquisition we would pick up six additional states with new customers and they have a pretty heavy concentration in the Tennessee, Kentucky area. So, that's a nice complement to our existing portfolio."
"So, it's almost non-Texas stuﬀ that maybe was the beneﬁt on this?","That's clearly part of it, yes."
Okay. Thank you. That's all I had.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you for your corporation. The next question will come from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research.,
"Thank you. On the acquisition, could you talk about the diﬀerences in margin, unit margins between your existing retail business and the Atmos acquisition?","This is Joe again. We don't give comments on unit margins by type of customer, but I will say that they deﬁnitely have a bigger mix of industrial, large industrial customers. So almost 400 Bcf of throughput on approximately 1,000 customers. So that's a much higher use customers than we currently have in our portfolio. So we actually like that aspect of it, but we don't comment on speciﬁc unit margins by customer type."
"Okay. Then given your comment just now, is there a preference of which way CenterPoint is leaning more towards the small commercial and residential or to the larger customers?","We like the addition that this gives us but we'll concentrate on all of our customer segments and make sure we provide them with great service, but we think this complements our portfolio nicely and it gets us into, as I mentioned earlier, some additional markets where we didn't have a presence."
"Got it. And one follow up on Enable. What is the point of trying to convert, and I'm not saying one is better than the other, but trying to convert a racehorse into a farm horse when you're talking about pulling back on the commodity volatility, maybe the whole point of owning something like an Enable is to gain that upside into commodities?","Well, I think the way to think about it is there is a – the actions we were talking about earlier about reducing volatility have to do with the structure of the contract, not the pace at which Enable may pursue opportunities and grow. So, it has to do with reducing volatility, not taking away from the growth possibilities of that segment."
I think I understand. Okay. Thank you very much.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   The ﬁnal question will come from Noah Hauser.,
"Hi. Thanks, guys.",Good morning.
"During the September conference season, you gave some drivers of 2017 for our utility net income. Are those drivers still intact or how should we be thinking about that now?","Noah, this is Bill. Those drivers are intact, and we will be updating all of that in our year end conference call after we have a board approval for our budgets and our capital expenditures for the 2017 year."
"Is there anything else aside from the MS acquisition that would presumably be additive to that, or is there anything else we should be focused on that could have changed?",I would say only on the margin.
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you, everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We look forward to seeing you at EEI. We will now conclude our third quarter 2016 earnings call. And have a nice day.
