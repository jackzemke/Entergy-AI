Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Jason, maybe a little bit of a tough question to answer, but I guess, how do you see the commentary that we've all been listening to from customers, legislators, and kind of stakeholders impacting the current settlement negotiations in the Houston Electric rate case?","Yes, thanks for the question, Shar. Clearly, as I've said in a number of diﬀerent forums, we can and will be better. These are important issues for the Greater Houston region for Texas. Ultimately, though, the answer for getting better is continued investment in resiliency of our system. And I think that needs to or will be reﬂected in the continued negotiations that are occurring from a settlement standpoint. And so there's again clear demand that we need to communicate better, that we need to mitigate the risk of these outages moving forward. And I think ongoing settlement discussions are all just part of putting the company in a position to continue to be able to make that progress."
"Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, obviously, Hurricane Beryl certainly highlighted more work needs to be done, and you had a level of resiliency spending bucketed as upside to the $44.5 billion CapEx plan. I guess, how do the recent events impact that bucket even directionally? So how fast do you plan to ramp up in light of the increased urgency with the current regulatory construct that's out there? Thanks.","Yes. I think it's deﬁnitely an area of focus. We were investing in resiliency prior to that resiliency legislation. I think we heard loud and clear at the PUCT meeting last week that we need to continue to move forward. We've made commitments to move forward. And so, ultimately, while we've pulled down the system resiliency plan, working with outside experts, taking feedback, we'll obviously work with parties in the case. We plan to rapidly reﬁle it.  And I think the short of it means there's probably more support for incremental resiliency investments. I'll give you one example. In the ﬁling, we proposed continued sectionalization of our system, which is an important part of isolating outages, helping minimize the overall number. We proposed a pace of about 20 years in that program. I think that's a program that we need to revisit. I don't think the 20-year pace is that -- is no longer kind of a pace that folks expect of us, right? And so, if anything, I think the bias will be towards accelerating incremental resiliency investment as opposed to delaying it."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. Okay. Appreciate it. I'll pass it to someone else. Thank you, guys.  Operator  One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.",
Yes. Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Steve."
"Good morning. So just on the, I guess, ﬁrst a question on the ﬁnancing plan, the comment on the equity content in the upcoming reﬁnancing. Should we assume that's more like a junior subordinated, or could that be like a convertible? Any more color on the likely type of ﬁnancing there?","Good morning, Steve. It is fair to say that we're certainly looking at diﬀerent versions of hybrids to pull in more equity content into the plan. And as I mentioned this morning, the other piece is just to pull forward $250 million. Again, to be clear, that doesn't change the overall guide from 2024 to 2030 of the $1.75 billion total. It's just a pull forward of that piece. And as you can imagine, the point there is to just be able to have that in place to comfortably position the balance sheet until we get the anticipated securitization proceeds. Currently thinking those are probably going to be end of year next year."
Okay. And then maybe you could just give us some color on how the rating agencies are reacting to this event and spend and your updated plan. And kind of it's going to be a little while before we know and see the securitization. So just thoughts on kind of their willingness to be patient.,"Sure thing. I think it's fair to say we're having a conversation, Steve, obviously, about both, how we're thinking about the plan that Jason has referenced, where we're going to aggressively move forward here in 2024 to do some critical work in the immediate sense.  Longer-term, we're also talking about some initial thinking on moving forward, ideally in Q1 with a subsequent revised system resiliency plan ﬁling. I think that in this case, Texas has had a   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   consistent construct in the state for utilities to securitize costs above the $100 million point. Certainly, that's the case here. And so we're sharing certainly that history and consistent history of the state as well in terms of its overall construct. So fairly ﬂuid conversations as you can imagine, just given how quickly we're moving on a few fronts, but certainly sharing all of our diﬀerent activities."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan Securities. Your line is open."
Hi. Good morning.,"Morning, Jeremy."
"I wanted to pick up on the storm commentary. Thank you for the details today. Just pulling it all together, looking at your post-hurricane action plan in the items you laid out here, how do you feel about, I guess, how Houston Electric can respond to the next storm out there? Do you think you have the pieces in place now to see a better response, even if everything's not in place altogether? Just wondering how you guys think you stand now.","Yes, no, thanks for the question. I do feel conﬁdent. As I mentioned yesterday in the Senate hearing, it oﬀers no relief to the customers impacted by Beryl. We were moving with pace and urgency after the derecho to move to a fully scalable outage tracker platform that would oﬀer estimated times of restoration consistent with industry-leading practices and had begun the work to overhaul our communications. That's why I feel conﬁdent that if a named storm threatens the Texas Gulf Coast region, we'll be in a much better position to communicate before, during and after that storm. I think giving our customers the information they unfortunately lacked during Hurricane Beryl. But it's that work that we've been doing in advance that I think helps on the communication front.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   And then equally, it oﬀers no relief to the customers that experienced this pain during Beryl. But we had been working on bringing a lot of the innovative predictive modeling to target enhanced vegetation management and resiliency investments for work. And that's why I'm conﬁdent that as we execute on the incremental resiliency commitments that we've made to Governor Abbott and others, it will have a meaningful impact for our communities. And so the last month has been tough on the City of Houston. We understand the role we play, but that's also why I have conﬁdence looking forward."
"Got it. Thank you for that. And then just to follow-up here, you mentioned that 60% of the downfall came from outside of your right of ways. What can you do about that going forward? And also, I guess, just the assets overall, how did the hardened assets perform during the hurricane? Just want to see what value you think has been delivered with kind of prior hardening here.","Yes. It's again oﬀers no relief to the customers, but we are seeing a value of resiliency investments. We saw very minimal structural damage on our transmission system substations. And strategically, it makes sense to put the ﬁrst investments in the backbone in the system from a resiliency standpoint. We've begun some of the incremental sectionalization work and hardening of distribution circuits, and that work saved over 150,000 outages in the communities that we deployed that.  And so I think moving forward from a resiliency standpoint, it's the acceleration of that work on the distribution grid that will have kind of the most meaningful impact to minimizing outages going forward. The key issue, though, at the end of the day was generally there was little structural damage on the system. It was less -- well, less than even 0.5% of our poles failed, but what really caused the outages were, as you pointed out, 60% of the trees impacting our lines were outside of our right of way.  And candidly, we don't have any authority today to trim and manage those trees. We are doing the work to identify the trees that create those hazards. We are proactively trying to work with property owners to access that property and address those trees which are a safety issue, obviously, for the residential homeowner, as an example. Tree could easily, just as easily, fall into their home as it could into the power line. But we don't have authority today unless granted by the homeowner. And so looking to work with community leaders, our regulators, elected oﬃcials, to make sure that we can continue to work at pace to address this vegetation that threatens our system moving forward."
Got it. Thank you for that.  Operator  And our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions this morning and I appreciate all the detail.","Good Morning, Nick."
"Morning. Just wanted to follow-up as we kind of contemplate pulling forward some of this equity into from '25 into '24, and then you also talked about doing this equity content ﬁnancing as well. I know you talked about some kind of one-time issues in the trailing 12-month FFO to debt. Where do you think you kind of end at the base year just based on the current plan today?","Sure. Good morning. I think if you saw us report this morning, as you can imagine, some of this is just the diﬀering methodologies. But from this standpoint, in the S&P methodology, there's the assumption that these securitization proceeds do come through, which moves us up to well above the downgrade threshold, up to 12.9%. At Moody's, they treat it slightly diﬀerently, so it takes us from that roughly 14% to 13.3% where we are this morning.  I do have to emphasize, though, Nick, keep in mind that last year, this was the same situation. This is a bit of the trough that occurs in Q2, before we pick back up, and we've got a one-time item that we believe in Q3, that you'll be able to see come through, further improving FFO to debt. Hard for me to be speciﬁc about year-end, but just you can imagine where we are at this point, is it's really a transitory impact here of the time period that will pass between now and the securitization proceeds."
"Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just you spoke about kind of doubling some of the labor eﬀorts around the tree trimming. Just can you remind us, because you do have this 1% to 2%, I think, it's an O&M reduction forecast in the long-term plan, does that need to be kind of reassessed? Can you kind of execute on that, even net of these veg management increases? And just how do we kind of think about that? Does that stuﬀ get deferred? I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Thanks for the question, Nick. I think we continue to see opportunity to drive eﬃciency in our O&M practices to help support that overall 1% to 2% reduction in O&M. We continue to highlight, as we have in the past, a classic example of that is the beneﬁt of deploying smart -- the next-generation of smarter meters on the gas side.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So we see plenty of opportunity to continue to be eﬃcient, which is, I think, obviously in our customers' interest, but also helps free up some opportunity to accelerate in other areas. And as I highlighted, we increased proactively our vegetation management over 30% last year in 2023, and we still achieve that 1% to 2% reduction year-over-year in '23. We will always make the investment that's needed to drive an improvement in service, but I still feel like we've got a number of opportunities across the full scope of the company's operations to achieve on a consolidated basis that 1% to 2% O&M reduction."
That's helpful. Thanks so much.  Operator  And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is open.,
"Hey, team. Good morning. Thank you for giving me time. Just I think, Chris, you mentioned 2% bill increase from the securitization of the distribution spending. I had two questions related to that. First, the conﬁdence level in $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, I guess where I'm getting at with that is, have you basically taken a deep dive into costs or are still incurring costs and the number could be signiﬁcantly higher? That's one. And second, what that 2% is over -- you're assuming, I guess, cost recovery over a timeframe, over multiple years. Maybe just if you could elaborate on that, please. Thank you.","Sure thing. Happy to. Good morning, Durgesh. I think there's really two pieces there. I think the ﬁrst is, I'll hit the second one ﬁrst in terms of timeframe. At this stage, we would be compiling the costs. The thing to keep in mind is that the existing construct in the state does allow for the entity to combine events that occur, including multiple events over a calendar year, into one securitization. So again, we would seek to ﬁle that and ultimately assume in this situation end of year 2025 timeframe for recoveries there.  As it relates to the overall kind of proﬁle itself, the thing to keep in mind here is that we do already have a good feel of the asset-based costs associated with both the derecho and Hurricane Beryl. The primary driver beyond that is most commonly the labor costs, right? The costs associated with nearly 15,000 individuals that were doing work on our system. And so we do have a pretty good feel of how those are forecasted at this stage, which informs the disclosure this morning at the high-end of $1.8 billion. So again, it's going to be a somewhat similar proﬁle, just given the crews and the associated contracts are very similar as to what we saw in the situation with the derecho, and we're well over 75% of those costs already in. So it gives us conﬁdence to inform the proﬁle that you see today."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Excellent. Thank you. Just one quick clariﬁcation, Chris. The 2%, I think you mentioned the 2% impact on customer bills. I guess where I was going with the timeframe is that assumes that $1.8 billion is collected over how many years?","Sure. Traditionally in the statutory requirement in Texas, it's 15 years."
Thank you. I appreciate the time.,Sure thing.  Operator  Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
"Oh, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Good morning, David."
Morning. I'm wondering if you might be able to comment on the legislative outlook from here. I'm curious if there are legislative initiatives that you might pursue or support. Just any ideas that are maybe being explored by lawmakers in the state to help improve resiliency?,"Yes. I mean, a couple of the topics that have come up early on are sort of consistent with my previous discussion around vegetation management. Is there -- I think the question is, does the state of Texas, do we need to do something diﬀerent to be able to attack these hazard trees that are outside of right of ways and do so in a manner that is obviously constructive with property owners? I think that's obviously a place to look.  The other thing that's come up is sort of the unique aspect of the market here in Texas, the fact that we have a service relationship with customers, but not a commercial relationship. It's, at the end of the day, inexcusable that we don't have customer contact information at each address since we have that service-related responsibility. And there may be something around that as well. Clearly, yesterday, there was a lot of feedback on mobile generation.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Right now, we want to be constructive with the policy objectives of the state. As I mentioned in the Senate hearing, we have an order by the PUCT that we cannot allow a customer to go more than 12 hours without power in a load shed event. Those assets are necessary to comply with that order. But if policy makers want to change that direction, obviously, we will work to support the policy direction of the state. So there's a lot of diﬀerent things being discussed now, and I think that they will come into greater focus as we approach the end of the year and obviously the start of the legislative session next year."
"Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe, Chris, just wondering if you might be able to clarify, is there a target for when you would expect to get back the FFO to debt level? You would expect to get back into the target range and get above 14%, for example, at Moody's?","Sure thing. I think -- sure, David. I think what you'll see there, naturally, is that you'll have the adjustment upward from S&P that will take place, and then Moody's does so upon receipt of proceeds again. So you'd be looking at roughly Q4 of next year in this timeframe."
Okay. Understood. Thanks so much.  Operator  And the next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jeﬀeries. Your line is open.,
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you, guys, for the time. I hope you guys are hanging in there. Just maybe on the puts and takes. Obviously, you talked about some of the accelerated equity here on '24. Just can we talk a little bit about your thoughts on the positive oﬀsets here to the pressure points, whether it's additional OpEx in the form of these storms, to the extent to which realized, the extent to which that there's any realized interest expense, or ultimately just lost sales. How do you think about the good guys and bad guys in the oﬀset there to maintain the outlook here in the very near-term?","Oh, sure thing, Julien. In the very near-term, as you can imagine, right, there was a usage impact associated with the storm itself. We also had a situation where we were having to adjust work temporarily as it related to the literal storm response and restoration. But ultimately, as we're looking through the remainder of the year, as you saw, we reaﬃrmed this morning, gives us conﬁdence that we've got both two things going on.  One, the ability for the mutual aid and other crews who joined our colleagues to really eﬀectively work to restore customers quickly. But also, as I mentioned, we have been able to   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   retain conﬁdence in achieving the base CapEx plan as well. So net of the diﬀerent factors, including interest expense, we're conﬁdent that we're still able to reaﬃrm this morning."
"All right. Fair enough. And then just coming back to the mobile gen, I mean, that's been getting a certain amount of attention here, and obviously, perhaps they were contemplated for a slightly diﬀerent circumstance. How do you think about developing a more reﬁned program here to target more of these localized, distribution-related outages with the vegetation management issues that you've encountered here? And ultimately, how does this work in, because of which you evaluate this or otherwise into a revised timeline on the resiliency ﬁling here? I know that there's various permutations there as well.","Yes. I mean, I strongly believe we have the most comprehensive mobile gen program consistent with what has been asked of us by the state and its policy objectives. The legislation was passed in 2021, and there was a focus on load shed events. Those are sort of larger units tied to substations. And as I mentioned yesterday, there's been 115 instances since that legislation started to be discussed where there were tight system conditions on our cotton. Those systems -- those units may be utilized.  We had also utilized in 2021 one of the medium-sized units for storm restoration and got a signiﬁcant amount of pushback. And I think the legislature clariﬁed that in 2023. And as soon as we got that clariﬁcation in the fall of 2023, we increased the number of small units. And so I'm proud that we were able to scale to 18 small units out of a total of 30. The other 12 we borrowed from our utility peers to be part of the storm response.  And so, as I said yesterday, we manage a number of diﬀerent risks, whether those are load shed events or storm response, we've got a portfolio of assets to kind of meet those needs. Now, obviously, as I said, if the policy objectives of the state change, we will change with them. But I think today we are maintaining a diversiﬁed portfolio for the diversiﬁed set of risks that we manage.     Operator, I think we're going to have time for one more question.  Operator  Okay. And our last question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Your line is now open."
"Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Just two quick ones. I'm not sure if one was answered. If I look on Slide 3 and the plan and everything else, if I remember correctly, your system resiliency plan was between $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion. $2.2 billion was the base case.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Can what's on Slide 3 be accomplished? Is it $2.7 billion number or that would be above the $2.7 billion number?","Anthony, morning. I would thinking about it within the $2.7 billion. Keep in mind that we provide that higher-end as an articulation of the ability to accelerate some work. And that's really what you're seeing here is a pretty aggressive acceleration here in 2024 to make sure we're doing more work on the system."
"Great. And then follow-up to an earlier question. You guys identiﬁed a lot of the outages occurred due to, I think, trees that are on customer's property. You guys didn't really have any responsibility over it. I mean, does undergrounding become more of a solution in your service territory than maybe years past?","Yes. Thanks, Anthony. It's a great question. I think one where there's certainly going to be a greater push for undergrounding, and it will play probably an even more prominent role in our resiliency eﬀorts going forward. But what I think is important as well is to kind of balance it. About 60% of our customers today receive service through underground lines. It's a pretty signiﬁcant penetration of undergrounding already in the system. But the point of weakness is those communities are often fed with overhead lines kind of at the feeder level. That's where we saw the tree damage.  And so I think we have to ﬁnd a balance between undergrounding where it makes sense, and where we have overhead lines making sure that they are hardened and more resilient, so that they're not the single point of failure, so to speak, from an outage standpoint. So it's a little bit of an all of the above, but I would imagine that undergrounding takes an even greater prominence moving forward."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.,"Thanks, Anthony.     Great. Operator, with that, that will now conclude our Q&A for the day. I appreciate everyone dialing in. I think with that, we'll conclude the call.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   This concludes CenterPoint Energy's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call.
