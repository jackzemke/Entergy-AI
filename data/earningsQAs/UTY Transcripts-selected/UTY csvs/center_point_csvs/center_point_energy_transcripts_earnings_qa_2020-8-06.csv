Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"So congrats on the quarter, I mean, obviously you pushed the COVID assumptions out to year end and still reiterated the '20 guide and your 5% to 7% trajectory. So you have an Indiana IRP proposal which looks to generate a meaningful increase versus the prior iteration. Can we talk about sort of the CapEx updates and mainly focusing on the moving pieces for '21 to '24 and it's a solid plan. So what could provide upside to this as we think about further capital growth opportunities that could maybe be accretive to your 5% to 7%? And have a follow-up on strategy.","Sure. Well, thanks for the compliment. I appreciate it. I want to congratulate our team for the quarter, they did a great job. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have lots of upside beyond   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   the capital plan that we have out there right now. If you look at the organic growth in Texas, you look at opportunities we have in Minnesota, you look at the IRP plant in Indiana that to me is why making sure that we're doing proper capital allocation is so important because we have the luxury of having more opportunities in front of us than, at this point, we can fund, and therefore we have to ﬁgure out a way to eﬃciently fund them and be able to drive continued growth and at some point in time, obviously, as we said in the call would like to up our growth projections going forward and that's what we would anticipate to do."
"Great. That's great. And that sort of just touched on the fundamentals remain really strong. And just kind of sort of two small parts strategic question here if I may. Dave in you're prepared remarks you mentioned quarter-on-quarter nothing is oﬀ the table, which is a bit of a widening of the language from prior management's comments. So are you saying that BREC could also be looking at corporate M&A opportunities versus a standalone initiative? Then just have a quick follow-up to that.","Shar, just as a reminder, we're going to not hit any BREC questions today, just since we have that ongoing and we'll certainly update folks when we have updates on that."
"Got it. And then the only other thing also Dave you talked a little bit about simplifying the story that you have there with CenterPoint and there is obviously, Indiana and Texas you've highlighted its core to the company, and you do sort of have some smaller jurisdictions, potentially nonadjacent jurisdictions. It's about 23% of your rate base is in other states with LDCs. Is that potentially also an opportunity? Do you consider potentially monetizing LDCs capturing pretty healthy multiples as a potential avenue to streamline or simplify your story, recycle capital and maybe strengthen your balance sheet even further outside of your core Indiana, Texas?","Yeah. I mean, let me just comment in this way. I mean, I've covered a lot of territory in my ﬁrst 30 days, but I haven't covered all the ground we have in the organization. So, let me defer oﬀ to probably the next quarter call to address some of those related topics. When we say simplify the story is as I sort of look back at how we've communicated with shareholders over the past several years, we really have not had a consistent message, we've had a relatively complicated story, we've had a lot of M&A, we've had regulated versus non-regulated, we've had the MLP to deal with. And so, I do believe that a simple message to shareholders consistently executed quarter after quarter will I think help regain conﬁdence that shareholders have in us as a management team and our ability to not only maintain, but grow our future revenue and return stream. And so I guess at the end of the day, give me some time. 30 days is not enough time to give you a complete answer, but we're deﬁnitely headed in that direction."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Well, congrats Dave on your ﬁrst-ever utility earnings call. Congratulations.","Thank you.  Operator  Your next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.     Good morning, Steve."
"Hey. Good morning, Dave. That that was a hell of a lot you've done in 30 days.",(Inaudible)
"Appreciate that. So, two questions. First, on your Point 8, the optimized ﬁnancials, you went through that pretty quickly. And I think that's a pretty important point. So could you just maybe repeat or maybe give a little more color on your thoughts on that aspect of what you're looking at?","Yeah. I mean, what I said is basically, what you want to always do as a company is make sure you optimize your ﬁnancial ﬂexibility as an organization. COVID is a perfect example of why you can't predict the future. So if you can't predict the future, you need to be as ﬁnancially ﬂexible as you possibly can. And so focusing on our ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and then of course in our case that means looking at our balance sheet, looking at our borrowing capacity and then looking at our overall capital structure, where do you lodge your debt for instance. Do you put it at the parent, do you put it at the individual subsidiaries. You know that the ultimate goal, as I said is to basically have a long-term capital structure that allows us to grow the business beyond the 5% to 7% that we have out there. And that's an integral part of what we're studying right now and it's a process we're in the middle of and I don't want to sort of presuppose any outcome, which is really why we don't really want to talk about any more of the inner workings of the BREC at this point in time. Give it a chance to work. I think the BREC at is working really-really well, but we're really only at half time if you will in terms of what we're doing and what we're looking at. And just let me leave it at that."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. So, okay. It sounds like the growth opportunities are there, you just need to ﬁgure out how to fund them eﬃciently.","They are at there, absolutely there. Every time I see Kenny Mercado for instance who run our electric business. He has a sheet of paper he brings with him with all the extra areas that we could invest just in Houston Electric or Indiana."
"Got it. And then just one other question. This is maybe just a silly logistical question. But with the two people that you named to the enable board, like how do they communicate back to CenterPoint? What's going on with Enable? And just could you maybe give a little more color on just the information ﬂow and in the like there?",Sure. They are our representatives. They are not Independent Directors on Enable Board. They represent our interests and Enable. And just like when Kristie was on the Board she would talk to me about what was happening in Enable. They will be in constant communication with us as to their views of that organization.
"Okay, great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.",
"Thank you. Good morning. And congratulations, Dave. My ﬁrst question is on the cost structure and obviously that's part of the plan and you guys are assessing the overall strategy. But just in your ﬁrst 30 days as you look at the cost structure of CenterPoint and the diﬀerent parts and if you've had a chance to compare that data versus peers on the utility side on diﬀerent metrics, how does it compare and does that give you conﬁdence that there's a lot of low hanging fruit or runway of cost opportunities there?","Well, I mean, I think they're a number of ways for a company to get more eﬃcient. One is just sort of be Draconian[ph] and institute cost controls and cost management down. I think that if you look at our operating metrics as I indicated on the call, our O&M per customer, our O&M per this metric or that metric, our reliability standards are very, very good. So I think, you come away saying operationally our folks run a pretty eﬃcient business, but the reality is that any business can become more eﬃcient. And one of the things I have done as I mentioned in the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   call, not only have we trimmed back some of the more senior management in the organization, I have restructured where functions report within the organization to put them more adjacent to places they naturally should ﬁt. So customer service for instance, which is a very technology driven part of our business. I have put adjacent to the IT department for now, because I can -- I believe we can share set of cost, we can share some infrastructure, we can share some management across that. So I think one is just looking at the business diﬀerently. Two, is using technology a little bit more eﬃciently to help us continue to look at reducing our costs. And then the third is as I mentioned, just structurally looking at things like putting the electric businesses together under one management team and trying to harvest the sort of eﬃciencies you get there.  So again, I don't -- I'm not here to say I have all the answers. 30 days has come and gone very quickly. I'm still learning a lot about how we ﬁt together and are stitched together as an organization. But I've been in business a long time and I recognize that any company no matter where they are in their life cycle can always be more eﬃcient. And I just need to make sure that we're making prudent decisions around making us more eﬃcient and that's what we're doing."
"Yes. Deﬁnitely appreciate that. And I'm sorry for asking all these questions in a given it's only been 30 days. On the rate base growth opportunity on the regulated side. When you look at the electric businesses together and the gas side of things if -- and the potential upside they had that each of each of those businesses have, what -- do you see more upside to either of the businesses or are there just a lot in both?","No, I mean, I think that, it's really let's not let's not get totally focused on electric, yes, we have tons of upside in electric. We can take on more of the ownership on the renewable side in the IRP in Indiana. Renewables is a space that we need to learn to play in, not only does it bring some tax advantages but it really is the wave of the future. And so it's something that we need to learn how to do, because we really haven't tippy-toed into that area in the past. As I've said in my remarks, that Houston Electric is a crown jewel utility. I mean, it's in a market that has grown consistently for decades. As I said earlier, the guy who runs our Houston Electric business of carries around a list in his pocket of things he would like to invest in incremental to our $13 billion we have. But also, our gas business is good. And as I mentioned in the call, we can invest at or greater into that business for the next decade. And so, that to me is why it comes back to making sure we have an eﬃcient capital structure that allows us to take on those opportunities, grow the business beyond the 5% to 7% and do it in a way that doesn't dilute down our shareholders any more than you normally would have to, to grow the business."
Understood. Thank you so much for the color.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you for the --","Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, good morning, and congratulations. If I could follow back up just to clarify a little bit more on the ﬁnancial outlook and aspirations, just to clarify, again I hope I'm not intruding too much into the ground rules here, but with respect your answer to Steve. How are you thinking about the needs for capital raising, speciﬁcally equity over the forecast period as it stands today and has that changed at all? So want to make sure we're crystal clear about that. And then separately, what is the ultimate aspiration of this eﬀort, if it to become a fully regulated entity of some sort or is it to reﬁne and improve upon the EPS growth target? I feel at least the perception is that perhaps you said both things and through the course of this call. So just want to make sure we're clear on that as well if I can.","Yeah. Again, number one, we're reaﬃrming the 5% to 7% growth rate that we have out there. That is built around a $13 billion capital spend base. So, let use that as the base line if you will. My eﬀort and my goal and again, I don't have all the answers after 30 days, but if you look at developing the balance sheet ﬂexibility, you look at eﬃcient capital allocation process, you look at the opportunities we have in front of us, I believe that when we get through this process that we could look at increasing our growth rate. I'm not saying we're going to do it yet, I'm not declaring that today, what I'm saying is that's aspirational for us at this point in time and we have the biggest building block available to us to be able to do that, which is the capital opportunity that exists in our Texas businesses, our gas business, our Indiana businesses. So, unlike a lot of utilities that maybe have the capital available but not the opportunities. We have the opportunities available which many don't which is a really great place to start. And so that's what I'm trying to convey is our excitement around the opportunities. It's my job and the job of the management team now to ﬁgure out how do we get the balance sheet ﬂexibility to take advantage of those opportunities."
"Thanks. If I could follow up exactly along that line of thinking if you will. What is reﬂected in your outlook today with respect to Indiana and the IRP? And your conﬁdence on being able to self- build any opportunities that come out of that process speciﬁcally, and obviously, this is with the proposal now becoming a little bit clearer? And then related tied back to what you just said a second ago, isn't it typically bill headroom that sort of is the limiting factor? And how are you thinking about the O&M that is necessary to create the additional headroom to invest?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah, let me have Kristie -- let me have Kristie answer the front part of that and I'll try to come in and back clean up a little bit.     Yeah. Well, we had our best guess of what our capital would be in the -- capital plan that we had for Indiana think it was the over the ﬁrst years the total capital plan for Indiana was in the $300 million range going to $400 million, and like as Dave said where we hope to be able to do more than what is in that plan.     I think Julien what the way I think about it is that if you looked at sort of our initial view, we had an allocated amount of that $13 billion in capital to the plan in Indiana. As I look at the renewable opportunity with respect to that. Our initial view was that we would not take on much of that. I really want to revisit that because I think for two reasons. One, I think we need to be in the renewable space, we need to learn how to operate in that space and because of the tax -- basically the tax advantages of it, we ought to be in that space. And therefore, we're really right in the middle of us reassessing. What part of that plant and how much do we want to own, and how we might ﬁnd and seek partners for the rest of it."
It is not or isn't the plan. What was it -- just to make sure heard that is right.,So what was in the $13 billion -- I'm looking at Kristie now. What was in the $13 billion plan was about $300 million to $400 million for the IRP.
Okay. Thanks for all the color. Appreciate that.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.,
"Hi, good morning and Dave congratulations.",Thanks.
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Wanted to just ﬁrst talk about your dialogue with the rating agencies, and then thinking about the your credit statistics and the linkage to enable cash ﬂows and whether there's a possibility that over time your credit sets really can be dependent on your core utility businesses rather than sort of have a dependency or linkage to enable from a credit perspective. Would you mind just give me a general sense of where we are now and sort of what your objectives are there.","You actually just made my pitch in terms of what we want to do. Yes, we are engaged with the credit rating agencies. I've had a lot of experience with them over the years. I understand it's a matter of laying out a process and a path forward. I agree with you that in terms of the credit metrics that were held against today or potentially will be held against in the future, that's a dialogue we have to have with them. I think we have to demonstrate a path to growth which I think we're in as we've talked today, we're going to be able to do, reaﬃrm where our current commitments are which we are doing today. But then have a dialogue with them that doesn't in eﬀect penalize us for the cash ﬂow that we get oﬀ of Enable. And that's an ongoing dialogue and I hate to keep coming back to it, but give me more than 30 days to sort of get those conversations behind us, but they're top of mind at this point in time for sure."
"Yeah. I respect that. And then just wanted to go back to one of your the elements of the prepared response in terms of the benchmarking work that you had done. And I think you had mentioned brieﬂy that operationally very solid metrics, but you've mentioned the ﬁnancial metrics versus peers were less solid. I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about what ﬁnancial metrics you focused on in that in that benchmarking work?","I mean, basically, if you can name it we took a look at it. I mean, clearly, you look at PE. You look at discount to where we ought to be trading with the assets we have, with the growth potential we have, with our aﬃrmation of our earnings per share and the 5% to 7% CAGR that we put out there. But I think instead of all relative market valuation metrics, we lag behind. And I think, I understand why now, and a lot of it has to do with what I said in my remarks. In that, if you look at sort of the last year of history at CenterPoint, we've let our shareholders down. And it's my intent and my focus to turn that around. Again, I understand it isn't instantaneous. It's really a matter of engaging with our shareholders, listening to our shareholders, understanding what the individual shareholder may view as shortcoming in the organization. But as I said, as I've talked to people, I'm a very high touch individual as a CEO. I like engaging with shareholders. I like debating with shareholders. And so again, just give me a chance to get out there, get you an opportunity to know me better. And I think that we'll rebuild that conﬁdence."
"That's really helpful. If I could just -- one last question just on Renewables. It's obviously an exciting area of growth. I know it's early days, but just as you look at CenterPoint's capability with respect to Renewables and the capabilities needed versus peers versus more established players and clean energy. How do you sort of scope out the capabilities you have, additional   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   capabilities you might want? Or do you feel like you do have sort of what you need to be able to pursue Renewables in a cost-eﬀective way?","No, I mean, I think, I know we can ﬁnd the resource to pursue Renewables in a cost-eﬀective way. The question is going to be how much of that do you bring in-house and build that capability and how much do you hire? As consultants or do you seek partners on it? And I think we're early in that process. We've made the conclusion, we need to be bigger in Renewables. We have the perfect opportunity in front of us with the IRP plant in Indiana We know that in that plant we can get both into solar and to wind. And it really now is a matter of doing the calculation that optimizes what we want our participation to be there. But it is fair to say, we do not have much of that capability in-house at this point in time, but it is not such a scarce resource in the world that we can't go out and ﬁnd it. And as I said, the decision for us is going to be how much do we bring in-house and institutionalize, because we're going to be in this area for a long time. And how much do you use sort of the best assets and people in the industry to jump start you in this area and we're still going through that assessment. But, I'm conﬁdent, we'll hit the right balance."
It's great. Thank you so much.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.,Good morning.
"Hi, good morning. Maybe starting oﬀ at Indiana here. Just wondering if you could share any early feedback you've received on the IRP. Just want to get a feeling for how that's progressing?","Yeah, I think, we've been through start of the process of exposing it to the market. The response was very-very positive. You know clearly, there are the regulatory hoops that we have to jump through. And frankly, I don't have enough knowledge about how we would do that. We've got our Head of Regulatory Aﬀairs here, if you want to do a little bit deeper dive in terms of it. But I think it's got a lot of momentum behind it. I think the political process in Indiana, the political environment has positive. I think the reality is that you don't think of Indiana as a place that's got a lot of wind and a lot of solar opportunities, but it really does. And it's really wind in the north along the Great Lakes area and lots of sun in ability to build solar in the southern part. So I think the state is behind it because it sees an opportunity not only to develop the generation capability from Renewables, but to do it actually in Indiana which brings with it then the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   construction jobs, the O&M jobs and those kinds of things. So, I haven't really encountered any major opposition to it at this point in time, but it's still a bit early days. But we're optimistic at this point."
Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then may be turning over to COVID. Just want to dig in a little bit more there on the assumptions in the back half of the year and just kind of how you see -- how long the depressed demand would kind of continue and do you see it spilling into '21? Or just if you could give us a little bit more feeling for how you see that unfolding in your neck of the woods?,"Yeah. I'll let Kristie give you a little more granularity and then I'll sort of again come in and back clean up on the back end of the question.     So in our COVID-19 range -- the new range, we have assumed that the recovery would go out through the end of the year. And so in gradually improve from the second quarter as what the peak would be.     Yeah. I mean, I would just say, this is more anecdotally since I've moved back to Houston now. You see traﬃc starting to pick up a little bit. If -- your data points are how are you living your life everyday. I'm seeing more traﬃc on the roads. But I'm sitting here in downtown Houston right now and it's still a ghost town. And restaurants aren't open, the bars aren't open, and those are consumers of our products. And so as Kristie said if you look at where we've had demand destruction of you will, it's in sort of the light commercial, light industrial part of the business. So, I think that if anybody could predict sort of where COVID is going to go, they could make a lot of money betting in the stock market, that's not me. As I said earlier, we just have to make sure we have a company that's structured to be ﬂexible enough to handle anything that is thrown at us. And what we gave you is sort of our best guess of the impacts in the markets that we're in. And if you think back, our big markets are Minnesota, Indiana, Texas a little bit of Ohio and Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, each of those states is sort of approaching the reopening in a bit of a diﬀerent way. So we're giving you our best shot at it right now. Things might get better quicker. We might get shut down and we'll update you if we set a very oﬀ of the scenario that we laid out."
Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks.  Operator  Your next question will come from the line of Aga Zmigrodzka with UBS. .   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),Good morning.
"Good morning. Dave you met with Commissioners from diﬀerent jurisdictions and in Q&A, you mentioned potential for higher CapEx across electric and gas utilities. What is the potential for adding new or expanding regulatory mechanism to accelerate recovery of CapEx to reduce the regulatory lag? Is that something that we should expect?","Let me have Kristie answer that one. She's our resident expert on regulatory lag and basically getting our capital investment into our rate base as fast as we can.     Yeah, I mean, as you know, Houston Electric, we do have capital recovery mechanisms for both transmission and distribution capital. In the Texas Gas jurisdictions, we have capital recovery mechanisms as well. Our other jurisdictions besides Minnesota pretty much have well I would say, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Louisiana all have cost of service. So again fairly, quickly the capital is in the rates. In Indiana and Ohio, we also have capital recovery mechanisms. So it's really Minnesota and in Minnesota, we have interim rates and a rate case pretty much every couple of years to help reduce that regulatory lag. We actually think we are in good shape and as we increase this capital. We have the mechanisms."
"I have one follow-up question. Kristie you mentioned lower interest expenses are helping oﬀset higher COVID impacts. Do you expect that trend to continue? If yes, could you quantify how much interest expense are going to be down in 2020 versus 2019? Is that's tracking better than you previously expected?",Yeah. The interest is better than we had in our models for our plans. And let's see in the quarter interest was favorable $0.03 to last year.
Do you expect that to continue or?,"Yeah, I mean we do expect to see favorable interest going forward.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Perfect. Thank you for taking my questions and stay safe.,Thank you.  Operator  Our ﬁnal question will come from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hey, guys.",Good morning.
"David -- good morning. David, congratulations. Some investors have noted you're coming into the job after a long and distinguished career at Halliburton and you're 67 years old, I'm just wondering what your -- how long do you plan in staying at CenterPoint? Where do you see your career at this point as you take on this role?","Yeah, it's a good question. You know, I guess, I see myself as 67 going on 50. The reason I left Halliburton is Halliburton has a mandatory retirement age or frankly, I would still be there. I've got a lot of energy, I like being a CEO, I like being a leader. And to me, this was a perfect opportunity because of the great assets, the great jurisdictions, the great people that are here. So I have not set a timeline on my tenure here. I'll know it and Board will know it when the time is right to move on. But I think for right now I am totally committed, and as I said earlier, I've just moved back to Houston last weekend. And I am raring to go and as far as I'm concerned the sky's the limit at this point in my career."
Sounds good. Have you had a chance to meet with the regulators yet in Texas to talk about how the last rate case went and some of the criticisms that I think a lot of people had about that rate case and also maybe even meet with the Governor? Just wondering if?  (Multiple Speakers)   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Yeah, clearly I know the Governor. I know the Governor well from my days at Halliburton. So, having a meeting with the governor for me would be pretty easy to get. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, I've actually met with all three of the Public Utility Commissioners in Texas. I had a face-to-face sit down with the Chairman of the PUC in Texas. We did have a frank discussion and dialogue around the rate case and the outcome. But I think, it's really important to point one thing out in that even though there was a lot of noise there look around our rate case. If you look at the outcome that we got and the outcome that others have gotten since then, we were really the maybe the ﬁrst company up that was experiencing a bit of a policy change in and around the equity splits and the ROEs that we're going to be allowed to utilities in Texas. And so that was part of the dialogue that I've had with the commissioners. If you look at where we came out, we're pretty much in the middle of the more recent cases that have been adjudicated through the system in Texas. But that doesn't mean that we are not going to continue and I am not going to continue to have a dialogue. And it's important to have relationships with your regulators every place that you operate. They are in business to protect the consumers in their particular states, and it's our job to provide reliable gas and power to those consumers. So I don't necessarily see that has to be an adversarial relationship. It really needs to be a partnership, really pointed toward making sure that we're providing reliable power and gas to the consumers in the states where we operate."
"Great. Well, thank you very much and good luck, and godspeed.","Hey, thank you. Thanks, everyone.     Thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
