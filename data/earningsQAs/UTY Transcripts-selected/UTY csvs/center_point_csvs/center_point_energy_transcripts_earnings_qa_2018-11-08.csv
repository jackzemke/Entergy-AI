Question,Answer
"Hey, sorry about that. We are having an issue here. This is Anya [ph] on Julien's team. He is on mute at the moment. Can you hear me?","Yes, we can hear you."
"Sorry about that guys. Had a bit of a IT issue on our side (inaudible) Anyway, just wanted to follow-up you ﬁrst on the CapEx question if you can. You talk about 5% to 10%, what is above and beyond some of the transmission spending you all have talked about in terms of the initial plan here?","So Julien it's a -- the -- as you pointed out, the project we've already talked about, but it's a review of capital expenditure or capital plans with respect to what I would consider more normal business around maintenance and infrastructure replacement and growth. Those are the major themes that will impact the other elements of our capital plan in addition to the Freeport Master Plan."
"Got it. Excellent. And then, also wanted to follow-up a little bit here on the Enable side of the business, obviously we are seeing some reinvigorated investment opportunities here. Does that shifted all your longer-term thinking about Enable and certainly there's been a variety of diﬀerent elements including potentially greater cash ﬂow contributions here?","When you say reinvigorating, you're talking about the opportunities that Enable is seeing."
"Yeah, it was the organic opportunities, the acquisitive opportunities and then ultimately how that translates back into cash ﬂow, back into your pocket?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Look, I would characterize this as we are very pleased to see what Enable is doing. Their recent performance and how they are looking into 2019 based on the performance of their core business as well as these growth opportunities. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we have no need to sell any units over the coming 24 month period. That said, I think that if there were opportunities to opportunistically sell units down the road, we may take those opportunities, but we are certainly very pleased to see that Enable is performing well and they are being presented with these growth opportunities."
Excellent. And then just one last quick clariﬁcation. You talked about a 1Q close. Would you expect to provide an update proforma as soon as you close or are we going to be holding out to like a fuller update with 4Q?,"Well, you know we have to close before we really get access to the information and begin that process. So what we anticipate is, there will be a reasonable period of time between close and when we have our fourth quarter call which will give us time to prepare what you described.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse."
This is actually Khanh on for Michael.,"Hello, good morning."
"Hi. Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up quickly on the Vectren merger. So far the integration exercise -- the planning exercise that you've had, anything that would point to where you are in that range of $50 million to $100 million or are you in the position to share that at this point?","Yeah, we are not in a position to share other than say we are really in the middle of what I'll call the design phase, and given the targets that we have established for the team, our level of conﬁdence in that range is -- perhaps is good or stronger than it was when we shared that target earlier. So what we are doing is, we are seeing their work in line with what our expectations are. We'll be in a much better position to describe in some greater detail what we think that looks like when we -- after we merged and we have a chance to share that with you.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"That's great. So quickly on that too. So what kind of business outlook for the VISCO and VESCO at Vectren that you embedded in your 2020 guidance on slide 21. And given their results in the third quarter, how is your updated view on that business?","Yeah, we have not updated our view other than to believe that what we were using. As we initially described, our earnings potential in 2020 is still very appropriate. They just had their earnings call and shared their results and their performance was good and their backlog is good. So we continue to be very optimistic and believe that -- what we had in our -- the basis on which we built our estimates for 2020 so far is still very accurate.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank."
Good morning.,Good morning.
So just following up on the 2020 range. Why is it still so wide given the execution of the ﬁnancing and when might you update it or narrow it?,"Yeah, so we've obviously answered one of the variables on there, but we know as we are going through capital planning and we are thinking about other variables in there, we felt it is best to wait and do a single consolidated new view of 2020 after many of these other variables have been resolved. So you are right. We've taken one of the variables out, but there are other things that we want to be able to ﬁnalize before we revise or tighten that range.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JP Morgan."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning, Scott and Bill. I have a question on the 2020 guidance slide as well. I think I heard your comments in your prepared remarks on some of the moving pieces within there and your answers to some of the previous questions. But could you maybe walk us through how you can maintain that range, how you can still have conﬁdence there despite the higher equity layer embedded there versus your original estimate?","Chris, good morning, it's Bill. We shared with you on the slide and Scott shared with you in his remarks as well as mine, some of the impacts. You are correct and we've completed the equity ﬁnancing in both of the acquisition and as we look forward to greater rate base investment. But we have yet to complete our capital planning and we have yet to complete our views of the synergies and commercial opportunities associated with the pending merger of Vectren which should be on the top lines of that slide. And that's what we'll need to update and tighten the potential 2020 EPS guidance which we will provide for you at our year-end call.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust."
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. I had two unrelated questions. But ﬁrst oﬀ, with regards to Enable, from your commentary and the fact that you don't need as you said any proceeds for the next couple of years, is it fair to assume that your overall strategic thinking on Enable may have changed as well to the sense that, you are no longer a bit pushed to necessarily exit that business, but over time maybe if the opportunity is there could do that? That's question number one.  And question number two, could you also give us some -- as you look out longer term and as you are updating your CapEx. Can you just remind us, how you are thinking about the growth rate beyond 2020 as well? So two separate questions.","Ali, I'll start with a latter question, because I think that I can answer that one fairly quick. We have, as you know, we have not provided any guidance with respect to growth rate beyond 2020, because we get to the end of the year and we merge and we can go through a more integrated planning process, we will be in a position to determine when we are better suited to provide thinking beyond 2020. So that's the answer I would give to the second question.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Your ﬁrst question, I think was about Enable. And in there, you mentioned as our strategic interest in Enable changed. I would say no, it is not. We continue to believe that our objective here is to have less exposure to the Midstream segment. By virtue of this merger, we accomplished some of that. We have less percentage exposure to the Midstream segment. But we will continue to look for constructive opportunities to reduce our position over a longer period of time. We've said in the past that the considerations around monetization of that investment will be as market conditions allow and as we have the needs and the opportunity to redeploy that capital into other investments and those are going to be the drivers for us.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition."
Good morning. Can you just -- just for a little bit of -- can you just tell us exactly what assumptions have changed apart from the ﬁnancing assumptions since the guidance was given for 2020?,"So at this point, we haven't changed any of the assumptions relative to that. We've just addressed or now know what the outcome of the ﬁnancing is. We still have the Vectren forecast that we've been using all along, that's the information that we have. We do know that our forecast internally will change somewhat in part from the capital update that I described in my comments. So that would be a variable that would change."
"Okay. So that has not been input into that analysis yet, right? So --",That is correct.
Okay. Thank you so much. So kind of you.,You're welcome.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"Hey, guys. Just listening to a lot of the questions. It seems as if there is not a lot of focus on what looks like to be a really fast-growing utility you have known in Houston. So just curious, can you talk to us about your views for ﬁrst power demands growth, meaning how diﬀerent that your three quarters into the year? Do you think your weather normalized demand view is in Houston relative to what it was maybe at the beginning of the year or at the end of last year this time when you gave guidance? That's question one.  Question two, what do you see and I don't mean over the next couple of years with big transmission project, but I'm trying to think longer term. What do you think the opportunity set is and the size and scale is for distribution investment in Houston relative to the historical last ﬁve-year run rate?","Michael, good morning, it's Bill. I'll start with demand and then Scott I think will pick up with CapEx and talk about that. So I would begin the comment that we have now worked through most of Harvey with respect to residential housing consideration and residential housing consideration is translating and the meters has accelerated in the 12-month period, and it's September 30th relative to the 12-month period ended June 30th. You'll see, if you compare those ﬁgures, it was 1.5% for end of September 30th and 1.2% end of June 30th. So we are seeing meter count pick up again.  We've had a normal weather year. We've had a modest decline, meaning less than 1% in use per customer in a normal weather year. And if you'll look at our sales volumes, depending on the period that you want to use, it will be somewhere total increase of 2% to 4%. So industrial and large commercials load continues to be there. That all looks good in the service territory if you've been reading about various economic data and facts on Texas. We continue to add employment at a much faster rate relative to the nation. People are moving here for jobs and our unemployment rate in Texas and in Houston is close to the country as a whole.     Michael, I'll just add because I think Bill gave a lot of the building blocks that would suggest what's driving the capital investment opportunity, but we continue to see strong growth in residential and commercial and even in the industrial space. So much of the capital that we have planned in the Houston area is around growth, as well as investments will make around resiliency and around maintenance, that type of thing.  So we, as Bill gave you many of the indicators, we did see a little bit of a slowing in the residential meter account. We believe it was because of two things: one was a slight overbuild in high-rise residential and that wave came to a completion about a year ago in the industry. The environment of the community here is now absorbing those units, and the impact that we had from Harvey, a year ago, and we are seeing that start to tick back up. So you set those two things aside, all the other indicators suggest the area continues to grow at record pace and that's what drives a lot of our considerations about additional capital needs.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.,"Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Abe Azar with Deutsche Bank."
"Thank you. Can you convert the increase in Enable's guidance between 2018 and 2019 into the CNP earnings view? And then, also the -- you exclude the VVC deal close and the dividends, but do you make a change for the shares issued or is that a little bit of dilution this year?","Abe. I'll have Bill answer that question. I think he's got the numbers in front of him.     Abe, Enable announced yesterday, their net income estimate of $435 million to $505 million for 2019. That would translate to us $0.42 to $0.48 per share on a share count of $504 million. And that would be before the interest expense burden at CenterPoint Energy Midstream, but would also include $49 million of basis diﬀerent secretion.     And what was the second part of your question, if you're still there."
I am here. You excluded the cost around the impacts of the merger this year. Did you also take out the dilution in your numbers or is that still in from the --,In the 2018 numbers?
That's right.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Yes, we are taking out the dilution as well as the other cost of capital."
"Got it. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to turn the call back over to David Mordy for any closing comments.","Thank you everyone for your interest in CenterPoint Energy today. This will conclude our third quarter 2018 earnings call. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI. Have a great day.
