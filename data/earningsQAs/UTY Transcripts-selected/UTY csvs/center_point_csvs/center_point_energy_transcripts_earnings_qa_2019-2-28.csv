Question,Answer
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. And Bill, wishing you all the best for the future as well.",Thank you.
"My ﬁrst question, just to clarify the '19 guidance, are you resuming any merger synergies in '19?","Yes, we do assume merger synergies in 2019, as well as obviously, we have costs to achieve those. But to answer your question speciﬁcally, we do assume that synergies are in there."
"So of the $75 million to $100 million, how much should we assume will be in '19?","We have taken action to get after a fair amount of that. We haven't disclosed the actual amount for 2019. But we have already gone forward with reductions in workforce, which is a signiﬁcant component of that."
"Okay. And my second question, as you map out the 5% to 7% growth '18 through '23, are you assuming that Enable stays within the portfolio over that ﬁve years? And for the non-utility   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   businesses, are you generally assuming a growth rate that's also in line with 5% to 7%, or is it higher or lower? Can you just provide a little more clarity on those?","So Ali, we are assuming that we remain invested in Enable. I will say that we are not assuming that Enable performs at the -- in terms of growth, at the same level that our utilities will. We've taken a more conservative view of that. To your question about the growth of our utilities, the growth of our utilities will be a slight reduction oﬀ of the growth in rate base over that period due to regulatory lag."
"But just to be clear, the other Vectren non-utility operations, are they going in line with the overall growth, or they are also growing less or more?","I'm, sorry. I misunderstood your question. As far as the competitive segments, we do assume that they're growing but not at the rate of our utilities."
Understood. Thank you.,Yes.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning.",Good morning.
"So I just wanted to follow up on the 5% to 7%. I know you guys discussed that in the initial slide deck after the Vectren transaction. Can you give us a little bit more of a sense of what's changed and if there's any kind of apples and oranges sense versus what's out there implied in the 2020   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   number? I think costs to achieve, for instance, but anything else, right? Obviously, some of the synergy numbers may have changed, but versus the April deck versus today on '20?","Well, Julien, I think the 2020 view that we provided, I think, is very much in line with what we had shared before. As you know, we've tightened up the range versus what we were looking at before as we understand more the pieces. As far as the growth rate, this is the ﬁrst time we provided kind of growth for that ﬁve year period, and it's really driven by the visibility around the growth in our utilities."
"Got it. When it comes to costs to achieve, that's been -- that's comparable treatment last time versus this go around (ph)?","Yes, that is absolutely correct."
"Got it. And then just quickly if you can clarify this, what kind of balance sheet metrics are you seeing in the '20 time frame associated with that 5% to 7% at that point in time?","I'll let Bill -- you want to comment on that?     On the balance sheet, Julien, as we've shared before..."
Like FFO to debt in '20.,"Yes, FFO to debt is in -- we target 13% to 16%, and we are comfortably in that range. And therefore, as we've said in the past, we don't foresee any need to raise equity in either 2019 or 2020."
"Got it. Congrats, again, Bill. And I'll leave it there. Thank you.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Thank you.     Thank you, Julien.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Michael."
"So just to clarify on Julien's question, the costs to achieve in 2020, what is that? What are you expecting there?","So we've not provided what that number looks like. What we have said though is, within the forecasted range of our EPS for that year, we have included a range of possibilities. The reason we haven't provided, we just don't have visibility. We have much more visibility at this point to what the synergies or the cost eﬃciencies will be. In terms of the primary contributors towards costs to achieve at that point, it will be systems related. And we are just going through the exercise now of reﬁning what that looks like. So we have a range in our minds. We weren't prepared to provide it, but those numbers are going to be primarily system-related costs, and they're inclusive in the earnings range we gave."
"And he -- I think he was speciﬁcally trying to get at, were you including costs to achieve in the prior range that was higher?","We were, yes. Yes, we were."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. And I apologize, but one more question. The 5% to 7%, that is the standalone guidance. So the current 5% to 7% is now a merger -- a merged pro forma guidance, which is unchanged. So is there -- what synergies are you assuming in this new 5% to 7%? What are the oﬀsets to those synergies that are keeping the 5% to 7% ﬂat at the same level?","Yes. So we had assumed a 5% to 7% growth rate for a -- and discussed a shorter window for it. We've now made the window longer with the visibility around the merged business. We are still in the range, but to your point, following the merger, believe we have moved upward in the range or that we have strengthened our potential performance within that range, but we are still in that range."
"Okay. Thank you, very much.","Yeah. Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."
"Hi, thank you. I don't know if I missed this a little bit before, but were you saying that you don't anticipate any sale of units of Enable, at least through the next few years, in your guidance?","Insoo, what we've said is that we don't anticipate issuing equity in 2019 or 2020. We have also stated that we will look for opportunities over the forecast horizon to sell some Enable units in order to fund our capital investment."
"Understood. And then, not to beat a dead horse, but going back to the 2020 slide from last April to the guidance you gave this time, I appreciate you'd mentioned that the costs to achieve metric was included in both slide decks and the resulting range is about $0.05 below what you presented in April. Can I assume -- if the utility is still growing at a healthy rate, are the moving pieces -- the other moving pieces in terms of the costs to achieve that maybe have been updated since what you originally thought, in addition to maybe the additional equity that you ended up raising. Where those the moving pieces that had an impact on the midpoint?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. So Insoo, I appreciate your question here. This maybe another (ph) calls we're getting at. If you look at the new range versus the old range, the most signiﬁcant driver for the decrease on the upper end would be changes around the midstream segment. The forecast provided earlier were at a time when commodity prices were diﬀerent than they were today. So as we thought about the range of opportunities, that included a larger range of commodity -- a larger commodity range as it would impact the Enable performance.  So by reviewing today's commodity environment and taking a little bit more conservative look, given the commodity prices, that's been the primary driver of the reduction of the upper range. We've also, since that time, updated our capital spending for the ﬁve-year period and have been able to reﬁne a little bit the timing around some of the recovery. But the majority of the impact is related with Enable."
"Understood. Thank you, Scott. And Bill, it's been a pleasure. Wish you the best of luck.","Thank you, Insoo.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Aga Zmigrodzka of UBS. Please go ahead."
Good morning. Could you please discuss what could drive your earnings closer to the higher versus lower end of your 2020 EPS outlook range?,"Aga, this is Bill. Scott shared it one way in the last question, I'll just putting it another way. Within the 5% to 7%, the largest unknown is the contribution of earnings from the midstream segment. So what could drive us to the higher end would be a strengthening commodity prices environment, translating to greater volumes in our midstream segment and, therefore, earnings contribution."
"So as a follow-up to that, do you expect Enable's net income in 2020 to be ﬂat versus 2019 in your like middle of the range, or you expect a decline? Any sense you could give around that?","We have only provided what Enable has provided in their earnings call, and that's their 2019 guidance. We do take a look at their forecast and take a view against that with respect to   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   commodity prices, but we are not going to forecast Enable's net income or other ﬁnance metrics beyond 2019."
"Okay, thank you for that color.",Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"And congratulations and thank you, Bill.",Thank you.
"A question on -- just as we look at the -- back to that original guidance slide. You had the $50 million to $100 million range on commercial opportunities and cost savings, and now, it's $75 million to $100 million on O&M savings. Have you eﬀectively sort of taken out whatever you're assuming on commercial opportunities? Or is that still part of but just not called out? I'm just curious if you could bridge those numbers a bit for us.","Sure, Jonathan. Thank you for the question because it's a good point. Since we're talking about 2020, our disclosure reﬂects the fact that we believe the majority of the synergies in 2020 are going to be cost related or O&M related. We still have expectations that there will be commercial synergies. We just believe they're going to develop more fully in the years following 2020.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"So if I could just probe on that a little bit more, of the $50 million to $100 million, you originally listed commercial opportunities ﬁrst, suggesting that might have been the bigger piece of it. So is there -- have the cost savings actually increased although the range for the combined is the same, and if so, how much?","Yeah. I would say that the way we intended to represent the $50 million to $100 million was that the primary of that would be eﬃciencies or cost savings and that there would be some component that was revenue synergy or commercial synergies. Those numbers were an estimate early on. And as we've gotten further into this and we realized the timing, I think we've got more clarity around the cost side of things, which gives us conﬁdence in how we talk about it in 2020. And we have expectations for the commercial side, but we now know the development of that will primarily occur after 2020."
"Great, okay. Thank you. And then just -- I may have missed this. I apologize if you have to repeat it, but could you give us an update on the process and timing for replacing Bill?","That activity is underway as we speak. We do not have a replacement announced, but we're actively working that process. And I hate to give timelines when we're in environments like this, but let's just say, it's being actively worked and we hope to have his replacement on in the near future."
"Are you looking inside, outside, or both?",We are looking outside for his replacement.
"Okay. Thank you, guys.","Yeah, thank you.  Operator   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Your next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, guys, and congratulations again, Bill. A lot of questions have been asked already, but I wanted to just kind of maybe summarize what your message is here and how it's changed. Is it fair to say that outside of Enable and perhaps a little bit of timing diﬀerential with incremental lag in maybe '19 and '20 at the utilities at Houton Electric, the overall plan is pretty much the same. It's not kind of enhanced and a little bit better than it was before?","I think that's a fair representation. We're excited by the plan. We have -- as you've seen, we have a robust capital deployment plan for these service territories and we're excited about it. So I think that's a safe summary."
"Okay. You mentioned in response to an earlier question that the, I guess, net income growth of the utilities would be slightly lower than the 8% rate base CAGR. In that vein, is there any reason to believe that a lag would remain wide after you hit your stride after the Houston Electric rate case across the whole utility footprint? Will you basically be able to earn your authorized ROE?","I think there will be some accelerated or maybe some enhanced lag in '19 for the reasons that we talked about or Bill talked about. But I think on an ongoing basis, given all the jurisdictions and the various rate mechanisms and the need for occasional rate proceedings, there will always be some element of lag such that our earnings growth will kind of consistently lag behind the 8% rate base growth. But it continues to be our objective to push towards and achieve, if not get very close to, our allowed returns in our jurisdictions."
"Okay, great. And then just real quick on VISCO, can you give us any updated thoughts there? I know the merger has only closed recently, but any reason to think that the Vectren standalone plan has changed?","No. In fact, we believe VISCO is doing well. As we go forward and we begin to talk about the segments starting in Q1, we will begin to provide some more information as to how well that segment is doing. But traditionally, their -- one of their metrics has been backlog, and their backlog is doing very well at the moment."
"Okay, great. Thank you, guys.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)",Yep.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.
"Yeah, thanks. And Bill, congratulations on a great career.",Thank you.
"Is -- I only had one question left. On Slide 9, your investment outlook for electric, is Freeport now in there? I assume it's in there. And have you tied that down, because I think last time, you were talking $500 million to $700 million is in -- in what years is that in, if it is included?","Yeah. So that project is now fully baked into the plan. We -- as you say tied down, we don't have it completely tied down. We have estimated what it looks like. The actual amount will be the outcome of the proceeding with the Commission because it involves -- it will involve decisions around routing and around some of the infrastructure decisions being made. So there is a range that's in there. What we tend to provide and look at when we provide this data will be kind of midpoint of range, and it spans across primarily '21 -- '20, '21 and '22, with '21 being obviously the most signiﬁcant year."
And it's still in that $500 million to $700 million range?,"Yes, that is correct. Yes, still in that range."
"Okay, that's all I have. Thank you.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yep.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Ahar Shan (ph) with Verition. Please go ahead.
"Hi, this is Ashar. They got my name wrong. Can I just ask you, is the merger accretive in '19 and '20 or not, based on the new disclosure provided today?","With the exception of costs to achieve, we're forecasting the merger to be modestly accretive."
"Okay. And secondly, sorry, a lot of things going on this morning, Bill, can you just mention there what the average shares outstanding are -- I might have missed it, it might be on the slide -- in 2019 guidance and 2020?","Yes, we have provided -- I believe we provided that. But it's not -- you should consider the average shares outstanding to be 500 million in 2019, and that will be less than the share count of 505 million because we closed the merger on February 1st, so we're taking out one-twelfth of the new shares, and then moving to 505 million to 506 million into 2020."
Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.,Thank you.  Operator  Our last question is from the line of Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint. Please go ahead.
"Hey, guys. How are you?",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. Doing well. Thank you.
"Congratulations, Bill. You've been a very good friend and a better CFO.",Thank you.
"I will miss you dearly, but it's been a good run. Just a couple of questions. Just back on Enable, so you're assuming ﬂat earnings on Enable as the forecast. Is that correct?","So our forecast, Andy, is, in 2019 -- and we recognize Enable's midpoint, taken from what they have disclosed, is below their 2018 contribution. Beyond that, we have not disclosed our forecast, but it does include a range of scenarios, and that's why that growth rate of 5% to 7%."
"Okay. I thought that you were just taking the '19 number and then just using that going forward. So you have some number in '20 and '21 that may or may not be diﬀerent than the '19 number, is that kind of correct? Am I saying that correctly?","Is he saying it correctly?     Andy, could you repeat that? I think it faded a little bit -- your voice faded."
"Sure. I apologize. So in '19, you have your estimate based on what Enable has put out there. And then in '20 and '21, you're not using the '19 estimate. I thought you were just kind of using the same number. But you have an estimate for '20 and '21, you're just not sharing that with us.","Yeah, that is correct. That's right."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. Okay. And then on the costs to achieve in '20, how much -- I'm sorry, if I missed that, but how much is that?","We've not speciﬁed what that speciﬁc amount is. I commented earlier that, thematically, the majority of it will be system-related, and we're not far enough along with the analysis post- merger to know exactly what that looks like in that year. So we've made some estimates on a range, and we've made that inclusive in our thinking about earnings, but we've not speciﬁed what we think that costs to achieve is in that year."
"Well, I'll ask a question, I don't know if you can answer it. Is it greater or less than $0.05 per share in '20? Okay. That's no answer. I got that. Got a laugh. Thought I'd ask. Okay. And then the last question I have, so you do have these two Vectren legacies, the VISCO and VESCO, and again, you guys didn't break that out as far as what the earnings contribution is for those in '19, did you?",We did not.
"Okay. At the same time, I'm just kind of thinking longer term. I kind of have in my head what I think the business is worth if you were to sell them and then what you could either do with the cash, whether it's buy back stock or whether fund your business to maybe raise CapEx, whatever it may be. But it's a very low P/E business relative to your regulated business. And so I don't really see much sense in keeping those businesses. They don't really grow much. So I just want to get your thoughts longer term. I know, obviously, you just bought them, but is it in the realm of possibilities that you would dispose of those assets and reinvest that in a higher P/E business?","Again, either way I would answer that is, to your point, we just acquired them. They just came in as part of the merger. As we were looking at those businesses coming in, while they're diﬀerent than the utility business, they have some utility-like characteristics, which we were comfortable with. We do think there is growth opportunity in those businesses. So I would say our strategic direction is to own and operate and grow those businesses, and that's where we stand at the moment."
How much capital are you putting into VISCO this year?,"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Go ahead.     Andy, one way to think about that is really the 2017 and 2018, and they invested approximately for $50 million in capital in the infrastructure businesses."
"Okay. But because it is a fairly -- depending on the year, a fairly capital-intensive business because of the equipment needed on the pipeline side, so I don't know. I guess we'll discuss it more in Boston, but obviously, clearly, you know my opinion. Thank you, very much.","Okay. Thank you, Andy.     No further questions. I'd like to thank everyone for their interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will now conclude our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Have a great day.
