Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Neel."
"Regarding the Enable update, is the right way to look at the updates going forward is that – the Enable portion of the business is something that you don't want to own longer term, and you'll pursue ways to, kind of, lower that stake in your overall portfolio, but not to expect a absolute decision as to whether you're going to keep it or not?","I think, Neel, the way to think about this is as we've expressed from the beginning we would like to reduce our exposure to oil and gas sector with our investment in Midstream. So, if we're not   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   able to aﬀect an outright sale, as Bill suggested, we would look for opportunities to lighten our ownership via public sale. But we're also very much aware of the need to be cognizant of market conditions when we attempt to do that. So, I think that's – maybe a long-winded answer, but I think the way you described it is perhaps accurate."
Okay. And then just with the outright sale process. How do you look at the tax leakage associated with that?,"Well, the viable sale processes that are there are ones that don't involve a cash transaction and therefore would not involve an immediate tax liability."
"Okay. Great. And just really quickly, Houston Electric is doing very well for you. Wanted to just try to think about rate base growth versus sales growth. When you think about the capital spending that's involved there, is it mostly due to keeping up with the sales growth or are there reliability needs that need to be addressed as well, and kind or rough percentage of what's driving the rate base growth, sales growth or just reliability in need for new equipment?","Yeah, Neel. There is a mix of investment for those categories you described. I would estimate, I don't have the numbers in front of me, that the largest category is centered around growth investment, perhaps around 60% of our capital is growth oriented. The remainder would be geared towards maintenance and reliability spend."
Okay. Thank you very much.,Yep.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Insoo Kim with RBC Capital Markets.
"Hey, good morning, everyone.","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning, Insoo."
"Hey, Scott. Just going back to the Enable options, per the partnerships agreements, I understand the 5% limit that would trigger the road curve (23:14), but is there a limit to how many or what percentage you guys can sell, either via an open market or an Exchange in a given year?","Insoo, good morning. This is Bill. The 5% limit would be to a single owner. There is not a limit with respect to what we might sell in the capital markets. Having stated that, we are well aware of the practical limitations, I think, which center around the actual ﬂoat and average daily trading volume of Enable."
"Got it. But in terms of the partnership agreement, there is no written language of amending any. It would just be subject to the market conditions that you guys mentioned?",Yes.
"Okay. And then just maybe another technical question on – if you were to do a non-cash unit exchange with a third-party for a sale, what happens to the current negative tax basis that you guys have in Enable?","Insoo, it's Bill again. That negative tax basis stays. And whenever we would sell those securities, we would recognize a capital gain."
"Okay. Got it. And then, maybe turning to the CEHE, with the legislative change in Texas, do you foresee the chances of you ﬁling a rate case in the foreseeable future is like pretty low?","Well, in our last disclosed estimate of ﬁlings we did not have a full-blown rate case in our – in that plan. The removal of the four-time limit on DCRF would potentially allow us to defer a rate case even further. Keep in mind that DCRF is only usable if our total ROE is below our authorized ROE.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Understood. Thank you very much.,Yes.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"So, thanks for the additional color on Enable. Let me get your refreshed thoughts here. In a scenario where you are – there's not an outright sale and you're divesting a small percentage on an annual basis, can you just remind us how you're thinking about other ways to potentially dilute your ownership in Enable, maybe looking at non-organic growth opportunities and tapping what seems to be an underutilized balance sheet, which I guess is a bit of a surprise for the rest of the sector? So how are you, sort of thinking about M&A and maybe potentially diluting Enable's exposure?","Well, certainly our objective of having our Midstream exposure on a percentage basis being lower could be accomplished through continued utility growth. Our emphasis continues to be around organic growth for our utility. You know we – when we invest organically we know the returns that we will get on those investments. It would be nice to ﬁnd an opportunity or to be able to accelerate our utility growth. But we have to compare the returns of other investments against the returns we can get investing in our organic growth opportunities.  Bill, did you want to add to that?     Sure. Thanks, Scott. Shar, I'll just remind investors that we did revise our ﬁve-year CapEx higher in the 2016 Form 10-K. And with the growth that we continue to see, I think that CapEx investment is biased to go higher yet. The strength of our balance sheet and our credit metrics   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   allows us to make those investments without having to consider common equity in the near term."
"That's helpful. Okay. Got it. So, the organic opportunities far away (27:47) you having a look at the M&A market. Thanks. Appreciate it.",Yes.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan.
"Good morning. To continue on the conversation regarding Enable, can you just kind of give us a little bit of background and remind us of the exact trigger of when you need to go to OGE with the right of ﬁrst oﬀer? You've done this, I think, a couple times now? You said that you recently kind of refreshed that with them last month?","Sure, I'll ask Bill to do that.     Good morning, Chris. See, if we intend to have discussions with third parties to sell more than 5%, then, under the partnership agreements, OG&E (sic) [OGE] has the right of ﬁrst oﬀer. Given that we have been having discussions and continue to have those discussions, the time period lapsed, and therefore we needed to provide OG&E (sic) [OGE] with another right of ﬁrst oﬀer."
"Okay. Then how did the time period lapse, exactly?","Yes. There is a time limit by which we would have to conclude the process and to close. And that time limit is 120 days after we respond to OG&E (sic) [OGE], should OG&E (sic) [OGE] give us an oﬀer. And OG&E (sic) [OGE] has 30 days to respond to our right of ﬁrst oﬀer notice, and we have 30 days to respond to that."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. So, as you've been going through the process over the past year and a half or so now, we can assume that cycled through a couple times. And each time, you've not been able to get it done, obviously, by the ﬁnish line there, okay.  And then, switching gears to the Energy Services business, it seems like, since you closed the transaction with Atmos early this year, you're generally pleased with the results, and you say that it kind of remains accretive. Can you just speak in a little bit more detail to the kind of business market conditions there, and the outlook going forward?","Yes. I'm going to ask Joe to make a comment on this one. He's sitting at the table here with us.     Hi, Chris. Yes, it just gave us the opportunity to broaden our geographic scope, which is one. And it lessens the overall impacts of economic conditions and weather conditions across the country. And two, the integration has been going well and it allows us to look for further organic optimization of the businesses as we combine them, so with Continuum and with Atmos and legacy CES, it's put us in a good position to grow from a organic perspective, just based oﬀ of the size we've accumulated with the acquisitions."
Okay. And just the overall commodity and volume environment out there remains supportive and kind of in line with your expectations from six or nine months ago?,"It has. With the gas prices and the gas availability out there, the market looks good."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.
"Good morning, gentlemen. A few...   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)",Good morning.
"...questions on Enable. Regarding the spin, I'm of the understanding that the risk proﬁle of CenterPoint would have improved. So I'm not understanding the inability to maintain desired credit metrics. Could you kind of clarify that?","Go ahead.     Kamal, good morning. It's Bill."
Hi.,"Yes, you're correct in that the business risk proﬁle would have improved without having the Midstream Investment as part of our business. Having said that, we think there is real advantage to our credit metrics, and we speciﬁcally look at FFO to debt. And we did not think that we could put the amount of debt on SpinCo for it to have a sustainable credit quality, as well as to meet our objectives of maintaining our credit metrics at CenterPoint."
"Okay. Regarding the potential sale opportunities, if you go down the path of selling via the public markets, would you go back to a potential block sale? Or would you just remain on the public market sale path?","We will not be commenting as to how we might do that. But there are various – either programs, or as you suggested, block sale opportunities. I think it very much depends upon the capital market considerations. And I know I've said it twice, but I'll say it again. We do recognize practical limitations that exist today as a result of average daily trading volume and ﬂoat."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. And one last one. Back when you had the Cable business, you used the ZENS structure to oﬄoad the position in the Cable business. Is that something that could be evaluated for your Enable LP interest?",I don't think that would practically work with units.
Okay. All right. Thanks for the time.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust.,
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. First question, Scott, I just want to understand the sort of strategic thinking behind the sale for shares because it seems to me that all you're doing is essentially adding another layer in your ultimate goal of exiting that exposure. Is that fair? I mean, essentially what you may get is a more liquid share ownership that you could sell more easily. Or I'm just trying to understand what the sale for shares would accomplish, given where you want to go.","So, Ali, our objective with this transaction was to have more visibility into the earnings associated with Midstream Investments, as well as the option to have more liquidity to change our ownership. So, your point is exactly right. The transition to another security, in part, would be to provide optionality for us to lighten our investment in Midstream over time."
"Okay. And so presumably that potential buyer – is understanding of that fact, that there may be some pressure on their shares, if they do give you shares for their ownership exchange?",Yes.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)
"Okay. And also to clarify, Scott, the – and I think you said that, just to clarify, as far as selling the Enable units in the market is concerned, there is no oﬃcial limit with the partnership agreement? I mean, theoretically you could sell all of it in one go if you wanted to. I understand the capital market issue, but there is no other limit to how much you can sell at any given time.",That is correct for just straight capital markets transaction.
"Right. And then second question, Bill, for you, if I look at what you've reported so far through the ﬁrst half, and I look at the guidance range you have for the year, even at the high end of the guidance range, it's essentially is telling us that second half results would be ﬂat with second half 2016. Is there any rationale or any reason why that would be the case?","Well, we never said it was ﬂat with 2016, but what I said in the prepared remarks, Ali, was that we will update earnings guidance as appropriate, hope you'll appreciate we are in the middle of our big quarter for Houston Electric. So, volume sales related to weather do matter to our earnings. And we do recognize that oil and gas forward price has changed, and that could change the mark-to-market accounting that is at the Enable level."
Okay. But there is no structure – there was no one-time gains or anything last year's second half that would make up for a tougher comparison?,That's correct.
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe.,
Yes. Hey. Good morning.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Morning, Steve."
"Good morning, Scott. I just – just curious that, you know, obviously beginning of the year you moved the date to this call, giving more time for this process, and then we have this happen again. And you could, I guess in theory, just say, hey, we're just going to go status quo, and obviously anytime somebody could make an oﬀer to do something else. So maybe just give us some color, like why, kind of continue with this process as is, instead of just saying, hey, let's just go status quo and if something happens strategically then it happens?","Well, Steve, the reality is that we are still in discussions with parties. Admittedly, there were some parties that came into conversation a little bit later in the process and that may be the driver for this not being concluded. But we are working towards a conclusion of the discussions that we are having. So, while we didn't get closure by this call, and I'm hesitant to provide another date for target, hopefully it will be in the near future when this is closed out."
"Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of thinking about the credit thought process if you applied it to any type of sale for stock. It really wouldn't, in theory, it wouldn't really change your credit situation much because you'd still be eﬀectively getting the Enable distributions through to CenterPoint from whatever entity you've invested in. And – so, you wouldn't have any of the credit issues that you would have with the spin at a high level, is that correct?","That's correct, Steve."
Okay. Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Good morning. Just one question I had left, in thinking about this idea of a sale of units for some type of like-kind exchange, so you can time your tax liability a little – have a little more control over that. Is some of that due to the uncertainty with respect to tax reform?","No, I would say it's not. When we started this process, we were talking about this option and that was before any discussion of tax reform. It is possible if tax reform were to occur there could be some beneﬁt from it."
Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.,Yes.  Operator  . And your next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
Hi. How are you?,"Good morning, Paul."
"Just a sort of follow up on Ali Agha's question, and some of the others in terms of this like-kind exchange. Is the only purpose for taxes? Or is there any other beneﬁt that you would get from accounting or what have you in having a lower percentage of ownership in a larger entity than you have with Enable?","Paul, good morning. It's Bill. We currently account for our Enable investment as equity accounting under really – the real estate accounting rules. So, if we were to exchange those units for units or C Corp common of some other entity, at this time, we don't see a change in the accounting. What – and we would not expect to recognize any tax liability. The exchange   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   would defer the tax liability until the time which we sold either units or C Corp common and that the exchange for the units would be under a plan of reorganization."
"Okay. And then with respect to – I mean, just with respect to the management of the tax liability, is this a big driver in this? Is that – I mean, as opposed to potentially selling your Enable's ownership for cash? Is that what we're talking – but is that one of the big drivers here that you guys are considering? Is that the big portion of the consideration here?","Well, we do have to think through that. And we have signiﬁcant negative basis. So, in order for us to meet our objectives as Scott has outlined, we would need a very high sales price to ﬁrst recognize that capital gains liability, and then drive the rest through to get back to our earnings per share."
"Okay. So, with that in consideration, when we're talking about capital markets opportunities and what have you, the idea of a secondary oﬀering of selling security holders or what have you, it would seem that because of that management of the tax liability issue, you would be probably divesting if you were doing it to the capital markets. Your preference would be to not do a block sale or not do a large sale? It would seem to be that you would be, for lack of a better word, dribbling it out over a considerable period of time as you would with the like-kind exchange.  I mean is that the right way to sort of think about the likely outcome? I'm not trying to preclude you from any potential disposition. But does that make more – is that sort of the way we should think about it just in general?","I think with respect to sale in the public markets, the capital markets considerations are much more of a limiting factor than paying capital gains tax as we liquidate."
"Even like – so, but what about the idea of a secondary oﬀering for instance? Like in other words, an underwritten kind of oﬀering, or something of that sort of nature? I was thinking in those terms (43:34) yes, obviously if you were to selling in the open market like you've been saying, there'll be some restrictions there just because of the ﬂow and what have you. But just in thinking in terms of the block sale or something of that sort of nature or marketed eﬀort, that would sort of be precluded as well, would it not, because of the tax consideration?","Well, it would. But just practically, we own over 54% of the LP units of Enable. So, we have to think through how much any one block sale would be relative to that ownership.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
Okay. Thank you very much.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.,
Hi. How you guys doing?,"Good. Good morning, Andy."
How long has the – just to your sale process been going on for Enable?,"We announced it about 18 months ago. But from a practical standpoint, it began a little less than a year ago. We had some challenges right after we announced with the commodity markets, and basically caused a delayed start, if you will. But I'd say it's been active since a little under a year."
"Again, I'm not talking about the strategic review. I'm just talking about the actual sales process, straight sales process for Enable, which is kind of where we're at right now. It's been about a year?","Yes, it has."
"Okay. And, I'm just curious. I mean, obviously, you mentioned obviously the energy markets as well. And obviously, you know there's been number of times where OGE has been oﬀered the right of ﬁrst oﬀer or whatever it's called, ROFO. But the point being is, why is it taking so long? Is it because it's a – not a minority stake, but obviously that there's another owner of Enable? Is that the problem? Or can you give us any color of why the process has taken so long?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Admittedly, it's taking longer than we had expected. I think I'll began with, it took some time to get conﬁdence in a forecast over multiple years that we could represent to potential buyers. Then – you just have to think back to the state of the E&P industry and the Midstream segment for the ﬁrst half of last year. And then you're right, this has an added layer to it, in that any potential purchaser wants to get comfortable with their partner."
"So then, move to the like-kind exchange, I would assume that may be a similar issue. In a like- kind exchange, how does it work, just logistically, with OGE? I mean obviously, I guess they could participate in that like-kind exchange, tell me if I'm right or wrong, but also, as far as their ﬁrst look at it, better way to put that.",That's within the ROFO.
That's within the...,"So if we're oﬀering our interest for sale, OG&E (sic) [OGE] has a right of ﬁrst oﬀer."
But in the like-kind exchange as well?,Correct.
"Okay. And that's just based on a cash price, I guess.",That's based on the fact they have a right of ﬁrst oﬀer...
"No, no, no, no I understand that, but I'm saying, as far as the like-kind exchange, obviously you would be oﬀered shares in a new – another company, in exchange for your shares of Enable. But that would be based on a, I guess, a price, right? Obviously, so that's how OGE would determine whether they're kind of in the game or not (48:18).   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Right. Well, under a right of ﬁrst oﬀer, they make the oﬀer ﬁrst, if they elect to do that."
"Okay. Okay, so they – I guess I didn't realize that. I thought they were able to at least be able to review what the oﬀers were, but I guess that's not the case.","No, they have ﬁrst oﬀer rights."
"Right. Okay. But I was – something I had in my head that they were at least part of the process beyond that ﬁrst oﬀer. Okay. So basically, on a like-kind exchange, we'll ﬁnd out about that fairly soon. Is that fair?",Yes. We hope to move this to conclusion here pretty quick. Yes.
Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.,Yeah.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Insoo Kim with RBC Capital Markets.
"Sorry for the follow up. Just one follow up on the Enable, I know that's been a – essentially oﬀ the table – but was the decision for that, you say it was credit metrics, but did the math that you guys work through, in terms of potentially paying down the debt and maybe re-equitizing CERC via equity oﬀerings? Did that not make sense to you guys as – in terms of accretion or whatnot?  And then, the other part is, are you able to tell us whether you received a private letter ruling from the IRS that it would or would not be a largely tax-free thing?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","I'm not in a position to comment on the latter. Well, we're not in the position to talk about private letter rulings publicly. But, with respect to the way we looked at it into, it was the consolidated credit metrics of CenterPoint after a spin, and the amount of debt that we could reasonably place on SpinCo, so that SpinCo would have reasonable access to the debt capital markets."
Got it. Okay. All right. I'll follow up with you guys oﬄine. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.,
"Hi. Just a quick a follow-up. So, assuming that you guys do a like-kind exchange and there is no liquidity issue or very little one. What would then be, in terms of the disposition of those assets, which you think, because at that point assuming there is no liquidity issue, it's just a question of tax liability management, it would seem to me. How should we think then of the disposal of the new securities that you would own and would those be accounted for in operating earnings potentially?","Well, I'll start, and maybe, Bill, can add to the latter part of the question. Thinking through that option, that far down is reaching way far ahead in terms of what may happen if the ﬁrst assumption were to occur. We maintain our objective of trying to reduce the volatility of the investment proportion that we have in our Midstream space.  So, the timing for disposition, there are many factors that would go into that. One is the variability of the earning stream that we now have, and as you know, capital markets considerations. But there are many factors that would go into, and we have not at all described what our objectives would be relative to that investment."
Okay. I thought I'd try. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.,
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Hi, sorry. One quick follow-up regarding the GP interest in Enable. Would you hold on to it until you sold down, or got out of your LP position, down to a reasonable level? Or to more of a smaller stake per se?",Our expectation is the GP would go with the sale.
"Okay. Thanks.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Neel Mitra with Tudor, Pickering.",
"Thanks for the follow-up. Just another question on the like for kind exchange? If you were to exchange units with somebody else would that ultimately actually reduce the tax liability, or just manage your ability to basically pay that out over time when you sell the units?",That would not change our tax liability.
"Okay. So, just be able to manage it over time.",That's correct.
Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.,
I think I'm all set.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"Okay. Thanks, Andy.     Thanks, Andy.  Operator  Our last question is from the line of Andy Gupta (54:05) with HITE.  Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clariﬁcation. In the sale option, is the only option you're considering taking units of shares? Or what if it's a cash oﬀer?     Cash oﬀer would work, but it has to be at the right price to meet the other obligations."
Understood. Okay. Thank you.,"This concludes our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. And have a wonderful day.
