Question,Answer
Good morning. Can you guys hear me?,"Good morning. Yes, loud and clear.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. So not trying to front run the upcoming Analyst Day too much, but yeah as David touched on Slide 5, the $500 million of opportunities in Texas. I was just hoping to dig in a little bit more on the timing of these incremental investments, how you're looking at the regulatory treatment? And also, where you see the best opportunities across the platforms, whether it'd be energy, storage, generation, transmission? And again I'll pile on a little bit more, but any additional thoughts on the scope or the growth beyond this initial view and when you'd be in a position to kind of talk a little bit more about this?","Yeah. I mean, certainly, we're not going to front run our Analyst Day, and we -- and for one main reason is, we're still trying to assess the all the details in the bills, when they go eﬀective and what is essentially a practical time when they can come into a eﬀect. I think another thing to focus on, a lot of people think that these were tools put in our toolkit basically to face a winter storm. And in reality, what they really help us more for is hurricane season, and that's more likely that we'll have a hurricane before we'll have another Uri in terms of the territories that we serve. So, I think it's a good set. As we said in the call, the initial view is at least another $500 million in capital.  I'll maybe let Jason give a little color on what those -- what -- where that $500 million may land and sort of what the timing might be.     Thanks Dave. I would say, we're obviously very appreciative of all the work the legislature went through to give us the tools to reduce the risk of a widespread outage. In terms of timing, I would say about half of that $500 million likely to be deployed over the next call it about two years with the remainder over the back half of the ﬁve-year plan. We see the tools coming through in sort of a couple of diﬀerent ways. Our system was designed to shed about 3 gigawatts of load and -- in sort of widespread outage events. This past winter storm, we were asked to produce about 5 gigawatts of load. And so what we see sort of as an immediate opportunity for us is the opportunity to own emergency generation for outages that are expected to be longer than eight hours.  We will be deploying mobile generation at the substation that with in combination with a year- round demand management program will give us the ﬂexibility to shed much more signiﬁcant load for ERCOT, yet still provide power on a rolling basis for our customers and that's some of the work that we will pursue aggressively.  There are then some additional opportunities related to owning battery storage, kind of a grid level resource as well as a bill that introduced an economic dimension to siting new electric transmission lines. That -- those tools will help provide congestion relief and ensure even better reliability of our electric grid, but those programs will likely take a couple of years to site and build. And so, I would think about half of the $500 million is coming in over the next couple of years with the remainder in the back half of the ﬁve-year plan.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Great. Thanks so much for that detail. Appreciate it, guys.  Operator  Your next question is from David Peters with Wolfe Research.",
"Yeah. Hey, good morning guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"So the CapEx plan you maintain the $16 billion for the ﬁve years, but clearly you're pointing to that moving higher, and I think you said, there's no equity needed for that $1.5 billion. But could you maybe just talk more about the sources of funding for that? Speciﬁcally, I think you kind of talked on the tax eﬃciencies, but even to the extent that you see kind of more upside above that $1.5 billion, is it still fair that we shouldn't expect any additional equity?","I mean that's a question that's right in Jason's wheelhouse, so I'll let him answer it.     Thanks Dave. I think that's a fair assumption. As you pointed out, we outlined back in December a ﬁve-year capital investment plan of $16 billion. At that time, we acknowledge that we held back about $1 billion of what I would consider to be sort of routine capital investment spend. We really wanted to make sure that we could eﬃciently grow into the increased level of CapEx as well as funded eﬃciently and we're gaining that level of conﬁdence. And then as I just mentioned and we just discussed, we see the opportunity for at least $500 million of incremental capital investment related to the recently passed legislation here in Texas. And so the combination of those factors allow us to at least increase our ﬁve-year CapEx plan up to about $17.5 billion.  And back to the central part of your question around funding it, we've got a couple of strong tailwinds that give us the ability to fund it without any incremental equity. First, as we   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   announced on the ﬁrst quarter call, we have about $300 million in incremental proceeds above our original plan from the set sale of our gas LDCs. And as we talked about on today's call on our prepared remarks, we're seeing at least $250 million in after-tax cash beneﬁts from the implementation of the tax repairs method change that we will put in place.  Think about that as providing $550 million of equity related ﬁnancing and so we can eﬀectively double that with debt that would be authorized under our regulated capital structure. And so that gives us at least $1.1 billion to fund that capital investment increase. And these ﬁgures are all before we take into consideration any of the signiﬁcant unit appreciation from Energy Transfer. So in short, we have signiﬁcant capital investment opportunities above that $16 billion plan that we outlined in December, and we have conﬁdence we'll be able to fund that without any incremental equity as we move forward."
"Thanks. And then maybe this is something for the Analyst Day, but just the 6% to 8% going forward given, I think you said a lot of this won't start contributing till '23, should we maybe think of it as a like a step up at that point or just a bias towards the top end through '25?","We're focused on this year on delivering on the high-end of the 6% to 8% utility EPS range that we had outlined, we'll reserve further comments on long-term growth for the Analyst Day later this year, but I think you highlighted an important element. As we spend this incremental capital likely beginning here towards the end of '21 to '22, it really will not drive earnings until 2023. And so think about this as a long-term tailwind for the company[ph] and we look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Analyst Day."
Fair enough. Thanks guys.,Thank you.  Operator  Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourezza with Guggenheim.
"Good morning, team. It's actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a strong quarter and congratulations to Tom on a job well done.",CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Thanks.
"Just in regard to the CapEx plan and bridging the new disclosures and maybe elaborating on the $1.5 billion of incremental opportunity that you're now presenting, do you feel that there is more work to be done beyond the current IRP in Indiana, and is that number inclusive at all of any upsides in Minnesota and kind of do you anticipate that this would be reﬂected at the Analyst Day?","I'll let Jason handle that. He's on a roll handling capital questions today.     Constantine, can you repeat the question around Minnesota?"
Is the $1.5 billion in upsides at all inclusive of the new legislation in Minnesota like the RNG and/or any reliability enhancements?,"Yeah. The Natural Gas Innovation Act up in Minnesota. So no, the $1.5 billion ﬁgure that we've been discussing is prior to any incremental capital related to that new innovation gas act up in Minnesota. I would say the -- we do have incremental upside related to Indiana and the coal transition plan as a potential. Right now, we've outlined is part of the $16 billion capital investment plan. The cost associated with the closure and transition of two of our three coal facilities in Indiana, we will be looking at that third coal facility as part of the upcoming integrated resource plan that we will ﬁle in 2022 in Indiana.  To the extent of that ﬁling changes sort of timing around the closure of that third and ﬁnal plant in -- coal plant in Indiana, that potentially could provide further tailwind to the capital investment opportunity up there. So, overall, we still have -- as we try to indicate I think additional tailwinds beyond what could be about a $17.5 billion ﬁve-year capital investment plan, those would come from increased opportunities as we continue to work with stakeholders around the Texas legislation as we pointed out here, the opportunities around the Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota as well as further work on the coal transition plan."
"Sounds great. Momentum is good. Can we shift to O&M and kind of maybe some updated thoughts on cost savings? The targets are staying the same, but are you ﬁnding it easier to reach those targets at this point? And what sort of visibility do you have for '22? And just as a quick follow-up of that kind of post-Enable sale, what trajectory do you see for the remaining parent costs?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Let me handle sort of the 50,000 foot view of that, and I'll let Jason come in and sort of ﬁll the blanks then. I mean, our commitment is to a 1% to 2% reduction every year and we have every intention of living up to that commitment. I think as we tried to provide some color on the call here this morning is we have the luxuries, we're running ahead of the 1% to 2% this year. And think of the 1% to 2% as averaging over the ﬁve-year horizon that we're talking about. We're actually ahead of that which gives us the ability to pull forward '22 into '21. And so, we are taking run rate O&M out, and I view it is that just turning around and immediately investing it in sort of opportunities to save in the longer run. So, I think we're dead on track on O&M. We've learned a lot from Tom about what -- going from sort of O&M reductions to the thought of continuous improvement, which is just grinding out a more eﬃcient operation quarter-after- quarter. And clearly as you -- we start to think about '22, I mean, we're halfway through '21, so we're having a lot of dialogue right now about what '22 looks like, where we're going to spend our money, where we're going to get savings, and clearly that is in high focus for us right now.  I don't know Jason you want to add anything else or think I've covered it.     Okay. I'll spend a minute on providing a couple of examples that we're really proud about. We've talked about some big opportunities, things like we're ﬁnally integrating the legacy veteran companies onto our SAP platform. We went live with that integration this summer, and so as we tackle big events like that that allows us to reduce signiﬁcant cost. But importantly, what we're seeing is the real beginning of adoption of a continuous improvement mindset.  On previous calls, we've highlighted a focus on reducing truck rolls in the ﬁeld and we had some success in the second quarter this year in our electric business by bundling some of our major underground work, bundling both the capital and the expense work to be executed at the same time. And so we saw not only the beneﬁt of reducing truck rolls, but also reducing a lot of the support cost behind the scenes. And so we are very pleased with the continuous improvement mindset that is it is building giving us conﬁdence in '22.  I know you also asked about sort of post-Enable parent. We see some opportunity for parent costs coming down as we use the proceeds from the sale of the -- what will be the Energy Transfer units to de-lever at the parent level as well as the reset of the preferred dividends that are Series A preferred stock in 2023. So we do see an opportunity over the next few years, as well to see sort of as parent company cost, also come down and help further support and overall reduction in our cost structure.     I think that's the reason that we keep emphasizing that post the sale of the LDCs and post the elimination of the midstream, we are absolutely conﬁdent and around our 6% to 8% growth. We don't want to leave the impression of losing that earnings stream means that we are going to back oﬀ of that 6% to 8% growth.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
That's very helpful. Thanks for taking our questions.  Operator  Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.,"Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, it's actually Kody Clark on for Julien. Good morning.",Hello Kody.
"So ﬁrst, can you give a little bit more color on the gas cost recovery process in Minnesota? I know there was a hearing on the matter yesterday, but just wondering what the latest feedback is from parties and when are you expecting a resolution there?","Jason, you want to take that one?     Yeah, happy to. Let me ﬁrst start sort of overall with going to where we expect to be with gas cost recovery. I think the punchline is we expect to recover about 80% of those incremental gas costs by the one-year anniversary of the storm. That's really going to be largely driven by the issuance of the securitization here in Texas. The reimbursement for the incremental gas costs in Arkansas and Oklahoma as part of the sale to Summit, as well as the recovery that has begun or will be beginning here shortly in the remaining states.  Back to Minnesota, later today the commission there will likely vote on a proposal to begin recovering costs over 27 months and we've been working with stakeholders there. We understand that it is a signiﬁcant amount of money for our customers and we appreciate the commission and others work to try to ﬁnd a balance between timely recovery of those costs, as well as helping mitigate the bill impact for our customers up there and I think the proposal that will be heard strives to strike that appropriate balance, and we're obviously very appreciative of the work.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   We are also looking forward to working with regulators in each of our states going forward to see what tools we should put in place to help mitigate this risk going forward, but a lot of work's been done and we expect to hear more later today as the -- in Minnesota as the commission considers our proposal for cost recovery."
"Got it. Okay. And then utility results have been strong year-to-date. So, I'm kind of wondering, how you're thinking about the drivers in the balance of the year, what are the factors that would put you towards the top or the bottom end of the range? And you talked about them a little bit already, but if you could just give a little bit more detail, that would be helpful.","Certainly, very strong results, driven by a few things, obviously, the continued growth that we see in our business, the rebound in the economy sort of post-COVID, and some one-time tax changes that we've highlighted on today's call. What I would say though is some of those one- time events will enable us to fully accommodate the cost of the recent governance changes that we announced for the Board here at CenterPoint, which will likely -- mostly be incurred during the third quarter this year. And so as we look at sort of the balance of the year, I think there are a couple of things that would drive us or continue to improve our proﬁle, that's really continued growth in the markets we serve as well as continued O&M discipline.  And as we try to highlight here and we try to highlight on previous calls, our focus is on consistently growing our utility earnings at the top of the peer group. And when we have the ability to pull forward incremental work for the beneﬁt of our customers, we'll do so. And we highlighted today that we've already made decisions to pull forward about $20 million to spend from '22, that's allowing our electric business in part to execute more vegetation management work which helps with the reliability and for the beneﬁt of our of our customers. And so as we (Technical Diﬃculty)"
(Technical Diﬃculty) and so does that include some optimization for the LDC sales?,"What I would consider is more optimization of our tax position for our ongoing utility operations. It's largely driven by the adoption of a method change for how we account for our repairs expense for tax purposes. It's a pretty standard deduction in the industry. It's a temporary reduction. It eﬀectively allows us to expense upfront what otherwise would be a capital addition on our system. We will claim that method change essentially starting back after bonus depreciation was phased out. So back to about 2018. And the real beneﬁt here is, obviously it gives us this one-time cash tax beneﬁt, but going forward it's really a very eﬃcient way for us to fund the incremental capital investment for the beneﬁt of our customers, because it is a temporary diﬀerence. It will reduce rate base of increased deferred tax liability. And so it gives us what I consider to be cash to address sort of on a one-time basis, some of the tax gains that you pointed out, gas LDC sales as well as the sale of Energy Transfer units. But more   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   importantly, it gives us a really eﬃcient way to fund incremental capital investment for our customers going forward.     We probably have time for one more question."
Thanks so much.  Operator  Our last question will come from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.,
"Yeah. Thank you. My ﬁrst question is on that additional CapEx that you're talking about, the $1.5 billion, it's deﬁnitely pretty impressive. And whenever we talk about the upside to CapEx, one of the questions that come up is customer bill impact and I think deﬁnitely through this 1% to 2% O&M and decrease plan that you've laid out, it deﬁnitely helps with that somewhat as it moderates the balance of the customer bill impact. How does this incremental CapEx -- how do you plan to deal with the potential increases in build, and are there some other moving parts besides that just cost management eﬀorts that that could help on that eﬀort?","So, I think it's a good question and it's something that we debate internally all the time. Because at the end of the day, we exist to serve our customers at a good rate, but I think you put your ﬁnger on one of them, the continuous improvement program and focus there passing some of that along to our customers. But I think the thing that we have that most other utilities don't that people forget in the equation is our organic growth, so by continuing to grow for instance our Houston Electric business 2% sort of quarter-over-quarter, year-after-year, you're spreading essentially that ﬁxed cost across a wider base, which also helps in terms of the impact on customer billing. So, we're cognizant of the set of responsibilities we have and I think the combination of continuous improvement, organic growth and just bringing new technology and more resiliency and hardening of the grid, which sort of pays beneﬁts over time is the key to doing that, but we're conﬁdent that we can pass muster with PUC here in Texas and our other jurisdictions with respect to the CapEx that we're going to spend."
"Got it. That makes sense. My last question is on that Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota, just for my purposes to clarify, is that basically allowing these investments full rate base treatments in that utility, I know I think currently if there's like a feed-in tariﬀ type of system in place, so just wanted to clarify there. And piggybacking [ph] oﬀ of that, are there any similar proposals or initiatives at some of your other jurisdictions that, would allow for certain rate base treatment of RNG type of investments? Thanks.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","We will work with the Minnesota Commission obviously on the implementation of the Innovation Act, but the way that we read it as it would provide incremental rate base opportunity for our utility there to help invest in the decarbonization of the gas that we provide our customers up there. And so, we do see this as a potential additional driver of incremental CapEx in the future. And sort of more broadly, yes, we are working with our other jurisdictions in a focused eﬀort to help reduce the carbon intensity of the gas we supply our customers, across our footprint. And obviously that we've got a green hydrogen pilot that will come online here in Minnesota at the end of the year, it gives us a great opportunity to begin to kind of understand that technology, how our system responds to green hydrogen and we're looking to take those learnings and see if we can expand it across the broader part of our gas system as well as working on renewable gas, renewable natural gas opportunities. And so I think Minnesota is taking a leadership position with respect to helping reduce carbon intensity of the gas we provide our customers and we're looking to take that beyond the work we're doing there."
