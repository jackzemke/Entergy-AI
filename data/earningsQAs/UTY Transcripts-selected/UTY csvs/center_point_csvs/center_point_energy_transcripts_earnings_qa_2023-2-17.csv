Question,Answer
Hey guys. Good morning.,"Hey, Shahriar.     Good morning."
"Dave, just I wanted to start oﬀ with a question on the capital markets environment and how you're sort of thinking about debt metrics at this point. Deferred costs have obviously been elevated including fuel, you had a securitization delay in '22, you've seen around a $0.06 of incremental interest drag across the utilities and parent in 4Q. I guess how should we think about resolving some of -- some of these carry cost and managing the interest rate exposure and cost pressures in the near-term?","Let me, yes, let me ask Jason to put his CFO hat back on for a minute, and answer -- and answer that one.     Good morning, Shar. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're not immune to the interest rate headwinds that everybody is facing these days, but we're conﬁdent we can manage through these challenges. We continue to have more tailwinds than we do headwinds overall. As it relates to kind of interest expense, let me make a couple of points. First is we saw interest rates rising last year. We embedded conservative assumptions around interest rate costs in the '23   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   guidance that we initiated in the third quarter call. So, I feel conﬁdent that we can accommodate some of the variability that we've recently have been seen.  The second thing is, I kind of touched on it in my prepared remarks, you know we ended the year with slightly higher elevated working capital balances due to higher gas cost that we were purchasing in late third quarter, early fourth quarter. You know as gas prices have come down now, we expect those working capital balances to turn pretty quickly. That should take a little bit of pressure oﬀ and then you know, as you mentioned, while we get to defer the interest expense on the extraordinary gas costs from winter storm Uri here in Texas, we still anticipate receiving that $1.1 billion in securitization proceeds in the coming future and that will really help reduce the overall variable-rate exposure. So again, we feel conﬁdent that we can manage through any interest rate headwinds."
"Perfect. And then just lastly for me, just maybe touching base on sort of the expectations for the upcoming Texas rate case. I know we've had some data points from the Oncor process and despite the confusion with the PFT which was eventually rectiﬁed, there seem to be really a focus on ﬁnding rate relief for customers and other peers obviously in settlement discussions. Just maybe from a high-level, Dave, what are sort of the major categories of that revenue really if you anticipate seeking, is it primarily rate base, is it deferred cost, is it O&M true-ups? And do you anticipate a noticeable rate increase from the '24 ﬁling or do you think you guys have enough levers and plan to show even a potential rate reduction despite the ask? Thanks.","Well, that's a -- that's a handful of a question. Let me -- let me just answer it by saying, I don't think it behooves us to try to front-run what might happen, what bills might get put in, where we're early in this session, Jason Ryan and his team are heavily engaged in Austin with respect to looking at opportunities that are going to be primarily focused on making sure we keep customer bills under control. But I don't think it would make any sense at this point to talk about speciﬁc eﬀorts or bills that we would like to see put forward. I would just say, watch this space and I think when we come with our ﬁrst quarter call, which will be later this spring, we'll be way more into the session at that point in time and I think you and all of us will have a better idea where that might be headed and what bills are likely to get passed. But for now, I just don't see any upside, save anything more on it."
Sure. (multiple speakers),"If I may add, you know obviously, as Dave alluded to, we're early in the legislative session. On the regulatory front, though, as we look at the upcoming rate case for Houston Electric, obviously customer rates are top-of-mind for all of us here at CenterPoint. I don't anticipate at this point much in the way of a revenue requirement increase. I'm proud of the work that the teams have done with respect to O&M and as you look at you know, where we set the test year   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   for the 2019 rate case and kind of where O&M is currently trending, I think we can oﬀer a fairly signiﬁcant revenue reduction in the upcoming rate case.  That would oﬀset any of the other things that we are trying to pursue like a more equitable equity layer and in addition I think we're pretty fortunate in the fact that maybe unlike Oncor, we have very little, relatively speaking in a way of deferred costs as regulatory assets and so I think we can again position the Company sort of to have a more equitable equity layer relative to some of the non-ERCOT T&D companies here in Texas. But at the same time, keep the revenue require rate very modest. So, we're you know in a I think a fairly fortunate place as we as we prepare for that ﬁling."
"Terriﬁc. Thanks, Jason. That actually hit exactly what I was trying to ask. Appreciate it. Thank you, guys.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Good morning, Nick."
"Hey, good morning. I cut out there, but I think I heard my name, so, I hope everyone is doing well. I guess just on the -- on the CFO search, I just wanted to tie that oﬀ, when is your intention to have something more formally announced here? Is it by the next quarter call, or are you taking your time? Thank you.","No, I think by the next quarter call, we should have someone announced and on-board. We're down to a handful of ﬁnalist candidates. As I've said, part of it is just the process of getting an individual or individuals in, get them interviewed and more importantly for me, making sure that they have a complementary skill-set to not only Jason, but the broader Executive committee we have here. But, I think as we said in the call, we've been really pleased with the quality of candidates that we've talked to. This is a really great job, believe me. I think, Jason would attest to that. This is a great job and we're going to get a great CFO out of it."
"Great. Thanks. Thanks for that. And then, I just thought the annuity lift-out comments were interesting, can you just maybe walk us through that strategic action, a bit more? And I guess if you weren't to pursue that, how would that aﬀect your 6% to 8%, you know, presumably I guess it would be a headwind and could you quantify, you know that at all? Thanks.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yes, let me ask Jason to put his CFO hat back on and answer that.     Good morning, Nick. What I would say, kind of overall the annuity lift-out was a strategic decision to de-risk our exposure to businesses that we disposed oﬀ. Think about this as part of the continued eﬀort to focus CenterPoint on a strong set of regulated operating companies. You know we've been very active in exiting unregulated businesses and a handful of couple of -- of gas utilities in Arkansas and Oklahoma. And so this was really just a step to de-risk any of that tail exposure from those employees that are currently receiving pension annuity beneﬁts. As I said, it was non-cash. You know there's a really kind of liquid market for this, insurance companies took the obligation, they took the assets, it has no impact on our pensioners. But to your point, we now don't have any P&L volatility associated with exposure to changes in interest rates, asset returns, etc. So, it's a great way to de-risk future earnings. It's a great way to continue to execute on our strategy of focusing on a set of high-quality utility assets and really proud that we could get this work done here in the fourth quarter."
Thanks for the color and have a great long weekend.,"You too. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.     Hey, Steve."
"Yes, hey, good morning, Dave. Good morning, Jason, Jackie. So, just maybe high-level a little bit on Texas political regulatory, you know obviously the -- the backup generation has proven to be pretty valuable in the short-time you've had it and we still have this kind of disagreement on recoveries and just between that decision legislature, next rate case, just how are you feeling about you know both commission and political leadership recognizing the importance of certainty and the value of kind of what you're doing?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yes, let me start and then I'll ask Jason to put his operations hat and provide a little bit of color commentary. But I think if you -- for those of you that sort follow Texas closely, as the legislation - - legislature, the governor, lieutenant governor came into this session, there is two main topics, gambling and the grid. I won't talk at all about gambling. But there is a big focus on the grid in Texas, making sure that the grid stays up with the economic development that is happening in the State. So, I think you are going to see sort of everyone rally around you know that aspect. Now what does that mean? It means diﬀerent things for diﬀerent people obviously in the State. You know the T&D companies while, one thing, the generator is another, the legislature another. I think I continue to go back to sort of our main mantra in this area, we're laser-focused on customer aﬀordability. So, everything we do in and around capital deployment, O&M reductions, things that we're going to push for in Austin, are going to be focused and pivoted around customer aﬀordability and -- and that -- those -- that set of topics.  So, maybe with that, I'll turn it over to Jason to see if he wants to say anything else.     Yes, thanks Dave, and good morning, Steve. You know overall, I would continue to echo Dave's comments on how constructive Texas is beyond the points that Dave raised, you know we continue to see signiﬁcant amount of corporate relocations to the State and here, more speciﬁcally in the greater Houston area, we continue to see now a 30-year track-record of 2% annual average customer growth.  So, I think overall it continues to be very constructive. More speciﬁcally on the operational front, maybe just a couple of brief comments. We continue to -- there is a law in-place here in Texas, that requires us to provide power to customers within 12 hours of a load shed event. We continue to operate under that standard. You know as we saw with winter storm Uri, load shed events can exceed the way the system design and so these mobile generation units are critical to meeting our reliability and -- and power quality requirements under Texas law.  I think legislators understand that, I think the elected oﬃcials understand that and more importantly, as we continue to see the impact of more extreme weather, tornadoes, ice storms, potential for hurricanes, I think the communities are starting to have a better appreciation of how we can strategically deploy these assets as we did to bring kids back-to-school after the recent tornadoes, as we can power hospitals before our restoration eﬀorts reconnect certain customers like that back to the grid and so I think these are really powerful tools to help keep our communities energized during periods of inclement weather. So, I think that's well- understood and as we said in our prepared remarks, we're going to defend the actions we took under the law that was passed here in Texas."
Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),
"Hi, good morning.","Morning, Jeremy.     Good morning."
"Just wanted to touch a bit, I guess you know portfolio rotation has been a part of the CenterPoint story in recent years and asset sale attention appears higher now than ever across the space, but we've also witnessed kind of some mixed data points with regards to LDC asset sales. And so, as you're thinking evolved at all in this area, and what are you seeing in terms of interest relative to a year ago, granted you guys don't need to sell anything right now, but just the optionality I guess in future?","Okay. Let me ask Jason to put his CFO hat back on and answer that one.     Thanks, Dave and I appreciate the question, Jeremy. I just want to reemphasize the point that you ended with, you know right now we don't have any need to sell any gas LDCs to fund the $43 billion equity capital investment plan that we -- that we have announced. That being said, you know obviously given our previous eﬀorts in this space, we continue to receive a signiﬁcant amount of outreach. I would say there remains tremendous interest in I think moderately sized utility systems like the gas LDCs. We operate in a constructive set of of States, places where it either gets very cold during the winter or States that are incredibly supportive of natural gas.  So, I think the interest remains strong for our assets in particular. I also think maybe some of the transactions that you referenced sort of reﬂect a few things. First, you know there needs to be at least a moderate size to the asset sales to get sort of a strongest interest from the largest possible place of buyers. Some of the sales that have transacted recently have been on the smaller end. You know the size of the gas LDCs we have I think are sort of a sweet-spot for attracting the most signiﬁcant amount of attention. And then as well as we've -- as we've talked about in the past, we think that there is beneﬁt in terms of selling assets out right. There's a control premium that often gets lost as maybe some of our peer utilities pursue minority interest sales, and so, we don't need to do it, but we continue to see, the market is deep and strong given the high-quality of the assets we own."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And then kind of shifting gears here and you touched on this a bit a number of times, but maybe just kind of bringing it all together, if you could kind of quantify the bill relief you expect to see based on the decline in natural gas prices? Just wondering how quickly that ﬂows back across your jurisdictions and I guess, how you think that rate -- you know that release could materialize over time?","Yes. I mean I think our customers should start to really see the impact of that in about February. You know we have obviously diﬀerent time periods for our purchase gas adjustment clauses in each of the diﬀerent States, but largely, they start to kick-in in February, some a little bit in March. I think kind of system-wide, on average, customers should really start to feel the beneﬁt of that you know across our system in April. And we're seeing gas prices less than half of what we were kind of buying into the winter season at, so it should be pretty signiﬁcant you know bill really for our customers as we head into the summer months, we're happy about that and hope it holds up."
Got it. Very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Operator, I think we have time for one more question.  Operator  Thank you. Our last question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open."
"Hey, good morning team.","Good morning, Durgesh."
"Good morning, Dave. All my questions have been answered. Maybe just one, the wind project that you mention in the Indiana IRP update section Slide 8, just any color you can share with us on that project?","Thanks, Durgesh. I appreciate the question. I think it's early days in the application there. So, you know, we anticipate that -- that project probably being approved kind of towards the end of   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   2023. But -- but just given kind of where we are in the stage of ﬁling, as well as ﬁnalizing the bill transfer agreement, I'd rather keep the comments brief. I think overall, what we tried to highlight in the prepared remarks is that, you know when we set-out on this ﬁrst phase of -- of this Integrated Resource Plan, we had an objective of owning about 50% of the renewables and we're proposing and contracting for 50% of the balance. And the way it's working out with this wind project that we will ultimately own, as well as the solar projects that we previously ﬁled, I think we're on-track now to own roughly 60% of the renewables and contract for 40%, so a slight improvement versus our original objectives as we -- as we are executing on this ﬁrst round of the -- of the Integrated Resource Plan."
"Understood. Thanks, Jason. I appreciate you wearing all the hats today. Thanks so much.","Thanks, Durgesh.     All right, Operator. That's going to be our last Q&A for this quarter. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and I hope everyone has a great afternoon and a long weekend. Take care.
