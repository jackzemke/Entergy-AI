Question,Answer
"Hi. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
"Just a quick one, Scott. I think you said you expected to give an update on your decision on direction with Enable on the second quarter call. Did you mean the call will take place in the second quarter or the actual reporting of second quarter earnings in Q3?","It would be the reporting of the second quarter earnings in Q3. We anticipate the exercise would be virtually completed or essentially completed by the second quarter. But our ﬁrst opportunity to discuss it would be in the third quarter call – or the second quarter call, sorry."
Sorry about that. I just wanted to clarify.,Yeah.
CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   And then could you also just talk about how you've thought about Enable in making the statement on 2018 growing at the high end oﬀ of whatever you earn in 2017. Does that contemplate the current status or do you think you could be there in an exit scenario? What should we take from that?,"Yeah, Jonathan. We assumed that the performance of Enable continues to be strong, but we did do some testing of various performance levels of Enable and have concluded that under a number of growth scenarios for Enable, including very modest growth, we would still be able to achieve that."
Do you think you'd be able to achieve that if you no longer held the position for 2018? Should we assume that too?,"Well, I think, under that scenario, you've got a very diﬀerent picture to look at. But as I told you, to the extent that we move forward with an opportunity around the transaction, our objectives were to maintain comparable earnings and dividend."
Yeah. I saw that. So I guess we take this as a statement that should apply in all scenarios?,Yes. That's a fair way to look at it.
Okay. Thank you.,Yeah.  Operator  The next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
"Yeah. Hey, Scott, Bill. How are you?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)",Good morning.
"So, ﬁrst just technical question. What was the year-end tax basis for Enable?","Steve, I'm looking at Bill. I think he's trying to ﬁnd that number at the moment."
"Okay. And maybe in the meantime, just – in terms of just thinking about what you're going to know by the second quarter versus what you know now. I mean I don't know if tax reform is something that you need to know for things like the spin or, I guess, I'm just a little confused like why hasn't something happened now and what are things that could happen in the next quarter or two quarters that suddenly you know, you'll have an answer by then? Or is that -","Yeah. So, Steve, this isn't -"
Yeah.,"It's not connected to clarity around tax policy. This is just the ongoing dialogue we've been having with parties and our estimate of when we believe that would come to an end. It has nothing to do with tax. In fact, as we've mentioned, this review is really around trying to address the volatility of earnings. And we're going to conclude this even without having clarity on what the future tax policy may look like."
"Okay. And then, I guess, Bill, do you have the Enable answer?","I have that, Steve. Steve, that's within our footnote on income taxes. And best way to think about it is the deferred tax liability is $1.38 billion. The other piece of that, you need on that, is where we record the investment at Enable. That's in our assets on our balance sheet and that's equivalent of $10.71 a share at year-end.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)"
"Okay. Okay. And then just when you look at the plan for 2017 or 2018, can you give us a sense of just where your earned returns are and just kind of make sure comfort that those are going to be? Okay. I don't think you need to – as part of your reviews like DCRF or TCOS whatever, there is no real kind of review of returns, right?","Yeah, Steve. The mechanism that has a return review would be the DCRF. So we cannot make a DCRF ﬁling if we are earning over our authorized return per our EMR that we ﬁle. That's the one that has the structured limitation to it. That said, we do anticipate ﬁling DCRF this year."
Okay,"And, Steve, our expected return on equity within the equity calculation for rate base would be within 25 basis points to 100 basis points less than our allowed return, depending upon the entity."
Great. Thank you. I appreciate it.,"Yeah. Thanks, Steve.  Operator  The next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners."
"Good morning, guys.","Shar, good morning."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Just to conﬁrm. Your growth guidance, your trajectory for 2018 doesn't assume any sort of tax policy changes including some of the accretion that you may anticipate. And then when you think about longer-term growth, how we should think about that, when you got sort of a front- end loaded CapEx picture as far as on the electric side? How we should think about the trajectory a little bit further out?","Shar, I'll answer the ﬁrst part of that. I'll ask Bill to comment on the second. The ﬁrst part is no, we do not assume as we look to 2017 or 2018 forecast that are projected targeted growth performance that there is any form of change in tax policy. Bill, do you want to comment on the second part of that?     Yeah. With respect to longer-term growth, I think your anchor point should be of rate base growth and we would expect earnings contribution to grow approximately 1% less than that."
"Okay. That's helpful. And then, sorry if I missed this, but what was the O&M guidance for the Gas business for 2017? And then when you look at the utility, in general, how we should think about cost inﬂation for your ﬁve-year plan?","Yeah. Shar, this is Joe. We remain committed to managing O&M in a very disciplined way. And so, that'll be approximately 2%, perhaps slightly above that in some years given the activity around pipeline integrity expenses. But we'll do everything we can to continue with the strong O&M discipline that we've been executing on in the past."
"Thanks, guys. Congrats on the results.",Thank you.  Operator  The next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Hey, guys. Congrats on a good 2016. One question. I want to make sure I understand for Energy Services what is included and if anything what is not included in your 2017 guidance? Are you   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   including all of the impact of both Continuum and AEM's acquisition in the 2017 guidance?","Michael, this is Scott. Good morning. Yeah. We have factored in the net impact of all of that in our comments around 2017 performance which includes essentially an integrated Continuum and then the eﬀects of the integration process associated with AEM. And we think AEM will be – I'll describe it as modestly accretive this year, but all of that is included in the numbers that we provided.     Yeah."
And do you think that business has a diﬀerent growth rate than the gas distribution business does?,I think that has the potential to grow at or slightly stronger than our utility business. It's really predicated on opportunities that come as a result of additional scale but I would say it's very close in growth rate. It's not something that's dramatically diﬀerent.
"Got it. And diﬀerent topic and this one maybe for Bill. When I look at your debt schedule, both at CERC even a little bit at CE and not much left at the parent, but you've still got a number of tranches kind of in the almost 6% range, up to the high-6%s, almost to the 6.9%. And it doesn't look like the make-wholes are really that expensive, just kind treasury yield plus 20 basis points to 35 basis points or so. How are you thinking about reﬁnancing what eﬀectively is high cost debt in this environment and kind of the timeline for taking some of that out?","Right. Well, Michael, ﬁrst, you're right. We do have, I think, in today's environment, what might be considered high coupon debt. The debt that just matured in February of this year had a coupon of 5.95%. The debt that matures in November has a coupon of 6.125%. We think about that as an investment decision. And if it's net present value positive on a cash-on-cash basis to redeem debt early then we'll do that. And that's exactly how we thought about it in late 2016 when we executed the make-whole call and redeemed $300 million of debt. It was a $22 million charge to our earnings, but it was a net present value positive decision on our part."
And was that $22 million charge – was that all cash?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),Yes.
"Okay. And the only reason why I ask is that the debt – a lot of the reﬁnancing opportunities that may exist right now are actually either at CERC or at CE, meaning not necessarily as much at the parent, because you've done a good job of dealing with parent debt. It strikes me that would – reﬁnancing a lot of that debt down at the OpCos would give you the opportunity over time, especially as you go in for rate relief to potentially impact customer bills, maybe alleviate any upward pressure on customer bills due to the investments you're making and maybe even give you more headroom to increase the amount of capital you deploy?","You're correct. And we take a look at those opportunities regularly and should they be NPV positive for the customer in the case of CE and our CERC related gas utilities, then we will redeem that debt and reﬁnance it. And in that case -"
Got it. Thank you.,There will be no charge earnings.
"Got it. Thanks, Bill. Much appreciated.  Operator  The next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust.",
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Good morning. Scott, coming back to your thinking through on the Enable ownership, obviously, you guys have been working at it for a while now and one of the impediments and you alluded to that again has been the tax leakage associated with that, particularly if there is a sale for cash. Is it fair to assume that that scenario is probably not high on the table given the tax leakage implications and perhaps sale for stock or spin-oﬀ, if you are going to do anything, are the two most likely outcomes?","We haven't handicapped each of these individually, but we've certainly been clear about the challenges we have with a cash sale from a tax leakage standpoint. So, I would say, your characterization is perhaps accurate. We do continue to have the challenges associated with tax leakage, if we were to pursue a sale as you've pointed out."
"Yeah. And on the OG&E (sic) [OGE] ROFO, they had a ROFO before you guys decided not to take them and go the other way and now they've come back with the ROFO second time around. I mean, again, is that procedural or is that something as a real option given that we've already been through this exercise before with them?","Ali, it's Bill. That is largely procedural. If we intend to have discussions with third-parties, then under our partnership agreements, our partner has a right of ﬁrst oﬀer. And so as long as we're having those discussions and don't complete a transaction within a time limit, we'll need to give them another right of ﬁrst oﬀer."
"Right. And so, Bill, fair to say, I mean this is just the same ROFO that's come back again?",That's correct.
"I see. And then, Scott, also to be clear on your comments. As you mentioned, if none of these options comes to a conclusion, doing nothing and working with the system is an option. Am I to read into that that's probably become a bigger option today than maybe it was when you started the process? I mean, are you committed to doing something or doing nothing may end up being the best option after all?","Yeah. Ali, I think, we've been pretty consistent about expressing that any of these are viable options. But the real gating item here is whether something other than retaining our ownership   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   would allow us to achieve the objectives we've laid out. If we can't achieve the objectives we set forth then our option of maintaining our ownership and continuing to work with Enable to be less volatile is certainly a very viable path. We've been doing that all along, quite frankly. And they've had some great successes in the eﬀorts that they've made in 2016 to just do that and that eﬀort would continue going forward."
"Okay. And last question, again, just to round this out. Fair to say that a fair bit (47:43), it's taken longer than expected has been to try to ﬁgure out the most tax eﬃcient way of making an exit if possible? Has that really been the issue that's held you guys back?","For practical purposes, we didn't really – weren't able to start this process until the latter part of the summer last year. Shortly after we made the announcement, the market fell oﬀ precipitously and we needed to have a viable forecast from Enable that we could use in these discussions. So we weren't really able to start anything until the August timeframe of last year. So we're not as far into this as it appears we might be but we are committed to working this through and exploring the various options that we have. And we will make our decisions accordingly based on our ability to achieve those objectives."
Understood. Thank you.,"Thanks, Ali.  Operator  The next question will come from Kevin Vo with Tudor, Pickering."
Hi. Good morning.,"Kevin, good morning."
Just following up on Ali's questions on Enable. Could you – I know you mentioned how the decision will likely come before any potential tax reform. Could you kind of just walk us through   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   how the tax reform could lower the tax leakage at all from Enable – from a sale to the (49:08) Enable? How should we think about the impact there?,"Kevin, it's, Bill. So, on a cash sale of Enable, assuming we had a lower statutory rate and that statutory rate was also the capital gains rate for corporations then that would lower our tax bill."
Okay. That's the question I had. Thank you.,All right. Thank you.  Operator  The next question will come from Charles Fishman with Morningstar.
"Hi. Good morning. Since, my questions on Enable have been answered, let me just give one to Joe before he gets out of dodge.",Okay.
"Joe, a couple years ago, you instituted that we were able to get together with the Minnesota Commission and get a decoupling mechanism for weather. And if my memory serves me, this might be your ﬁrst winter where that's really going to come in handy. Is that working? Do you anticipate it working to your expectations this winter?","Yes, Charles. Your memory is good. This is, in fact – we've had it in place for almost a year now and it beneﬁted us last year as well. And, obviously, with these mild temperatures this year, it will also continue to be a beneﬁt. So, as I said in my remarks, we had a great 2016 despite these mild temps and that was in large part due to the Minnesota decoupling. And we've recently got – it was a $25 million true-up that was approved last fall that we have begun to bill under that mechanism. And it's a three-year pilot. So we're hopeful that we can translate that into a permanent tariﬀ after that three-year period expires."
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Okay. And then just as a follow-up with the transmission loop around Minneapolis that you're working on, where does that stand?","Yeah. The Belt Line project continues to go well. We're actually a little bit ahead of schedule. I can't remember the exact date as to when that will conclude, but we're spending signiﬁcant capital on that replacing that 60 or plus so miles loop around the city of Minneapolis. And everything is on track if not ahead of schedule."
"I mean, you're on the home stretch of that, aren't you, just another year or two years or?","No, there is more than that. There is about – yeah, there is about four or ﬁve more years, Charles."
"Okay. Thank you. That's all I had. Then good luck, Joe.",Thank you.  Operator  Our ﬁnal question is from Nick Raza with Citigroup.
"Thank you, guys. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On Enable, assuming that a transaction does occur, is there a thought around what you'd do with the preferreds you currently own with the company?","Nick, it's Bill. Should there be a transaction, we could go one or two directions. We could continue to own a preferred and make sure that we are protected in a right way by its current non-cumulative feature and so we build that into the original structure that we negotiated with Enable. Or we could include that preferred and the sale or a transaction with another party."
"Okay. And that would eﬀectively reduce the tax basis, correct?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)",The preferred is its own tax basis.
"Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. And then, I guess, on the – if I look at slides 15 and 14, your rate base is growing on average about $200 million to call it $250 million. And I guess you're spending about $534 million a year, pretty ﬂat for natural gas distribution. But if I take out the system maintenance and improvements, that's only about $100 million. Am I missing something?",Are you looking at slide 14?
Slides 14 and 15.,"Yeah. So, you're correct. The majority of the spend is in that blue category, if that's what you're trying to conﬁrm."
"Well, I guess, what I'm getting at is that if I take the system maintenance and improvements out, you only have about $100 million left. So I mean, how is the rate base going from $2.8 billion to $3.7 billion, which is an average about $200 million a year ago? I'm sure it's probably something I'm missing.","Nick, this is Joe. I think if you're just trying to back into the rate base number it'd be – for the most part it's CapEx minus D&A."
Okay.,And deferred taxes.      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Yeah. So -     And all of them.     Hi. It's Bill. I mean just to jump in here and follow on Joe McGoldrick's comments. Rate base is the CapEx less depreciation less deferred taxes.
"Okay. And then I guess that's actually a good segue. In terms of your current deferred tax liabilities, on slide 25, I understand your $2.3 billion is in the utility business. Where is most of that located? Is it transmission distribution or natural gas distribution?","Well, it's across all asset classes, but you can see really the majority of that is in PP&E as disclosed both in this table on 25 as well as our tax footnote."
"Okay. And you mentioned there'd be a liability. Should there be a tax relief presented out there, there'd be a reduction in rates. Do you know what that would be if all of this deferred tax liability were to go away in terms of percentage of rate reduction?","That would depend on when new rates are set. So it would be either a matter of going through our mechanisms where you add them at the (55:46) gas utilities or through general rate cases. And I said regulatory liabilities, because there would likely be diﬀerent regulatory liabilities depending upon the nature of the original deferred tax liability and the amortization of that life of the regulatory liability would be part of the rate case and/or the mechanism."
"Okay. Fair enough. And so – fair enough. All right. Thanks, guys.","Thank you, Nick.      CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We will now conclude our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Have a nice day.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call.
