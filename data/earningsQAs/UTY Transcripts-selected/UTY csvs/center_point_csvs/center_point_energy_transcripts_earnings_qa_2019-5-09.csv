Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. Maybe starting of at Energy Services, are the margins that you saw this quarter reﬂective of more normal level going forward for the ﬁrst quarter? I understand ﬁrst   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   quarter '18 was a strong weather quarter for the segment, but just trying to look out beyond 2019 to see like what type of margins we should be assuming going forward.","Insoo, good morning. This is Scott. I'll make some comments. If Joe wants to add, I'll ask him to do so. I would characterize the ﬁrst quarter of '19 as a little below what we would expect. It's certainly well below what we saw in '18, but it is a little lower than what we would expect on a normal basis in the ﬁrst quarter. That said, since we weren't able to do much optimization in the ﬁrst quarter, those storage assets are now available for us to take advantage of optimization in the latter part of the year. And we've already begun signing some commitments that do exactly that. So it essentially moves some of the earnings capacity for the ﬁrst quarter to later in the year."
"Understood. And perhaps on -- and in Indiana with the CCGT no longer in the plans, I understand there's going to be alternative proposal to 2020 IRP with potential CapEx starting in 2021 likely. But in the '19 and '20 time frame for the moderate amount of CapEx you guys did have for the CCGT, are there some oﬀsetting CapEx levels or investments that you're contemplating that could ﬁll that gap in the next couple of years?","So I would say as we look at our total capital plan and spend, given the relatively small amount that was associated in those years, it's quite possible that capital could be redeployed to other areas where there may be additional needs. We're going to go through an exercise associated with the new IRP of understanding what the shift in investment looks like in Indiana. And as we do that as you know, we do that on an annual basis where we look at capital, we will update capital plans elsewhere. And it may well include the ability to deploy that limited amount of CapEx either on other needs within Indiana or elsewhere in our service territory."
"Understood. But at this point, the earnings power that you see for this year and next year should largely be unchanged or not impacted that much?","That's correct, yes."
Thank you very much.,Yeah.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)  Operator   Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Thank you. Good morning.,"Good morning, Ali."
"Scott, the Energy Services full-year outlook you that you've laid out of ﬂat is certainly lower than I think what your expectations were previously. So what could oﬀset that in the portfolio? Or is that something we should be thinking about in terms of adjusting our numbers? Let me start there.","So Ali, the amount of expected annual performance change from where we started the year, I would say, is minor in the business. What we're really seeing is a shift of anticipated earnings from one quarter into other quarters. To the extent that it is slightly less than what we originally anticipated, we can look at other levers to help manage our overall performance, including necessary cost levers or other options we have to continue to make us feel good about the earnings guidance that we've given for the year."
"Okay. And then overall, how are you looking at your non-utility businesses, given this volatility that creeps up in your earning stream and obviously the negative reaction to your stock price? How do they ﬁt into the predictable growth rate you're thinking about long term? And I put Enable in there as well in terms of your latest thought there. And also on Enable, can you just clarify, so your ownership used to be 54.1%. Has that come down? And what is the current ownership in Enable? Thank you.",Thank you.Current ownership is 53.8% and the -- that modest or very slight reduction was due to the additional units that were awarded as part of Enable's management LTI compensation program. So that -- does that answer your second question?
"That does answer that part, yes.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)",So the ﬁrst question you're asking is about variability with our competitive businesses. I want to point out that a look at business performance or a competitive business performance on a single quarter basis is where it -- inaccurately or incorrectly characterizes the volatility of the business. And the reason is that the businesses have some seasonality to them as do our utility businesses quite frankly have seasonality to them. So to the extent that you want to characterize a business with greater levels of variability I think we need to look at that overall over the entire course of a year. And what we've seen is consistent performance -- relatively consistent performance over a 12-month period as opposed to some variability you might see with any given quarter.
So these are core for you?,"Yeah, these are businesses that we are operating and we are looking to grow. And we understand the fundamentals that drive them. And they're complementary to our much larger utility business, which comprises roughly 70% of our total earnings."
Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.,
"Hey. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
I have a question on Indiana and the IRP process. Could we have a -- just a refresher? Are you required to put other options you might pursue out to RFP? Or is this just a question of replacing one-rate-base investment with others of a diﬀerent ﬂavor? Just some sense of timing and how conﬁdent you are that this would end up in rate base.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity),"So Jonathan I'll start with the ﬁrst. The ﬁrst one was a question around the process. So State of Indiana has a cycle of refreshing the IRP every three years. So we're on -- we started our last one that ultimately included the recommendation or the requests with the CCGT that started in 2016. So we are in the process now of ﬁling our next one, which was due in 2019 anyway. We believe the process of -- it's a very stakeholder-rich process. That process will take us into probably mid-2020 before the new IRP is ﬁnalized. And that IRP process will bring forward the multiple ideas and multiple options in terms of how to meet the generation needs going forward.  And then that process will conclude with some recommendations and ultimately the ﬁling on our behalf of equivalent of CPCNs for the solution that we believe is aligned with the stakeholders and the commission. So we would then begin the process of requesting certain elements of generation. Exactly what that looks like is to be determined. We do know that the commission would like to see smaller, more discrete projects in there as a way of hedging against uncertainties in the future. But we do believe, given our experience with the last IRP, that the alternatives represent investment that are similar to the total investment we had represented in this case. The time frame may change slightly but the amount of investment that we think is needed to achieve our future state, we think is likely to be similar to what we were looking at."
And the conﬁdence of those would be sort of rate base investments as opposed to PPA? I was just curious what -- do you have any comment there?,"Yeah. I think our conﬁdence at their rate base is reasonably high. We were successful in putting together a project for 50 megawatts of solar that we will have in rate base. And we think that type -- the similar type of approach can provide us rate base opportunities. There may be some element of PPA in there, but we think the preferred path, the one that would be best overall would be investments that go on a rate base."
"Okay, great, thanks very much.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.",
"Thanks, good morning.   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Good morning, Greg."
I don't want to beat a dead horse on the issue. But I think the volatility in earnings in the gas business has just got some people confused. So if you could just explain to people what the commercial opportunities were that you were able to optimize Q1 last year and why this Q1 was diﬀerent from last Q1? And why there's durability over the course of the year and your ability to achieve those earnings outcomes.,"Fair enough. Greg, I'm going to ask Joe to make some comments on this.     Thanks for the question, Greg. Again as you know, last year there were some extreme weather opportunities in various parts of the nation and those opportunities occurred where we had the ability to optimize those assets at that time. 2018 was unusually favorable as a result of those oﬀset by less than favorable 2019 from a weather perspective, especially in the areas where we have operations. So when you compare those to year-over-year, it created a tremendous downfall.  But as a result of the lack of activity in the ﬁrst quarter of this year, we are well positioned with our assets, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year to take advantage of that, an opportunity we did not have the chance to do last year because of the amount of work we did in the ﬁrst quarter of 2018. If you look at our projections for the rest of the year they are more in line with what we would call a normal year with 2018 being the aberration. So with that, we have the ability to recover going forward for the rest of this year.     Greg, I'll just add into Joe's comments. In the ﬁrst quarter of '18, when we were able to capitalize on some extreme weather, we essentially utilized the capacity of the storage that we had during the ﬁrst quarter. And we then spent the balance of the year kind of reﬁlling inventory and reﬁlling storage, which means you don't have opportunities to optimize whereas in this year, we weren't optimizing as much in the ﬁrst quarter. Those assets are available to us to optimize and we've already begun to sign up commitments for that margin for the latter half of the year."
"Got you. Okay. That's more clear. And then with regard to Indiana, it does sound like ultimately there's a need for generation solution. It just -- it maybe conﬁgured diﬀerently and because of the timing of the IRP that capital might be deployed over a longer time horizon. But ultimately,   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   from my perspective and correct -- please correct me if I'm wrong, like there is a capital need there, it's just a question of the types of resources you deploy and perhaps over a slightly longer time frame, is that fair?","Yeah. Greg, you said it very well. That's the message we were wanting to get across. We absolutely believe that there is a similar investment opportunity to meet those needs. It's just a matter of what it looks like, what those pieces look like and some element of timing given the timing impacts of going through another IRP before we begin to make those investments.     Greg, I would add that for the smaller scale projects, solar for instance, the spending curve is much shorter. So remember that $850 million, very little is in 2020 and before. So the majority of that was in '21 and '23. So if we replace with smaller scale projects the timing may work out, we just don't know that yet. But smaller scale typically take shorter period to ﬁnish."
"That's good clariﬁcation, too. Thank you. Have a good morning.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Abe Azar from Deutsche Bank Your line is open.",
Good morning.So just 2 questions. How much merger cost do you expect in the balance of the year?,On Slide 23 we provided you with the year-to-date spend. So year-to-date we spent a little over $110 million. And I think that's roughly half of what we plan to spend for the year.
"Got it, thank you.And can you break down pieces within the $0.15 of other on Slide 15?","Sure, absolutely. The majority of $0.15 is related to 2 things. One is the merger ﬁnancing. If you remember we had a combination of seniors note, commercial paper, perpetual preferred, convertible and common equity. So the combination of those merger ﬁnancing is roughly about $0.12 out of that $0.15. Additionally, we took on some more Vectren debt. So that was the   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   interest expense that we didn't have same quarter last year. And we issued some new debt at Houston Electric. But the majority of the $0.15 is related to the merger ﬁnancing."
Got it. Understood.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.,
"Hi guys. good morning.Just to follow up on, I think it was Ali's earlier questions about the Infrastructure business. Can you talk about how that rolling 12-month backlog ﬂow? How should we think about that number in terms of how it converts into earnings over time? And also I think Vectren's old guidance used to be around $ million to $54 million for that business a year. And what's the seasonality look like over the course of the year for that business?","Morning, Michael.So I'll take the second one ﬁrst. The second part of your question, the seasonality is such that the ﬁrst quarter is always a very weak quarter for them and that the majority of their contribution is in well I consider more construction-friendly times of year of second, third quarter and part of fourth. So the ﬁrst is traditionally their weakest. And I think we've referenced that in my comments, trying to do a comparison of what performance look like this year versus last year, even though last year was under the ownership of Vectren. And remind me what your ﬁrst question was."
It has to do with the backlog number that you put in there.,"The backlog, that's right."
Yes. How does that work?,"So the best way to think of it now is the amount of contracts that are in place that are to be addressed over the coming 12-month period and that is a -- it's an important measure on kind of a relative basis to what it's been in prior quarters. So as the backlog has grown, it suggests   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   there's more demand in the coming 12 months, more commitments in the coming 12 months than we had in the prior -- maybe the prior look at it. So the backlog is approaching $1 billion at the moment. Forget what the number was last year, it was probably a little -- 750, mid-7s type thing. We constantly have new projects that are rolling into the gas distribution type business. Some of those contracts roll oﬀ. Some of them get updated and renewed. And then we have new contracts that show up in the transmission side of the business, some contracts roll oﬀ and then other ones roll on. One of the big drivers for the sizable increase was a single large project that was contracted at the end of this past year and that's reﬂected in the numbers. But both the distribution work and the transmission work are both up from the last time this was reported."
All right. What's the average length of time that you work on a project? How should we divide that $1 billion number into how many years?,"Michael, this is Joe. Again on the -- those contracts can vary. They can be anywhere from 3 to 4 months up to 12 to 18 months. As Scott reﬂected, we try to average that, but over -- that $1 billion that we have in the backlog will be realized over the next -- between now and 18 months from now.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open."
"Good morning.Scott, can you disclose what this 300 million transmission project is? The one in your backlog?","We have not disclosed it by company name, if that's what you're asking."
Morning Steve.Okay. Okay. Okay. So I can't just track which one it is. Okay.,That's right. Yes.
"CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   All right. And then I guess separately, just is there any kind of refresh or change in views on Enable's strategy or thought process?","No. I mean we've commented each time we meet that we appreciate Enable's performance and their contribution that they make to us. We know that, that market is challenged at the moment. The capital markets are challenged there. But we're pleased with Enable's performance and the contribution they are making to us. I think that's probably the best way to summarize it."
"Okay, thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Aga Zmigrodzka from UBS. Your line is open.",
Good morning.How has the integration process of Vectren been progressing? Have the asset so far operated in line with your expectation?,"Good morning.Yes, integration is going extremely well. As we mentioned earlier, we've taken the necessary actions to begin achieving our targeted synergies. And we've also put in place the management structure to begin operating the businesses that have overlapped combination, like our gas LDC businesses. So that's all been put together. So we're operating it as a single business, which is what helps drive the performance that we expect for customers. It also helps drive the ﬁnancial performance that we've targeted. So integration has been going very well in my opinion."
Thank you for that color.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open.,
"Scott, just one clariﬁcation. This CCGT in Indiana, was this a product of the 2016 IRP? And if so, I mean if the commission changed their mind now, could they also change their mind by 2022 when you ﬁle the '19 IRP? Just give us the context of where this project came from?   CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)","Yes. The project was the result of the 2016 IRP, and -- but as you go through that IRP process and you present your ﬁndings, there's input provided and commentary. There is no approval, if you will, of the IRP. There's just a recognition of the merits of diﬀerent options and then we proceed with ﬁling our request for investment that we want to make against that IRP. Clearly, our views was that it was the low-cost solution.  But I think the diﬀerence in time between when the IRP started in '16 and when did -- and where we ﬁnd ourselves today, that the commission understands we need to make investment, but they wanted to see the investment made in a way other than a bet on one single large plant. Now you asked the question, is it possible that commissions can change their mind? We all know that's the case. So what we plan to do with this next revision is take the direction that they provided about the future and modify our thinking and plans in a way that aligns with the direction they gave us. And our hope is that when we get to the point of submitting requests for investment and recovery that we will minimize the chances that they will not be supportive of that."
"I see. But to be clear, they had never blessed their CCGT either directly or indirectly?",They don't do it until you actually ﬁle the CPCN. And the ﬁling goes through of that particular request for that particular asset.
I see. Thank you.  Operator  Our last question today comes from the line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.,
"Hi Just one quick follow-up. I know we asked questions around this in the last call regarding the guidance and inclusion or exclusion of the cost to achieve the merger synergies. As I look at your deck today, I don't think the language has changed. But I'm still trying to get clarity on whether '19, it seems it's saying its exclusive of costs to do synergies versus 2020 guidance, which says it's inclusive to those savings. Am I reading that right? And if that's the case on a more apples-to-apples basis for 2020 if you exclude those costs to achieve, is the range actually higher than what you're providing?","CenterPoint Energy Inc (CNP US Equity)   So Insoo, let me try to clarify the beneﬁts is as we talk about guidance for 2019 we are excluding the cost to achieve. So those are excluded from our guidance EPS. When we get to 2020, our EPS guidance range that we have provided is inclusive of those costs to achieve. Now what we said on the last call was $75 million to $100 million in 2020 of beneﬁt and what we didn't clarify until now is what we believed the costs to achieve number would look like in 2020. So here we've just provided an update to that of $15 million to $25 million of expected costs to achieve in 2020. That's a new number that is really kind of an oﬀset to the $75 million to $100 million that we provided. And it's the -- all of that is inclusive in the range that we gave, our earnings range for 2020."
"Right. So $15 million to $25 million is the cost related to it. So if you take that out, am I thinking about that right that, that's actually a beneﬁt?","That's a right way to think about it. You could for the year if you're wondering what the net was, it's closer to the delta between those. And as you think about going beyond 2020 then cost to achieve is lower in 2021, for example."
Understood. Thanks very much.  Operator  We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks.,"Thank you, Lisa. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming AGA conference. We will now conclude our ﬁrst quarter 2019 earnings call. Have a great day.  Operator  This concludes CenterPoint Energy's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.
