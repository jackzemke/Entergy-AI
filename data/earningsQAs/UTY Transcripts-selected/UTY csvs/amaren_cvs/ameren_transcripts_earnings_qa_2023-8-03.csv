Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks so much for the time. I appreciate it. Thanks for all the comments. Maybe just kicking this thing oﬀ on the Rush Island side of the equation, just with the book value, it seems like that's $550 million. Can you comment a little bit on the size of the securitization and maybe, the oﬀset to that, if you will, when you think about the additional transmission rate-based opportunities and otherwise you articulated, just thinking about the timing and the net puts and takes here, if you will?","Yes. Good morning, Julien. I appreciate the question. This is Michael. Yeah, from an overall amount, I mean, again, we provide that book value of $550 million, again, this will be, probably a year from now. But you should think roughly in those lines, I mean, around $500 million would be some of the depreciation, et cetera, that'll occur there's another couple of items that get incorporated into that, like inventory, et cetera, but around $500 million.  And, yes, I think as we've talked about in the past, I mean, we have a lot of ﬂexibility here in terms of what we do with that, in terms of additional investments. It's really not restricted. It just really needs to go back into infrastructure. We obviously can use it to buy back and debt and other things as well. But, I mean, given our capital plan, there's lots to do there.  I think from a timing perspective, that's what -- we're being very thoughtful about, trying to determine the actual retirement date itself, get this, well in advance of that to give us plenty of time to make sure that we continue to replace that rate base over time and avoid any sort of earnings hit there. Hopefully that helps."
"No, it does. Absolutely. Thank again. And then just when you think about the oﬀsets here, just to push a little bit further on that, right? Rush Island, okay, securitization when you're out. Obviously, you alluded to a few diﬀerent things there. Transmission probably being the single most notable element of what you talked about a moment ago.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Can you maybe elaborate a little bit what HB 3445, if I got the number right, does? And then separately, just on timing for Tranche 2, I mean, what opportunity do you see there as well, right? I mean, and/or competitive pieces from Tranche 1, just trying to think about like, again, the emphasis on the puts, and especially the opportunities.","Hey, Julien, this is Marty. Hey, thanks again for your questions. Just to ﬁrst tack on to what Michael said, and then answer some of your speciﬁc questions. But when we planned out our capital expenditures for this ﬁve years, and we looked at the timing and amount on a year-by- year basis, we were thoughtful about the potential timing of this Rush Island closure and securitization ﬁling.  And so within that, we had already timed some of our capital expenditures in a thoughtful manner to as Michael said, ensure that as Rush Island comes out of rate base that we don't have any kink, if you will, in the trajectory of our rate base growth and our earnings growth. So some of that's already baked into our plan, Julien, I guess ﬁrst and foremost.  Now, you did ask about, some of the transmission investment and speciﬁcally about the legislation coming through Illinois, the transmission eﬃciency and cooperation law, which was HB 3445 that you referenced. There, as we explained in our prepared remarks, the General Assembly passed that legislation in May of this year and now it's really on the governor's desk for his potential signature.  So I got to the governor on in late June, June 22nd in a 60 days, which means the decision deadline for the governor is August 21st. And if you were to sign that, that would mean then that the one Tranche 1 project in Illinois would come to us and then any Tranche 2 projects that were approved in the ﬁrst half of '24 that's our expectation, but anytime in 2024 would also come down to the incumbent transmission owner.  Now the governor's expressed some concerns about that legislation, so it's unsure what action he will take. I'll tell you that supporters of the bill including ourselves continue to share the beneﬁts of the legislation and hopefully addresses concerns. If he signs the law, obviously, our bill obviously becomes law, and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, if he takes no action, that bill becomes law as well. So we'll see what action he ultimately takes, but we continue to believe that right of ﬁrst refusal is really in the best interest of our customers and the residents of the state of Illinois.  Then you just mentioned on overall what MISO is doing in terms of these projects. Again, as MISO is evaluating what projects might come out of Tranche 2. I will say there that we continue to believe that the work that they're doing points to an overall portfolio that would be larger than what they approved in part of Tranche 1.  And that's really because as they've gone through this analysis, one of the things obviously that's come to fruition is the IRA legislation and in D.C., which means that, we expect more renewables than had previously been expected. And so, MISO is planning towards something that's between sort of a future two and future three. And again, we expect that they'll continue to work through that. It's premature to say exactly how large that portfolio will be or exactly   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   what transmission projects may fall into our service territories in Illinois or Missouri. But MISO continues to believe that they'll approve those projects in the ﬁrst half of next year."
"Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the thoughtful response, guys. Really appreciate it. Take care.","Thanks, Julien."
Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Paul."
"So Just to follow-up on Julien's questions about the ROFR. I know that you guys are involved in, I apologize, but what I was wondering is that the Supreme Court and this 5th Circuit decision regarding the ROFR in Texas, do you think that could have any wider implications in the country if it's allowed to stand?","Julien, sorry, Paul, I apologize. Paul, it's -- yeah, it's okay. I apologize again. But, look, it's -- some of the actions have been taken in various states, seem to be particular to the way that legislation was passed or -- and so, look, we're going to continue to pursue it. We think that if the governor were to sign this into law it would be applicable and applicable to as I said before both the MISO Tranche 1 projects as well as Tranche 2 projects that approved in 2024. So look, I guess time will tell, but I think that as we sit here today we think this would stand."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   You think it would stand, so I got you. So in other words if the 5th Circuit which is a Texas situation, you don't think it would apply to Illinois because of the individual walls that were -- because of the diﬀerences -- if I understand you correctly tell me if I'm wrong because of the diﬀerences between the Texas law and what passed in Illinois assuming that it's signed is that right?",I do believe that.
"Okay, that's great. Thanks so much.  Operator  Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan Please proceed with your question.",
"Hi, good morning.","Hey, good morning, Jeremy.     Hi, Jeremy."
"I just want to dial into Illinois a little bit more, if we could, and I know that you touched on your commentary, but just wondering if it's possible to provide any more color on updates in the Illinois electric rate case, and just maybe how the tone of conversations with regulators and stakeholders have been trending so -- recently?","Yes, I think that maybe I'll start, and perhaps Michael would want to tack on here as well, this is Marty. I think, what you heard in our prepared remarks, again, is that, we really feel like we're working constructively with stakeholders as we work through this process. Of course, this is the ﬁrst multi-year grid and multi-year rate ﬁling. And so, as to be expected, you're going to have to work through some of the mechanics.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   But ultimately, I still believe that we're going to get to a constructive outcome, something that accomplishes the policy goals that CJEA had for the state. And you'll notice that, when we started this, down this path in direct testimony, the ICC staﬀ's recommendation was about 56% of our overall ask. And through the rounds of testimony and additional support that we've been able to provide with the staﬀ, we've been able to work constructively with them to where their suggested revenue increase now is about 70% of our requests. So we've made positive progress there.  On our slides, we detailed that, there's still a diﬀerence between our recommended or requested cumulative increase and that recommended by the staﬀ. And that diﬀerence is about $131 million over that four-year period. And we broke down some of the components for you. So look, we're going to continue to, work constructively with stakeholders. And like I said, I think we'll be able to get to a constructive outcome, and importantly, that accomplishes the policy goals of CJEA. So, I don't know if you have any more speciﬁc questions, or Michael, you want to add something?     Yeah, just a couple of comments, Marty, a good overview. And I -- look, I do think the teams collectively, between us and staﬀ and others continue to work very collaboratively. Trying to really work through these issues, I think we all want the best answer, obviously, for customers, making sure that we're delivering on all of the policy objectives that Marty talked about, that CJEA is really, wanting to achieve as well.  And I think as Marty talked about, that diﬀerence today of about $131 million, about 62% of that is really tied up in ROE and cap structure. And so, there is this sort of fundamental diﬀerence on ROE today, they're still recommending the old formula that was approved under EMI which was basically 580 basis points, plus the 30-year treasury versus we really think the law says, look, it's a cost of equity and determined by the commission under their authority under the laws of the state that govern these rate reviews.  But I mean even putting that aside, I think the important thing to remember, if you took a current mark on that are we today at 580 basis points, I mean, you're -- it's something approaching 10. And I think the only other point I would make to is I think and under a kind of traditional cost of capital under like a cap and/or DCF, staﬀ did also point out I think they would have been in about 10.02%, but then reverted back to this formula. So anyway, I give you those details because I think it does kind of narrow a lot of the issues in terms of what the diﬀerence is Jeremy."
"Got it. That's very helpful and maybe to follow-up, peel back a little bit more if I can, if there is anything left that can be said here, just, speciﬁcally with regards to your rebuttal strategy on the notably lower than expected ROE the $700 million capital discrepancy, $100 million medical OPEB overfunded balance. Just wondering if you could speak to any changes in receptivity overall, given Ameren's rebuttal argument.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. Hey, Jeremy, this is Michael again. Yes. I mean, just again, to be clear, I think that receptivity has shown in the fact that I think we've closed that gap. So you continue, you referred to the $700 million gap, I'd say that gap is about $350 million today. So I mean, there's been some good work that's been done on both sides to agree that, look, here's some additional support and go ahead and accept those. That really, ultimately, Marty mentioned going from 56% to 70% of the asset, that was really a large part of that.  The other items that you noted are still out there, the post-retirement issue that we'll continue to argue for. We do think that it should be included. Customers are beneﬁting from this. It's an overfunded plan. It's throwing oﬀ gains that are actually reducing rates for customers, et cetera. We're going to continue to make those arguments, and we'll see ultimately where it goes, through the process over the next couple of months."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And one just quick last one, if I could. With the decrease in energy prices, as we've seen, has bill pressure kind of faded from the conversation with the public and policymakers, or is it still front of mind in discussion?","No, look, I mean, I think the overall backdrop is much better today. I mean, just given what's happened with commodity prices, both on the natural gas side, so you've actually already seen some of those beneﬁts start rolling through on the PGAs, et cetera. I think we've talked about that.  And then certainly, some of these capacity auctions and the corresponding energy auctions are certainly providing relief to customers. That's always a good thing to see, right, in terms of just making sure that we're trying to get the lowest possible bill for customers. So I'd say it's less of a conversation today and it's a good tailwind as we think about the future."
Got it. That makes sense. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Good morning, Sophie."
"Yes, if maybe I can chew on this Illinois situation a little more. And you provided a lot of color already, but I'm just curious if you think there's a legitimate legal argument as to why, the old formula should be used in the new framework, why the staﬀ is sticking to that old formula here?","Yes, Sophie, this is Marty. One of the things CJEA called for, in the legislation was that the cost of equity be determined consistent with commission practice and law. And we believe that means the use of traditional methods like capital asset pricing model, discounted cash ﬂow analysis, IEIMA, which was the prior legislation had some very explicit language that required the use of a formulaic.  So we've certainly argued that the intent of CJEA was for the commission to use its traditional methodology. And I would note there that, the staﬀ and their testimony as part of the Multi-Year Rate Plan, instead of that traditional CAPM and DCF kind of analysis was used that, they would get an ROE of about 10.02%, as a recommendation, and of course, in our gas rate case, that's pending the staﬀ. They're recommending a 9.89%. So Sophie, at the end of the day, that's what we're hanging our head on is that, we believe that CJEA called for the use of that kind of methodology."
"Got it. Thank you. And then maybe if I can ask a solar question, I'm just curious on your Missouri Solar Projects, particularly the ones that you're self building or participating and building them. How are you thinking about your procurement strategy with respect to potentially getting adders for them as content and things like that? Does that inﬂuence your decision as to what equipment you're going to procure for these?","Yeah, it certainly does. So as you saw on our slides in terms of our build out, we do plan to have projects that -- or build transfer agreements that are built by developers, projects that are developed to a certain point, and then we procure them and ﬁnalize the construction ourselves, and then some self-build. And certainly, we're taking a host of considerations into account when we look at, where these projects are being built and, what they're being built with.  And so if we can, take advantage of a site that provides us with incremental tax credit opportunities, we'll do that. If we can take advantage of procurement strategies that resources that allow us to maximize the value of credits, we're going to do that. So at the end of the day, our goal with this is to build a portfolio of projects that really provides good diversity, low cost for our customers, reliability for our customers, and we'll look to maximize those tax credits to   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   the extent possible to, again, deliver the lowest present value of revenue requirements for our customers."
"Great. Thank you. And do you expect to self-consume those tax credits, or would you be looking to monetize them with a third-party?","Yes, ultimately, I think it's a combination of both, Sophie. I mean, we're not sitting on a lot of credits today, but I mean, as we build into these, certainly, again, we'll be very thoughtful about it. We've been very involved in these issues on transferability and getting clariﬁcation, working through some of these rating agency issues, et cetera, but, I absolutely think that it could be a combination of both as we move forward."
Great. Thank you so much.,You bet. Thanks.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
"Hi, guys. I was worried it was going to end early. I wanted to squeeze in a couple here. Look, I wanted to come back to what was being discussed on Illinois real quickly. Do you have any thoughts about Illinois gas here? I know that's very preliminary, but it seems like there could be some conversations going into '24 on perhaps reform that might look akin to Colorado or something like that, or Minnesota at that? But you guys tell me, what were you guys hearing or seeing on any front there?","Yes, Julien, in terms of legislation for next year, I can't say that there's anything percolating right now that we're aware of or involved in. I think that right now, our focus obviously is on this Illinois Multi-Year Rate Plan on the electric side and also getting a constructive resolution of our pending Illinois gas case.  And so that's our focus right now. I know in the past there was some discussion around QIP, but of course, that's expiring at the end of this year and right now we think we're positioned well as   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   we utilize the forward rate cases in Illinois for our gas business. So really nothing to share with you on that front right now Julien."
"All right, fair enough. And obviously, you've got these new CCNs going on the Missouri side. Just any lessons learned from Boomtown, Huck, et cetera?","I don't think there any speciﬁc lessons learned. We were certainly pleased to receive the commission's authorization to move forward with Huck Finn and Boomtown and pleased with the orders received and the resolution of those. So I wouldn't say there's any speciﬁc lesson learned.  We think all four of the projects that we have proposed are excellent projects for the beneﬁt of our customers and move us along the path towards the investments that were laid out in our 2022 IRP. And we've got another IRP that we plan to ﬁle this September. And certainly, we think those projects are consistent with the path that we'll lay out as part of that IRP as well."
"Awesome. All right, guys. Super quick. Thank you.","All right. Thanks, Julien.  Operator  It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the ﬂoor back over to Marty Lyons for closing comments.     Yeah, terriﬁc. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We have a strong ﬁrst half of 2023, and we remain absolutely focused on strong execution for the remainder of this year. So we look forward to seeing many of you at conferences in the coming months, and thanks again. Have a great day.  Operator  This concludes today's conference.
