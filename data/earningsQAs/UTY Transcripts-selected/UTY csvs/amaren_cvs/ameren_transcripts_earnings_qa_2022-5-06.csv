Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy."
"Thanks for having me. Just wanted to start oﬀ with MISO long-range transmission planning here at Tranche 1. Just wondering if there is any way that you could quantify what the opportunity set might be speciﬁc to Ameren here, trying to get a sense for how big that could be in your mind?","Yeah, Jeremy. I appreciate the question. Look, as we said in the prepared remarks, we certainly believe we're well positioned for projects that MISO has outlined that cross through our Missouri and Illinois footprints, but as we sit here today, we don't want to get ahead of the MISO in terms of their overall approval of the projects or the designation of which ones are brownﬁeld or greenﬁeld projects. So, we do expect that when they approve these projects in July, we expect that they will designate which ones are brownﬁeld, (inaudible) indicate which   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   transmission owner has been assigned those projects so, and I would just say stay tuned as I said in the February call, we expect to have more to discuss on our Q2 earnings call."
"Got it. Will eagerly await that. And just want to see that there is some new development in Missouri as well as it relates to PISA and just wondering if that comes through, what your thoughts would be there as far as PISA ﬂexibility in how that impacts the Ameren's planning?","Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy. Yeah, we were actually very pleased that yesterday the Legislature did pass Senate Bill 745, which is great. That's a bill that really extends the longevity of the Smart Energy Plan that we have in Missouri. And so we're very appreciative of the strong support of the Legislature with regard to that legislation and I think it's a recognition that the investments that we've been making in Missouri have really been producing good beneﬁts for our customers in terms of safety and reliability of the service that we provide and the fact that we're really scratching the surface in terms of the investments that we need to replace aging infrastructure and modernize our equipment throughout our Missouri footprint.  I think it's also a recognition of the economic development beneﬁts associated with that legislation. We are having a positive impact as we invest on our economies through the creation of jobs, we concentrate on using Missouri vendors substantially for the things that we procure and the things that we invest in, and there is some great economic development incentives rates associated with this legislation that help Missouri businesses grow as well as attract Missouri businesses to the state. So, we're really excited about the legislature passing Senate Bill 745. Tt now heads to the Governor's desk for signature and we're excited to be able to extend the beneﬁts of the Smart Energy Plan prospectively."
Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one if I could on a similar note recent eminent domain legislation Missouri. Could you comment on the implications for greenbelt MISO or anything else as far as investment that could be related to Ameren and the state going forward there?,"Yeah. I think, I don't think with respect to that legislation that there are any immediate impacts other than making sure that as we move forward in time to the extent that there are greenﬁeld transmission projects that owners of agricultural properties are compensated fairly for, for their property. I think that's the primary impact going forward."
Got it. I'll leave it there.Thank you.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.,
"Hey, good morning. This is Darius[ph] on for Julian. Thanks for the time. Maybe just on the proposed multi-year rate plans for Illinois Electric. I know it's somewhat early in the process still, but can you maybe discuss a little bit about what type of performance metrics are being considered as you go through that workshop proﬁt?","Yeah, you bet. Good morning, this is Michael Moehn. I would say things are moving along just ﬁne there and a lot of constructive conversations, workshops, et cetera, There are a number of diﬀerent paths that are occurring, there's one associated with the performance metrics, I'll give you a few details there. There is one around a multi-year grid plan et cetera, and so I think they're all moving along as we sort of anticipated last year and so nothing we see that's concerning.  With respect to the performance metrics themselves, it really is kind of the standard stuﬀ that you would think about from like a reliability standpoint. So, system average of days of disruption, you're looking at customer metrics in terms of customer response time on calls, et cetera. So kind of standard stuﬀ. Right now, we are advocating for about 24 basis points, so there's about 8 diﬀerent metrics and ascribing 3 basis points to each one of those metrics. Everything still should be on track to conclude here by September of this year and then at that point in time we make the decision, and as we've said before, we see ourselves opting into that and then the multi-year rate plan we need to be ﬁling in January of '23.  That help?"
"That does help. That's very helpful. Appreciate it. And maybe just one other one on the equity ﬁnancing. I just want to conﬁrm that the the forward agreement that you guys executed for your funding in '22 that takes oﬀ requirements for the full year other than the drip. And then also the amount under the forward agreement, that's part of the 750 included under the ATM program. Is that accurate?","Yeah, you got both of those correct. (Inaudible) $300 million that we have sold for that does take care of the requirements here that we outlined in February for 2022 and then that is part of that 750, that 750 should get us through the end of 2023."
"Okay, great, thank you for clarifying that. I'll leave it here.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",You bet.  Operator  Our next question is coming from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"Marty, if you could, I'd like to maybe touch on Illinois, the bill and kind of the reliability backdrops seems to be a little bit noisy amid sort of the year over year jump in PRA costs, planned retirements under (inaudible) and just the general concerns that obviously is coming from some of the C&I customers. I guess how do you sort of see this kind of resolving in the next couple of years especially as you are looking to go through multi-year rate plans in the interim?","Yes, sure, there's certainly a lot there. I think, ﬁrst of all, backdrop to your question is that recently, we've been seeing higher power prices here in the Midwest and then recently, as a result of the MISO capacity auction, we also saw capacity prices clear at high prices really at cost of new entry and those higher costs of power prices as well as the capacity prices then will be borne by Illinois customers. Obviously, we know it's a retail choice state, typically what we've seen is that various retail electric suppliers have suppled about 60% to 65% of our customers and then around 30% to 35% have procured their power through us, but when they do, of course, it's really the Illinois Power Agency that does the procurement of the power and the capacity and as they've reported those prices were elevated and, therefore, some of our customers are going to see meaningful increases in their bills starting here in June. So I think ﬁrst of all, concern for our customers. We're trying to make sure that we provide education about the impact of these higher prices, so that people know what to expect and they can take actions accordingly. And we're also oﬀering bill assistance where needed as well as, of course, reinforcing the opportunities under our energy eﬃciency programs, which are robust in the state.  And then some customers obviously will be still taking power through local (inaudible) aggregation programs, things of that nature that may actually not see bill increases immediately, but we are certainly concerned about those customers. Then, more broadly, I think   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   you say, how does this resolve itself. I think that ﬁrst of all as we go into the summer, there are concerns about just reliability. I would say when you see prices clear (inaudible), it's a sign that the resources to supply the load with cushion are tight.  So, we expect that MISO will be tight this summer, we expect that the MISO itself that is ultimately responsible for ensuring grid reliability and certainly going to be doing everything they can working with stakeholders as we head into warm weather situations to ensure that every possible resource is available to supply customers and certainly we'll be doing all we can as a company, especially when we look at our Missouri Energy Resources to make sure that they are available and ready to go in the hot weather months and so. Again, I think that's some of the eﬀorts in the short-term  In the long-term, we'll see how this plays out, I mean with capacity prices clearing account, it's a clear signal to the market that more is needed in terms of dispatchable energy resources to meet our load and we'll have to see how all of that plays out, and we'll be working with stakeholders as appropriate throughout all of that to help mitigate that situation in the long- term. As it relates to our multi-year rate plan, as Michael said, we were sort of marching towards a ﬁling here in January, related to that multi-year rate plan that then the Illinois Commerce Commission would rule on towards the end of '23 with implementation in 2024.  As I said on the prepared remarks, we still have signiﬁcant aging infrastructure in Illinois, the investments that we're making are producing improved reliability for our customers, ensuring we provide safe and reliable service. And I think even what we're seeing in terms of the tight market situation, Illinois is an appropriate backdrop for continued investment in infrastructure, both transmission as well as distribution infrastructure. So, we still see the need for the investments that we're making in Illinois and don't see any impact right now on the multi-year rate plan ﬁling itself and moving forward with that from the backdrop that we discussed."
"Got it. That's perfect. And then lastly for me, obviously, you have the opportunity to earn on some of your generation length in MISO and ﬂow that back to Missouri customers. Are you seeing that today and any sort of quantiﬁcation of the potential beneﬁt to customers there?","No real quantiﬁcation of the beneﬁts. You're right. We in Missouri right now have length in terms of our generation proﬁle and to the extent that power prices are elevated provides an opportunity for us to enhance margins and all of those margins, 95% of them, ﬂow back to our customers in the form of reduced rate. So, no quantiﬁcation of that right now, but you're right in terms of your thoughts on how that works."
"Okay, terriﬁc. Thanks guys. I'll stop there. Appreciate it.",Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Thank you.  Operator   The next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Paul."
"So, congratulations on getting the (inaudible) stuﬀ over the gold line. And, just to follow-up on Shar's question on Illinois, you say that it doesn't have an impact on the company's outlook on the needs for your plans, but I am wondering does the concerns at least I've been seeing by the Illinois legislators and I assume perhaps others in Illinois, does it lead to perhaps a better, a more receptive attitude perhaps to more of a buy into what you've been proposing on the part of policy makers perhaps in Illinois or do you think it's pretty much the same situation we just sort of seeing, I don't know, sort of legislative drama if you follow what I am saying?","Yeah. Paul, it's hard to say at this point, I would say it's premature to conclude, one way or another. I think what we're seeing right now is folks really digesting the news in terms of the higher power and capacity prices and what that means in terms of its implications for policy going forward, we will see, I think it's premature."
"Okay. And then with respect to just the Green belt legislation, it sounds like this is probably going to enable Green belt to get build, and I'm wondering if Green belt, how green a transmission project like that or others might impact your plans for infrastructure development if you have a big line like that crossing the area, what have you?","Well, with respect to Green belt, obviously that's a project that's been underway for quite some time and has been progressing and we had certainly anticipated that. One of the things that we've talked about in the past as last year or I should say in the fall of 2020 when we ﬁled our integrated resource plan, one of the things we did is assess the potential to utilize some of that capacity and wind in Kansas to meet some of our renewable goals and as part of our integrated resource plan so. I think the biggest thing for us, Paul, as we think about that project and we   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   think about the update to our integrated resource plan that we'll be ﬁling in June, is just the continuing optionality associated with that resource or those resources in potentially fulﬁlling the needs of our integrated resource plan, so that's something that we will continue to assess as we move forward."
"Okay, great. Thanks so much and have a good weekend.",Thanks.  Operator  (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning, Marty. Good morning, Mike.",Good morning.
"Hey. Like in the Blues, I didn't think (inaudible) here, so I'm rooting for them until they meet the Rangers, but just hopefully, two quick questions, I guess. One, if I think about Missouri and Illinois both Right of First Refusal states and if the transmission lines are greenﬁeld, does that mean they are competitively bid maybe, just wondering what's the distinction you're making between brownﬁeld and greenﬁeld?","I think you generally got it. Missouri and Illinois though are not Right of First Refusal states which is why that distinction between brownﬁeld and greenﬁeld is important. So, if it's a brownﬁeld which generally you should think of as new transmission on existing right of way, that we would then expect to be assigned to us as a transmission owner and then the question will be are there segments of projects that are greenﬁeld, which might be subject to competitive bidding and that's what we'll wait to see as it comes out of the MISO's July approval of these projects."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And then, just another follow-up here. Moving to Illinois and I guess maybe 30-year treasury and I think right now it's about 90 basis points above expectation I think for the year where you guys had thought it was going to be. I calculate that as kind of like a $0.07 tailwind, I guess are there any headwinds I think about that maybe could potentially oﬀset that beneﬁt, when I'm thinking about the year or maybe my numbers wrong on from where the expectation was of the 30 year versus where is that now?","Yeah, you got the estimate right, in February, we estimated 225, now you got to remember it's an average over the course of the year. So I think it averaged about 225 over the ﬁrst quarter, so just keep that in mind, but look it's in a good spot, I think what we indicated in our guidance for the remainder of the year, we're assuming it averages about to 27, so if you average that with the ﬁrst quarter, then that would be at around to 29 or so.  So, you're right, it's certainly elevated relative to that, if you think about it. In terms of things that could oﬀset it, I mean obviously along with that comes an increased ﬁnancing cost that we've been incurring a little bit on some of the short-term debt, other things. But look, it's a good tailwind to have at this point, There is still a lot of the year left. We are a lot of execution to do, we're going to stay focused on and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves."
"Great, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter.","Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. At this time, we reached end of our question-and-answer session. Now, I'll turn the ﬂoor back to Mr. Lyons for closing comments.     Yeah. Hey, thank you all for joining us today. We're really pleased we had a strong start to 2022 and we certainly, as Michael said, remain focused on continuing to deliver throughout the year for our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. I'd like to invite all of you to attend our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which is being held on May 12th and we look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Financial Forum in the next couple of weeks.
