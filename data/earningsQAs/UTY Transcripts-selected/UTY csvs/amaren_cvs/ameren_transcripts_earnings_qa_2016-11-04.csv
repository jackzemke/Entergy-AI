Question,Answer
"Yeah. Hi, thank you. I was wondering if the sale of the New Madrid smelter will have – how that would impact your case and ongoing operations and recoveries?","Hey, Gregg, this is Warner. Pleased to have you join us. So in terms of the sales in New Madrid smelter, frankly not sure if that has really any impact on the case. This tail has been completed, not sure exactly what the future is of the smelter at this stage, but we don't see it having any particular impact on the case. Michael Moehn, our President of Ameren Missouri Operations, any further comment on there?   I think that's right, Warner. I mean, we're in the process of sitting down with the new owners, trying to really understand what those plans are. My sense is that it's a long recovery, and as Warner said, I don't think there's an impact on this current case.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like turn the ﬂoor back to management for closing comments.   Yeah. We appreciate the comment, question, Greg, and I know a number of you're probably holding your questions for next week. We, as management team look forward to seeing many of you down at EEI at the ﬁnancial conference and look forward to having further dialog and answering your questions.
