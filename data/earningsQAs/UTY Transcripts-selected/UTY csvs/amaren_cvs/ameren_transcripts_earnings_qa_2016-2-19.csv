Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Julien.     Hello, Julien."
"Hey. So, let's just walk ﬁrst through here some of the assumptions baked into your new long- term CAGR, if you will. Can you clarify the sales growth embedded in that? And speciﬁcally here what I'm getting at is the latest energy eﬃciency program. Is that factored in and to what extent does that impact your assumptions in the program? And then separately, just to be very clear about this, no cash taxes through that new period as well, correct? And then perhaps a third point, if you will, what are the assumptions baked in in terms of treasuries in that 5% to 8% CAGR?","Sure, Julien. All good and reasonable questions. So, let's start with the growth rates. As we announced today, 5% to 8% expected compound annual EPS growth from 2016 through 2020. Obviously, the key there, the big driver is rate base growth. And as we announced today, we've got 6.5% compound annual rate base growth planned for the period 2015 to 2020, which obviously is smack in the middle of that earnings per share growth range as well. And that rate base growth is the foundation. And we'd say that – I'd say that that growth rate of 5% to 8% incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions.  As you know that, over time, in our planning, we look at consensus estimates for growth in the 30-year treasury rates, which today, I think economists are expecting it to rise about 200 basis points between now and 2020. But when we look at that growth rate range, it accommodates a number of alternatives both that increase in treasury rates over time as well as even a low interest rate environment like the one we're in persisting over this period of time. So, it incorporates a range of outcomes in terms of treasury rate assumptions ROEs, regulatory decisions, changes in economic conditions, et cetera.  In terms of sales growth, our – embedded in our forecast over this time, it's about ﬂattish sales growth through this period. But for the energy eﬃciency programs, we would expect to see modest growth. But as a result of the programs that we've got in place, we do expect it to be pretty ﬂattish over this period of time."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Got it.,Did I miss some of your questions?
"Then in separate – oops, sorry, go for it.","I was going to say, did I miss any of your questions?"
Cash taxes just to be clear.,"Yeah. Just to be clear, with bonus depreciation, which, as I mentioned on the call, had an impact of more than $900 million. We now don't expect to be a Federal cash tax payer until 2021."
"That's what I thought, excellent. And then a – just a brief follow-up if you will. What is the expected impact on the balance of your customers given what's going on with Noranda, how signiﬁcant of customer inﬂation are we talking about here or potentially?","Yeah. I think it's premature really – and it's really premature I'd say get into that. We'll – and as we mentioned on the call, we're going to obviously watch the Noranda situation closely, pending conclusion of the legislative process, expect to ﬁle a rate case, and I think at that point we'll see what that impact might look like."
"Great. Last detail, since you mentioned it, what's the test year on that rate case you're thinking?","Really premature to get into that too, Julien. Look, I think that what's happened with Noranda and their outages are very recent, certainly unfortunate. We're watching the situation closely and making plans for the potential of ﬁlling of that rate case, but it'd be premature get into what the test year would be at this time.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Clearly, as we do think about that case, we are thinking about the situation with Noranda and also thinking about capital expenditures, rate base that we have planned for later this year, as well as other cost drivers of our business. So all of those things are not going into our thoughts about the timing of that rate case, and as you mentioned things like test year considerations."
"I apologize. One slight clariﬁcation. You said 200 bps over the period, that's 200 bps over the 3.2% one you embedded in your current year?","No. I'm saying that I think where economists are today, Julien, out in 2020 is around that 4.8%. So, it's about not 200 basis points above where the current 30-year Treasury really sits today."
Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.,
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Paul.     Good morning, Paul."
"On the long-term growth rate, if you could – how does the Missouri legislation – proposed legislation, ﬁt into this? Are we talking – I mean, in the 2% rate-based growth, does that include – how does – I guess let me ask you this, what's included in terms of the potential legislative outcome in the growth rate? That's what I'm asking.","Yeah. Sure, let me – Paul, let me talk about that. Consistent with the guidance that we've provided in the past, and as you look at this new guidance, it is not dependent upon any   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   change in the regulatory framework in Missouri. We've had – we had about 2% rate-based growth guidance in our prior guidance. We've got about 2% rate-based growth incorporated into this guidance.  And, as we mentioned on the call, have incorporated into the capital expenditures in Missouri some incremental cost of compliance with environmental regulations. But it doesn't – the growth rate that we've got here, both in terms of the rate base, as well as the earnings growth, isn't dependent upon some change in the Missouri regulatory framework."
"Before, you guys have indicated, and I think you sort of suggested this today, that your rate- based growth has been stronger in Illinois because of sort of the regulatory treatment, which it seems that the Missouri legislation might give you something similar to that. So, is there upside potentially within this growth rate or would it be within the growth rate if you got the Missouri thing, if you follow me?  In other words, how much rate-based growth in Missouri might have increased if you were to get the legislation you're proposing?","Yeah. Sure. It's a reasonable question. I think it's certainly premature to speculate whether legislation would – how much that might impact capital expenditure plans. I'd go back – we feel very good about 5% to 8% earnings per share growth rate and a 6.5% rate base growth, great.  I mean, we think those are our very solid growth rates compared to our peers and to your point to the extent that we do have a change in the Missouri regulatory framework, I think we have to step back and assess whether to the extent that we did have additional capital expenditures, would they be incremental to this growth rate or would we modify the capital expenditure plans we have and still deliver I'd say within this 5% to 8% earnings growth range.  So, look, if that does take place, if there is a change in the framework; we'll step back and we'll update as appropriate.  Thanks. And Paul, this is Warner too. I would just simply – I agree of course with everything that Marty just said. But no doubt that the one thing that we've been very clear about that if we had the ability to enhance this framework to support investment in Missouri, we will do so. And how that ﬁts into the context of the big picture plan? As Marty said, that's something we'll step back and assess.  But we would expect to put more money to work in Missouri and we think there are signiﬁcant opportunities to do this to address aging infrastructure, to address things like greener forms of renewable energy, to address things like cyber and physical security, go down the line, including some of the advanced technologies that we're putting to work over in Illinois. These are things that Missouri needs and things that we will clearly be looking at.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"And just to circle back on Julien's question with respect to the interest rate, the Treasury. It looks like right now that we're talking about 30-year around 2.6. And I guess you guys have a higher number for this year. And it doesn't look like it's that big of a change in EPS. But just in general, how should we think about your projections versus what we're seeing right now? You said these economists are projecting this. But just to – could you just give us a little more of a ﬂavor for that?","Yeah, sure, Paul. So in the slides to your point, we give a sensitivity around Illinois ROEs that a 50 basis point change in the ROEs is about 2.5% for our Illinois electric distribution business. So to your point, Treasury rates today are lower than what we have embedded in the guidance. But we've had that situation before as well. And certainly we had been able to deliver on our overall earning's guidance.  And so that $0.025, as I mentioned, for 50 basis points, $0.025 variance is not a large number. But we continue to monitor it and we'll continue to manage our business around it. In terms of the longer term, as I was saying, it's a 5% to 8% earnings growth target. But the foundation, Paul, is the 6.5% rate base growth. And that 6.5% rate base growth, as I said, is smack dab in the middle of that range and that really anchors that growth.  And as I said then, there's a range of Treasury rates around it. Certainly, not meaning to imply that we were dependent upon a 200 basis point rise in the Treasury to hit the midpoint of that guidance. The upper end of that range, the lower end of that range incorporates higher Treasury rates or perhaps a current or lower treasury rate. So there's a range of Treasury rate assumptions that go into that 5% to 8%. The midpoint again is anchored on that rate base growth, at 6.5%."
"Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Sure, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Good morning, Stephen.     Good morning, Stephen."
"Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I just had one on energy eﬃciency. Marty, I think you laid out, I believe, that eﬀectively in the plan that it should be a relatively neutral impact. There's some negative in terms of impacts to demand, but you also have an incentive. How do you think about that, the mechanics of that going forward relative to historical experience with it? In other words, is it fairly balanced in terms of the upside versus the downside? Or, for example, is there a potential for upside given the $27 million potential incentive? How should we think about that, sort of, as you bake that into your plan?","Sure, Steve, I appreciate that. Yeah, I would say the $27 million is there to be an incentive for us. It's our goal, as we go into these energy eﬃciency programs, to really have these perform for our customers. And we are incentivized to achieve the goals. And we look forward to hitting the marks to be able to earn that $27 million performance incentive.  Between now and then, the way the new program is designed is to really be earnings neutral. That, as we get these programs underway here in 2016, that to the extent that there are negative impacts on our sales, that those will be oﬀset by revenues provided under the program. We wanted to be clear on the call and hopefully we were that in 2016, 2017, 2018, those programs shouldn't produce either a net positive or a negative result. This should be earnings neutral over that period. But like I said, we're incentivized to provide good programs to our customers, valuable programs to our customers. And if we're successful in doing that, which we expect to be, we've put ourselves in a position to earn that performance incentive in 2019."
"Understood. And so, Marty, that performance incentive would be a one-time payment in 2019. Is that correct?",That's right.
"Got you. Okay, that's all I had. Thank you very much.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Thank you.     Thanks, Stephen.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead."
When would you ﬁle for an accounting order around Noranda and when could you possibly start to collect revenues or book revenues?,"Yeah, Paul, this is Marty. I think the ﬁrst part of your question may have gotten cut oﬀ. Can you repeat the full question?"
Sure. When do you expect to ﬁle for an accounting order in Missouri related to Noranda and when do you think you could start oﬀsetting the losses?,"Yeah. Paul, this is Marty again. In the call, I think what we had clariﬁed was that there are a couple of diﬀerent things. One has to do with the temporary nature of this impact. And that ultimately, it's a temporary impact because as we ﬁle a rate case and we incorporate the reduction in sales to Noranda, then that impact would go away in terms of the overall revenue requirements and how our revenues would be formulated in the context for a rate case.  What an accounting authority order would potentially allow you to do would be able to defer the impact of these lost revenues between now and when rates are reset for potential recovery of those costs. And we could either do that as an accounting authority order, or also, as we pointed out in the call, you could make that request as part of a rate case.  So, there's a couple of alternatives there. I think one key is that it's not that – there's really no time limit on that, meaning if you were to ﬁle an AAO, it wouldn't just be for prospective impacts. You could also request, as part of that to recover the lost revenues from the date the incident ﬁrst happened forward in time. So, there's not really a clock ticking on that.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So, we'll consider those options. As I've said before, certainly very unfortunate what's happened with Noranda here in January with the outage. They still have one pot line running. They have announced that they do expect to shut that down. But I think we'll let that play out and see ultimately what does happen, and then consider these regulatory options that I just laid out."
"So, there is $0.13 of potential upside to guidance if you're able to get some sort of relief?","Theoretically, yes. I think the important thing to know when we think about this being temporary is that we do expect to – pending completion of this legislative process, we'd expect to ﬁle a rate case. And ultimately, that's what will stem these ﬁnancial impacts.  But yes, theoretically, through the AAO or through the request as part of a rate case, these lost revenues could be recouped. However, you should know that, that may not occur – to the extent it does occur, it may not occur in 2016. But again to the extent you requested this as part of a rate case, it would be more likely that to the extent that those – the collection of those revenues was granted by the commission that, that earnings impact would be reﬂected in 2017."
Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,
"Hey, guys. Congrats on a good year. Just looking through the bill in Missouri, and I only looked at the Senate one. So if the House one is very diﬀerent, my apologies. There's not a lot of detail to the bill. And so – and a lot of times, bills will – a placeholder will get published or put out and the bill will get ﬂeshed out over time. Can you talk to us about, like, what some of the incremental detail you would be seeking to add to that bill would be?","Good morning, Michael. This is Warner, and I'll start and then Michael Moehn can certainly jump in. I think a couple things to think about. Number one, the sponsors of the bill, they thoughtfully considered whether to immediately ﬁle a comprehensive bill, or as you say, it's a – I would say an outline of key objectives. I think that the objective there is to follow the outline to give stakeholders the ability to provide input into certain approaches that may be utilized in the bill.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And so, that's really where things stand today. I think the outline is pretty clear in some of the areas that will be covered. But the speciﬁcs are still being worked out. And so, I think as you saw, we talked about we're clearly going to be focused on issues around addressing regulatory lag especially those associated with investment. That's outlined in the bill. Certainly, important consumer beneﬁts, whether it be in the forms of earnings caps, rate caps or even performance standards similar to types of things we've seen successfully employed in Illinois. And I think importantly what's embedded in all of that is strong oversight will continue by the Missouri Public Service Commission.  So, it would be premature to go into details. I think those kind of speciﬁcs that are reﬂected in the bill as it stands today, I would expect to see in the bill when it's ﬁled in its entirety. And so, when that is out there we'll have a greater ability to kind of go in more detail with you and certainly the rest of the investors."
"Got it. And one other thing, when you're thinking about the potential and, Warner, you mentioned there are lots of opportunities for investment, when you think about the potential, is it kind of on the margin or incremental or is it signiﬁcant and structural? I mean, when I say signiﬁcant and structural, I think what you've done in Illinois since the 2011 law passed has been a structural change in the investment opportunity in a single state given a change in regulation. Do you view Missouri as being a potential another Illinois or just having an opportunity for a marginal uptick in investment?","Michael, this is Warner again. Look, I think at the end of the day and we've had these conversations. I think there are several alternatives that are being considered out there. And we've been clear in our conversations that we've seen the Illinois framework and how well it's working and how it's delivering for customers in the State of Illinois. That's part of the conversation.  And of course there are other pieces of the conversation that are being discussed among stakeholders as well. But, no doubt, we see the signiﬁcant structural changes happening in Illinois and we see the signiﬁcant beneﬁts that's been delivered. Those kind of conversations are clearly being had."
"Got it. Thanks, Warner. Much appreciated.","Sure. You're welcome, Michael.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glen Pruitt from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead."
"Hey, guys. My question is regarding your transmission investment. So of the $3 billion that you have planned through 2020, I see that there's about $690 million planned for 2016. How back- loaded do you expect the remaining investment to be?","Glen, it's a reasonable question. I don't really have the full layout of the transmission. I mean, I'll tell you that overall though, on our capital expenditure plan that it's pretty evened out over this period of time. I mean, obviously, one of the things that we're looking to do over time is to be able to achieve steady rate base growth.  And so, when you look at that $11 billion of overall capital expenditures that are planned for the ﬁve-year period and you look at our CapEx today, which is about $2.155 billion, it's a little below the average of $11 billion of ﬁve-year spend.  So over this period of time, we're looking to spend, in any given year, I'd say anywhere between that $2.155 billion up to about $2.350 billion over this period of time. And obviously, again, trying to achieve as best we can steady rate base growth through time. Obviously, in Missouri where you've got periodic rate cases it can be a little bit lumpier, but again, over time, the goal is to have that steady rate base growth through the deployment of capital."
Okay. Great. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Russo from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.,
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Brian.     Hi, Brian.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"In the event that you don't get the accounting order to cover Noranda's lost sales, how should we look at kind of the general rate case strategy? I believe you said the legislature ends in May. So that would probably – with or without legislation, that would kind of trigger the rate case and then assuming what, like, a 12-month rate case process, that puts you somewhere towards later ﬁrst quarter of 2017 or early second quarter for new rates?","Sure. Let me – the rate case processes in Missouri take 11 months. So you're right about when sort of the legislative session ends. So we'll be thinking about those things as I mentioned, thinking about, again, like I said rate base additions, the timing of cost increase and things like that.  One other thing to think about with respect to Noranda, and we mentioned this on the call, is just how their rates are structured. Their rate is lower during the period of October through May at around $31 per megawatt hour. And then from June to September, it's around $46 per megawatt hour. So that margin diﬀerential and the impact on us is something we would be mindful of too as we look out to the conclusion of a rate case and when new rates would go into eﬀect in the 2016 timeframe. So those are all things that we'd be mindful of."
Thank you. And I think earlier you mentioned that embedded in your guidance is about 50 basis points of lag in the Missouri jurisdiction. Is that like the historical norm for you guys? Or is that due to kind of the temporary or the O&M containment eﬀorts that you're pursuing?,"Sure. What we said in the call and is on the slide is that we expect to earn within 50 basis points of the allowed, and it really is a factor of some of the lag that we are experiencing in 2016. I mentioned the eﬀects of some of the energy eﬃciency programs and some of the headwind we've got there.  Some of the other things we identiﬁed obviously on the call, just ongoing depreciation. Transmission cost, you recall that formerly we had transmission cost in the FAC, but they came out in the last rate case. So as those costs have increased, that is creating lag, and then property taxes. And so all of those things are creating headwinds as we roll into 2016.  I mentioned we have worked very hard and we have plans in place to oﬀset a good part of that with reductions in year-over-year operations and maintenance cost. And obviously, we don't give all of those details on the pluses and minuses on the call, but did want to provide you some frame of reference that net of all of these things – and again, if you exclude the Noranda impact, but you do it, go ahead and include a normalized level of Callaway refueling cost, then we would expect to earn within 50 basis of that allowed. Our goal going forward, as it has been in the past, is try to earn as close to our allowed as we can. That remains our goal.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Feliks Kerman from Visium. Please go ahead.,
"Hi, guys. How are you doing?","Good morning, Feliks."
Just two quick questions on the Noranda thing. I know it's a temporary thing in nature. But can you just walk us through the high-level math on how are you getting to the $0.13?,"Yes. Sure. This is Marty again. In terms of the $0.13, we do have the opportunity as a result of the fuel adjustment cost to be able to retain margins on oﬀ-system interchange sales that we make as a result of the reduced sales volumes to Noranda. So when we look at it, we look at the diﬀerential between the rates of that Noranda would have been paying and the price that we can get for those kilowatt hours in the wholesale markets.  When we look at that, an around-the-clock price today at Indy Hub is probably around $27 per megawatt hour. But there's also a negative basis diﬀerential to our plants. And frankly, over the past couple of years, that's been running 15% to 18% kind of a basis diﬀerential. So those are the factors that we take into consideration and the calculation of that expected a 13% drag on 2016 earnings."
"So, it does assume some oﬀset from the wholesale sales?","Yes, it does. Okay."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And then can you just provide us a little bit of guidance on how that falls through the quarters in 2016?,I guess the best I can tell you when you – through the quarters is just again to go back to Noranda's rate and then you can go ahead and look at power prices. But the Noranda rate again between October and May is about $31 per megawatt hour and then during June to September it's about $46 per megawatt hour. So that's how their rates break down and then you've got to compare it to what you think the oﬀ-system sales price might be for each of those periods.
"Okay. So, there is some lumpiness, that should be the assumption, right?","Yeah. There is some lumpiness and if you just looked at the Noranda revenues, you'd say that the bigger impact would be in those summer months."
"Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the ﬂoor back over to management for closing remarks.","This is Doug Fischer. Thank you for participating in this call.
