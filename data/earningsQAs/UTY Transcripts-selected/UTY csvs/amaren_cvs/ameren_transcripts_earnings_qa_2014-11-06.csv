Question,Answer
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul."
Just on the – I just want to check out the FERC stuﬀ a little bit here. One of the things that came in the order seemed to be sort of – they dismissed the complaint – one of the compliance issues   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   regarding the equity level. And I was wondering if you could remind us what the equity level is currently at the transmission business and whether that could be changed as result of those.,"Well, the – Paul, this is Marty. In terms of the equity level, during construction, we do have the ability to use hypothetical cap structure of equity of 56% in that cap structure, and so that is what is being used. And then as projects actually go into service, then they have the cap structure that is in whatever legal entity that they sit within. And so for example within AIC right now, the equity structure is a little north of 50% in terms of where the equity sits in that cap structure."
So there probably wouldn't be much of a change you think or could there be as a result of the FERC ruling-,I don't anticipate signiﬁcant change in the way we capitalize the business in light of the FERC's ruling.
"Okay. And then the ROE, the 50 basis points, when do you see that – I know you guys are going to ﬁle for it shortly, when do you see that coming into eﬀect? Would that be when the ROE situations ﬁnally settled?","Well, I think, we'll wait and let the ﬁlings speak for itself. It is a ﬁling, not only our own ﬁling, but with other transmission owners, and we don't want to get ahead of that ﬁling and what we're asking for there. We do think that there's some language that was in the recent FERC order reaﬃrmed that that adder is appropriate and needed. There is language in there that basically said the adder is intended to incent continued participation in the RTOs. And we think that was favorable language, supportive of our view that indeed we're eligible for that 50 basis point adder.  So that ﬁling will be made shortly and then the FERC based on history, has taken up consideration of that generally within a 60-day period. So again, we'll let the ﬁling speak for itself and certainly answer questions once it's been ﬁled."
"Okay. And then ﬁnally on the MISO-PJM, there were several opportunities you guys saw in terms of FERC Order 1000; and one of them was transmission between MISO and PJM, I believe. I was just wondering if there were any speciﬁc projects that sort of have been identiﬁed   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   and sort of the timing that you guys think you might participate in terms of such a project and just any details you have on that or if you could just elaborate on that a little bit.","Sure, Paul and I think for that question, we will let Maureen Borkowski, who is the CEO of that business, speak to that question.     Hi, Paul this is Maureen.  We've been participating actively in proposing project solutions in PJM, and in the cross-border MISO-PJM solicitations. There is actually a window that's just opened that we'll be continuing to participate in. We've proposed dozens of diﬀerent solutions to date. There are still I think one or two that are still pending for further consideration, but we're continuing to populate those project proposals as PJM opens study windows. So I'd say just stay tuned. We certainly continue to participate; and as they go through their reﬁnement process of selecting which projects move forward, we expect to have some."
"So, what's the next key data point we should think about, Maureen? What you think will be the next in terms of timing we might see more clarity as to what might actually be selected?","Well, you'll certainly the volume of proposals should be public. The window is open now. So over the next several weeks more projects will be coming in. After the ﬁrst of the year, PJM will be doing more reﬁnement in their planning processes looking at which ones meet their criteria to move forward. So I would say, ﬁrst quarter of next year, there might be some indication of which projects are moving."
"Okay, thanks so much.","Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hi guys. Just to follow up on some of Paul's questions; do you guys have any kind of indication or any kind of inclination as to how much money some of these PJM, MISO and SPP seams issues might cost? What's the size of the opportunity we're looking at here?","Michael, this is Marty. We haven't really spoken to, I'd say, the size of the opportunity broadly. We have said that we've proposed tens of projects in various regions around our service territory and whether that be with PJM, MISO, SPP, projects ranging any where individually from $50 million to $500 million. So, we have said that, but not really spoken to, I'd say universally what the breadth of the opportunity is."
You guys think a settlement in the ROE complaint is a possibility?,"The settlement in the ROE, certainly, it's a possibility. We, and I would imagine other transmission owners certainly plan to take those settlement discussions seriously, and we'll see where they take us. Ultimately, if that process does fail to produce an outcome that is appropriate or I guess is reasonable to all parties, then obviously it will go to hearing which would likely take a while. And again either way we think as we said in our prepared remarks would extend into 2015, and I would say quite possibly beyond, although I think deﬁnitely into 2015."
"And one ﬁnal question, on the IRP, could you discuss a little bit about some of the factors that are going into your decision making on plant retirements and also how much of the spending in the IRP that's beyond 2020. How much of that could theoretically and possibly be accelerated into the 2015 to 2020 range?","Yes, sure, this is Marty. I will take that one again. So, on the slide that we provided on slide 10, we laid out some of the investments that may be required as we implement our preferred plan that's laid out in the IRP. I would say generally with respect to our coal-ﬁred power plants, the goal of the IRP and something that we think is appropriate is to be able to run those plants and beneﬁt from that capacity through the end of their useful lives.  So that's one of the things that sort of a foundation of our preferred plan. But along the way as you see, investing in wind, solar, landﬁll gas and some hydro projects as laid out on slide 10 of our materials, we did break some of the potential capital expenditures down into two buckets, one bucket for the next 10 years and then the 10 years beyond that mainly because the IRP ﬁling is a 20-year look, a 20-year plan.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I would say some of the investments that are in that ﬁrst 10 years are embedded in our current capital expenditure and rate-based growth guidance that we've provided. There's some that would be incremental to that, much of that investment that 10-year period would fall into the ﬁve-year period beyond the current ﬁve-year period that we're in, so basically rate-base growth beyond the current ﬁve-year period.  As Warner discussed on the call, to the extent that the EPA's Clean Power Plan was ultimately put into eﬀect in its current form. And of course Warner spoke to the various legal and practical concerns with that plan. But as we mentioned, if it was put into place, the interim targets by 2020 with ultimate carbon reductions by 2030, we said that would have a potential impact on our customers of $4 billion.  It would also require us to invest by 2020 an incremental $2 billion in additional infrastructure and rate base. So again, we ﬁled our IRP. We're advocating for our preferred plan, but ultimately we're going to stay ﬂexible and certainly continue to engage in discussions with the EPA and other stakeholders around the Clean Power Plan."
Thank you very much. It's very helpful.  Operator  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.,
Good morning. How are you?,Hi Paul.     Good morning.
Is there any – what's the status of discussions in Missouri about a legislative ﬁx to lag? Is that just kind of dormant right now?,"Yeah, we'll let – we have with us this morning, Michael Moehn, who's the CEO of the Ameren Missouri Business, and we'll let him to provide some comments on that.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Thanks for the question. Yes, it's certainly not dormant. I mean we continue to talk to key legislators, key stakeholders about the aging infrastructure issues we have in Missouri. As I sit here today, I don't have necessarily a decision on what we're going to do going into this legislative session, but we remain committed to trying to ﬁnd ways to address that lag either through legislative – through the legislative arena or through the regulatory arena, but deﬁnitely are spending a lot of time educating folks about that issue."
And when did the session start up again?,January 2015.
"January, okay. And then just your 7% to 10% CAGR, how lumpy is that and is the biggest source of lumpiness kind of Callaway outages?","No, the 7% to 10% – this is Marty again. The 7% to 10% growth obviously is driven primarily by rate base growth. As you've seen in our rate base growth chart, about 6% rate base growth between 2013 and 2018. So, I'd say there is a little bit of lumpiness along the way that has to do with the timing of the capital expenditures.  There will be a little bit of lumpiness due to the timing of rate cases, and there will be a little bit of lumpiness as you say along the way in earnings due to the Callaway refueling outage schedule. So we've got one ongoing right now. As we mentioned on the call, we don't have one next year. And then again in 2018, we would not have one in 2018. So, as you're well aware, on an 18-month cycle for those refueling outages, but certainly there will be a little bit of lumpiness in earnings from year-to-year for the reasons I described."
And so next year we should have a $0.09 pick-up on Callaway.,"Yes, that'd be right. So we have $0.09 negative impact here in the fourth quarter from that refueling outage. There won't be one next year. So we would expect to see a $0.09 pickup for Callaway. And then as I described in the earnings drivers for next year, I referred you to that slide, there's a number of pluses and minuses for next year, but certainly that's a plus.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
And then just – you said that next year's tax rate is expected to be 38.5%.,"Yes, that's good point, I think an important one. We have an eﬀective tax rate projected for this year of 39.5% and that compares last year. We actually ﬁnished the year at about 37.5%. And so, in our third quarter and you would expect in the fourth quarter to have a little bit of a negative delta this year versus last. But next year, we expect that to trend back to 38.5%, which is frankly where our longer-term expectations are. So I think that 38.5% is a good thing to think about in terms of model."
"Okay, thank you very much.",You're welcome.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of (42:23). Please go ahead with your question.  Good morning. And my question was answered just now. Thanks.     Okay. Thanks (42:32) thank you.  Operator  The next question from line of David Paz of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.
Good morning.,"Good morning, David.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Good morning, David."
Just wanted to check on the sales growth. What was the weather-adjusted sales growth by class in the third quarter and just what you expect for the full year 2014.,"Yeah, David, that's a very good question. I appreciate you asking. And I'll give you – it's a bit of a more a long-winded answer than you might expect, but I think generally some positive trends, some positive data that we do have to report. When you look at the sales data in the statistics page, you will see a decline; of course, part of that is weather as you point out.  But part of it I think you've got to remember too you have to do with the energy eﬃciency programs we have in Missouri. In those energy eﬃciency programs, we do believe our fair and constructive programs where we are made whole for the impacts the cost and the impacts of that energy eﬃciency and even to some extent are provided incentives.  So, getting to your question though, looking at the third quarter data on a weather-normalized basis, the residential and commercial sales were down about 0.8% and the industry was down about 0.9% which on the surface, is not appealing. But when you actually again peel that back and you look at for example in Missouri, the residential weather-normalized sales are down 1.1%. But energy eﬃciency spending investment is really causing most of that excluding the energy eﬃciency impact residential sales are actually be up 1%. And again, we're being compensated for that energy eﬃciency impact.  So again, normalized for weather and energy eﬃciency up 1%. Commercial sales on a weather- normalized basis and these are year-to-date numbers by the way, that residential number. Commercial sales weather normalized is down about 0.6%. But again if you exclude the impacts of energy eﬃciency, it's pretty ﬂat.  And then in terms of our industrial sales, you recall in Missouri in the ﬁrst two quarters, we had industrial sales increases in the third quarter. We did see a little bit of a decline, but that was solely related to a dip in usage at Noranda.  And on their earnings call a couple days ago, indicated that they had some temporary production issues that I believe were probably causing that. Excluding that Noranda impact on a year-to-date basis, our industrial sales are actually up 0.5% and again normalized for energy eﬃciency are up 1.1%. So, we're really seeing growth again in Missouri in all of those classes: residential, commercial and industrial when normalizing for not only weather but for the energy eﬃciency.  In Illinois, some positive trends there; weather-normalized residential sales up 1.5%, and they've been up across all three quarters; commercial sales, up 7% year to date. And then as we've reported previously, industrial sales have been oﬀ nearly 2%. And we've gone through some of the industrial categories that factored into that in prior calls. But overall, I'd say the trends are   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   positive; and I'd say economically, we're seeing housing starts in our service territory have been in an upward trend.  Unemployment has been coming down near to national averages around 6%. Manufacturing jobs have been stable. Services jobs have been growing, those are all positive and our residential customer counts are up in both states and our commercial customer counts are up in both states, so really some positive trends that we're seeing kind of across the board."
"Great, thank you, very helpful. Just a quick question on the weather impact versus normal year- to-date. Can you just remind me what that is?","Yeah, if you look at the page 18 of our slide deck, year-to-date the temperatures are having a negative – excuse me, a positive 2% – $0.02 versus normal. So, year-to-date, again temperature is $0.02 positive versus normal."
"I see, okay. So, if – okay, got it. And then just last one: remind me please your 7% to 10% EPS CAGR is based oﬀ of what year and what number?","That was based oﬀ of 2013, David. So, that's 2013 through 2018 compound annual growth rate."
"So, is that base just a reported 2013 or is it adjusted for any outages or weather impact?","No, it's continuing at reported continuing operation. So, it is a GAAP number, and it's 2013 through 2018, I'd say the only thing we've done there is obviously taking out discontinued operations."
"Great, thank you so much.","You're welcome.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Thank you, David.
