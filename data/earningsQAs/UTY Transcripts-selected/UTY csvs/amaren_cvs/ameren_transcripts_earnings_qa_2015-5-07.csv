Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. It's Julien here.","Good morning, Julien."
"Good morning. So ﬁrst question, if you will, on the Missouri case – and I apologize if this didn't come across – when's your next expected ﬁling and how are you thinking about addressing the presumably incremental lag coming from some of the changes in the latest ﬁlling? And what's the magnitude of that lag that you would anticipate having from the transmission expense along with some of the other tweaks?","So there are a multiple questions in there, Julien. And I'll take a stab at those and maybe others can chime in and supplement as we go and, if I missed any of your questions, we'll let you repeat it. I think your ﬁrst question was about when we're going to ﬁle our next rate case? I mean, obviously, we had just received this commission order. We're in the process of assessing the order and also considering what matters we may ask the commission to consider rehearing on. So I wouldn't say we're even through the full process of this one, so it's certainly premature to think about the timing of a next rate case.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   You know what goes into that, obviously, is assessing this order, its impact. As we mentioned on the call and as you just alluded to, we're going to be taking a number of actions to align spending with this rate case outcome. We'll be looking at our capital expenditures moving forward and the in-service dates, and all of those things are going to factor into a decision about when the next rate case may be. It's probably important to note that this rate case was about two and a half years since our last rate increase. So no telling when the next one will be, but like I said, those are the various things we will take into consideration.  You also asked, I think, about some of those actions that we may be taking to address any lag coming out of this order. And I think that, whenever you go into a rate case, it's certainly expected that cost savings that you've achieved over the past couple of years, in our case, helped to mitigate the rate increase for the customer and that's certainly what's happened here. And then what you have to do going forward is to the extent that there are non-recovered costs or escalating costs in certain areas of your business, that you're going to identify actions that you can take within your business to overcome those, to oﬀset those.  And as I said on the call, our goal continues to be to earn at or very near to our allowed returns and that's going to be our objective going forward. And without providing any speciﬁcs, certainly have processes underway today as part of our annual planning processes to identify and implement those actions, which are needed to achieve that objective."
"Gotcha. And could you perhaps quantify a little bit, what your lag expectations are? Or I suppose, it's a little early, right, in the context of identifying oﬀsetting cost cuts. And then maybe just more speciﬁcally on the transmission expense side, how much of the rate lag specially or what kind of inﬂation rate have you being seeing of late? I imagine, that's probably the most critical item there.","Yeah. Sure. So yeah, that's right. Those were parts of your other question. I guess, number one, Julien, we don't think about sort of an amount of lag that we're targeting or that we expect. As I said a moment ago, I mean, our objective is to earn at or very close to our allowed return. That has been our objective and it continues to be our objective. Now, there are going to be elements that are things that would have to be overcome. Now, we'll, on this transmission piece in the FAC, there what's happened is transmission revenues and costs are coming out of the FAC and then would go into base rates and would be handled that way subject to potential rehearing on that issue with the Commission.  I would tell you that today, just to give you an order of magnitude, in 2015 we expect transmission revenues and transmission expenses in Ameren Missouri to be around $35 million. However, those revenues and those expenses change over time, and one of the reasons that we view them as being appropriate for being in the FAC is that, frankly, those costs are outside of our control and they can be volatile. And to give an example, I think, what was put into our base rates reﬂected a diﬀerential between revenues and expenses of about $6 million, where revenues had exceeded expenses. So, that gives you I think some sense of the magnitude of the numbers and the change we've seen here recently. Hard to say what the change will be prospectively, obviously, again, as I said, those costs are outside of our control. So what that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   may – if it's not in the FAC, what that may mean for us in terms of prospective lag is really uncertain at this time."
"Right. But just to be clear though, if you may permit me, your expectation is that you will be able to continue earn at or around your earned or your authorized level?","Julien, that is our objective and we work each year to align our cost to achieve that objective."
All right. Great. Sorry for so many questions. Thank you so much.,"That's okay, Julien. I just would add on that, I mean I think we have a good track record that we've shown over this past couple of years of actually achieving that objective. But thank you for your questions."
Agreed. Good luck.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your questions.,
Hi. How you doing?,Good Paul.
Just on the long-term growth rate which – how should we think about that now?,"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, in terms of long-term growth rate, you're speaking about the rate base or the earnings per share or both?"
I'm talking about the earnings per share. That doesn't seem to be in the slide deck this time around?,"Yeah, sure. Yeah, that's ﬁne, Paul. I just wanted to clarify. I mean, obviously, in the slides we talked about our 6% compound annual rate base growth from 14% to 19%. I mean, you're right; what we didn't do is speciﬁcally mention the earnings per share growth. And I think going forward, reason for that is really simply that we planned to formally update you and others on the long-term earnings growth plans on an annual basis consistent with our annual planning cycles. But that being said, as we sit here today, we do continue to be conﬁdent in our ability to deliver within that 7% to 10% compound earnings per share growth range that we've previously talked about which is from 2013 to 2018. As you know, Paul, that growth is driven by the transparent rate base growth plans that I just mentioned. It's driven by a reduction in parent and other costs that we've been achieving. It's driven by the monetization and reinvestment of tax assets that we have – about $440 million of tax assets at the parent company. And also incorporated in there is our expectation of rising interest rates and rising ROEs over time.  And when we think about all those things together, we remain conﬁdent of achieving that 7% to 10% growth. What we don't plan to do is provide quarterly updates on the long-term plans going forward based on, I would say, short-term movements in interest rates or changes in allowed returns. We take all of that data, of course, into consideration as we prepare our – do our annual planning and think about where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to modify our longer-term growth plan."
"So I guess it means – does that mean like from quarter-to-quarter internally you guys might think that this number might be changing or is this more of sort of a cosmetic thing in terms of just simply leaving it alone till the – in a more annual basis, because that would make more sense than changing it I guess quarter-to-quarter. Is that – how should we think about that?","Sure. Sure, Paul. No, it's a fair question. No, I mean, what we're not doing, I would say, is internally updating our ﬁve-year earnings per share growth outlook each quarter based on changes. It's, frankly, a fairly comprehensive process that we and I'm sure other companies go through on an annual basis, to think about changes in long-term interest rate forecast, long- term ROE forecast, changes in regulatory frameworks, changes in customer needs, changes in technology. And really think about what kinds of investments should be made for the beneﬁt of our customers, where they should be made, when they should be made and all of those things factor into our long-term investment plans and our long-term EPS growth.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And so, we do those comprehensive planning processes on an annual basis. And we'll be planning then to roll that out and roll it into the guidance we provide you and others on an annual basis about what our long-term growth plans are.  Paul, I would just add, a couple of months ago when we provided our guidance, I was asked a question about, well, are you going to hit that 7% to 10% in the current ROE environment? And what I'd said in that call and I certainly standby is that, if we held the ROEs that where embedded into our guidance ﬂat through time, we still expect it to be in that 7% to 10% range, albeit potentially at the lower end. And I have to say that, while we haven't completely reassessed our long-term model, I do remain conﬁdent that even with this lower Missouri ROE and holding the other ROEs embedded in our current guidance ﬂat, we do have that ﬂexibility within the guidance range and within our business plans to be able to achieve at least that 7% end of our growth.  So net that growth, as you know, that 7% earnings per share growth is superior I think to the average of our regulated peers; and we fully expect that interest rates overtime will rise, that ROEs will rise, and that'll certainly help to drive earnings higher within that range."
"Okay. Just to sort of follow-up here on the regulatory environment and the legislative environment in Missouri. You guys went over the rate case, not exactly what you guys wanted. And it looks like the legislative eﬀorts, if I understand you guys, they're dead for this year. Do you think that there's any rate case fatigue? I mean, let me put it right out there, I mean, do you think that there's maybe, there may be a limit in terms of revenue increases in Missouri? And then just to sort of follow that through, do you have any opinion of the legislation that's happening in Illinois with respect to nuclear and the other sort of clean job stuﬀ and what have you that's been gain – garnering a lot of attention in Springﬁeld?","Yeah, Paul, we'll try to – this is Marty again. We'll try to take those in order. I think on the Missouri ones, maybe Michael Moehn, who's with us here who's the Head of our Missouri operations, can take the ﬁrst part of your question.     Yeah, great. Thanks, Marty. With respect to the fatigue, certainly these increases have been hard on customers, we recognize that. We try to do everything we can to mitigate the impact on customers. But at the end of the day, all of these investments that we're making are really to continue to provide safe and adequate and reliable service. And so, we're going to continue to do what we think is necessary to deliver on that promise.  But, you know, and I – and with respect to legislation in Missouri, we do remain very focused on trying to get something across the ﬁnish line. We continue to talk with stakeholders, legislators about the importance of modernizing the regulations in the Missouri to make sure that we're able to continue to build out the grid of the 21st century. We continue to remind them of the good things that are going on in Illinois, referencing what's happening in Arkansas and   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Wisconsin and Michigan. And so, I think through a constant, relentless pursuit of it, we're going to get it across the ﬁnish line at some point. It's diﬃcult to say exactly when that's going to be – when that's going to happen. But we are going to continue to put every eﬀort into making it happen."
"But it won't be this year, right?",Yeah. I think that is a fair assumption at this point in time.
Okay. And then if you could follow up on Illinois. I don't want to take any more time – sorry.,"Yeah, that's okay. And Paul, this is Warner. Richard Mark is here, too. So Richard, maybe you can give a little perspective on the Illinois legislation.     Well, there's three bills pending in Illinois and we're just continuing to monitor those bills to see which one of them or which of them will be called for hearings in the near future. The session in Illinois ends May 31, so we're going to continue to monitor those to see which ones – how they aﬀect our customers through improvements and value as well as the impact that it would have on increased cost to our customers."
Okay. Thanks a lot.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.,
"You guys have answered a lot my questions. I was looking back at the disclosures from the end of the year call. And I can't remember, did you disclose explicitly what ROE you're reserving – you're reserving to or was it just that you're making assumptions that are less explicit?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah, Greg. This is Marty. What we've talked about on that call and repeat here, I mean, obviously, we've got active litigation and we don't want to get into speciﬁcs. But what we did say then is our guidance reﬂected approximately the outcome of the ISO New England order last year plus a 50-basis point adder and that -"
Gotcha.,...that kind of an ROE was embedded into our guidance and that's what we continue to reﬂect in our ongoing results. And it's also reﬂected in our current guidance for 2015.
Perfect. Thank you for reminding me. Have a good afternoon.,"You too, Greg. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions."
"Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter and sorry about Adam Wainwright, what a tough way to start the season even though they're on a great winning streak, that's just brutal.","Let's do remember that they've been on a pretty good winning streak, Mike."
"No, I know, but it's May not August or October. So I'd rather have Wainwright back and give up a couple of the April wins.  Real quick, I want to make sure I understand some things. In the quarter O&M was down a lot this quarter, and came in a good bit better. Can you just talk about whether that's seasonality, whether there were some things that will put upwards pressure on O&M towards the back half of the year? Or is this a kind of a new run rate?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Michael, I'll try to answer as best as I can. This is Marty again, obviously. But, yeah, the O&M was down. The O&M was down principally at Missouri. When you see the 10-Q, you'll get some further detail and breakdown, I suppose, by legal entity. But I'll tell you that Illinois was about ﬂat, and the real driver was slower Missouri. And I would say that, that's just – in general, just eﬀorts to contain costs. There were some speciﬁc costs that we had last year at our Callaway plant, that did not recur in the current period. But I would say, overall, our focus is to continue to work to improve the productivity of operations, to ﬁnd ways to control costs. And I can't really be speciﬁc with you in terms of trends for the remainder of the year in O&M, but I will tell you that, just, in general, and especially in light of the rate case outcome that we had, we're going to continue to be very cost conscious and manage O&M very carefully.     Mike, I would just add – this is of Warner. This is not something new. This is not something new. We have been very disciplined in managing our costs. And as Marty rightfully said a moment ago, as we manage those costs between rates cases, it helps address regulatory lag, and then as we have the rate cases, it certainly provides a signiﬁcant beneﬁt to customers.  And we're not done. We're going to continue to do that both in Missouri and across our enterprise because it's the right thing to do. And so, I know others have raised the questions on regulatory lag, we cite that, obviously, the regulatory lag may become more challenging; at the same time we're geared up to address those issues internally and are still very focused and conﬁdent that the execution of our plan is going to deliver superior value to – not just to our shareholders but also to our customers."
"Got it. And want to circle back on the transmission ROE. Your guidance assumed a lower ROE, is there any change in the guidance level of the ROE? I know this is piggybacking oﬀ of Greg's question a little bit, but I want to just make sure I understand kind of the puts and takes versus original guidance and what you're saying today.","Sure, Michael. I'll reiterate. Basically, what's in our new guidance our current updated guidance reﬂects exactly what we had in our guidance at the beginning of the year. So we said then and we say now what it reﬂects is basically the outcome of the ISO New England order plus 50 basis points. And so that gives you an approximation of where we're booking a reserve to, what the eﬀective earned ROE is that we're reﬂecting in our ﬁnancial statement this year. Obviously, we don't know where those cases will come out. We certainly think that the testimony that was ﬁled by the MISO TOs and our own witnesses speak for itself and we'll let that play out here over the remainder of the year."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. One last item, thinking about Illinois and MISO transmission opportunities, I mean you've got a very healthy rate base growth opportunity there over the next four years or ﬁve years. But trying to think about what could be incremental to what's already in your plan, can you talk a little bit about the Order 1000 process in the MISO and whether projects are soon to be put out to bid or whether there's another round of potential Order 1000 related projects that you could potentially be a participant in an RFP on or updates on the (48:31) process as well?","Sure, Michael. I think the best person to speak to that is Maureen Borkowski, who is the head of our transmission business. Maureen, you want to comment on those questions?     Sure. MISO is in the process of getting some Order 1000 things started. There're a little behind the curve relative to the other RTOs. And just to clarify, at the present time, our business development folks are active not only in the MISO Order 1000 process, but also in PJM and Southwest Power Pool. We actually have some proposals active in some of the PJM solicitation windows right now.  And as you mentioned, correctly, any kind of success in that venue – in any of those MISO, PJM, SPP is all incremental to the rate base growth and the investment that we've already talked about today.  But we're not necessarily relying on that to provide our future growth pipeline. We have a great deal of investment opportunity remaining in our utility systems, both for reliability needs, aging infrastructure replacement and modernization of the grid. We also expect the Clean Power Plan will likely have some impacts on the generation ﬂeet in our service territory, which will also drive local transmission projects. And all of those opportunities that I mentioned are really hours to deliver on. They're not subject to any of the competitive process in MISO. So we certainly are active in the competitive space, but we're not relying on that to provide our pipeline. We have lots of other opportunities as well."
"Got it. Okay. I just wanted to kind of tail on that only because yesterday on an earnings call one of the Kansas utilities talked about the SPP and just mentioned that they had only put out one small Order 1000 project bid, no others for RFP. Do you know the number of potential projects that the MISO is likely to put out to bid and when those RRPs would come out?","I really couldn't speculate on that. It is supposed to be in the MTEP 2016 process, I guess, which begins eﬀectively in August of this year. So sometime late next year you would probably see the results of that."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Okay. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.,"Okay. Thanks, Mike.     Hey, Michael. It's Marty. Just one – couple things, I think it was implied in your question; but obviously, our rate base growth plans that we've put out there today and in prior call, that 6% doesn't include any kind of expectation for any kind of FERC Order 1000 competitive win. So if anything was achieved there, it'd certainly be incremental. As Maureen described, we've got a good pipeline of local reliability projects that goes on behind the ﬁve-year period. Certainly, there could be some incremental for our current ﬁve-year plan. But I'd also mention that, as we discussed last time – I think you asked the question on the last call and I responded – I mean, certainly, there could be even incremental investments in other areas of our business, particularly in the gas area, where there's the possibility that new federal rules will come into play that will actually cause us to increase the amount of investment that we need to make for replacement of aging infrastructure. So there are a number of things including transmission on top of transmission that present additional rate-based growth opportunity. Appreciate the question."
"No, thank you, guys. I really appreciate the response.  Operator  Thank you. Thank you. At this time, we've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the ﬂoor back to Mr. Doug Fischer for closing comments.","Thank you for participating in this call.
