Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. First quick question, a high-level one, can you perhaps more precisely address the disproportionate EPS growth versus the prior rate-based CAGR you'd been talking about? Can you delineate the drivers of that?","Yes, what are you trying to reconcile the rate-based growth to what?"
To your EPS CAGR?,Sure.
"How would you get the 10%, if you will?","Sure, Julien. We've provided these building blocks in the past and I'll go through them again. The rate-based growth is the foundation, but then when you look out some of these one-time items that I'll refer to or the regulatory impacts this past year, these are the charges that I outlined -- the fuel adjustment clause charge that we had, the ICC redemption cost disallowance, you back out some of those, you build up to your 2014 earnings. Then you can talk about -- then you look at the reduction in the parent and other costs, where we had about, if you look at the income statement or look in the stats pages on the other, had about $0.18 of drag this past year from those other costs, which as I said on the call, we expect that down to about $0.10 in 2014 and then even realize some further savings into 2015. Then you think about where our rate-based growth is going, as we transition our rate base to a heavier emphasis on FERC-regulated transmission. You again get a blended average return that's even higher. Those are really the building blocks that get you up into that 7% to 10% range, and then add on top of that whatever you may for expected rise in 30-year Treasury yields over that period of time. But Julien, those are the building blocks we have been providing and that 7% to 10% growth range that we've given is very much in alignment with the building blocks that we've provided.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Great and perhaps if you could elaborate a little bit more about the Illinois gas opportunities. It seems as if you've driven up the CAGR there a little bit from your last slide deck, as best I can tell. Could you talk about the timing on implementation and growth out of that and whether that is incorporated within your current CAGR?","It really is incorporated within that current CAGR to the extent that in this ﬁve-year period, we plan to enhance the investment in the gas portion of our Business. If you do look at the CapEx that we historically had provided, which was 2013 to 2017 and then the CapEx in this period, 2014 to 2018, the overall I would say, amount of capital expenditures in those ﬁve-year periods are about the same. But as you note, there has been a bit added to the gas portion of the Business and that really does reﬂect what we talked about last year, that to the extent that we had the favorable legislation passed in Illinois, it would serve as a basis to invest more in that area for safety and reliability and that's been added to the mix."
"Right and then sorry to keep going here, but the last quick question on reﬁ-ing the debt here, what is your thought process if you will, in terms of size, and I suppose how does that ﬁt into your ﬁnancing plan? What's your target capitalization, if you can remind us again, as well?","Yes, sure, maybe I will talk about that overall. We had in one of our slides our target capitalization of around 50% and on Slide 16 of our materials, we laid out our free cash ﬂow for the year. This year, we've got negative free cash ﬂow of about $800 million that's forecast terms. In terms of debt maturities, Julien, the one you're referring to is the Ameren long-term debt issue of $425 million that comes due in May and provides us with a nice reﬁnancing opportunity. We've also got a maturity in Missouri, a little over $100 million, and in January, we actually did move to redeem some debt at Ameren Illinois of about $160 million. So when you add those things together, that's total funding needs of about $1.5 billion. We plan to tackle that with a couple of debt oﬀerings in Illinois this year, which we estimate will total about $600 million of long-term debt ﬁnancings; we're planning a Missouri ﬁnancing of about $350 million. And then with respect to the Ameren parent, both for the debt maturity, as well as some of the funding that Ameren will be providing to ATXI as it begins to build its transmission project, the Illinois Rivers project, we plan, at Ameren Corp, to have a mix of long-term and short-term borrowings. At this point, we're expecting a long-term oﬀering that's something less than the current amount of the long-term debt that's at Ameren Corp so something less than that $425 million. Julien, as you think about the capital expenditures that we show on Slide 16, and we think about the -- where we're going to issue that long-term debt, as I said, of $600 million at Ameren Illinois every and $350 million at Missouri. When you look at those capital expenditures, it pretty clear, obviously, that we have about $760 million at Ameren Missouri. At Ameren Illinois, we have $530 million for the energy delivery businesses, but it's also important to remember that a good portion of our transmission build also within Ameren Illinois. So, when you break out that $510 million of FERC transmission, what you ﬁnd is about, in addition to the $530 million overall at Ameren Illinois, we've got about $800 million of capital expenditures at   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Ameren Illinois. When you think about where we're issuing that debt, it is really at Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri, for the most part, this coming year. There, at the end of 2013, our equity ratios and the cap structures when you get the 10-K and you look at that, was 53% -- or north of 53% in both of those legal entities. So what will happen as we issue some of this debt, is those equity ratios will trend down somewhat into the approximately 51% range. Then overall, at Ameren, as you saw on our stats page, we are a little above 50% in terms of our equity content right now; would expect that as we fund ATX and build that out, we should slip maybe a little below the 50% but then trend back to our target ratio over time."
"Great, thank you, very thorough.  Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.",
Good morning. Congratulations on the promotion and the retirement guys.,"Thank you, Paul."
"I want to touch base with you on just the EPS growth rate on Slide 15 and make sure I understand this. The Treasury yield of 4.5% in 2015, is there any sensitivity you can give us in terms of what that -- if we don't get -- interest rate sensitivity in terms of what your growth rate might be, all things being equal?","Paul, are you looking at particular Slide 15 and 2015 earnings or just overall?"
Whatever you can give us. I realize that there a lot of moving parts in the range?,"What we tried to provide in terms of the longer-term guidance was just a benchmark or an anchor point, if you will. In Warner's talking points, one of the things he said is that all of the things being equal in our plan, if Treasury rates were to stay constant, we would expect to deliver an earnings growth rate that was slightly below the mid-point of the range that we provided of 7% to 10%. It is not necessarily our belief that Treasury yields are going to stay at the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   current levels, but wanted to provide that as a bit of an anchor point. Otherwise, within that 7% to 10% growth, Paul, as we talked about, we think it accommodates a range of Treasury rates outcomes, if you will, or sales growth levels, spending levels, whether the capital or O&M and regulatory developments, we feel like again, Paul, the building blocks are the ones I laid out earlier. It is the rate-based growth; it's the reduction of parent and other costs; it's the capital allocation to FERC-regulated transmission; those of the things that are really going to drive the growth that we've got outlined."
Okay and is SB 909 -- is the implementation of that necessary for this growth rate or--?,"No I would say it's necessary for this growth rate. The outcome of that, however, I'd say is baked into our overall range of potential outcomes in terms of the 7% to 10%."
"Okay and then just ﬁnally on the transmission buildout, I know you guys are no longer a merchant, which is nice, but can you tell us how you think that these transmission projects might impact power ﬂows or congestion or what have you in terms of wholesale prices and perhaps how that could beneﬁt your customers or anything else you could elaborate on that?","Yes I don't know that we'll get into all those speciﬁcs but Maureen Borkowski, who is the head of our transmission business, is here with us this morning, and I will give her the opportunity to make comment, if she has any.     Yes, good morning. With regard to the multi-value projects that Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois is building, those were approved by MISO for multiple reasons -- basically to improve reliability, to enhance the accessibility of renewable resources, particularly wind, but also to improve the eﬃciency of the power market and that equates to congestion relief in the marketplace. So yes, that is the focus of those projects is to improve the eﬃciency of the market, as well as reliability of the customers."
Could you give any sense of basis diﬀerential changes or anything like or any quantiﬁcation on that latter point?,"Sorry, but I really don't have any information like that. Again, MISO did a pretty extensive analysis to deﬁne with their entire portfolio across the MISO footprint, what kinds of savings   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   those might be, but I don't have anything speciﬁc to our system."
"Okay, thanks a lot.  Operator  Ashar Khan, Visium.",
"Good morning, and congrats. I wanted to go more in on this dividend payout. You gave out a range, and if I do my math correctly, next year we will be at the lower portion of the payout. So I'm just trying to see how is the Board thinking this year or next year? I know you declared the dividend earlier this week or last week? Is it something done for this year or is there a quarter we should look at -- some people have a quarter in which they increase the dividend every year? Or how is the Board looking at the dividend? Is it done for this year that we have the same rate and we look for next year or can it be reviewed later this year? Or could you just tell us the deliberations that you and the Board might have gone through as you went through this new outlook of yours and the dividend staying constant, as you declared it at the end of last week?","Yes this is Tom Voss. We've mentioned previously that the 55% to 70% payout ratio is what we hope for and we're somewhat at the high end of that this year, but the Board is very much engaged every quarter and looking at our earnings and our projections and they review it. I would say that as we continue to grow earnings over the this period, we hope to continue to grow our dividend."
"Okay. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Paul Ridzon, KeyBanc Capital Markets.",
"Good morning. Senate Bill 909, if that were to pass, would that alter your 2% Missouri rate- based CAGR?","Hi, Paul, this is Warner. In the bigger picture, what we have said, if we have constructive legislation passed that supports investment in Missouri, we will put more money to work. So if   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   you look at SB 909, which is a little bit diﬀerent than what we saw last year, we step back, we think we would have the opportunity to put to work incremental investment in Missouri of, say, $50 million to $100 million per year, should that legislation get passed in its current form. So simple answer to your question is yes, we do believe that we could put more money to work and we think it's absolutely a very good thing for the state of Missouri and its customers."
Would you borrow that from another bucket or would that be incremental capital?,"Paul, this is Marty on that one. It's really too soon to tell on that particular point. I will say that, as we think about managing our overall capital expenditures, we're certainly mindful of impacts on customers' rates, we're thinking about impacts on overall funding needs, and we're also thinking about building a pipeline of investments beyond the ﬁve-year period that we've presented. Too soon to tell, but that is certainly a possibility, that if we added investment opportunities there in the short term in Missouri, that other investment opportunities may slide to beyond the period presented. But again really too early to say that. We'll get through this legislative season and see where we are at and make those decisions in due course."
Is your guidance -- have you baked anything in to that for year-to-date weather?,No. Our guidance for 2014 is based on normal weather.
"And then lastly, given your tax position, do expect to be a cash tax payer through 2016?","As I mentioned earlier on the call, we expect that the NOLs and the tax credit carryforwards that we have to provide us beneﬁt out through the 2016 timeframe."
"Through or to, sorry?",Into 2016.
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Into. Okay, thank you very much.  Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.",
"Hello, guys, congratulations on a good year and a lot of strong accomplishments during 2013. I want to ask just a question about 2014 guidance, which if I just use the mid-point of your guidance range, implies almost an 11% or 12% year-over-year growth, and then therefore, if I think about the 7% to 10%, it implies a much lower growth rate after 2014. Am I thinking about that the right way, am I missing something, and how should we think about the puts and takes on that?","Well, you're right. The growth between 2013 and 2014 is certainly signiﬁcant and it's driven by the items I highlighted. But Michael, obviously, you can do the math, as you look at our 2014 guidance range and you look out to the overall growth we've given out through 2018. But if you take that mid-point of 2014 and project out, you've still got a really solid growth rate of around 6% to 9.5% in terms of where that range ends up. So you're right, there is a solid amount of growth from 2013 to 2014 and it moderates somewhat from there but still a very solid growth rate oﬀ of 2014."
"And it strikes me that you're a few years from a dividend policy question. You're a few years away from -- you wouldn't get -- if I just use mid-points of guidance, you would get to the middle point of your dividend payout ratio in 2015 at the current dividend level -- $1.60 at, I don't know, $2.50 or so of earnings in 2015, and I know you're not really giving 2015 guidance, I'm just slapping the growth rate on 2014. That still gets you into the low 60%s payout ratio, but by 2016 or 2017, your expectation is to grow the dividend with earnings growth?","Michael, just to reiterate or repeat what Tom said, which is that, as we grow the earnings, we aspire to be able to grow the dividend, we're not giving out, I'd say, an expected timing or amount of growth in that dividend. But as Tom has previously said on prior calls, we don't necessarily think that we need to get into the bottom end of the range before we would grow the dividend. There are a number of factors that are considered --Tom laid those out a few moments ago -- just in terms of our earnings outlook, but also our capital funding, our cash ﬂows, things of that nature, a number of those things are laid out, as you've seen in our 10-Ks and 10-Qs that the Board considers, but that's about what I've got to say on that."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay and then last question just on capital spending because you're investing a good amount of capital in concurrent return businesses like FERC-regulated transmission. Of the transmission investment for 2014, how much of that is ATXI versus Ameren Illinois?","Let me see if I can do my math here real quick. It's about, of that $510 million about $270 million is Ameren Illinois and the remainder is ATXI."
"Got it, so not quite 50%/50%, but pretty close. Cool. Guys, thank you, I appreciate your taking my questions and once again congrats on a great 2013.","Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Andy Bischof, Morningstar Equity Research."
"Hi, good morning, just a few follow-on questions on terms of Missouri. In terms of reducing lag, are your eﬀorts solely on Bill 909 or are there other initiatives that we should be thinking about there? And then in terms of the potential $50 million to $100 million capital spend, could you provide us with a little bit more color on what these investments are?","Andy, this is Warner. With regard to the Missouri, we're not putting all of our marbles into legislation. We have been working for years to align our spending and to be consistent with the existing regulatory framework in Missouri and we've been successful and that focus, that relentless focus on disciplined cost management will continue. So there are a host of initiatives that we have taken and will continue to take, including things like lean initiatives that are being taken place across our Enterprise coupled with, again, disciplined management of our discretionary capital. As we discussed a little bit earlier, you put those factors together, we continue to believe that we will be able to align our spend with the existing regulatory framework. Of course, as we've said earlier, we're going to be going in for an electric rate case later this year to true up our rates, as well as costs, and so that obviously will help and certainly help mitigate the regulatory lag that we're experiencing associated with the infrastructure investments in our enterprise. That's probably one of the biggest sources of regulatory lag that we have today and indeed SB 909 is squarely about trying to address the regulatory lag associated with those investments. Marty, there's a question on capital investment. Or Andy, if you could follow-up make sure--?      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   He was just asking what kinds of projects might be involved in that, Warner.     So, when you look at our existing spend, this year we have two major projects that we discussed a little bit earlier -- the Callaway reactor vessel head, as well as the precipitator project -- but we also have some new substations that we have to bring on. They are aging infrastructure and so we have to address some of those, as well as we have a renewable energy project, the largest solar investor-owned facility in the state and we're going to get that done by the end of the year as well. Looking ahead, we see that we have a need to invest incremental monies -- discretionary monies into things like substations, into things like our power plants, certainly in things -- in trying to automate our system in a better way. Ultimately, we'll have to address maybe even the meters we use in Missouri. So we see a real need in investing in our aging infrastructure and that is what SB 909 is all about, to try and do that in a more timely fashion."
"Great, thank you, and congrats on the promotions and retirement.","Thank you. Thank you, Andy.     Thank you.  Operator  Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board."
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"I was wondering -- you mentioned you're looking for declines in sales volumes for 2014, but it looks like you had slight increases for 2013 so if you could give a little more color on just what you're seeing in customer growth and demand, particularly residential customer growth on the industrial side for demand in your service territories?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Sure, Dan, this is Marty thanks for calling in and thanks for the question. You're right in terms of what we saw this past year -- of course, the sales numbers that you see are -- on the stats page -- are aﬀected by weather, but stripping out weather, we did see some growth this year in both Missouri and Illinois in the residential and commercial categories. Overall, on a weather- normalized basis, we estimate that residential and commercial sales grew about 0.6%. Coming into the year, that's about where we expected, somewhere between 0% and 0.5% of growth and towards the upper end of that range at 0.6%. We actually did see customer count in both Missouri and Illinois go up in terms of residential and commercial customer count, so that was certainly positive in 2013 versus the prior year. Overall, on industrial we did see a decline in sales of about 3.2% overall. Missouri, which was positive up about 1% in 2013 in industrial, so that was a good time, while Illinois was down about 6%. I spoke to that on some earlier calls, that we've seen some weakness in Illinois in the manufacturing sector in metals on equipment, those types of things, and unfortunately in Illinois, we've been seeing unemployment recently bump up while national average has been coming down and we've also seen unemployment in Missouri coming down. Illinois, unfortunately, in recent months, is seeming unemployment-wise and industrial sales-wise to be trending in a negative direction; Missouri seems to be trending in a little bit of a positive direction. But looking forward to 2014, what we're expecting is a decline, as we mentioned in the call, in residential and commercial sales. And while we expect to see still slow improvement in the economy and jobs, housing starts, et cetera, we do believe that both federal energy eﬃciency, as well as state energy eﬃciency measures reduce sales and have an impact of reducing sales in 2014 compared to 2014. And as I mentioned on the call in our prepared remarks, it is important to remember that in Missouri, we do have an energy eﬃciency program whereby we are made whole for the cost of our energy eﬃciency programs and even provided some incentives with regards to that. In 2013, we estimated that, that had an impact on our residential sale of about 0.8% and about 0.1% on commercial. And then, as I said, we are made whole for the cost of that. So as you think about 2014 and you think about those impacts of the residential and commercial sales going down, they are mitigated in Missouri by what we call our MEEA funding programs, as well as in Illinois, it's important to remember that under our formulaic rates, there is a 50-basis-point collar around the earned ROI. With respect to industrial sales, we are expecting those to be down across the two states about 0.7%. We are expecting to see declines in both states -- in Missouri it is somewhat speciﬁc to some expected customer load that we do expect to see go away and then in Illinois, I would say, it's continued concerns about just general economic weakness."
"Okay and then on Missouri, given that you're planning to ﬁle for a rate increase mid-year, I was wondering if you could give us what your ROE was in Missouri in 2013 and the year-end rate base?","I don't really have the year-end rate base. You can go ahead and calculate the ROE by referencing the number on the stats page. I don't have that in front either -- the exact net income. But as we look ahead, as we mentioned, we do see the need for a rate ﬁling, which we expect to make in July. On prior calls, we had said in the second half. As I've mentioned before, really a primary driver of that ﬁling that we plan to make in July has to do with the signiﬁcant capital expenditures that we're making in Missouri. We've talked about the electrostatic precipitators at Labadie, we've talked about the Callaway reactor head, and Warner just mentioned a little while ago some of the solar installations that we're doing in Missouri, as well.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   If you want to look at rate base, the closest is to maybe go back to page eight of our slides and we do have a year-end rate-based pie where we break some of that information out and you can ﬁnd an estimate of the Missouri rate base of the end of 2013 there."
Okay and then I just wanted to add my congratulations to Tom and Warner on their upcoming changes.,"Thank you.     Thank you, Dan. I appreciate that.  Operator  Rajeev Lalwani, Morgan Stanley."
"I had just two questions on Missouri. The ﬁrst, can you talk about the impact the Noranda complaints may or may not have on the upcoming rate case? And then the second, what you see the headwinds associated with getting SB 909 passed?","Hi, this is Warner. With regard to the Noranda complaint case ﬁling, we don't see it having any impact on our ability to ﬁle and execute the rate case that we plan on doing in July. We were clear last November that we needed to ﬁle rate case in the second half and now we've sharpen our pencils and it is going to be July and we plan to execute that in a timely fashion. And I'm sorry, you had a second question -- that was?"
The major headwinds you see with SB 909?,"The reality is this -- as you know, the legislative process, it's a dynamic process, so it -- ultimately it is always diﬃcult to predict the prospects of the passage of any bill. I'll tell you what I do know -- I know that Missouri must make progress in really modernizing its framework to support investment and it's the message that is understood by many key leaders and the legislature, and frankly, many stakeholders around the state. So as we continue to have more discussions with the General Assembly and other key stakeholders around the state about SB 909, our   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   message is that this is an important step forward. As I said before, this is an incremental step, it is an important step forward, and it can start making progress on the aging infrastructure in Missouri. So I'm not going to be able to handicap it; we do believe that there will likely be some groups that will oppose the bill, but that's probably true with every bill, but one thing I can tell you, our team is going to be very focused on this legislation over the next several months."
"Great, thank you. Good luck.","Thank you.  Operator  Bill Appicelli, Nexus Asset Management."
"Hi, good morning.","Hello, Bill."
"I just had a question about the ﬁnancing. You had asked or you had mentioned that you didn't expect to issue equity through 2018 but that you would evaluate use of a DRIP and I know in the past you had talked about the potential for $75 million to $100 million maybe using that. Looking at your base plan, should we assume that there is DRIP being utilized in terms of that growth path that gets you to slightly below the mid-point that you talked about?","Bill, I'd say that's one of the things that probably I'll leave up to you to factor in as you look at your model. What we planned to do here today was just to, again, give this guidance range of 7% to 10%. There's a range of potential things that could aﬀect our results that we outlined there that could put us into the upper or lower end of that range in terms of the Treasury rates, sales growth, spending levels, regulatory developments. We're simply saying that we would leave the option open as we encounter these various changes to issue shares as needed through the DRIP or 401k. Don't really see the need over that ﬁve-year plan for a public equity issuance, as we said in the slides, and we'll evaluate the need for the DRIP or 401k on a year-to-year basis. You're right about the number that we've previously said, which that is if we did, I'll say, turn that on, it would be about estimated $75 million to $100 million.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay and then just changing gears, do you guys have any update on the status or timeline for resolution of the challenge at FERC around the MISO ROEs?","I'll let Maureen go ahead and answer that one as well.     Yes. In January, the Midwest ISO transmission owners ﬁled their response to the complaint, requesting that FERC dismiss it because the complainants really hadn't met the burden of that the rate is just and reasonable. They have provided additional information, as well, about errors in the calculation and the complaint. At this point in time, others have also ﬁled their responses, but FERC has not taken any action or set any kind of a schedule so at this point time, we're really in a wait-and-see mode. We do have conﬁdence, though, that the FERC commission is still very pro-transmission development and they understand that the return on equity component is a very important element of continuing to encourage transmission investment. So we're hopeful that the outcome will be positive."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, Bill.  Operator  Gregg Orrill, Barclays."
"Thank you, and congratulations, Tom and Warner.","Thanks, Gregg, really appreciate that. Thank you."
"Maybe you touched on this already, but I just wanted to come back to it in terms the growth post- 2014. With 2014 being at an accelerated rate, is it 6% to 9.5% post that? Should we think about it that way?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",Yes--
And then I have another detailed question?,"Yes, Greg, and I'll let you do a follow-up, but yes, that was the answer that I gave to -- this is Marty by the way, as you know. But simply coming oﬀ of the mid-point of our 2014 guidance and just looking at -- as I said earlier, you can do the math if you are taking the 2013 base and then you're looking at the 7% to 10% growth out through 2018, calculate a number, and then bring it back to the implied growth oﬀ of the 2014 mid-point, and you come up with a 6% to 9.5% growth rate oﬀ of 2014, over that period."
"And then if you come back to Slide 15, the negative driver there, just higher cost in Missouri and otherwise, is there anything more that you could provide detail on there or is it really just a thought about the impact of regulatory lag in Missouri?","Gregg, obviously, what we're trying to do on Slide 15 is just provide some of what we consider to be the meaningful drivers -- or earnings considerations for 2015. As I said before, as we think about the Missouri electric rate case, we would plan to ﬁle that in July of this year -- July of 2014 -- so you would expect the normal 11-month resolution, with a rate increase in June. Again, we're timing this rate case, certainly, to pick up these large capital investments that we're making this year, but in the early part of 2015, given the Missouri regulatory framework, you would expect to have some regulatory lag as a results of those investments, when you think about depreciation, property taxes, the potential for some incremental O&M costs in early 2015. Then the rate increase would kick in that June time frame of 2015. Then we lay out just a number of the other drivers, which we've got. As you know, the formula rates in Illinois, the investments we're making there in both the gas and electric portions of our Business, and of course the investments we're making in the transmission. Then, as you know, the somewhat incremental reduction we would expect to get with the parent and other costs going into 2015."
"Okay, thanks.","You're welcome.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the ﬂoor back over to Mr. Fischer for any additional concluding comments.     Before we complete our call today, Warner and Tom have some closing remarks. Warner?     Thanks. I know it has been a long call and I thank you for your interest in the Company, but we do have a couple of closing comments. As I said at the outset, I'm very, very humbled and honored to follow in Tom's footsteps. As you all know, his strong leadership over these past ﬁve years has delivered tremendous value to our shareholders and I can tell you his leadership has also delivered tremendous value to our customers and all the communities that we serve. It's important to know that Tom's strong leadership has also positioned Ameren and our team to continue to deliver superior value to our shareholders and customers and, frankly, the communities that we serve in the future. He has demonstrated a commitment to safety, diversity, and service to our shareholders and our customers and our communities, as well as a generation of Ameren coworkers for 45 years -- well, it's just simply unequaled. So, Tom, on behalf of our entire Ameren team, I want to thank you for your tremendous leadership, and I just want to personally thank you for being such a ﬁne mentor and a friend to me, so thank you, Tom.     Thanks, Warner. This is my ﬁnal quarterly earnings call for Ameren and I would like to share a few thoughts. It's been an honor to lead this great Company for these past ﬁve years. I am pleased that during this time, our team developed a clear vision and strategy for the future, and made signiﬁcant progress on executing that strategy. My many years with the Company have been very rewarding. I've always said that the secret to a great career is to be able to say that you love what you do, why you do it, and who you do it with. I can tell you that I have really enjoyed working with our Board of Directors, our leadership team and co-workers for the beneﬁt of Ameren shareholders and customers. I've also enjoyed interacting with so many of you in the investment community. Warner has been with Ameren for nearly 20 years and has served in a wide variety of leadership roles in ﬁnance and operations. I have absolute conﬁdence in his ability to lead Ameren and that he will continue to execute on, as well as enhance, Ameren's growth strategy.     This is Doug. Thank you for participating in this call. Let me remind you again that a replay of the call will be available for one year on our website. If your questions, you may call the contacts listed on today's release. Financial analyst inquiries should be directed to me, Doug Fischer, or my associate, Matt Thayer.
