Question,Answer
"Hey, everybody, it's Nathan Richardson on for Nick.","Hey, good morning, Nathan. This is Marty Lyons. Hey, before you get to your question, I just -- you may not have experienced this, but I think many of our participants that were participating on the webcast missed a portion of our prepared remarks because of systems issue, but I just want to reassure everybody, we will post our replay of the entire conference call as soon as possible following the end of the Q&A session. So with that, please carry on with your question."
"Got you. And I just want to talk about equity needs ﬁrst. I'm sorry if I missed this, but in the September slide, you talked about $500 million of equity needs per year from $24 million to $27 million. And would this still be the case? And would you mind maybe talking about how you're thinking about ATM versus block needs and what you would be open to?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yes. Perfect. This is Michael. Yes, our equity needs are really unchanged from where they were. At the beginning of the year, we issued our 5-year guidance. We talked about $300 million of equity that we needed to do in '23, and then $500 million per year, beginning '24 through the balance of '27 million. Happy to report, I think we've said this before, we've taken care of those equity needs for '23. Those have been done under an ATM forward sales, so we'll bring those down here at the end of the year.  We've sold forward about $100 million of the $500 million need for '25 through some forward sales. You know, as we sit here today, we continue to ﬁnd the ATM to be very eﬀective, eﬃcient. We'll continue to evaluate our needs. Our capital comes in pretty ratably. So the ATM works well from that perspective. And so -- but we're always open to, if there are better mechanisms to continue to take advantage of."
"Got you. And then one last one. So sticking with ﬁnancing. You have a robust IRP with a lot of renewables. Can you help me think about your position on transferability, cash ﬂow, and whether that is something you would utilize and maybe a timeline for that.","Yeah, you bet. I mean, it looks like the transability market continues to evolve here nicely and we continue to see some deals get starting to get done there, which is great.  Yes. I mean as we kind of step back and think about it, it's certainly something we could avail ourselves of over time just because we don't have necessarily the tax appetite to use all those when we need to. And so as we think about from a ﬁnancing perspective, I mean, there could be it could be a slight positive, right, just over time? I mean ultimately, you're going to end up providing those back to customers, which is great because it ends up lowering the cost of those renewables, which is what we all want.  But there could be some positive temporary regulatory lag that we may experience from time to time, but not a huge, I think, replacement of any sort of ﬁnancing needs going forward, if that makes sense."
Got it. Makes sense. Thank you very much.,You bet. Thank you.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Hey, Shahriar. Good morning."
"Good morning. Let me just starting with Illinois. I mean, can you just maybe talk a little bit about the outlook for the balance of the process here on the multiyear? I mean, obviously, your neighbor in Chicago was very dissatisﬁed with the ALJ. You have briefs out there. I guess what's your expectation for the ICC to depart from the ALJ at this point? And what's the next step, right? So would you consider ﬁling for a rehearing of the ALJ stands as is? Would you look to defer redeploy CapEx? I'm just kind of curious what the next step could be if you get an adverse decision.","Yes. Look, Shar, I think great questions overall. First of all, as you referred to, we ﬁled our reply brief in September. And we believe that what we ﬁled there really best supports achievement of the state of Illinois' goals as captured in the Clean Energy and Jobs Act. And so if you look at that, that's where we really believe that the state would be best served and the customers of the state.  So look, I would say, as I think about the process to date, we've been pleased both the staﬀ and frankly, now that in the NBA, with ALJ as well, they've supported nearly 95% of our planned capital investments over the next 4 years. So I think that's a positive that's occurred through this process. We -- as we stated in our prepared remarks, are disappointed with the recommended return on equity and capital structure that came from the ALJ as well as the treatment of the OPEB asset. But the case isn't over.  Like I said, last week, we ﬁled our brief on exceptions. We articulated our concerns and the reasons for seeking a better outcome from the commission. And I'd say that's really where you get to the next steps, reply brief on exceptions are due on November 14, and then we'll expect a commission decision by mid-December.  As we said in our -- again, in our prepared remarks, we continue to support our initial asks of a 10.5% ROE and 54% equity in the cap structure. But we did in our reply brief suggests an alternative that the commission could arrive at 9.85% ROE or an alternative equity structure of 52% equity. And in coming up with those, we looked at alternative data and the record looked at the averages of comparable utilities as it related to cap structure. So again, I'd refer you to our ﬁling for further details on those.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   But we remain hopeful at this point that the commission will meet is going to reach a more constructive and fair outcome that came from the ALJ. And then at this point, I wouldn't comment on what action we may take post the commission ruling. Michael, you want to make a comment?     Yeah, Mike. Agree with all those comments. And just Shar to remind you, I think you know this, I mean, it's about 18% of our rate base today. And again, as we sort of step back and just look at our overall capital plan, we got the the $19.7 billion out there over the next 5 years and $48 billion over the next 10.  I think we have really constructive jurisdictions to continue to allocate that. We'll continue to be thoughtful about that. As Marty said, I think where we are from a rate base and capital addition standpoint and that rate review process is a positive at 95% or so. But we have some ﬂexibility to pivot if needed."
"And then just to conﬁrm, just the equity ratio growing into it, no block equity. So just I guess how do we think about juicing of that?","Yeah. I mean again, as I think as we sit here today, really just kind of stand by the comment I just made about the ATM itself. I think it provides us a great deal of ﬂexibility. It's cost-eﬀective. It's not to say that we wouldn't entertain something if we needed to. But again, just the way that capital is being laid in over time. It's been a pretty eﬀective way to do it.     Yeah. And Shar, just to build on sort of the answers that I gave and the Michael gave. I think as it relates to our overall plan, and Michael mentioned this, I mean, we obviously have robust portfolio of capital expenditures that we can make across all of our segments. And we really feel very conﬁdent as we sit here today and our continued ability to grow at 6% to 8% in terms of our EPS CAGR. As we've laid out before, we've got $48 plus billion of infrastructure pipeline out through 2032. And we remain very conﬁdent in our overall ability to execute as a company."
"Perfect. Thanks very much, guys, and big congrats to Warner. But I have a sense that he's going to be as busy as ever anyway, even in phase two. Appreciate it, guys.",You're probably right. Thanks.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Thanks. Our next question comes from Julian Dumilo Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, guys, good morning. This is Darius on for Julian. Appreciate you taking the question. Maybe just to start with, you alluded to this, and I appreciate that you don't have formal '24 guidance out there. But with the drivers and the visibility that you have now and the known of the ALJ rex in both the Illinois cases, can you comment on maybe just how you see that 6% to 8% shaping up on a year-over-year basis? Does the sort of give you a basis to still hit that range in '24?","Hey, Darius, Michael here, thanks again for that question. Look, again, as we sit here today and we updated and provided guidance in February, that's we feel good about that 6% to 8%, thinking about that midpoint of 4.35%. We gave you some select drivers here, right, in terms of what we see sort of impacting us kind of year-over-year. But again, feel good about the situation that we're in and we again feel good about the 8.4% rate base growth that we have.  We've had obviously the updated IRP that we released in September. We talked about an incremental $1.5 billion of capital that could come into the plan over time there. So again, as we sit here today, feel very good about that 6% to 8% earnings per share growth."
"Okay, excellent. Thank you for the detail. And maybe if I can ask one on the competitive transmission projects. Just looking at your updated slide, it looks like the -- and I appreciate these are MISO's estimates, but it looks like the overall competitive opportunity is unchanged at a little bit under $1 billion, but there was- maybe within that, the content, including Orient Denny Fairport was slightly lower than in our previous or in the previous estimates. So just curious if you guys can comment on maybe the other projects within that set of competitive opportunities, do you see any anything moving up or down as the estimates get for the reﬁned?","Yeah, happy to answer that question. This is Marty again. So again, with respect to the projects that were signed to us in Tranche 1, the $1.8 billion, as we've we're getting underway with those, which is fantastic. And then there were about $700 million of competitive projects. And the ﬁrst one that we bid on was the Orient to Denny Fairport project. And we're very pleased that we were selected as the winning bidder on that project.  As you mentioned, the ultimate price that we bid was lower than the MISO's original planning estimate. And I think our bid is indicative of the kind of work we do to partner with others, whether those be co-ops and munis in the area or vendors to really deliver a low-cost project.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And as I mentioned, MISO's numbers are planning estimates and don't necessarily have the rigor that goes into the formal bids that we provide. But I wouldn't read too much into where that project came out relative to MISO's estimates. Each project is going to be diﬀerent. Each project has its own routing issues, land acquisition requirements, partnering opportunities, et cetera.  So you really can't extrapolate that outcome to the entirety. But again, I think we're very pleased with where we are. We are very pleased that we were selected as the winning bidder on that project, and we submitted another bid on another project, the Denny to Zachary to Thomas Hill to Maywood project. And we've got one more that we plan to bid on as well, the Skunk River Ipava."
Great. Thank you very much for the color. Appreciate it.  Operator  Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"Just wanted to come back to Illinois Electric, if I could, realized questions have been asked, but maybe just to put a ﬁner point on some of the questions here. Why do you think the ALJ's ROEs came out so diﬀerent than your proposal? Or are there any speciﬁcs in the ALJ ﬁling that you see that justiﬁes this diﬀerence or why they view the electric ROEs less than the gas ROEs as you see kind of justifying this delta?","You know, I can't really -- It's Marty again. I really can't comment on why, if you will, they got to that. They used some discounted cash ﬂow and capital asset pricing model kind of calculations that used some data that was in the record. But again, in our reply briefs, we note certain data that alternatively should be used in our view, in those calculations if they were used. And of course, staﬀ use similar calculations and came up with a little over 10%. So again, I can't say why, but we again feel like inappropriate data points were used in those calculations, which, again, in our reply briefs we addressed, and I'd refer you there in terms of our thoughts in terms of those CAT calculations.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Got it. Understood. Maybe pivoting towards Missouri here and the IRP, what has been the reaction to the proposed Missouri IRP here? How have conversations with stakeholders been trending over time?","Yeah, I think the conversation that's been had within the state is very much a balanced one. I think that some of the things that we put into this IRP as opposed to our prior one was the addition of 800 megawatts of gas simple cycle in 2027. And we made a couple of adjustments to, ﬁrst of all, the timing of, one, coal-ﬁred energy center to push that out for a couple of years and with it push out a 1,200-megawatt planned combined cycle plant. And then I can say we also move forward some of the battery storage technology we had planned by about 5 years.  And I think the conversation has been balanced because in doing this, what we're really doing is putting -- stressing the fact that our integrated resource plan really represents what we believe to be the lowest cost approach to transitioning our portfolio of energy centers over time and maintain, importantly, the reliability that our customers expect and as we do that, making sure that we're being good environmental stewards. We're able to add those resources to bolster reliability while still hitting carbon emission reduction targets that we've discussed previously of 60% by 2030, 85% by 2040 and ultimately, that net zero.  So again, I believe the conversation has been really balanced because of that, our focus on aﬀordability, our focus on reliability while still hitting our targets in terms of environmental stewardship."
Got it. Makes sense. Very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you.,"Thank you.     Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. Wondering if you could just speak a little bit to-related to the CCNs and renewables in Missouri, how competitive are renewables currently? And just what's your latest in terms of how you're positioned to compete for company-owned generation versus contracting?","Yeah. With respect to the Missouri renewables, earlier this year, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved two solar projects that we had proposed, both the Huck Finn and the Boomtown solar projects. Together, they're about 350-megawatt as of investment. And those are projects that we -- will be constructed and that we will own, and we expect the closing date on those to be Q4 of 2024. So a good step forward in terms of commission approval of projects consistent with our IRP and our ownership.  We also ﬁled four CCNs this year for an additional 550 megawatts of solar projects. 4 projects in total. And that's going to be proceeding. We expect a commission decision on that early next year. And again, we do believe it's in the best interest of our customers and communities long term for these projects to be constructed for our ownership.  In our Integrated Resource Plan, we didn't change the amount of our are anticipated and planned overall renewables versus our prior IRP. We did include an expectation that the costs associated with those renewables would increase. However, those costs are being oﬀset by the impact of the higher production tax credits and investment tax credits that are available under the Inﬂation Reduction Act. So when we go to -- when you look at the IRP, which we laid out the time line on Slide 10 that we provided. What you see there is a really good balance of the growth in renewable projects, but also investments in assets that will preserve reliability, as I mentioned a second ago, both the gas simple cycle, the gas combined cycle, some of the battery storage technology that's really going to ensure that we continue to have a reliable system.  But the important thing is that this combination of resources, along with the continued investment, ensuring the reliability of our existing dispatchable assets, both our Callaway nuclear plant as well as our coal assets through retirement, we really believe that this represents a least cost plan for providing energy to our customers in Missouri and preserving again, the reliability that they expect. So again, the CCNs that we're proposing for the renewables really ﬁt with execution of this IRP.  And then with respect to your last question. While you can't rule out the possibility of of PPAs. What we've really demonstrated over time, if you look at some of the renewable projects that we've put into our portfolio and have had approved by the commission, is that we really do believe in the long term, that our ownership and operation of these assets provides the long term lowest cost for our customers."
Great. Thanks for all that color. Very helpful. And I was wondering if you could also touch on your expectations here for load growth going forward. We've seen weather normal loads still   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   trending down through most of the year. I'm wondering if you could give your perspective on when that might settle down and outlook for industrial sales to within that?,"Yeah, you bet. Good morning, David. It's Michael. Yeah, this year has obviously been little interesting. You see some of the decreases in residential. I think we attribute that to a couple of things. We had some signiﬁcant storms, a number of them over the summer that certainly contributed a bit to that. And then also, we still just working through, I think, the going back from working at home into the oﬃce. And so you're certainly seeing that transition as well. And it continues to throw the number around a bit.  We -- obviously, we've had some extreme weather here and there, which always factors into kind of how you think about this on a normalized basis, but you try to get it as close as possible. I do think it is beginning to level out as we kind of look forward. I mean, again, I think I pointed out, if you look at our residential side of things, I mean, you're seeing about 3% growth relative to where we were kind of pre-pandemic. And the other positive is we actually have customer growth year-to-date, too. So ultimately, you believe that's going to continue to transition into some sales growth.  I think on the commercial side, we continue to see some positives. I mean the industry noted that obviously we are impacted by the strike at GM that was going on for some period of time. That obviously seems to be concluding. There's actually an expansion that has occurred there. So we should see that be a positive element going into the remainder of the fourth quarter.  And then I think there's some positive developments that we're seeing just broadly on the industrial side as well that are adding some growth. So I mean as we look out in the future, I think we still stick by this about 0.5% kind of load growth over time. I think that has the ability, hopefully, to move up as some of this industrial continues to evolve, but that's where we are today, David."
"Okay, great. Thanks so much. See you soon.",You bet.  Operator  Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning, guys.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Good morning, Paul."
"Just wanted to -- and I apologize if I missed this because I did have some tech problems. But the -- Darius was asking about the competitive bid, and I was wondering, do you guys have any data that you guys provided or can provide on kind of what kind of returns you're seeing in the competitive transmission versus just in general?","Yeah. Paul, ﬁrst all, I do apologize again for the technical diﬃculty you and others experienced apologize for that and the inconvenience.  I don't think we have anything that we could point to in terms of return. I would say this. I mean, when we bid on these projects, we're very cognizant of what we think our cost of capital is and what appropriate return expectations are for these projects. So that's certainly taken into consideration when making any bid. So I think the assumption should be that as a winning bidder of this project that we expect to earn a fair return on the project."
Sure. Okay. But I guess maybe it's competitive to tell us what that might be? Is that right? Or can you?,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, we'll give some consideration post the call to whether there's anything we can point to. But yeah, I think that probably not something that I think we could point to today."
"Okay, cool. The second question I have is on the ROFR legislation, which you guys plan on pursuing perhaps in the spring? It seems according to the slides and stuﬀ. I'm wondering about the lake -- the need, I think that's the case at the Supreme Court -- that sat ROFR case in Texas that the Supreme Court may or may not. If it doesn't get so drawy, and I'm sure you guys are following the case, what does that mean with respect to the ROFR situation, generally speaking, I mean, how should we think about that?","Well, You know, I think Paul, as it relates to the court cases -- as you know, we watch court case around the country, both in Texas as well as a couple of other states. We've seen -- we've seen them run into problems in Texas. We've seen the ROFRS upheld in other states. So we're going   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   to continue to watch the developments across all of these cases. and then make sure that whatever we bring forward, which we do plan to bring forward next year, these rights of ﬁrst refusal, both in Illinois and Missouri. That we make appropriate adjustments to the proposed legislation to ensure that they're able to withstand legal challenges and hold up.  If for some reason through the process of these things going through the courts, we don't believe that they'd be lawful. Obviously, that would aﬀect whether we move forward with seeking these rights of ﬁrst refusal or not. But as we sit here today, we do believe both in Missouri and Illinois that these rights of ﬁrst refusal really are very beneﬁcial to our customers and communities.  I think we just talked about this project that we won, which was this Orient to Denny to Fairport project. And I think it just goes to show that we are a low-cost constructor. We are a low-cost operator. And we do believe that these projects have very good value for customers. And when MISO puts these forward in Tranche 1, what's to come in Tranche 2, these projects have very good beneﬁt to cost ratios. And by not assigning those to the incumbent transmission operator by putting them out for bid, you're delaying those beneﬁts to customers by two years or so.  And again, we've certainly demonstrated we're a low-cost provider. So we do think that these rights of ﬁrst refusal are in the best interest of our customers, the citizens of both the states of Illinois and Missouri. And we look forward to working with stakeholders as we move towards the next legislative session to really build a stronger coalition and make sure people really understand the value, and we'll work with all stakeholders to put forward legislation that we think not only can pass, it should pass, but can withstand any core challenges.  So back to your question, Paul, we'll continue to monitor these cases as we have and adjust as needed."
"Okay. And absolutely, I hear you on your ability to demonstrate your competitiveness and stuﬀ. But just I guess what I'm saying -- I guess what I'm asking about is the Supreme Court, I guess, what I'm wondering is would that invalidate ROFRs? Do you follow them across the country? Or do you see this as being speciﬁc to I mean I guess what I'm saying -- what, I don't know understand is the math of -- of an industry question, if you follow me to sort of. I'm trying to ﬁgure out for my own ediﬁcations or like what happens if it is in ROFR, I guess that would mean the Fifth Circuit would stand. And if that is the case, what -- how do we think about the ROFR? Do you follow where I'm coming from?","Well, I do. And I guess we'd have to see how the Supreme Court rules, what they say. But when we talked about this a little bit on the last call. When we looked at Texas, we thought it was really more applicable to the situation in Texas. Whereas when we looked at crafting the rights of ﬁrst refusal we've been putting forward more aligned with states where the ROFRs have been upheld in the courts. So I think we'd ultimately have to look at the ultimate the Supreme Court decision and its applicability. But I guess I can't really comment further at this time, Paul.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"I got that. I appreciate it. Thanks so much, and thanks.",You bet. Thank you. See you soon.  Operator  Our ﬁnal question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just hopefully an easy one. You talked a lot about the ﬁnancing plan. It seems like it's intact. A lot of capital opportunities, rate base opportunities. I'm just wondering what do you think is the most challenging part of the play that you have?","Yeah, hey, it's Michael. Look, I think it's just about continued execution around all these projects, right? I mean I think we got some robust rate base growth, 8.4%, as you just noted, $20 billion of capital plans. We got to continue to execute these well, get them into service, make sure we realize all the beneﬁts associated with them.  Obviously, we're in a diﬀerent ﬁnancing environment today than we were a couple of years ago. So that creates some headwinds you've got to continue to work through. But I mean ultimately, I think we talked about this in the past, we've got a number of mechanisms to recover those ﬁnancing costs pretty rapidly through both on the Illinois side. We can always accelerate some rate reviews if we needed to on the Missouri side.  But at the end of the day, I think it's really this just comes back down to just an aﬀordability, opportunities just making sure that we keep cost as low as we possibly can for customers as we work through this incredibly important clean energy transition.  Marty, anything to add to that?     No, I think that's well covered. Anthony, any other questions?"
"No, I'm good. Thanks so much. I'll catch you guys up in Phoenix.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Look forward to seeing you next week.  Operator  Mr. Lyons, there are no further questions. At this time I'd like to turn the ﬂoor back over to you for closing comments.     Well, thank you all for joining us today.  Once again, I apologize for the technical diﬃculties, some of your experienced those -- you experienced, and as I mentioned, we'll make sure that we are post a replay of this call as quickly as possible.  I think what you heard today is we have really had a strong start to 2023. We've gotten through these important summer months. And just with just a couple of months left, remain remain very conﬁdent in our ability to achieve our earnings per share growth goals for this year and earnings per share range that we've outlined today.  We make sure that we're focused on continuing to deliver strong value, both for our customers, our communities as well as for our shareholders. As we underscore today, we continue to expect 6% to 8% earnings per share growth for '23 to '27. It's supported by strong investment in rate-regulated infrastructure and rate base growth of 8.4% compound annually from 2022 to 2027. So we feel very good about our execution of our plan, and I thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you all soon.  Have a great day.
