Question,Answer
Hi. Good morning.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"Good morning, Julien.     Good morning."
"Excellent. So, just ﬁrst detailed question then a bigger picture question. On energy eﬃciency, obviously you're talking about lower load growth here in general, but what is the annualized impact here in 2016 after incentives? It seems as if it's about $0.17. In tandem with that, what are the weather-normalized sales trends excluding Noranda? And then, most importantly, what are your 2017 expectations as you think about that energy eﬃciency drag?","Yeah. Sure, Julien. This is Marty and, obviously, a number of questions there. I think as it relates to energy eﬃciency, you got to keep in mind that some of what we've quantiﬁed is year-over- year comparative impacts from last year to this year. So, when we think about that, you got to remember that the construct of the energy eﬃciency plan in Missouri from 2013 through 2015 was diﬀerent than the one we've got now. And last year, we were being compensated for some of the eﬀorts associated with energy eﬃciency, and being compensated not only for the current year eﬀects in 2015, but some of the carryover eﬀects to 2016. And so, that's creating a bit of a year-over-year comparison, and that's why we've noted some of those facts this year.  In terms of the sales trends, what we're seeing, and we mentioned this on the call, year-to-date, on a consolidated basis, residential and commercial sales were roughly ﬂat. Frankly, they're up a little bit in Missouri and down a little bit in Illinois. And then industrial sales overall were down about 4%, with Missouri down about 0.5%, and Illinois down more signiﬁcantly. When you actually exclude the impacts of energy eﬃciency in Missouri, we would actually see overall sales, instead of being ﬂat, overall sales we'd see up about 1.5%.  On the residential, we think they'd be up about 1.3%, commercial maybe up 2%, and industrial, while they're down on a reported basis, maybe up 0.5% excluding energy eﬃciency. So, we do see those programs as having an eﬀect, both the programs we put in place last year having a carryover eﬀect to this year, but also the current year programs that we've now put into play. So, they are having an impact, but overall, sales are about where we thought. We said they – we thought they'd be about ﬂattish because of the eﬀects of energy eﬃciency and that's about where they are.  I think, economically, unemployment's running pretty good in Missouri, frankly. I think you probably saw nationally the unemployment is at about 4.9% now for the past couple of months. What we're seeing in Missouri is it's actually running a little bit below that, closer to 4%. While, unfortunately, on the Illinois side, we're seeing some of the industrial sales declines, seeing unemployment a little bit higher over there at about 6%.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   But overall, I think, the economies are remaining stable. We're seeing a little bit of growth, I'd say in Missouri, especially when you strip out energy eﬃciency. In Illinois, while the industrial sales are down, we're still seeing some growth in terms of residential and commercial demand, which we see as a positive."
"And then, just a follow-up here on the broader 5% to 8% CAGR. Can you comment quickly what the impact is from the U.S. Treasury being down within that range? Perhaps it's a linear (28:55), but I just want to reaﬃrm it. And then separately related, what about the impact from pension discount rates? Just want to make sure we understand, it's probably fairly modest given Illinois and then also Missouri, but just want to make sure we have that right.","Yeah. Sure. I know, I understand the question. I think that if you really think about the 5% to 8% growth over time, as we've said repeatedly, that's really anchored by the 6.5% compound annual rate base growth. And so, that really is the foundation. And then, when you think about whether we would be above that or below that from an earnings per share growth perspective, certainly, changes in Treasury rates or earned ROEs, sales growth levels, spending levels, regulatory decisions, all of those things can push you up or down within that range. And look, it's a ﬁve-year outlook, going out to 2020. So, a number of things can happen over that time, and that's why we have sort of a $0.40 range when you look out to 2020.  As it relates to the current impact of the 30-year Treasury since we mentioned on the call, we have booked to a lower Treasury yield than we expected at the beginning of the year. Beginning of the year, we had expected Treasury yields to be around 3.2%, while we booked 2% as of the end of June as an average rate for the year of about 2.65%, and of course, the current 30-year Treasuries are sitting at 2.25%.  So, that has caused us to change our outlook for this year; we've baked that into our guidance range for this year. I'd remind you that 50-basis-point move in ROEs in the Ameren Illinois delivery business of about $0.025. So, that gives you a sensitivity, but we've baked that into our current year guidance. We feel very good about the guidance, we were able to raise it $0.05 as you know this year, which is a positive. It's net of the impacts of those changes in 30-year Treasuries.  And as it relates to our long-term guidance, we obviously update our overall thoughts about how we're going to manage the business going forward on an annual basis, but right now, feel very good about that 6.5% rate base growth and that 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth that we've projected.     Marty, Julien had one other issue on pensions and OPEBs.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah. Thanks, Warner. On the pension and OPEB, which was a good question, Julien, I know that's impacting some folks with the lower discount rates that are expected. But we have trackers in Missouri for both pension and OPEB and then, in Illinois for our energy delivery business as well as in our FERC transmission business. You have formulaic rates, so we're largely protected from those declines that are happening in terms of the discount rate.  In the Illinois gas business, obviously, we have forecasted test years and depending on the timing of those ﬁlings, there can be some impact there, but largely insulated from the impacts of the changes in discount rates and any kind of asset performance changes."
Thanks so much.,"Sure, Julien.  Operator  Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please state your question."
Yeah. Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning.     Good morning, Brian."
"The $0.05 increase in the guidance, is there any way to break down some of the more noticeable positives and negatives? It looks like interest rates would be maybe a $0.025 negative versus previous guidance and – I'm not sure – I think weather is $0.01 positive, just maybe if you can elaborate on that, what's operational and what's kind of weather-related?","Yeah. Sure, Brian. Good question. And I think if you look back at our beginning-of-the-year guidance and then, walk through our ﬁrst quarter and now second quarter disclosures, you can piece some of these things together and you've got some of those. I think as it relates to –   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   starting with our guidance at the beginning of the year and thinking about how it moved, we had an $0.08 or so pickup from the adoption of the new accounting standard in the ﬁrst quarter, which was a positive. At that same time, we also had a couple of additional cents of decline due to this Noranda outage. We started the year thinking it was going to be about a $0.13 impact and now we're at about $0.15 impact.  We also had – as you mentioned, we've now had a little bit of a lowered expectation in terms of the Treasury rates, and again, like you said, that has impacted us by $0.02 or $0.03 there as well. So, those are some of the impacts that we had. Now, in the ﬁrst quarter, we also had negative weather, it was about $0.05 negative in the ﬁrst quarter. As mentioned on the call, we had a positive weather here in the second quarter, which more than oﬀset – more about a $0.01 positive now for weather year-to-date.  So, when you look at that, where we are at the end of six months, you've got that tax gain that we experienced in the ﬁrst quarter, you get about a $0.01 of positive weather and we've had some oﬀsets due to the decline in the Treasuries and then, this temporary impact of the Noranda outage that we're experiencing this year. So, those are some of the things that were plusses and minuses versus our original expectations and why we were positioned then with the backdrop of very solid operations and very solid execution of our strategy and our plan for this year that we're able to raise the guidance by $0.05."
"Okay. Great. And it's my understanding that you're using – that the ATXI and FERC transmission is being ﬁnanced at the parent. Just want to be – if you like, you could clarify the ﬁnancing strategy with ATXI and when might we see it break out into a separate sub and that parent leverage be a little bit more transparent?","Yeah. That's – you correctly described it, I mean, what we're doing today, because it is the most – has been the most eﬃcient way to do it as we've been ﬁnancing the transmission growth at our ATXI business through ﬁnancing at the parent, which we've got both some short-term and long- term ﬁnancing in place there at the parent that supports the investments we've been making at ATXI. Obviously, as that short-term debt grows to parent, we'll consider when it might be appropriate to term some of that out. I don't expect that to be this year, but in prospective periods, we'd really might consider that.  And to the extent that we believe it's more eﬃcient at that point to do it at an entity other than Ameren Corp, at either ATXI or a holding company level, we'll evaluate that going forward. But as we approach that decision, whether that be next year or in some period beyond, we'll certainly be happy to discuss our thinking at that time about why we're proceeding."
"Got it. And then, the Missouri electric case ﬁling, did you ﬁle the a utility cap structure or the parent cap structure?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","On the Missouri ﬁling that we ﬁled as we mentioned on the call, it had a equity content in the cap structure of 51.8%, and that is the cap structure of the utility subsidiary, Ameren Missouri."
Okay. Great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.,
"Hey, guys. Congrats to a good start to the year. Can you talk about, in your multi-year forecast what your planning is for leverage at the holding company level? Meaning, do you plan on delevering the holding company, do you plan on issuing debt solely to fund ATXI or using debt at the holding company level and sending it down to the utilities to help fund utility growth?","Michael, this is Marty. And as you've seen in our slides, we have about $11 billion expenditure plan over the next ﬁve years. It's something that we believe, given the strength of our balance sheet today, we can ﬁnance solely with debt and maintain a very strong balance sheet and maintain very strong credit metrics relative to the ratings that we have today.  And then as we think about the expenditures, obviously we've got those at each of the subsidiaries, we do ﬁnancing independently at each one of the subsidiaries. So we have – obviously, we issued long-term debt at Ameren Illinois, Ameren Missouri. And then as we just spoke about on a prior Q&A, as it relates to the ATXI transmission business, then we are using parent company leverage or debt to be able to fund those investments at ATXI and at some point may very well be able to do ﬁnancing either at ATXI or some sort of intermediate holding company.  But that's overall our plan, and our goal is with each one of our utility subsidiaries to maintain very strong overall balance sheets there as well. So that's how we're balancing things out, and again, we do believe we'll be able to ﬁnance this capital expenditure plan with debt (38:52) over the coming ﬁve-year period."
"Got it. So, no real plans for equity or signiﬁcant debt at the holding company to infuse as equity into the operating company?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","That is correct. That's absolutely correct. And I think one thing too to keep in mind longer term, over time, we'll be able monetize some of tax assets that we have up at the parent. We've got quite a bit of tax assets built up overall, about $760 million, but about $460 million or so of that is really at the parent company and it's something that over time we'll be able to monetize as well."
"Got it. One last one, and this is really – I don't know if this is Warner or for Michael, but when you're thinking about the proceeding in Missouri to help improve ratemaking processes, I know some of the testimony ﬁling dates have already passed, and honestly, it didn't look like there were lots of suggestions of very speciﬁc things that other interveners, besides you guys, really were recommending. More, the testimony seemed like it was more please don't do this or don't do that, but not as much please do this or do that.  How do you think the commission kind of takes it from there? Like, if you think about it as this is a giant kind of – a cauldron or boiling pot or lots of things can come out of this, how do you think about what the options that the commission actually looks at are based on what's been ﬁled in the public testimony?","Hello, Michael, this is Warner. I'll take a shot at it and then I'll let Michael add some more of the details on that. Number one, I think I would start with this. This is a positive development that we're talking about the need to address Missouri's aging infrastructure and seeking solutions, especially outside of the legislative session. So, I see that these proceedings that are being conducted, both by the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Senate Interim Committee, an opportunity for stakeholders really to come together to not only share ideas, to share diﬀerences, and to try and ﬁnd a constructive path forward. And so, while maybe some of the ﬁlings included things that the interveners or others did not want to see, that's informative.  Secondly, I know that that Ameren Missouri and then certainly the utility group, they ﬁled speciﬁc suggestions. And there was a host of suggestions to try and address this issue. So I fully expected the commission to carefully look at these things, to engage with stakeholders as well as the Senate Interim Committee to try and advance Missouri forward. Because we've been consistent, we strongly believe that this not only an opportunity but one of these things that it's really imperative for Missouri to move forward with the constructive policies.  And so, we're encouraged by these developments, we look forward to engaging with the key stakeholders. Michael, you've been working with some of the more speciﬁc key stakeholders. Anything you'd like to add in terms of the overall process and where things go from here?      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah. Perfect, Warner. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think that – I mean, where we are today is a positive, as Warner said. I mean, there's a great deal of dialogue that's occurring. And I think that given where the various stakeholders are, it's not terribly surprising. I think that the commission is being very constructive in this process. We'll have a couple more rounds of testimony as we move through it.  As Warner said, the Senate Interim Committee is going to hold some hearings in the very near future. They're really looking to get some outside perspectives. And I think, to me, the one thing that's really positive in all of this is there's a recognition of the issue. Now, there's not tremendous consensus on what the solution is yet, but there's a recognition of the issue. And that's where this whole thing starts. Once we have the problem identiﬁed, we can ﬁgure out how to go about it and come through, through debate and dialogue, come up with the right solution.  So I think it's a positive ﬁrst step, hard to predict where it's going to go, but both, I think, the commission-ordered process as well as the Senate Interim Committee are driving towards an early December date with ample time to work something through the legislative process."
"Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Sure, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please state your question."
Good morning.,"Hello, Paul.     Morning, Paul."
"Just a few quick follow-ups. So, most of my questions have been answered. But the tax asset monetization that you were referring to, is that just over the course of business, or is there any   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   potential transaction that might be contemplated with this structure (43:49)? I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little further on that.","Yeah, really, expect it to be monetized just over the course of business. As we go through time, what will happen is that as we have taxable earnings and we have taxes due, what will happen over time is that the utilities will burn oﬀ their tax assets, the utilities will then pay taxes up to the parent. The parent will be able to monetize this sort of – kind of this tax shield of the $460 million that I spoke about. And then ultimately, once that's burned through, Ameren Corp. becomes a taxpayer, which is out in the 2020, 2021 timeframe is when we project today."
"Okay. And then, on Illinois, there's a lot of legislative discussion there regarding the nuke stuﬀ that Exelon's asking for, but also others are asking for sort of renewable stuﬀ, et cetera. And there's been some discussion of an (44:54) bill, discussion of single ISO kind of things. And I was just wondering, is there any opportunity there for you guys, given your Formula Rate Plan and everything else for additional investments or additional opportunity, or any thoughts or risks – or any thoughts that you guys have that – in terms of seeing what's going on in Illinois?","Hello, Paul, this is Warner again. The simple answer is yes, we're at the table with key stakeholders. And as Exelon and others have promoted plans or potential pieces of legislation, we have provided input. We provided input that we believe that will encourage some additional investments that we believe will beneﬁt customers, but also to make sure that it's balanced for certainly the southern part of Illinois as well as the northern part of Illinois. That's all part of the framework.  And so, we think there are opportunities. Whether that will be a legislative eﬀort, that will be the priority for this legislature here in the short term, remains to be seen. They obviously are very focused on addressing some budget issues, and so once those matters are addressed, perhaps an energy legislation will come to the forefront. But the bottom line is we're engaged, we're simply engaged with them. And Richard Mark, who oversees our operations there. Richard, would you have anything else to add to that?     No, I think you put it well, Warner. I think we're at the table with stakeholders, we're watching the legislation very closely. But in Illinois right now, I think the primary focus of legislature is trying to get some of the state budget issues resolved.     Sure."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Right. Sure. And then just ﬁnally, on the Mark Twain, you guys mentioned the assent process at the counties, is that going well? Is that working out? It's just a – sort of a follow up from – just was wondering if there's anything going on there.","We'll have Maureen Borkowski who oversees our Transmission operations, she'll be able to give you some input on that.     Hi. This is Maureen. Yeah, everything at Mark Twain is going as per schedule. We are basically preparing the packets of information to demonstrate to each county that we need the statutory requirement of safely crossing public roadways. And we continue to have dialogue with each of the commissioners and each of the ﬁve counties to move that forward. So, everything's on schedule at this point."
Great. Thanks so much.,Sure.  Operator  Our last question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
"Yeah. Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Steve.     Morning, Steve."
"Wanted to give you a rare compliment for basically staying disciplined in this Westar M&A process. Usually, people congratulate on doing deals, but sometimes best not to. So just on that   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   front though, could you maybe just give a sense of how important M&A is to the plan or is it pretty much focused on the core rate base growth and it's kind of more opportunistic?","Steve, this is Warner. So, let me comment squarely on this. Our focus is on the strategic plan we laid out right at the outset. That focus, as you can see, is on the organic growth in our business, which is driven by robust rate base growth, which we believe is going to deliver solid earnings per share growth. And we have obviously talked about the dividend that goes along with it that's going to deliver what we think is superior total shareholder return.  As you said, we do believe the industry will continue to consolidate. And certainly in the past, we have obviously participated in some level of consolidation. And so, bottom line is we're focused on our organic growth plan, we're attentive to what's going on in the industry and we'll simply just continue to execute, execute, execute, period."
