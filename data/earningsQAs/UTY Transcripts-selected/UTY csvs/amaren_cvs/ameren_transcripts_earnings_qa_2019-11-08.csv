Question,Answer
It's actually Alex Morgan calling in for Julien.,"Good morning, Julien.     Alex, how are you doing?     Hey, Alex."
"Thanks very much for taking my question. I'm doing well, how are you.",Terriﬁc. Thank you.
Congrats on the guide up in 2019 earnings.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),Terriﬁc. Thank you.
"I have two quick questions, the ﬁrst one, I was just hoping you might be able to conﬁrm that you have not received a letter from the SEC or the FBI regarding any if your activities in Illinois, just thinking about some of your peers in the state.","Sure, sure, this is Warner. And so, look, the simple answer to that question is no, on both counts. And just to be clear, not in the normal course. We don't normally comment on litigation matters and subpoenas unless there are material or have a ﬁnancial impact. But I recognize the sensitivity of this and so I'll just reiterate again, no on both counts period."
"Okay, thank you. I just wanted to ask that one quickly. And then the other question that I had was just a little bit on that 2020 driver slide that you had included. In Ameren Missouri, I know you talked a little bit about the $0.09 lower energy eﬃciency performance. I was hoping you could delve into that a little bit more. Speciﬁcally, how we should be thinking about energy eﬃciency going forward. And also for 2020, how should we be thinking about that being oﬀset.","Sure, Alex, this is Marty. Let me talk a little bit about that. In 2019, we've had a little bit of an unusually positive year in terms of MEEIA performance incentive beneﬁts. In Q1, you may recall that we had about a $20 million beneﬁt and in Q3 we've recognized another approximately $18 million beneﬁt, so the total is about $38 million for the year or approximately $0.11 maybe a little over $0.11. And really that's because of incentives related to two prior programs both the 2013 program and the 2016 programs. And in the quarter, we actually had, as I mentioned in the third quarter, we had this $18 million beneﬁt and the range could have been anywhere from a target incentive about $5 million up to the $18 million that was recognized, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks where we achieved the maximum under the -- under the program. So, we actually had a fairly positive year.  Just to give you a little bit of a sense of history, you go back in time. In 2017, we had really no beneﬁt. In 2018, I think it was about a $0.03 beneﬁt. And then this year, we had, as I said about $0.11 beneﬁt. And like I said, it was something that was -- could have been a range of $5 million to $18 million in Q3. So, a bit of a positive beneﬁt there relatively and versus expectations.  As you look ahead to next year we roll into -- we're into now this year the MEEIA 3, the third version of this energy eﬃciency program. And depending upon the performance under this ﬁrst year, we expect that the beneﬁts next year could be in the range of $7 million to $8 million, so down next year, which is why we're guiding at this point to about a $0.09 negative year-over-   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   year. But I just do want to highlight again that when you look at this year, the fact that we are raising guidance here in the quarter, raising the midpoint of our guidance by $0.03, certainly part of our ability to do that is the -- is the performance incentive that we did earn in Q3 at that maximum level."
Thank you so much. Have a great (inaudible).,"Thanks. We'll see you next week.  Operator  Our next question comes from Greg (inaudible). Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Greg."
"Great. Hey, congrats on a good quarter.",Thank you.
"I was wondering, can you guys quantify this Callaway deferral request. I know that you've embedded about $0.11 for next year as a headwind. But if you get this deferral I guess how much of that $0.11 we get pushed out and kind of spread over the next period?","Yeah, Greg, this is Marty again. You're right. The outage next year, we're forecasting being about $0.11 outage. If the request we made is accepted by the Commission, what we would expect then is that we would defer that $0.11 and then amortize it over approximately an 18 month period. So, to a large extent that $0.11 would be removed from earnings next year. There would be a little bit of amortization sort of at the end of next year, but then of course the next year, when you roll around 2021 when we otherwise -- when we won't have an outage that we would see approximately two-thirds of an outage expense reﬂected in that year. So, that's how we do it.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I'll tell you, Greg, in terms of this ask we've made of the commission, its really not a change in ratemaking per se, or revenue requirement. But I think what this would allow us to do is over time not have ﬂuctuations in our earnings due to the timing of these Callaway outage and give us a smoother trajectory of earnings growth going forward. So that's a part of -- part of the goal with respect to this -- to this ask."
Got you. And then would you envision this being something that you'd be able to utilize to potentially help oﬀset some of the headwinds you're experiencing from the 30-year Treasury move down.,"No, not really. Speciﬁcally, Greg, in terms of that. I think that really like I said, the thrust behind this is to over time have a more normalized level of growth over time and not have these sort of ﬂuctuations associated with Callaway. If you looked at what we did this year. Greg, I mean just in terms of this 30-year Treasury. This year we went into the year thinking it was going to be about 3.1% and we're looking to about 2.5%. So, down about 60 basis points, which created this year about $0.04 of headwind.  As you heard today, we raised the midpoint of our guidance $0.03, a little bit of that is positive weather, we've had a couple of cents of positive weather. We also had these MEEIA performance incentive, I spoke to earlier. But also contributing to that ability to raise guidance with a disciplined cost control. As we look ahead, towards the longer term and the growth that we're expecting of 6% to 8%. Look, the long-term guidance we've given 6% to 8% growth out through 2023 yields about a $0.40 earnings range out there in 2023. If you look at where we are from the beginning of this year until today from, say, a 3.1% Treasury down to about 2.4% today, it's about 70 basis points we're talking about $0.05 or so of earnings. If those 2.4% Treasury rates hold. $0.05 and of itself certainly not going to move us outside that $0.40 range.  As we look to the longer term, we've got a number of tools in our toolbox. We have actions, we believe we can take. We've discussed many times that we've got a very robust pipeline of capital investments that we can make over time and certainly a tool in our tool kit. But bottom line is Greg that range we've got up there. A combination say a range of treasury rates, allowed returns on equity spending levels, regulatory decisions, rate review timing, economic conditions, ﬁnancing plans, etc. And we'll continue to take actions prospectively as we have in the past to deliver on our commitments."
Got you. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Greg.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Paul."
"Hey, good morning.",Good morning.
"So, I want to follow-up a little bit on Greg's question regarding the change in sort of the -- the ROE in Illinois. And I'm just wondering, I mean you went over pretty well the sort of impact on EPS in general. But just the diﬀerence in return versus other jurisdictions is pretty signiﬁcant. And I'm wondering, I know you're just going to get the CapEx update in -- in February. but could you give us a little bit of a ﬂavor of how it may or may not change in terms of your investment outlook just simply given the diﬀerential that you're -- that you're now seeing in Illinois distribution versus the other jurisdictions you have.","Yeah. Sure. Paul, this is Warner. I'll touch a little bit on it and then Marty feel free to jump in. But now look at the end of the day, we've said before, we like the formula rate framework. There are many things to like about it, including the ability to not only earn our allowed returns, but also to get every time and cash ﬂows to make these investments. And so that's worked very well for us for a long time. And as you heard us say -- me say in say on the call, it's a framework that we're going to continue to support whether it'd be in the veto session or the next legislative session. Look, we're mindful of the lower ROEs too. It's not lost upon us and certainly as we think about the overall framework, if there is an opportunity in the current tax of legislative initiative for a good reasonable ﬁx to ROE and Richard and his team, they will take a look at that, but we are clearly focused on -- on this formula rates legislation and passed into 2032 because we think that has delivered signiﬁcant results in Illinois for so many reasons, not just investments, reliability, jobs and aﬀordability. Now when we think about capital allocation, certainly we'll be mindful of that too. But right now we'll come out with a more speciﬁc plan next year, that is potentially a lever, but as Marty also said, we have -- we have a robust capital expenditures that we can put to work in all four of our business segments. So stay tuned. We'll talk more about that in February. Marty anything more to add to that?     I think -- it's great response. I mean, I think one of the things Paul to look at is especially on slide 8. I mean, over time we have allocated more growth capital to the places where we've had the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   more robust ROEs. And as Warner said, we do have a robust pipeline sort of infrastructure, investment opportunities in all of our jurisdictions. So, without giving any speciﬁcs as to what we might unveil in February. Certainly, we've carefully allocated capital over time based upon our OEMs and quality of regulatory frameworks. The other thing I just mentioned, this gets a little bit back to Alex's question as well as yours to Paul, I mean in each one of our jurisdictions will continue to work to earn as close to our allowed returns as we can. Yeah, Alex was speciﬁcally asking about Missouri and overcoming some of this decline and the performance incentives. And I would just note as I reﬂect on her question as it relates to Missouri in each one of our jurisdictions and earning the allowed. Certainly, we're going to exercise disciplined ﬁnancial management, both capital allocation as well as O&M controls as well to work to earn is close to those allowed as we can as we deploy that growth capital."
"Okay, great. Just in terms of the outlook on the legislation in Illinois. I -- is there a potential do you think for -- for changing the legislation signiﬁcantly? Or is it pretty much more sort of an eﬀort of getting what's been working for you pretty well extended. Do you follow what I'm saying?","I do, Paul, this is Warner. Again, look we've been real clear. Our objective is to take the existing formula rate framework and extend it to 2032. We've been -- that's what we've been advocating throughout this year, its what we continue to advocate today and that's what I've said on the call, whether we have an opportunity to address the ROE that is -- that is something that we will look at. But look we like what we have and, if we can make it even better we will do that as well."
Thanks so much guys.  Operator  Our next question comes from Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hey guys, how are you.","Good morning.     Good, Kevin. Thanks.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"I just wanted to ask, just a little bit more speciﬁcally on the -- on the FERC transmission subs, what kind of opportunity is there to add more capital? And also in terms of the kind of rolling ﬁve year period on the PISA in Missouri. What's the headroom beyond what you currently have in the plan?","So, couple of things there, Kevin. I think when you look at -- I'll start with transmission then Michael, I'll let you jump in on the Missouri piece there. Now we look together in transmission, we've said before, we think there are many robust transmission opportunities. I think number one, we've said in other calls that when you see the level of renewable generation being added in the broader MISO footprint and you see all the interconnection agreements that are being put in place today. We believe when you step back and we get through these interconnection agreements that MISO will have an opportunity to step back and say, look, is this the most eﬃcient and eﬀective way for the transmission system to be conﬁgured. And will give those that are in MISO an opportunity to look at potentially multi-value projects down the road, now that's not tomorrow. But we do see that as certainly an opportunity down the road that could be robust expansion there.  Even today, know that we have a vast transmission system and so today we're continuing to address Asian infrastructure. We continue to address sort of new compliance, that's not in both in Missouri and Illinois. So, we continue to see those investment opportunities to be real and signiﬁcant. And certainly you beyond that, there's certainly grid modernization, will go into security and all these other types of things. And so on, Shawn, in the transmission business we've talked often about this, but we see the pipeline to continue to be robust. Anything that I missed in those areas that your new and your team are looking at.     No, excuse me, I think you have well. There is a lot of opportunity that we see coming down the road, especially as we think about the transition to a carbon free generation portfolio that will in fact not only upgrades on our system. But the ﬂows arm system, which will cause us to think about additional investments.     Sure. Michael why don't you hit on Missouri please.     Yeah, really just similar, Warner, I don't think we've speciﬁcally have commented about sort of where our complete opportunities other than to say we have a robust pipeline there. Right I mean, we're investing quite a bit of capital already year-over-year this year. But as we look I mean, we're just beginning to scratch the surface. In terms of making the investments to continue to improve the grid and make the -- and meet the expectations that customers have   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   for us from an increasing standpoint. So, we feel that we have room underneath the cap to continue to do that over time.     If you look, as I said during the my prepared remarks. I mean, Missouri is going in for a rate review and it's been asking for $1 million rate decrease. And so I think that's evidence of the -- the work that we're doing to be very disciplined in our cost management as well as putting to work really signiﬁcant investments that have driven signiﬁcant value to our customers and our communities."
"That's very helpful. And just a follow-up , when you guys raise the growth rate before obviously it was driven by a lot of the stuﬀ you're just highlighting in terms of the sizable capital program that you have going forward. And I know people are focused on the headwind from the 30- year, should we still think that you guys have the program in place to do the midpoint of the range through the -- through the guidance period.","Yeah, Kevin, this is Marty. Look, it goes back to the statement I made earlier, you know the guidance range we gave that 6% to 8%, is about $0.40 range. If you look at where Treasury rates were at the beginning of the year about 3.1% when we gave guidance and now about 2.4%. It's about a $0.05 delta. So, that is not going to move you outside the range and frankly, not move you all of that far oﬀ the midpoint. And as I said earlier, we have a lot of tools in our tool kit, as well as, actions that we can take to oﬀset a $0.05 decline. So, look, I mean we just talked about the robust pipeline we have in all of our jurisdictions. We do believe we have a robust pipeline and transmission, as well as, Missouri Illinois Gas, Illinois electric delivery really across the board, and it's a major tool that we have in our tool kit. But as I said over time that -- that range we have out there accommodates a lot of -- a lot of variables. And we expect to continue to allocate capital wisely. We expect to exercise disciplined management with respect to our costs with a real eye towards aﬀordability for our customers and we've talked here today about making sure that we do the right things regulatorily, legislatively to make sure we deliver on our commitments."
Okay. So it just doesn't sound the $0.05 is basically the bogey for what you guys are -- have to oﬀset with the capital or whatnot.,"Well, as I outlined, we are at 3.1% at the beginning of the year were 2.4% today that's about $0.05."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks guys.","Thanks Kevin.
