Question,Answer
"Can you just give the drivers behind the revised guidance, kind of what drove merchant up? I guess it was weather that took the regulated down.","Sure, Paul. Yes. This is Marty. In terms of the overall guidance, obviously the guidance is aﬃrmed and unchanged. But within the guidance, the regulated upper and lower ends came down about $0.05 and merchant lower and upper ends went up by about $0.05, and they netted out obviously. The big driver for the quarter really in the regulated business was weather as you heard on the call. Weather impacted earnings negatively versus last year by about an estimated $0.13 and versus normal about $0.10. And we had very warm winter weather. And it was that $0.10 weather variance versus normal that caused us to move our guidance down for the regulated businesses by about $0.05. On the merchant side, our guidance had been $0.00 to $0.10 of earnings we moved up to $0.05 to 0.15. As a result of the impairment of our Duck Creek Energy Center, depreciation expense will actually be lowered going forward. And so the increase in our guidance for merchant reﬂects that reduction in depreciation expense."
And is there -- has there been any precedent for delaying the environmental that you've proposed?,"Yes. This is Marty again. The Illinois Pollution Control Board who we've ﬁled with has a history of weighing a number of things, impacts of a proposed variance to the environment as well as the costs of coming into compliance and economic impacts of the compliance plan that is either planned or the alternatives to that plan. So they have a history of sort of balancing environmental issues with economic issues and there has been precedent in the State for variances to be granted. In fact there's some precedent even here with us where variances have in the past been granted by the Pollution Control Board. So you know we're optimistic that our proposed plan will be received favorably by the Board."
How does it interplay with EPA regs?,"Well, as you know, some of those EPS regs are a bit inﬂux as we saw the appeal of the CSAPR rules and then the match rules come into play later down the line. You know, you may recall as a result of our compliance with the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard, we've made signiﬁcant investments in environmental controls. We've burned low sulfur Powder River Basin coal. We   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   control mercury through the use of activated carbon, so we've got a lot of controls in our plants. And those controls, those investments are positioning us well in our merchant business for compliance with MATS and then we'll see how CSAPR evolve. Although we feel like we were positioned well for compliance with the CSAPR rules that existed before as a result again of our use of Powder River Basin coal, the scrubbers we have on some of our plants, as well as the decision last year to shut down a couple of our older uncontrolled plants."
"Thank you, very much.  Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.",
Good morning. Can you hear me?,"Yes, Paul. We can. Good morning."
"With respect to the $0.36 of tax adjustment that gets fully reversed, is that going to be showing up in operating earnings going forward for the rest of the year?","No. Let me describe what that is. Basically what it is from a GAAP Accounting Standard, we're required to book to the estimated end of year eﬀective tax rate, which given the impairment charge that we took, and getting -- projecting out to the end of the year, we're forecasting about a 24.5% eﬀective tax rate. So we're required to book to that in the First Quarter. Because our earnings excluding the impairment charge are seasonal and heavily weighted towards the Third Quarter, the earnings in the First Quarter, excluding the impairment charge, are pretty low. So when you take that impairment charge and you tax eﬀect it at say a 40% kind of eﬀective tax rate, it has the eﬀect of really pushing the eﬀective tax rate down for the quarter down to a very low level. So we had to -- we would strive to decrease the beneﬁt of the Duck Creek impairment tax eﬀect, basically increase the eﬀective tax rate up to that 24.5% level in the First Quarter. But between now and the end of the year and likely between now and the end of the Third Quarter, that will reverse out."
And will that show up in earning?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"Well, yes. It would show up in GAAP earnings, but not core."
"But it won't be showing up in core earnings. And the $0.05, that's just for the three quarters ended, I'm sorry the last three quarters of this year and I guess the full year impact would just be you know we would just annualize that impact. Is that how we should think about it?",Are you talking about the depreciation from --
"Yes, the depreciation for Duck Creek.","It's about, Paul, it's about $25 million. So I think that's probably about $0.06 per share, so the $0.05 per share is really this current year expected impact."
And why only Duck Creek? Was that the only one that was impaired? Is that because of pollution control equipment or how should we think of that?,"Well, you're right, Paul. That's exactly right. It's part of the answer anyway. So when you do an impairment test from an accounting perspective, you look at the -- ﬁrst you look at the expected gross cash ﬂows undiscounted over the remaining lives of the generating assets and then compare it to the carrying values. The Duck Creek facility did have a high book value or carrying value per megawatt and that was really a function as you mentioned of the environmental equipment that is on that plant and that we invested in. But also you might recall, Paul, that that generating unit was actually acquired when Ameren acquired CILCORP years ago. And as a result at that time, in purchase accounting, that plant was written up to its then fair value. So it had a higher value, book value, as a result of that purchase accounting. And then on top of that, the investments were made for environmental control. So it had a fairly high book value compared to our other plants."
"Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator  Terran Miller, Cantor Fitzgerald.",
"Two follow-up questions. First is, if the Illinois regulators make a decision on the environmental issues, is that going to be precedent setting for the State or do you think it's just limited your request?","Well, I think it's speciﬁc to our request. As I said earlier, I think there is precedent for the Pollution Control Board to grant variances like the one that we have requested. So I don't think it's precedent setting in terms of the Pollution Control Board ruling favorably in terms of our speciﬁc requests, but I don't think that then would apply to others. It's really an Ameren Energy Resources speciﬁc variance request."
"Okay, and just as a follow-up for Paul Ridzon's question, if CSAPR rules are not changed, can you get to 2020 without having to scrub?","Well, I think that we're positioned pretty well for those rules. I guess I don't have the data here in front of me to say whether we're well-positioned all the way out through 2020 or what some of the impacts may be. But we're positioned well for it again as I mentioned earlier for the reasons I mentioned earlier when we looked at the mission allowances or the credits that we had as a result of the shutdown of the Meredosia and Hutsonville facilities we did last year as well as the pollution control equipment we have in place and use the Powder River Basin coal. So we're positioned well. We'll see what happens with the CSAPR rules where they come out. But again I talked about this on the February call. When we looked at the deceleration of the Newton scrubber, when we looked at the rules that were most restrictive for us out in that 2015 time frame, it was the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard that was the signiﬁcant limitation, absent the scrubbers."
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Ashar Khan, Visium.",
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hi, Marty. How are you doing? Marty, I just wanted to understand I guess the Genco is doing really well in terms of free cash ﬂow this year but the hedging slide that you gave us updated kind of like nearly shows a 1% remaining unhedged portion that the price could be dropping something like $9 or $10 on a basis from $12 to $13 which would imply that the business becomes negative cash ﬂow next year. So can you tell me, what is the plan, is the Parent going to provide or how are we going to address this negative cash ﬂow going forward? What is the kind of the strategy behind funding the business?","Sure, Ashar. I think Ashar, we're still focused on the merchant business and Genco maintaining an ability to meet its own cash needs and to stay cash ﬂow positive. So we haven't given any guidance yet and so I'm -- I know you've got your own model. I'm not going to comment on the ﬁgures you through out. But that is our goal. It is our focus. And as you saw earlier this quarter, we did put in place a put option that to the extent Genco found itself needing ﬁnancial resources could put its gas-ﬁred assets over to its aﬃliate for an immediate $100 million of cash and then that would be trued up to what, to fair value, so that it would actually receive fair value for the assets. And that's consistent with one of the things we've been talking about for a number of quarters that Genco does have certain assets that it could sell. We have as you've seen over the past couple of years, we've sold some of our smaller gas-ﬁred units and that's an option for Genco to the extent that it did need to raise cash as a fallback. But it's certainly focused on trying to reduce its capital expenditures, reduce operating costs, continuing to work to market its power to higher margin customers and meet its own cash needs."
"Okay, but does the Parent in terms of the write-down or this I guess what you're saying is you're going to sell assets to fund it or does the Parent need equity to fund it as well going forward? Is it going to be a combination of both or it's just the Genco selling assets and plugging the hole?","Well, Ashar, I guess the answer I'm trying to convey is ﬁrst and foremost, they are going to try to manage operating costs and capital expenditures to work towards a cash ﬂow positive situation. With respect to Genco, it could then pursue sales of assets if needed to generate cash and those are the primary focus areas. In terms of the impairment, the impairment was not a Genco asset. It was an Ameren Energy Resources asset, but over in the AERG subsidiary. So the impairment really didn't aﬀect Genco, the legal entity. So it basically rolls up and impacts only Ameren's ﬁnancial statements. And as you see today, nearly 52% equity in our total capital structure after the write-oﬀ and we have plenty of liquidity, over $2 billion of liquidity. So really no impact on cash. Our equity content and our cap structure remains strong and so overall, don't see a need for additional equity at this point."
"Okay. Thank you, so much.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   David Paz, Bank of America.",
"I have a question, but just to follow-up on Ashar's question, if the Genco put option is exercised, would AERG issue its own debt or would it borrow from the Parent?","Yes, David. No, AERG would borrow from the Parent. The AERG doesn't have any borrowing capacity of its own, so it can borrow from the Parent. But then the idea David is that the AERG would be buying those assets from Genco at fair value and could turn around and sell those assets at that price, generate the cash and pay down that borrowings. So that's the idea of it that if some amount of money goes into Genco for those assets, an equivalent amount of value comes out in the form of power plants, which could then be resold to pay down the debt."
"Got it. My question, original question, was on dividend policy. I'm curious if you have an update. How should we think about dividend policy going forward? I know you have 6%, or roughly 6%, rate base growth. Should we expect continued dividend growth?","This is Tom Voss. I -- we really haven't articulated a dividend growth policy but its Management's objective to continue growing our utility earnings by making disciplined investments in the utility infrastructure. And as we grow the earnings and cash ﬂows of the regulated business, we will continue then hopefully to grow the dividend. But any future increase will be a Board decision and it will based on our recent ﬁnancial performance and current ﬁnancial position as well as our outlook for earnings, cash ﬂows, and ﬁnancial position."
Now is that outlook to earnings exclusive to regulated or is it overall --,Regulated earnings.
"Great. Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Reza Hateﬁ, Decade Capital Management.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",
"I guess you have a great utility rate base case CAGR, but I assume that's probably running a little negative cash ﬂow and then I guess we'll see what happens with the merchant segment. How should we think about ﬁnancing over the next two, three years to achieve this rate base CAGR? Do you need to re-institute the drip dribble, or will there be equity in 2013, '14, or how is that going to get ﬁnanced I guess?","Good morning, Reza. This is Marty. I think when you look out and you do your modeling, I think you should assume that over time we are going to look to keep the equity content in our cap structure in alignment with generally where it is. I've talked about this before. Generally in that 50% to 53% kind of equity content in the total capital structure. So as we move through time, we'll want to keep a strong balance sheet and a strong equity content in our cap structure. As you know we don't have the drip dribble program currently issuing any new shares, but as we said I think on our First Quarter call that that's something we'll evaluate on a year-to-year basis and to the extent that equity is needed to keep the balance sheets of our utilities in that strong and that kind of category that I mentioned, we'll certainly act to do that. But it's important when you look out over time to remember that these businesses do generate signiﬁcant earnings each year over and above that which is paid out in dividends, so there's the ability to reinvest retained earnings over time. And I'd also point out that when you see the 6% CAGR in the overall rate base, but you've also got an allocation going to those jurisdictions that have formulaic ratemaking which over time should allow us to continue to bring up our blended earned ROE on that rate base. So in addition to the 6% rate base, hopefully also we'll see a little bit of growth in the blended average earned returns which helps as well."
"And then just ﬁnally I guess just kind of thinking about your regulated earnings power, should I just basically take this new rate base slide and use that or are there any other, anything else that I'm missing in terms of kind of getting your regulated earnings power?","No. I think you're on the right track. I think we just talked about the few things that you would have to consider and that's the rate base growth, the allocation of the capital to the various jurisdictions and how that aﬀects the blended earned ROE. And then over time as you model it out, how we would go about ﬁnancing that, which again I said largely would be through reinvestment of retained earnings, some debt ﬁnancing and then depending on your model, some consideration of additional equity. But the objective getting to that 50% to 53% equity ratio."
"Okay. Thank you, very much.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.",
"Congrats on a good quarter and obviously in terms of some of the regulatory improvements you've made in your jurisdictions over the last couple years. O&M, can you talk -- I just want to make sure I understand year-over-year from 2011 to 2012, both at the regulated side and at the merchant side, what's embedded in guidance for year-over-year changes in O&M?","Mike, thanks, Michael. In some of that, I think we would refer you back to the First Quarter call transcript. But I think when you look at overall, it's in Missouri. You're seeing actually a trend down in O&M. You'll recall that late last year you actually had a voluntary retirement or severance plan that ended up having about a 340-headcount reduction overall between Ameren Missouri as well as our business in corporate services area. So that's rolling through in terms of some cost savings this year. For the merchant business, we actually kind of gave out a speciﬁc number that was down a little bit from the prior year, which was about an expectation of O&M expense of about $290 million. Again like I said, it's a little bit down from last year. And then in Illinois, I think the important thing to remember there is that whatever the O&M costs are, those will actually be included in the formula ratemaking adjustment that we book this year so whether they were to go up or down, it would result in more or less revenue being recognized under the formulaic rate adjustment. We do expect those O&M expenses however to go up as we are ramping up to meet the requirements of the law in terms of investments and job creations. So those O&M expenses are going up in Illinois."
"And thinking about Illinois, in your guidance, what rate base is assumed in guidance for 2012? And what is [ph] earned ROE level is assumed in your guidance level this year?","I'll see whether somebody has the rate base number, I don't have that oﬀ the top. But we did, Michael, overall in terms of the ROE, the mid-point of our ROE reﬂects about a 9.2% earned ROE or assumed earned ROE in Illinois and that assumed average Treasury yields of about 3.3% for the year. So that's the ROE that we had embedded as the mid-point. And you'll recall that there's a -- where the ROE actually ends at the end of the year will be a function of where the 30-year Treasury yields actually go over the course of the year. And then there's a plus or minus 50 basis point collar on that ROE. One thing I might mention is that that plus or minus 50 basis point collar equates to about a plus or minus $0.025 per share. So there is a band or a collar on the ROE based again on the formula. One of the things I'd point you to just in terms of rate base was that in our January 3rd ﬁling and this is on slide 14, the rate base in that January 3rd ﬁling was about $2.16 billion, actually shown on that slide. And what that represented was the rate base from the 2010 FERC Form 1 plus 2011 and 2012 net plant additions. And then what that wouldn't reﬂect is simply adjustments to the deferred tax balances.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Got it. Because I noticed that in the ComEdison ﬁling process, there was about a $500 million diﬀerence in the rate base between the ALJ order and a lot of the Company and even the interveners, which has a signiﬁcant impact. Are you guys facing a similar issue?","You know, I would say Michael, it's probably in the $200 million-ish range, for us I would believe. The other thing to remember about Illinois is and that's just the -- we're talking about the electric delivery rate base, you've also of course got the gas rate base that we're earning on as well as the transmission rate base in Illinois. So that's not total Illinois rate base."
"Understood. Thanks guys. Much appreciated.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Tom Rebinoﬀ [ph], Fore Research & Management.",
"Just a quick question. Wanted to go back to CSAPR one more time. I just wanted to make sure that I understand what you're trying to convey. So basically you guys said that you're well- positioned for CSAPR. So what does that mean exactly then? So if I guess if Illinois does not approve, if Illinois does approve your request, would you have to spend any more money on CapEx beyond what you've told us already or is that going to be it? And then I guess, how do we think about what you mentioned on the last call in terms of having to kind of start thinking about the scrubbers for Newton I guess by the end of this year, maybe early next year?","Yes. Sure. I think in terms of CSAPR, again when we looked out to 2015, absent the Newton scrubber and if the Multi-Pollutant Standard wasn't in place, we believe we were positioned well for compliance with CSAPR and didn't believe the -- and don't believe the Newton scrubber would be needed to meet the CSAPR requirements. And so that's why we're very focused on the Multi-Pollutant Standard variance and relief. Your question about the considerations around the Newton scrubber, obviously we're pursuing this relief from the Pollution Control Board relative to the MPS. Absent that relief, we would sort of be back to where we were I would say when we last talked at -- on our year-end earnings call, which would be that we believe that if we re-accelerate the scrubber project it would take about 20 to 24 months to complete that. And again the way the Multi-Pollutant Standard currently works, there's a ratchet down in terms of SO2 emissions out in the 2015 time frame. So some time in the ﬁrst half of next year is sort of the point that is sort of critical and if we decided to re-accelerate some time in the ﬁrst half of next year, we would be in position to have the scrubbers in place the ﬁrst half of 2015. But again, there are a lot of factors we'll consider in making that evaluation and making that decision. Today, as we've said, market prices just don't seem to and capacity prices just don't   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   seem to justify completion of that scrubber. And we'll continue to evaluate things as we move through time."
"Okay. Got it. And so then a quick follow-up question. So is it the -- I guess it's the Illinois Pollution Control Board that will have to opine on your request. Now is the MISO or I guess does the MISO have a say in this at all, or no?",No. I don't believe so.
"Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.  Operator  Alex Tai, Standard General.",
"Actually just wanted to follow-up on Tom's question there. Speciﬁcally you said that you probably will not need a scrubber to comply you believe with the EPA regs, so what about other forms of capital expenditure? I mean will you need anything else, or do you think you're all set period?","I -- you were breaking up a little bit, but I mean I think your question was would the capital expenditures that we've got or the pollution control equipment that is in place, would we be sort of all set, and I think the answer is yes. We've made signiﬁcant investments for -- in pollution control equipment. We're incurring signiﬁcant O&M costs today for compliance with the Multi-Pollutant Standard. And those things position us well in terms of federal air emissions rules that we're aware of today."
Got it. Okay. So it really is only the state pollution rules that are imposing the need for a new environmental capital expenditure?,"Well, for -- yes, for the -- for this Newton scrubber project, that's right. And again, I'd refer you to our ﬁve-year CapEx plans that we put out in our 10-K and you'll see them updated in the 10-Q,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   but really no change. It -- so based on the equipment we've got in place, the capital expenditure plans we've laid out, we believe we'll be positioned well."
"Okay. And this is a slightly diﬀerent but same line of questioning I guess. You disclosed that you've increased the hedges on the immersion generating segment. Is there any breakdown of where the new hedges are? Are they within the Genco, or within AERG?",Yes. No breakdown there. They are AER overall hedges.
"Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","This is Doug Fischer. Operator, we've exceeded our scheduled hour, but I think we'll take just two more questions. So Operator, if you'd please put those through?  Operator  Thank you, Mr. Fischer. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS."
"So ﬁrst you've talked a lot about this peaker asset sale. Just kind of curious, any outlook in terms of getting that done and kind of the follow-up there? The Grand Tower's unit, I imagine that one has got a better heat rate. How much did it run in the quarter?","You know, Julien, I don't have any speciﬁc data on Grand Tower or the other couple of peakers to share with you. We do expect that Grand Tower will be running more this year than it has in the past given the low power prices. Overall and then on your other question really no update on the overall process. I mean again, the put option was put in place really as more of an emergency situation need arose, they could -- Genco could put those assets. One of the things we pointed out on our year-end call was that Genco had money pool loans that were made to aﬃliates at year-end. Those balances have actually grown a little bit here in the First Quarter. I think when you see their balance sheet I think we've got about $95 million loan to aﬃliates, so really no immediate need for cash. There is those loans that have been made to aﬃliates. So there's really no process under way right now to sell those assets."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Great. And just to make sure I heard you loud and clear here, in terms of actually achieving that 0.38 standard under the new 2020 extension, there really is nothing incrementally you need to do. It's probably just running a little bit more of the -- call it konar [ph] running your -- perhaps your scrubber just a little bit harder or something like that. Is it something akin to that?","Julien, that's right. We have the ability given the controls we put in place to meet that more stringent standard and with no additional costs. So we again believe that's something that as you say if we push the scrubber equipment that we've got in place we'll be able to achieve that."
"All right. Great. Thanks for being explicit there.  Operator  Raymond Leung, Goldman Sachs.",
"A couple of my big questions were answered with respect to where you were getting the cash for the put and the Inter-Company loan, but can you talk about how you guys are thinking about -- I think in your K, you indicated that you may trip to your covenant. So should we just assume that bank lines sort of you can't access that going forward? And just to clarify, you indicated if you were to comply with the Illinois rule here that you probably wouldn't see much incremental increase in the operating costs if you got the variance?",Right. That is what I just said is that I wouldn't expect to see incremental operating costs as a result of the variance being granted. And then I think your other question was -- I'm sorry could you repeat the other question?
"Well, you guys indicated in your K that you may sort of trip the interest covenant test and can you talk about how you're thinking about that or how you may try to deal with that or if you are going to deal with that at all?","Yes. I'm sorry. I was focused on the second question and had forgotten the ﬁrst. But yes, when you end up seeing our disclosures for the First Quarter, they will mirror those from year-end that essentially based on the covenant that borrowings at Genco would be -- we forecast to be restricted by the end of the First Quarter of next year. So there won't be any change in the disclosures in the Q relative to the K, which is why we put the put option in place. We wanted to make sure there was clarity in terms of if Genco needed access to cash, access to liquidity, how   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   would it arrange that. Because as you say, looking ahead, one might assume really no borrowing access under the revolver based on that disclosure that we made."
