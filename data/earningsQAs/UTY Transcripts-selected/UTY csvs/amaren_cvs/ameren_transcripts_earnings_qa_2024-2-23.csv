Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Marty, obviously you've throttled back Illinois electric spend here pretty signiﬁcantly versus the prior plan, which I think is completely expected just coming oﬀ those ICC orders. Can you just speak a little bit more to what you've actually embedded in that 2.3% ﬁve-year CAGR as it relates to the grid plan? I guess put diﬀerently, could we see that tick higher later this year once the plan is approved or is the embedded base case there still subject to some upside and downside scenarios. Thanks.","Yes. I'll let Michael comment on that further, but I would say, Shar, you're right. We -- what we've done here is we baked in what we believe to be a prudent level of capital expenditures, given the overall outcomes that we had in Illinois. As we said in our prepared remarks, we do believe that, this is an appropriate amount to continue to provide a safe and adequate service to our customers and meet the requirements of CEJA. And that's, what's been baked in.  I just repeat what I said on earlier, which is that, we do believe a higher amount of investment over time as originally proposed last year is prudent and appropriate for our customers to provide the kind of service that they expect to really further the state's energy goals and policy goals.  But again, what we've modeled in here is what we do believe would be a level that would be expected to be approved by the commission over time through the rehearing process as well as through our upcoming grid plan ﬁling and rate plan. So again, we do expect that this level of investment is something that will ultimately be reﬂected in those outcomes. But with that, in terms of further clarity on the CapEx, Michael, any comments?     Yes. Maybe just a couple of ﬁner points. Good morning, Shar. I think Marty said it well. I mean, as we think about the capital plan that we've allocated there, again, Marty is correct. I mean, we're absolutely focused on providing safe and reliable service.  I think we're being conservative in how we think about this. There's this 105% revenue requirement cap that we need to stay underneath. And as you know and I think there was some discussion about this, the commission's order, pointed to '22 rate base. I think it was really more of a function of, because that was really the only year-end rate base to point to.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I mean, we deﬁnitely have the ability to, I think, recover our '23 expenditures at really under another formula rate. As they do that and they update and we're seeking some of this clariﬁcation, that obviously would give you more headroom under that 105% revenue cap. I think we took a conservative approach saying, let's make sure whatever we spend in '24, we stay under pointing back to the '22. So my point is you have a lot more ﬂexibility going forward.  I think to Marty's point, we'll have to step back and then decide, given the 8.72%, how do you feel about allocating more capital there? But as we continue to see improvement here, there's obviously would be those opportunities."
"Got it. Perfect. And Marty, just -- thanks, Michael. Marty, just on Tranche 1, is it versus Tranche 2, is it still your expectation Tranche 2 will exceed Tranche 1? And then just on Tranche 2 estimates, are they embedded in that $55 billion pipeline number? And could any of the awards fall within this kind of ﬁve-year cycle you've got out there? Thanks, guys.","Yes. Good questions, Shar. So with respect to Tranche 2, we do expect it -- continue to expect it to be considerably larger than the Tranche 1 investments. And MISO as we said in our prepared remarks, is still saying that they expect to have those approved by the middle of this year. We'll see how that comes to fruition. But we do expect that in the ﬁrst half, we'll at a minimum, start to get some clarity on what some of those projects might look like. But again, Shar, to your point, signiﬁcantly larger.  Now, with respect to our plans that we've laid out, within the ﬁve-year plan, nothing is baked in for Tranche 2 investments. However, in the $55 billion, we do have some amount in there for potential Tranche 2 investments. So within the $55 billion, yes, certainly, we do have some. Thanks for the questions."
"Yes. No, appreciate it. Thank you guys so much. Fantastic. I'll see you soon.","All right. Thanks, Shar.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, thanks for taking my question today. Happy Friday.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",Yes. Thank you.
"I guess, yes, appreciate the guidance update and just, the comment that you're, kind of, below the midpoint of the 6% to 8% range. Can you just kind of expand on, what we should be watching for that kind of gets you back to that midpoint?  And I just -- I'm taking into account the comments around, it seems that some of this transmission spending has been reﬂected in the plan, correct me if I'm wrong, and then you're also just kind of assuming CapEx for the Illinois distribution segment as proposed is approved as well. Just what should we be looking for to get you back into that midpoint? Thanks.","Yes. Nick, maybe we'll take that in two part. I'll actually turn it over to Michael ﬁrst to maybe provide a little more clarity on our thinking around the growth and then, I'll provide some color on some of the upsides in our plan.     Yes. Good morning, Nick. Just to put a little ﬁner point on the midpoint, I think, as Marty said in his comments, expect to be a little below that midpoint.  And if you think about historically where we have been, just sort of the highest level, I mean, if you go back to, February of last year, we had 8.4% rate based growth. And over that period of time, we were issuing roughly about 2% worth of dilution, say, over the ﬁve-year plan. So it got you down to, call it 6.4%, 6.5%, something like that.  And then we've done a nice job of continuing to close the allowed versus earned gaps, et cetera, continuous improvement. There's been a number of opportunities being really thoughtful about, allocating capital to the places that are giving us the highest return. And you can see it, obviously, historically, we were trending above that 7% midpoint.  And we kind of think about where we are today, we got this 8.2% rate based growth, really kind of the same dilution math. So with all things we need we'll kind of put you at that 6.2%. And then there's obviously still improvement opportunities as we continue to look forward.  And I think as we think about a midpoint, it's someplace between that 6.5% to 7% today. So let's call it 6.7% just to put a little ﬁner point on. So 6.7% versus sort of 7%, where I think we kind of pointed people historically. And again, we've had opportunities to do better than that.  And Marty will talk about where I think, the future still lies for us. You think about the $55 billion, the capital projects that we have there. There's opportunities to continue to be thoughtful about   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   the transmission that we just talked about a second ago. And so those are the things that will provide us those opportunities. So hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the math. And I'll let Marty talk a little larger picture.     Yes. I think Michael started to touch on a little bit, in terms of the upsides, as I said in the prepared remarks, we certainly see good justiﬁcation for keeping that 6% up to 8% growth. And really what it reﬂects is that strong pipeline of investments that we have. We start there, $55 billion of potential investments over the next 10 years.  We have baked into the ﬁve-year plan, the Tranche 1 investments that we've been assigned to us, so that we won, but we also have competitive proposal out there right now for another Tranche 1 project, which hasn't been baked in and that provides us some upside. We've talked about just a second ago, some of the Tranche 2 projects. We've got further investments to be made with respect to Missouri as it relates to the IRP. We've got some of those certainly baked in today.  As I mentioned, we had a very strong balance sheet and opportunities, as Michael just said, to continue to close the gap between our allowed and earned returns, which provides upside. And then of course, as we look ahead in Illinois, a couple of things. I mean, ﬁrst, the current multi-year grid plan and rate plan ends in 2027. And so as we look out even to 2028, there's opportunities to think about that diﬀerently and what our approach will be in 2028.  And then I go back to maybe the most important thing, which is in the interim, to really work to improve the Illinois situation and perhaps provide an opportunity for greater investment in Illinois. So there, as we said in the call, we're going to continue and engage in a dialogue with all stakeholders about the beneﬁts of investment, risks of disinvestment, and our goal of really aligning our investments with the policy goals of the state around reliability, aﬀordability, the clean energy transition.  And of course, we all know that our investments drive, not only improvements in critical energy infrastructure, but jobs and economic expansion. So look, we've got to just continue to show ﬁnancial discipline in the short term, but in the longer term, make sure we create this dialogue that, having consistent constructive regulation, having strong investment infrastructure in the state is going to beneﬁt our customers, their communities, the economy, the state, and continue to work to make Illinois a place that attracts greater investment."
"All right. Thank you very much for that. And then I guess just on the O&M, I think in your prepared remarks or even on slides here, 4% versus last year, and then you're doing more O&M, just looking through the EPS slides, you have positives for Missouri and Illinois.  So just, is 4% of the magnitude of decrease that we should expect to continue through '24? Can you maybe give us any type of way to frame that? And then how are you kind of thinking about just recapture of that or timing of the next rate cases in Missouri, if you can maybe expand?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Hey, yes, good morning again, Nick. This is Michael. Let me take this and Marty can certainly add in. Yes. And we've talked about this obviously over time. I mean, customer aﬀordability is not something that is new to us. I think we've been really focused as a company on it for a number of years, and really up and down the P&L.  And we've talked about this. We, I think, do a great job of kind of going in and continuing to benchmark ourselves all over the diﬀerent areas of our business. And some are really good, some have opportunities and continue to close the gap in those opportunities. And I think, Marty pointed to the 4%. Obviously people are very focused on it. And we've talked about ﬂat O&M over the ﬁve-year period is a good way to think about it. But the bottom line is there are a number of levers that we're able to pull here.  I think as we think about '24 speciﬁcally, I mean, I mentioned in my opening remarks, yes, I think we're taking just another view here. We're looking at headcount. I talked about the headcount. Hiring freeze at the moment, being very thoughtful about just contingent workforce, consultant dollars, any sort of discretionary spend, I think all the right things to do just in this elevated rate environment anyway for customers, and so that's really the focus there.  But we're also being very thoughtful and strategic about, as you mentioned, just rate reviews, et cetera, and being thoughtful about investments on the digital side, too, just to make sure we make these costs sustainable. That's really what we want to do.  I think we've talked about, we've had an increased investment in the digital platform over the last several years after we got PISA passed, and it's allowed us to replace our work management systems, our back oﬃce accounting systems, we continue to put a great deal of distribution automation, et cetera, on the system, and all of these things are productivity improvements over time, which just give us a lot of conﬁdence this is a lever that we can continue to pull. So Marty, anything to add there?     No, nothing to add there. Thanks for the question."
"All right. And I'm sorry, just to follow-up on that. Are you planning to ﬁle a Missouri rate case in the next year, or is that more than a year out?","Yes. That's not something we've decided yet. And look, if you look back over time, it's been every 18 to 24 months we've ﬁled a case, but haven't stated when we're going to plan to ﬁle the next one. So we'll be thoughtful about that. I mean, look, we always try to go as long as we can between rate cases, and we'll continue to take that approach, but be thoughtful about when major capital additions go in and the like to think about the timing of our cases.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Have a good day.,You bet. Thanks.  Operator  . Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
Hi. Good morning.,"Hello, Jeremy.     Good morning."
"Thanks for all the detail today, and just wanted to kind of follow-up on some of the points that you've talked about before, and just regarding your capital reallocation. How should we be thinking about Missouri bill impact over time from the higher CapEx? Just any thoughts there.  And then also as we think about deploying that capital, the timing for receiving approvals and permits for the additional transmission investments, broadly speaking on that side, if you could provide some more color there would be helpful.","Yes. A lot there Jeremy. I think number one in terms of, bill impacts, we're going to work through time as we have to keep the bill impacts as manageable as possible. I think, we had a pretty good track record in Missouri since we got more constructive regulation legislation back in 2018, and it really, kept the growth in bills really below the level of inﬂation.  And so we're going to look to continue to, as Michael stated a minute ago, pretty comprehensively take a lot of actions across the board to really manage our operating costs, and really, to the extent that we have rate increase requests, really make those about the capital   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   additions that are going in, that are producing greater reliability, for our customers, et cetera, where they're seeing the beneﬁts.  So we're going to continue to work to keep our belt tight and, as I said, overall, look to keep our operating costs, ﬂat over the next several years, and as Michael said, create as many productivity improvements as we can. So that's our goal.  Now, with respect to these projects, I would say, when you look at, our capital expenditure plans over the next ﬁve years for Missouri, I would say a need, they really relate it on the left side of the graph on Page 23 to, things that were included in our integrated resource plan.  So there -- the integrated resource plan had called for 2,800 megawatts of renewables by 2030. This is a piece of that as we move ahead with renewables, over half of what we've got there in that capital spend of $3.3 billion is related to two CCNs that have already been approved, and then there's four CCNs that are pending right now, and we expect to be able to ﬁle a stipulated settlement on those in the near term, and so those are proceeding well.  And then with respect to the dispatchable generation, part of this is the simple cycle gas plant that we plan to put in service over the next ﬁve years, and then part of this is continuing to invest in the dispatchable energy resources that we have in the state. But we will -- as we said on our call, we've begun to do work around this 800-megawatt simple-cycle gas plant, and we will consider when to ﬁle a CCN for that. So those are some timelines in terms of some of the investments we've got. Michael, any color to add?     Yes. Marty, you did a great job there. Jeremy, I think the only thing that I'd probably add there is, if you think about the $13 billion, that we're allocating to Missouri, about 25% of its renewables. And, obviously an important factor is just the PTC, ITC that's being given oﬀ with respect to those projects. So you think about the impact for customers ultimately, I mean, there is a really big beneﬁt there.  And so it's just something to keep in mind, I agree with everything else Marty said. I mean, we continue to be focused to all the comments I made before. It's not something new that we're doing here, you can -- sometimes you can get a little lumpy impact in Missouri just because of the timing and the rate reviews. But the team really is focused on trying to keep these bills as low as possible."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe just shifting towards Illinois and from where you sit, just wondering your perspective, and what you see happening with regards to potential legislative or legal responses to the Illinois orders there, in the state house? How your conversations with stakeholders been trending here? And just any color you could share would be helpful.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. I think, look, the ﬁrst order of business we look at is, as I said before, to really try to work constructively with stakeholders and right now I'd say our primary focus is, is a couple of things, it's number one, making the rehearing ﬁling, which is, we plan to make next Thursday.  So there, the opportunity to have rehearing around incorporation of 2023 rate base, as well as baseline, capital investments that we plan to make over the next ﬁve years and have those included in a rehearing, and then as we've said before, we follow that up with our grid plan, update and ﬁling in mid-March.  There, again, we get feedback from the commission, obviously on deﬁciencies that, they saw within the initial ﬁling, we're looking to address those. We're looking to work constructively with stakeholders, whether it's the staﬀ or other parties, to make our ﬁling as strong as we can, to address the commission's identiﬁed deﬁciencies and position ourselves for success in getting, again, both a good outcome in the rehearing, as well as getting that grid plan approved and ultimately incorporated into a revised rate plan. So I think those are where really our focuses are in the short term.  Like I said, in the longer term, we'd like to see a more constructive environment for investment, and that's going to take a really engagement with all stakeholders. And I think, what we found is a receptivity among stakeholders to have the conversation, to listen, and we'll ﬁgure out over time what the best path forward is to achieving the result we want, which is, a more constructive environment for investment, which, again, we believe is ultimately in the best interest of customers, communities, and in the achievement of the state's policy goals."
Got it. Understood. Thank you for that.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Good morning, David."
"I just wanted to -- in terms of whether normal load growth, just wondering how conservative --","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, David, we're having a really hard time hearing you. Could you speak up a little, David?"
"Hey, how is that? Sorry about that.",That's much better. Thank you.     Yes. Perfect.
"Good. No, just in terms of whether normal load growth, I was wondering how conservative the outlook is that you're presenting here. Is there any possibility for acceleration either from any manufacturing activity or data center activity that you're seeing or otherwise?","Yes. Let me start oﬀ and certainly Marty can add as well. And I think, yes, I tried to provide a little bit color in the opening remarks. Look, I think we do a good conservative job of kind of thinking about the load growth, but there are some really positive things happening in our service territory.  Just, economically it's very strong, GDP growth is strong here, and really talking about the kind of the greater Missouri area unemployment running below the national average. We've had, if you think about even just '24 more speciﬁcally I mean we got the GM coming back on, they've added some additional load. There's a couple of data imaging companies that are using just a tremendous amount of energy about 20 megawatts and these things really begin to add up.  And there's just a number of longer term I think opportunities as we think about data centers and other things from an information technology standpoint that could provide some economic growth. I think we do a good job of not really baking that in at this point. We talked about toward ﬂat to up a 0.5%, but I'm optimistic that, hopefully that is -- ends up -- turning out diﬀerently. So Marty?     Yes. I would just say that, look, we have a broad service territory and we're deeply involved in -- throughout Illinois and Missouri in economic development activities, and our teams support economic development expansion across both service territories. I would say this, though, in the greater St. Louis region, both in the Illinois side and the Missouri side, I'm more excited than I've been in years with respect to.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I would say, the collaborative approach to really going after economic development eﬀorts and really thinking about, how we drive inclusive economic growth, economic development, and compete for projects, and I've never seen the community as uniﬁed and speaking with one voice and going after these things. So we're seeing some wins, some wins that'll produce, I think, economic expansion two and three years out, some positive announcements, as Michael said.  But I hope we are being conservative with respect to our growth projections. That said, as we see growth, we often see also continued eﬀorts on energy eﬃciency, both the energy eﬃciency we promote, but also just kind of energy eﬃciency in general. And so try to be realistic about our growth expectations net of those eﬀorts."
"Okay. Got it. Yes. Thanks. That's helpful. And then was just curious, what level of FFO to debt you're seeing over the plan, wondering to the extent you realize some of the CapEx upside opportunities, how that could impact the equity needs going forward?","Yes. Perfect, David. And so again, we haven't really given targets in the past. I mean, I think what we've talked about is, look, we like our ratings where they are, Baa1, BBB+, that downgrade threshold S&P is 13, 17 at Moody's, we've trended obviously closer to that 17. And again, as I outlined in my opening remarks, I mean, we feel good about our balance sheet.  I think we come into this from a position of strength as I look out over the ﬁve years, the equity needs that I outlined certainly support, I believe actually maintaining that Baa1. And so maintaining something over that 17% over that ﬁve-year period.  And so -- and again, I try to be clear on what we did from an equity standpoint, for 2024, we're assuming $300 million of equity. We've done about $230 million under our ATM program today. Really the remaining balance that we need to do is related to our DRIP 401(k) and then for all the other years it's really consistent with where we had been before, so basically its $600 million, and again I think supports those credit ratings that I just spoke about."
Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.,"Thanks, David.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Hey, guys. Thanks for giving me time, I know it's close to the hour. Just, Michael, on the point about equity maybe you could just expand on this, so the CapEx plan is up, the ﬁve-year CapEx plan is up close to 10%, a little over 10%, but the equity is kind of the same. Are you kind of modeling now lesser cushion versus the downgrade thresholds or are there other cash ﬂow improvements that you might be missing?","Yes. I don't know if there's other cash ﬂow improvements. I mean, again I think we -- we've always been conservative as we think about the balance sheet. And so again, I feel good about what I just said, David, in terms of how we're thinking about the FFO to debt over time and being above that downgrade threshold at 17%. We continue to obviously work with the rating agencies. We'll be in talking to them again in the spring.  And so I guess I don't have any reason to feel concerned about it at this point. And again, I think it was -- it's the right thing to do. And we added the capital and still feel good about the levels that we're at, given the equity that we're issuing."
"Got it. And then maybe just a couple of clarifying questions and this will be quick, hopefully. But in the current ﬁve-year CapEx plan, the four solar projects that you have settlement for in Missouri, those are included in the plan, conﬁrm that for us. And then the upside would be, the Missouri IRP results and then any transmission project awards from the MISO planning, am I thinking about it correctly?","Well, I think, ﬁrst of all, yes. The projects that -- we've already had CCNs for -- as well as those subject to the stipulation, are included in the ﬁve-year CapEx that's shown on Slide 23. And, in fact, some additional CapEx, as well, for renewable projects that we anticipate to come into service by the end of 2028. And then the second part of your question was?"
It was just the traﬃc --,"Transmission? Well, upside. Yes, no, I would think there, what we're saying is, with respect to transmission, we've got the Tranche 1 projects that have been assigned to us, or awarded, or included in there. But what we have not included in there is any upside for a potential additional win of a transmission project that we've proposed on."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate the time.,You bet. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time. I appreciate it, squeezing me in here. Look, maybe just to kick oﬀ quickly here, just on the balance sheet, obviously you're bringing down equity slightly over the comparable period from last plan, upticking CapEx fairly meaningfully here.  I just wanted to clarify, just where are you relative to the required metrics? Can you elaborate a little bit through the cadence of the plan, how you're thinking about the FFO to debt, or just where you're starting and ending, if you will? And then I've got to follow-up real quickly.","Yes. Good morning, Julien. It's Michael. As I said, we have the downgrade threshold in Moody's is 17, and we historically haven't talked about exactly what we're targeting. But again, over this ﬁve-year plan, there is cushion over that 17%.  Again, I feel good about it, and we have been, I think, done a great job of sort of telegraphing what our equity needs, being very disciplined about going out and issuing that equity. I think we come into this kind of super CapEx environment with a very-very healthy balance sheet. As you know, we're not trying to get up to some level, right, where we've been at these levels, and I see us staying at that level over the ﬁve-year plan."
"Got it. So every year, kind of, over that 17% threshold, give or take.",Over the ﬁve-year --
And the rating agencies --   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"Yes. Over 17%. And again, look, as we have frequent conversations, then we'll go in again and have another conversation with them, so."
"Wonderful. And just to clarify just on the Missouri CapEx, I mean, obviously, that's a nice uptick there, and obviously, you haven't necessarily decided when you're ﬁnally cased. But how do you think about just the clarity that you have on that spend, right, when you think about having visibility tied to speciﬁc projects that are likely to be approved or what have you.  I just want to understand the level of conﬁdence that there is in this CapEx in Missouri. Obviously, you're putting a lot more in there. I just want to understand what are the key parameters, what are the key inputs that you're thinking about in saying, look, we've got conﬁdence on the totality of this, right? What pieces aren't necessarily approved, perhaps?","Well, look, I think one of the things you could look at, Julien, is every year at this time we make a ﬁling in Missouri where we're very transparent and lay out what our planned capital expenditures are, how we're justifying those, thinking about those, where they plan to go, and so you'll see that actually today coming from Ameren Missouri. It happens every year at the same time, and then it's subject to public discussion about the plans and where they're going.  I would say this, I mean as you look at Missouri, it's really -- as I said earlier, it's really to align our investment with the things that were in our IRP last fall. So we do plan to invest in an 800- megawatt simple cycle plant. We do plan to continue to invest in our dispatchable resources, which is both our coal-ﬁred energy centers to get them through to their retirement, making sure that they're reliable and eﬃcient, making sure that we continue to invest in our nuclear facilities. So we've got a lot of dispatchable resources there.  And then as it relates to the IRP, also we had planned investments in renewables in some over this ﬁve-year period and in battery storage as well. And so those were included in the plan. As I mentioned earlier, with respect to renewables, and we got a positive order out of the commission on a couple of CCNs last year. We've got four that are pending right now that we believe will be ﬁling a stipulated settlement here in the short term, and we would look to commission approval, but those would be subject to commission approval.  And then with the other planned investments in renewables, again, in accordance with that IRP. And then with respect to the remainder of the spend, it really has to do with continued investment in our distribution infrastructure. I think our customers are seeing a lot of beneﬁts today, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, especially when we have severe weather events, we're seeing the infrastructure investments that we are making, which are, stronger, thicker, taller poles, smart automation, you know distribution automation, our system, new substations, we're really seeing the beneﬁt of that in terms of reduced frequency of outage.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I mentioned earlier, hit top quartile in terms of, safety measures or frequency of outages here. So seeing a lot of beneﬁts from that. But you know we've only really been at that since 2018. And there's a tremendous amount of investment still to be made, really decades of investment still to be made in terms of, not only replacing aging infrastructure but really modernizing that infrastructure to make sure that, the kind of beneﬁts that we're seeing in terms of reduced frequency and duration of outages are spread, across our service territory in Missouri.  So again, all of that is subject to further planning and et cetera. But I think, again, I'd point you to today's ﬁling in Missouri, which really lays out all the speciﬁcs in terms of the plans we had to invest in the justiﬁcation. With that, I'll stop."
All right. Great. Thank you guys. I'll keep it there. All the best.,"Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Thank you. Mr.Lyons, I would now like to turn the ﬂoor back over to you for closing comments.     Yes.
