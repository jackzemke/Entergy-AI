Question,Answer
"Hey guys, good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning, Marty. Marty, can you just maybe elaborate a bit more on the recent EPA regs? I mean, you touched a bit on the ﬂeet impact like (inaudible) but maybe expand on potential shifts to timing and scale the spending opportunities versus last year's IRP if it makes it through the courts. I mean, could we see some pull-forward of generation spend? What do you see as kind of an updated pathway here? Should we be thinking of an IRP update like you did with Rush -- with the Rush decision? Thanks.","Well, Shar, you've outlined a number of the considerations. I mean, ﬁrst of all, we're all just still absorbing the rules. And so our teams are studying the new rules thoroughly and we'll be over the coming weeks really trying to assess what the potential impacts are on our IRP. And certainly, that could mean, as you note, a revision to the IRP. But of course, too, we'll expect these rules to likely be litigated and -- so we'll have to take into account that litigation and the uncertainties they create.  In my prepared remarks, I noted a couple of the more notable concerns that we have. The ﬁrst being that the rules do really rely on carbon capture and sequestration, which I think we all recognizes and really ready for prime-time today. And the things that would impact, we have, as you know, in our IRP, a planned combined-cycle facility, 1,200 megawatts planned for the 2032- 2033 timeframe, which is really important from a reliability perspective as we expect to retire our steel [ph] power plant, our coal-ﬁred power plant in that 2032 timeframe. And certainly, new combined cycle that would operate with greater than a 40% capacity factor, which we would expect this one to -- would be impacted by that carbon capture and sequestration. So that certainly has signiﬁcant implications as it relates to that planned combined-cycle facility and we'll have to reassess and think through that.  The other one I mentioned is our Labity [ph] Energy Center. That plant is scheduled to retire really in phases with about half of it in 2036 and the other half of it in 2042. And so the rule would have implications for the ultimate retirement date, pulling that forward a little bit. But in order to be able to maintain the life of that facility out through 2039, the rules require co-ﬁring with natural gas in the 2030 timeframe. And of course, trying to get things permitted and constructed in that amount of time certainly proposes challenges as well, and so highlighted those in my prepared remarks today.  So at the end of the day, Shar, I think as we look at these rules, we do have concerns about the feasibility and ultimately the reliability of our system. Those were our primary concerns. But   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   you're absolutely right, as we think about these rules, it certainly could cause revisions to the IRP, and on balance suggest a greater level of investment that would be required to maintain reliability of our system over the next 10 years."
"Got it. And then just a bit nuanced, but what exactly was going on with the PRA auction in Zone 5? I mean, obviously, it's quite a large breakout for you. It's net neutral from a customer impact perspective, which you just highlighted. But maybe just some color on the backdrop. Is this kind of structural? Should we should expect it again, or really kind of an administrative or design error? Thanks.","Hey, Shar, it's Michael. Good morning. A couple of things. I mean, as you noted, I mean, obviously, Zone 5, we've moved to this new seasonal construct. We did see quite a bit of variability. We had $30 in the summer and $0.75 in the winter and then cone in the fall and the spring at 719. [ph] So as you know, I mean, this is a capacity issue. It's not an energy issue. And so I think it's always important to just start with that. We expect to have obviously, enough energy available for customers.  We don't foresee any issues with respect to providing reliable service, which I think is important. And also from a customer impact standpoint, we really don't see any material, if any impact to customers as well. And it gets a little complicated. I mean the MISO model is a revenue-neutral model and so there'll be some shifting that goes on. We have -- Missouri owns generation in Zone 4. We're able to point to those as hedges, and so it helps oﬀset [ph] that. But I think when you step back, I mean, it is right trying to send a price signal with respect to needing additional dispatchable generation, as Marty just spoke about. And I mean, there were a couple of things I noted in my prepared remarks. I mean it was due to increased load. There were some accreditation issues with respect to some generation that got deem for some past performance. That should go away over the next couple of years, and then there was a reduction in import capabilities. That also I think there's probably some transmission opportunities there that would relieve that.  So I think again, it does speak to what we're trying to do from a dispatchable perspective. And I think, Shar, there's a way to work around this and see some relief over the next couple of years."
"Okay, perfect. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you so much.","Thanks for the question, Shar.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question."
Hi. Good morning.,"Hey, Jeremy. How are you there?"
Good. How are you?,Good.
"Just wanted to go to Missouri and as far as legislative initiatives there, if you could provide us, I guess, thoughts on the environment there, what you're looking for? And speciﬁcally PISA legislation, and I think the session is ending soon and -- so any thoughts there would be helpful.","Yeah, Jeremy. You've got it. I think that as we sit here today, you know the legislation that is most likely to get across the ﬁnish line is that a piece of legislation. And so as you know, and I'm sure you've been following the House Bill 1,746 and Senate Bills 740 and 1,422. I would say at this point in session, they're probably as well-positioned as you could be for passage. Senate Bill 1,422 and Senate Bill 740, they're on the Senate informal calendar that could be brought up at any time, and House Bill 1,746, which passed out-of-the House with a very strong supportive vote of 119 to 17, you know, is also now passed through the Senate Commerce Committee. It's listed as number one on house bills for third reading. So things are well-positioned.  The challenge that I highlighted in the prepared remarks, however, is that time is short. The legislative session ends in two weeks on May 17, and the legislature does have some signiﬁcant things to get done, including a budget. So that's really the concern is just whether time will run short. But in the meantime, we'll continue to work with key stakeholders towards passage if we have a window to get it done."
"Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just pivoting towards Illinois. As far as the regulatory processes are concerned with the electric rehearing, I think we plan reﬁning, any incremental thoughts you can share with progression versus expectations there? And really, I   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   guess the question is more on the other side with the legislature. Do you see any potential there to maybe secure more constructive development?","Hey, Jeremy, it's Michael. Good morning. Maybe I'll handle the regulatory one if Marty wants to comment on the legislative one, he can certainly do that. I think, look, things are continuing to move along there. I think we mentioned this in our prepared remarks. I mean, from a rehearing process, feel good about where we stand today. Again, just really proud of the work the team has done. Lenny and his team have been working really hard going through a number of public hearings, a number of workshops, et cetera, just getting this prepared. And I think you're seeing that produce some results here as we kind of work through this rehearing process.  And so we should have a decision here in early -- sometime in June with rates eﬀective in July. And this will be an interim adjustment, and then obviously, we'll have the more comprehensive multi-year rate plan, grid plan piece in the back half of the year. It's great to have a procedural schedule around that. I have some ﬁnality around this in the December timeframe with rates in January.  With respect to the rehearing piece, the diﬀerences between us and staﬀ are fairly minimal at this point. As we indicated, we were at 305 and it set staﬀ is at 283 today. It really comes down to two issues there. It's the OPEV [ph] issue that we've spoken about in the past. We still are continuing to advocate for that. We think it's the right thing. I think our range accommodates that if it goes in a diﬀerent direction. And then there were some projects that were really deferred into the grid plan itself. And so we'll have another opportunity to advocate for those. So again feel as good as you can feel at this point in time. And the team is focused on it and getting some stability put back in that process.     Yeah. Really, Jeremy, nothing to add at this point. I mean in terms of legislative initiatives, nothing to point to. Of course, this year, both in Missouri and Illinois, we have supported right of ﬁrst refusal legislation in both states. In neither states do we see those as moving forward at this time, but continue to advocate for the beneﬁt of those for our customers and for the reliability of the grid broadly. But nothing to tack on right now."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave there. Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.,
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions today. Maybe just a follow-up really quickly on the Illinois rehearing process. First, can you just remind us what of that 305 revenue increase requested there is embedded in the '24 guidance, and the kind of ﬂexibility there to the extent there's some gap? And then is there any potential for that decision to come earlier than the late June timeframe that you laid out?","Hey, good morning, Carly. This is Michael. With the second part ﬁrst. I think no. I think at this point, the expectation is kind of move along that timeframe and should have a decision here in July.  In terms of sort what's embedded, that 305 is obviously over that 4-year period. And so there's a component you can see that we have broken out for 2024. Again, feel good about what we have embedded in there and just sort of where the positions are. To the extent that something ended up changing from that. We'd have to just step back and look at it from a rate-based perspective to the extent that it's capital.  Again, I mean, you're earning 8.72%. So I mean that obviously minimizes the impact and we just have to see what our options are. I mean, we do have ﬂexibility with some additional capital there, but really just looking to see the process move along and feel better about the framework ﬁrst."
Got it. Thank you. That's super helpful. And then maybe just on Rush Island. You talked a bit about the delta between Ameren's proposal and the DOJ proposal there. Is that just a matter of sizing the program that you expect to be the piece of debate or is there anything else that sort of sticks out as a point of debate as you think about going into hearings there this summer?,"Yeah. And you're talking about -- which one were you asking about? Were you asking about NSR case, Carly? Yeah, I think you were. Listen, as it relates to the NSR, as we outlined in our slide prepared remarks, we've proposed programs that have a value of about $20 million, and Department of Justice has outlined a series of programs that they've estimated at $120 million. And when you look at the components of the two programs, they're very similar in terms of electric school buses, air ﬁltration programs, charging infrastructure.  So very similar. So it really is -- it seemingly not a matter of the program mix, but sort of the extent of them and the cost of them. So we can't predict what mitigation the court would ultimately order. We would generally expect though that the positions I just talked about that the parties have in the proposed orders would sort of -- sort of just look in[ph] for the degree of mitigation relief that was either ultimately reached through a settlement between ourselves and the Department of Justice or a court order. But really can't speculate further at this point."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Okay. Thank you so much for the color.  Operator  Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hey, good morning.","Hey, Paul."
"So I just wanted to follow-up on the on the EPA rule. It seems so challenging, I guess. I'm just wondering, assuming you know that it's largely in place or something, what -- when you mentioned diﬀerent reliability things you might have to do for reliability and stuﬀ. Could you just sort of give us a general sense what happen, I mean, because as you mentioned, I think that yes, carbon capture and sequestration has got so many challenges associated with it. Would you just start running the plants lower? Would there be more batteries? Would it be -- what -- what would be sort of the remedy that might be -- that might be thought about?  And also, would there be any change in depreciation schedules, or I'm just sort of wondering, I mean, it just sounds like a very diﬃcult thing to sort of talk about potentially changing the IRP with a plan that seems so radical kind of, if you know what I'm saying.","Well, Paul, it's Marty. I think you hit on a number of the considerations. And I'll go back to what I've said before. As early days, we just got the rules. We -- we're going to go through a thorough assessment of the rules and reassessment of the IRP. And again, you've got the likelihood of litigation, which will have to be factored in as well to our considerations.  But I think when you look at the steps we're taking between now and '30 as we currently have outlined, I think the EPA rules underscore the importance of these. We've got 2,800 megawatts of renewables planned by 2030. We've got 400 megawatts of battery storage planned between now and 2030.  Now we've got 800 megawatts of simple-cycle generation plan between now and 2030. And I think given these rules, certainly it underscores the importance of all of those things. I think the broader implications that are down the line. I think with respect to the retirement of the Sioux Energy Center that we have planned for 2032, you know, generally in line with the rules.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   The Labadie Energy Center, I mentioned earlier, half of it retired in 2036, half of it in 2042. Again, if that need to be retired by 2039, maybe a little bit of a change in depreciation there recovery. But I think the bigger thing for Labadie then would be getting gas into Labadie and the ability to be able to co-ﬁre with natural gas so that we've got that.  And then I think when you think about that combined-cycle facility and again, you know, ﬁrst of all, the feasibility of doing carbon capture, much less the cost of doing carbon capture, you really have to reassess that plan in light of these rules. But you're right, what it might mean otherwise is more simple cycle gas ﬁre generation, more battery storage technology, more renewables, because again anything if you're going to operate a combined-cycle over 40% capacity factor, it calls for carbon capture.  So that -- you know, but those are -- I think you've got your sort of ﬁnger on the things that you'd have to consider, which is what would be an alternative mix of renewables and dispatchable resources that can maintain reliability for the system."
"Okay. So we'll just, I guess, monitor this. Okay, that's very helpful. And then with respect to transmission, there's been a lot of focus on the part of oﬃcials in Washington and other places on grid-enhancing technologies. And I was just wondering how you -- how you thought about those and the potential deployment at Ameren and just any thoughts you might have on that?","And we'll let Shawn Schukar, who runs our transmission operations comment on that.     Yeah. Thanks for the question. So the grid-enhancing technology generally allow us to ﬂow more across the system. They don't take care of some of the capacity needs. And we see those as complementary as we transition through the grid investments, which means that we'll be making some enhancements like you see from the MISO, but we also look at those grid- enhancing technologies to support the system and we'll be utilizing a combination of both."
Okay. Thank you. Good talking to you guys.,"Thanks, Paul.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Hey, good morning. Happy Friday.","Hello, Nick. Same to you."
"Hey. Hey, so I just wanted to ask quickly on the mitigation proposal on Rush Island because I know that you booked this $20 million ﬁgure, which was an ongoing hit in your O&M line, but then you kind of mentioned the risk of the DOJs asking for $120 million and obviously, we'll see where this goes at the end of the year. But like if it does go against you, is that still an ongoing item in your view? Or is that kind of more onetime in nature?","Nick, it's a great question. And I think ultimately, wherever this settles, it really is a one-time item. It is non-recurring. Given the size of it today, we didn't think it appropriate to sort of carve it out. And as we talked about on our call, we look to overcome the cost of that with respect to ongoing operations savings. However, again, as I outlined, the $20 million we proposed and the $120 million that the DOJ proposed are probably bookends as we think about settlement and an ultimate potential court order here. But like I agree with you that ultimately, whatever this cost is nonrecurring and one-time, and it won't be something that aﬀects ongoing operations or earnings."
"Hey, I really appreciate that. And as it just relates to '24, I know you're highlighting that you kind of have this line-of-sight to O&M in the back half of the plan. So just any comment on how you feel like you're trending versus your full '24 number at this point? Are you at the midpoint or I guess, any comments there?","Yeah. Hey, Nick, it's Michael here. Good Friday to you. Yeah, look, I mean, we obviously reiterated our range of $4.52 to $4.72, really focus on the midpoint of that range. The team is completely aligned on ﬂexing what we need to ﬂex here from an O&M perspective. We talk about a number of programs. I think it did the ﬁrst part of the year that we put in place with respect to some hiring freezes, looking at discretionary spending and looking at contractors, travel, all those kinds of things.  And again, those programs are fully ramped up at this point, and feeling good about it. Look, we have a long history of this, you heard us talk about this. I mean, we've been doing a number of things really from an automation, a technology investment perspective. We've now fully deployed AMI and feel we have distribution automation. We've done a great deal of stuﬀ from   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   the back-oﬃce perspective in terms of the accounting systems, HR systems. I mean, all of those are driving productivity improvements that we're taking full advantage of.  And I was sort of reﬂecting on the situation and thinking about 2020, that terrible COVID year, we lost 15% of sales within about a week and then the team came together and really looked for tens of millions of dollars worth of opportunities that were reﬂex [ph] and continue to-end up hitting our guidance for that year. And I don't see this as any diﬀerent. We'll continue to look for these opportunities. And ultimately, we're going to make the decisions right for the long term at the end of the day, but we do have the ability to ﬂex up and down as needed."
"That's really helpful. And deﬁnitely, acknowledge the ability to ﬂex here, especially based on the past.  One more thing. Just you're very clear, your '24 equity needs are basically done outside of internal programs and maybe some DRIP. But just for '25 and beyond, is 600 million [ph] a year still the kind of right number to be thinking about? I think that's what you guys talked about in the fourth quarter.","Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. That still stands. You know, we delivered back there in February."
All right. Have a great day. Thanks.,Okay. Thanks for the questions.  Operator  Our ﬁnal question is from David Paz with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
Good morning.,"Good morning, David."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Could you maybe expand on the data center opportunities? I know you mentioned them -- you mentioned data centers along with some other large customers, but just what opportunity are you seeing there? And particularly on the investment side, maybe any sense of the size of the projects that potentially could come down the pike? [ph] And just how much would incremental investment from Ameren be for a typical-sized project? Thank you.","Yeah. Hey, good morning, David. I'll start here, and certainly, Marty probably chime in as well. But I mean, I think we have a strong value proposition, right, when it comes to serving both data centers and manufacturers. I mean, we've talked about this. We start from a really strong position just in terms of where our rates are, both on a Midwest and national average well below that we prevented a number of sites in both states that can ramp up quickly, sewer water, transmission capabilities, et cetera.  I've never seen state, local, regional leaders work together as they are right now, really trying to come together on a combined eﬀort, oﬀer various incentives to again this is beyond just data centers, but manufacturers in general in terms of things around state and global use taxes, development grants for workforce development, et cetera. We have a number of incentives in place here that are available to customers based on location and size.  Yeah. As we sit here today, David, we've executed a construction agreement for one data center, and it's got an estimated 250 megawatt loads. That's sizable for us. We haven't seen this kind of load growth in a really, really long time. We should be serving that customer by 2026. And I would say we're actively working 1,000 plus megawatts beyond that. And so these are all in diﬀerent stages at this point. They'll come online diﬀerently. But again, I think as we think about the IRP and just adding the renewables and the dispatchable generation that we've been adding in the last few years, I mean, this is exactly what we need. And again, all of these projects probably won't come to fruition, but some of them are really, really moving along nicely. And beyond data centers, there's just a tremendous amount happening in the manufacturing side as well.  I mean, Boeing, the largest manufacturer here in the State of Missouri started a $1.8 billion expansion. Unilever in Jeﬀerson City is also doing a very large expansion. Illinois Wheeland rolled products of $500 million expansion. I mean there are a number of projects here that continue -- should continue to add to some signiﬁcant growth.  In terms of what that means from a capital perspective, obviously, it's a net positive. I think we're going to continue to step back and assess that. But it's certainly great to see from an investment standpoint, and certainly a customer aﬀordability perspective, right? This is going to make it obviously, more aﬀordable for all customers at the end of the day."
Great. Thank you for that color. Maybe just sneak a quick one. I think you sounded like your Tranche -- the Tranche 2 initial concept map suggests that there will be some opportunities in your service areas. Any sense of how this compare that to what the initial concept map for   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Tranche 1 looks for you guys? Is it roughly the same in terms of potential dollar -- either size or dollars?,"Yeah, David. This is Marty. You know, it -- I'll tell you what, ﬁrst of all, the map is encouraging as we showed. And I think if you look at our Slide 11 that we provided, you know, you'll see substantial proposed additional lines, both in our service territory and in central Illinois as well as in the Eastern half of Missouri. And so you know that's certainly exciting to see. We're excited that the overall project portfolio was about twice the size of Tranche 1. You -- everybody else, I'm sure recalls Tranche 1 was about a $10 billion portfolio. We ended up having about 25% of that as we talked about on the call. And we were happy to be awarded some directly. We're very proud to have won all three of the competitive projects that were in our service territory. So you certainly feel good about the way Tranche 1 turned out.  It's too soon to really say what level of investments would be in our service territory from Tranche 2 for really a couple of reasons. One, I would say that the -- while we're excited about these projects that were in our service territory, as you well know, right now, the MISO is going through a process of getting input from stakeholders regarding these proposed projects. And we do expect that as MISO considers the input from various stakeholders that these project plans will be modiﬁed. So it's premature there, number one.  Number two, when MISO put out these Tranche 2, they really didn't assign while they came up with an overall portfolio investment of $17 billion to $23 billion. It really didn't put any particular quantiﬁcation of investment value on any particular substations or lines, et cetera. So really premature to even say how much these investment opportunities would be that are shown on this map.  So for a couple of reasons, I think it's premature to say how much of this would be in our service territory and ultimately, how much would be brownﬁeld or greenﬁeld. So -- but I think we will start to see iterations of this through time, and we're excited that MISO seems to be very much targeting an approval of this Tranche 2 portfolio by mid-September. And so -- and it should be pretty exciting over the next few months as we see how this unfolds."
Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, David.  Operator  We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the call back over to Marty Lyons for closing comments.
