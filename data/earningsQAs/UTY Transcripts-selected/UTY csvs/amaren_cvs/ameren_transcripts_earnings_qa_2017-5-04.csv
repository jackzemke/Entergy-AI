Question,Answer
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul.     Good morning, Paul."
"The FERC complaint case, I'm sorry if I missed this, but the D.C. Circuit decision, does that change any of this, in your opinion?","Yeah, Paul, this is Marty. We commented on that right there at the end of our prepared remarks. That case I wouldn't say has any direct impact on the MISO ROE complaint cases, but of course the methodology that the FERC used to determine the outcome of the ﬁrst complaint case and also underscored the ALJ's decision in the second complaint case, were certainly in line with that methodology that the FERC used in the New England case. So again, no direct impact, but of course the methodology did underlie the ﬁndings of the FERC and the ALJ, as I mentioned.  So as we look ahead, we suspect that once the FERC has a quorum and they look to decide on the second complaint case, they'll want to take into consideration the court's ﬁndings in the ﬁrst case as they think about how they'll rule in the second. And it's hard to predict, but we suspect that it could end up factoring into the timing in terms of the FERC's decision in the second case."
"With respect to the 206 (31:01), the ﬁnding whether or not the original rate was unjust and unreasonable, that element doesn't seem to be – do I understand that you don't think that portion of the D.C. Circuit's ruling applies? Is that right, or is not applicable to this? That's what I'm little bit confused about.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Well, I think in our cases, like in the New England case, I mean, they have to do both, right? They have to determine that the existing rate is unjust and unreasonable, and then secondarily determine that the new rate is properly supported by the evidence on the record. So I think both of those things apply in both of the cases. And so I think when they look at those cases, they'll be taking both of those things into consideration."
"Okay. And then just on the 9% rate base growth in Illinois and – should we expect a decrease in O&M or fuel and – or purchased power cost or just in general operational cost or productivity increase as a result of this? Or is it rate base growth that doesn't really do that, it's kind of replacement or what have you? I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that.","Yeah. I assume you are speciﬁcally talking about the Electric Distribution. But absolutely, what the customers in Illinois are seeing, as a result of the investments we are making, are both improvements in reliability and decreased costs overall as a result of the investments we're making. I would also note that over time the customers' rates are also being positively impacted by the lower power and capacity prices that we've been seeing in Illinois, apart from the positive impact of the investments that we're making in the Illinois Electric Distribution system."
"Do you think because of the low – I mean, Dynegy is kind of crying out there about how the price is so low, they can't go on this way. Is there any opportunity for you guys to – I know things would actually have to change there in Illinois, but I'm just wondering if there is an opportunity there for you to provide some sort of resource or something in Illinois or just any thoughts about what Dynegy is talking about with this low price that came in.","Yeah, look, I don't have any speciﬁc comment on what Dynegy is seeking. I will say this that today it seems like, with respect to capacity, that we have the resources in Illinois to serve our customers' needs. That I think is evidenced by the low capacity price that we saw this year. Longer term, however, we're certainly concerned about capacity adequacy, reliability, and volatility of rates for our customers. And as we have in the past, we stand ready to work with all parties in terms of resource adequacy for the state of Illinois."
Okay. Thanks.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Zhou with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.,
Hey. It's Andy Levi. How are you guys doing?,"Good morning, Andy. How are you?"
"I'm doing well. Just on the Missouri rate order that you got, and I know you kind of went over it, but I just want to understand the earnings power of it. Could we just go over the three components and how they beneﬁt the income statement, $92 million to $54 million and the $26 million?","Yeah. So, Andy, this is Marty. Absolutely. I think if you refer to slide 10, you will probably get the best picture of that overall in terms of how we expect the impacts to occur. Obviously, the ﬁrst element, which was the $92 million overall increase in rates, which was about 3.5% in terms of customer rate increases, is primarily the primary driver. And I would say this year just because of the timing of our rate structure, which we have higher rates in the summer months, about 80% of that will be realized this year.  But as you look at slide 10 and you look down the list, one of the other elements of the case was that the net base fuel costs that are embedded in the rates were lowered. That becomes the base on which any prospective changes in net fuel and purchase power costs are measured.  And then lastly, we saw lower amortizations or lower base for things that are amortizations that are reﬂected in riders and trackers also reduced by about $26 million. So those are the primary impacts. We list those in the slides. It's the $92 million rate increase, it's $54 million of reduced net base energy costs, and then the $26 million of lower net amortizations. And as you see on slide 10, we list out some of those components."
"Yeah, I do see that. And this is just – this is not the annualized aﬀect. This is nine months. Is that correct?","Yeah, that's a good point too, Andy. That is the nine-month impact. And so as we look ahead to next year, we would see the full annualized impact of that. That's why I mentioned on the $92   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   million, it's about – 80% of that's realized this year. On the other two, it's about three-quarters, about 75% realized this year."
"Right. So really, I mean, it's not $170 million rate increase, but it's $170 million of earnings beneﬁt pre-tax.","Yeah, the rate increase was $92 million, like I said, which is about 3.5%, but then on slide 10 we show you the overall impact."
"Right, right, right. And then you have those other two components. What have you built into your forecast for 2017 relative to these three items?","In our forecast for 2017, that's what we've got on slide 10, if I'm understanding..."
"I understand that, but originally when you came out with a forecast (37:22)...","Oh, you're talking about our guidance?"
"Yeah. I think the settlement had been already out there, is that correct, before you gave guidance? (37:34)","It is, Andy, yes. No, I understand your question now. Yeah, I understand your question now. Yes, when we came out with our guidance for this year, certainly that we had reached the settlement amongst the parties and we believe that the guidance range that we provided accommodated that outcome. Andy, I think as you think about the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and what we're seeing here to-date, we've had about $0.08 of negative weather in the ﬁrst quarter. And as you think about when we provided you that guidance, which was midway through February, certainly we had a sense that weather hit was very mild and that there were some negative impacts.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   We also had a sense of this constructive settlement that have been reached. However, the Commission had certainly not yet ruled on it and we really didn't know deﬁnitively when the rate increase would go into place. So when we gave that guidance, we certainly felt like the range that we gave was appropriate, given the multiple things we had in front of us there. As we look ahead for the remainder of the year, when you think about the ﬁrst quarter and if you look ahead, in the ﬁrst quarter we had about a negative $0.08 of weather, and that was oﬀset, when you think about the ﬁrst quarter, by this change in the timing of the revenue recognition in Illinois.  But the Illinois item is simply a timing item, whereas the weather is more permanent, if you will, unless we see some weather variation in the next nine months. So as we look ahead at the guidance, we obviously left our guidance unchanged and, as we think about it, we expect that negative impact of the weather to be overcome in part by a constructive outcome in the rate case and the timing of the rate increase, but also by continued ﬁnancial management and disciplined cost control."
"Okay. Thank you very much on that. And the other question is just on kind of a big picture basis and the reason I'm asking it – maybe I shouldn't. I mean, hopefully, I'll like the answer. But, obviously, this Great Plains-Westar merger is having issues, and may or may not happen. They just ﬁled for reconsideration today. But I don't know if that's a half-hearted eﬀort or not, but whatever. But then the media talk was like, oh, well, then Ameren is going to come and when everything is said and done and take a look at WR -- and I know you don't like to speak about speciﬁc names and all that, so I'm not asking you to do that. But just in general, can you kind of address that? Because over the last two weeks there has been a lot of talk within the investment community concerning that and the concern around that.","Andy, this is Warner. I can be happy to address that. Number one, as you rightly said, we never comment on any rumors or M&A activities or speculative transactions, right? But as I said before, and I will say it again, I want to be clear. We remain very focused, very focused on executing our strategic plan, and that strategic plan is all about organic growth in our regulated business. It's all about executing that rate base growth that we've talked about. And that plan has delivered strong total shareholder returns over the last three years. So that's where our focus is."
Thanks.  Operator  Our next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.,
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Hi. You cited $0.07 per share in corporate from lower tax beneﬁts from share-based compensation, and as I go back and look at the ﬁrst quarter, last year your tax rate was particularly low. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about sort of the timing there. Was that a beneﬁt that you took in 2016 that didn't recur in 2017, or is there something changing in terms of the new FASB rules on accounting for stock-based compensation?","Yeah, thanks, Leslie. This is Marty. Yeah, we actually adopted that accounting for stock-based compensation last year in the ﬁrst quarter. And last year, if you look back, which we were pretty clear about, we had a $0.09 beneﬁt from adoption of that standard in the ﬁrst quarter of last year. And that really gets to a diﬀerence between the value of what employees received at that time versus what had been recognized previously in earnings. It was a $0.09 beneﬁt last year. This year the beneﬁt was $0.02. And therefore, the delta is a negative $0.07 year-over-year."
"Okay. And then your tax rate for the full year, are you still thinking it will be around 38%?","Absolutely, Leslie. Yes, that's right. So when you look at – it is lower here in the ﬁrst quarter. I think it was around 35-and-change in terms of the eﬀective tax rate, but we expect 38% for the full year."
Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Hey. How's it going?,"Hey, Paul."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So just, you guys covered SB 190, but as you know, this has been going on for some time. Each legislative session, it seems like déjà vu. We had a ﬁlibuster before. I listened to some of the debate, as you mentioned, this session. But how should we think about the fact that – ﬁrst of all, I don't know whether or not constitutionally or rule-wise, what have you, if the ﬁlibuster could be broken. But, I mean, I don't know what the rules actually are associated with that, so maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. But I guess in the absence of that, how should we think about your legislative strategy, I guess, next year or what have you regarding this?","Paul, this is Warner. I'll take a shot at it and I'll address both of them in terms of the bigger picture – sort of the déjà vu comment, as well as sort of ﬁlibuster. Number one, it may feel like déjà vu, but I will tell you, from my perspective, we have consistently made progress in advancing the discussion on important energy infrastructure legislation that will support investment. And I think what we have seen over the last two sessions has been, not just meaningful progress in terms of stakeholder support, but also legislative support. And so, of course, if it doesn't advance this session, we are going to be disappointed.  But from my perspective, what we've done in the Missouri legislature working with our other utilities across the state is make sure they understand the clear opportunities in terms of what's important to modernize the energy grid, but also those opportunities that those investments will create jobs. I think this is why you see such strong bipartisan support. This is why you saw we come out of Senate Commerce Committee with such a strong vote. Unfortunately, as you rightly point out, we have had some challenges in avoiding the ﬁlibuster. And so, in terms of the ﬁlibuster, there are two ways to address a ﬁlibuster, or probably maybe three.  Number one, you try and minimize the number of folks that are willing to ﬁlibuster and, from our perspective, that number has meaningfully decreased from where it was in the past. Secondly, what you hope to do is try and ﬁnd a compromise with those folks. But if not, then you need to be given adequate ﬂoor time to try and drive either negotiations or get something across the ﬁnish line. It's not unusual in the Missouri legislature. Filibusters do occur in other bills, and frankly, ultimately, sometimes they get passed, sometimes they don't. But the bottom line is, a ﬁlibuster doesn't ultimately kill everything that goes on in the Missouri legislature.  Last, but not least, there are rules that the Senate has available to it that could help debate on the bill. But as we've said before, those rules are used pretty infrequently. But there are ways to address it. First and foremost, we try to do it in a constructive fashion and ﬁnd good compromise that creates a win-win for everybody.  So as we look forward then to the next legislative session, as I said on my comments, while we may be disappointed if Senate Bill 190 does not advance this session, we're not going to be deterred, because we think it's absolutely critical to continue to advocate for important energy and economic policies. They're in the best long-term interest for our customers and the entire state of Missouri.  I think when you look at the work that we've done and the growing body of evidence across the country that these regulatory reforms are truly driving customer beneﬁts and creating jobs,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   those kind of things will continue to put us in a very good position, whereby constructive regulatory reform can ultimately be passed in the state of Missouri. That's my perspective."
"Okay. That's very helpful and very comprehensive. Just to make sure, although, I understand personally, because I don't want to monitor the thing forever. When you say that you would be disappointed, it sounds like you are not hopeful that it will pass, but do you think that there is a signiﬁcant chance that it may pass still?","No. Well, Paul, what I said, we said it's unlikely. We have till May 12, so time is short. And so because of that I think it creates – it's very challenging for that Senate Bill 190 to get passed this legislative session."
"Okay. But, never say never maybe.","You never say never. And we still – or as I said also, that we're still trying to work on the constructive path forward with key stakeholders, but the time is ticking."
"And then just one ﬁnal follow-up on the rate base growth question that I had about Illinois. Is there any quantitative number in terms of O&M or just cost savings in general that are associated with them that you have? I know you may not have oﬀ the top your head, but I'm just wondering if there is a rule of thumb that we should maybe be thinking about in terms of what might happen there in terms of – I don't know – smart meter, lowering costs or what have you. Any thoughts?","I don't know that there is really a rule of thumb. If you look back at some of our prepared remarks today, you will notice some of the mention we gave to the improvement in reliability, as well as some of the annual value that customers are realizing as a result of the broad infrastructure investments that we're making and we'll continue to update those over time, Paul, I guess. I don't think I have a good metric for you and we'll look at whether one of those exist. But clearly over time as we invest more in our smart infrastructure as we roll out more of our smart meters to our customers in Illinois, both the electric meters as well as the gas meter modules, we will provide continuing updates on the improvements that we're seeing in overall reliability and cost savings that we're bringing to the customers. And, in the meantime, we'll work with some of our folks in operations to see whether we can come up with some meaningful metrics that we might provide going forward in terms of the savings.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Great. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot.,"Thanks, Paul.     All right. Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question."
"Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call.","Hi, Neil."
"So really you answered most of my questions on SB 190 in the last question – or the last answer, but just a follow-up. I think your points are well taken that in the state, the legislative support, other support for something is really strong. So what point in time, tactically, do you say maybe going down the legislative route we don't need to do that as much anymore and really look for solutions just going straight to the regulators themselves? Would that be something that you would rethink as we think about 2017 and 2018 and beyond?","Hi, Neil. This is Warner. Look, the bottom line is that in moving policies forward, we consider both the legislative route and we consider the regulatory route. You've seen us in regulatory, the rate cases advance policies that are within the tools that the Commission currently has. So that's always an option. But we also pursue the legislative option. And we think too clearly that that is a good sustainable path as well. So there is no point of inﬂexion. There's no black or white line that you just literally go through and say here's the time. The point is, we factor a number of things into our thinking around that, but the most important thing is that we get it done for the state of Missouri and for our customers.  And, Michael, you have some additional comments on that as well.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Yeah. Well, I think the important thing associated with the legislative side is creating that consistency, right? I mean, I think the uncertainty associated with the regulatory processes that you are looking for is long-term investments to make, and that's really what we see through the legislative process is giving us the window to do that. That's why we've been so focused on it."
Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Joe Zhou with Avon Capital. Please proceed with your question.,
Hey. It's Andy again.,"Hi, Andy."
"So, I guess, the points are kind of well taken on the legislation. So it just seems like that strategy is going to kind of work in Missouri and maybe it does, but God only knows when. So how about on the regulatory front, what are you thinking there? I mean, you have kind of backed oﬀ spending more money and allocating more money to Illinois, which obviously is the right strategy and not as much to Missouri. At the same time, you got a pretty fair rate order, and we're also compensated for Noranda in the latest ﬁling. And I guess there's been some workshops, but over my career workshops tend not always to be too much.  What's the thinking now in Missouri CapEx-wise, investment-wise? Is it still kind of to not invest as much as you had planned, or as much as maybe the legislation would have allowed? Or at some point do you decide to kind of go the more traditional route and start ramping up the investment there? And, obviously, there is regulatory lag, but also working with the Commission to try to – the word is not eliminate that, but to kind of be able to recover costs on a timely basis Missouri-wise? I'm not saying timely in general, but just Missouri-wise. So what's the thinking on that?","Andy, this is Warner. I'll hit the highlights and certainly Marty and/or Michael can join in. My view is that we're pretty clear about what our ﬁve-year plan is. I mean, it's laid out there and clearly the compound annual growth rate for Missouri is what it is. It's laid out there in the slides, about   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   2% and we feel very comfortable with that. And the strong robust plan, the 6% rate base growth plan that we talk about is not contingent on regulatory reform in Missouri. But we've have also said, if we have regulatory reform in Missouri, whether it comes through legislative means, whether it comes through regulatory means, or a combination thereof, it will give us the ability to put more money to work in the state of Missouri, and therefore enhance that investment proﬁle. So I think that's really how I see it going forward.  Michael, any other comments?     Yeah, absolutely. I just want to be clear that we are investing to maintain safe and adequate service here in the state of Missouri. There's no question about that. We are missing an opportunity, I think, to modernize this grid. And what we are doing in Illinois today, I think, is a great example, but we're going to continue to stay after this. But just want to be clear about the investments that we're making today in the state of Missouri.     Absolutely right."
"I understand that. I mean, obviously, you're going to run the system the best you can and it's just a matter of modernizing the system to where other states are at right now. But you don't get to a point where – not because the system is not running well, don't misunderstand me, but where you decide, okay, the legislative route is not working. Obviously, you are trying not only to run a really good system in Missouri, but also trying to make a point too that without proper regulatory reform or treatment, it's very hard as a business to make those investments, especially when you have opportunities across the border in Illinois. So at what point do you decide to make those investments? And I want to say regardless, but kind of just – are you saying that you won't unless there is reform?","Again, this is Michael Moehn. I think it's looking for that certainly. I think you said it well. I mean, as we said before, we are maintaining safe and adequate service. We're allocating where we can in other jurisdictions today. We'll continue to look at all tools that we have in front of us, legislative or regulatorily, and if we see an opportunity, we'll certainly take it, but it is that certainty that we're missing today and we have better opportunities. But, again, we're going to continue to invest where we have to to maintain the system that customers are expecting from us.     So the bottom line, Andy, is we feel comfortable with our plan."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  I know you do.,"And we have been pretty clear. So we're going to continue to stay at it, because we think it's simply the right thing to do for our customers, for the state of Missouri, and our shareholders."
"I mean, obviously, we like your story quite a bit and you guys have done a very, very good job. But I guess, at the same time, we could see some higher growth from Missouri, obviously, that would enhance the growth rate of the corporation as well beyond the 6% through 2021. But I completely hear what you are saying. I mean, Missouri regulation is – again, this is me talking, not the company, somewhat arcane in the way that they do things and makes it diﬃcult, both on an investment basis as a investor and also for you guys as well. But okay. Thank you very much.","Thanks for your question, Andy.  Operator  Thank you. There are no further questions at this time.
