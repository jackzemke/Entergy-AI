Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Brian."
"The $1 billion of incremental investment opportunities in Missouri, would that require external equity needs?","Brian, I think as we think about that extra $1 billion, obviously, we are pursuing changes in the Missouri framework that would allow us to actually move forward with those. To the extent that we have the opportunity to make those investments for the beneﬁt of customers, what we'll do, Brian, at that point, is step back and look at our overall capital plan, assess and reassess what we've got in that plan, and also step back and reassess our ﬁnancing. So I think it's premature that we would need to issue any additional equity or that we would issue additional equity. We'll take a step back and look at our overall capital expenditure and ﬁnancing plans. Of course, we do have a very strong balance sheet today. We have very strong credit metrics relative to our ratings, so we'll assess all of those things as we move forward to the extent we have that opportunity."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. And at the Missouri legislature, it's my understanding that there are three bills being proposed, yet your comments and the presentation slides focused on Senate Bill 190. And I'm just curious to know why is that? Does Senate Bill 190 have a higher likelihood of success versus the other two?","Hi, Brian. This is Warner. Yeah, a couple of comments. Yes, in December, three bills were ﬁled. Senate Bill 190, which we spent most of our time on, but then, there are two other bills, Senate Bill 214 and Senate Bill 215. Senate Bill 214 really is very similar to the performance-based ratemaking bill that was ﬁled last year, and Senate Bill 215 is similar to, I would say, enabling language.  Our focus right now and those in the industry is on Senate Bill 190. We believe when you take all the stakeholder input that we have had since last session and even in this session, it reﬂects many of the input that we've received from stakeholders. So that's our focal point now. Those other two bills are still out there, but we're focused on Senate Bill 190."
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Liou with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.,
"Thanks for taking my question. Just want to talk a little bit about the Commission, Missouri. They did a review of the ratemaking framework last December, I believe. Are they still involved in the process or has your focal point kind of shifted to the legislator at this point?","And so, look, I'm going to turn it over to Michael Moehn who oversees our Missouri operations. Michael, you can comment a little bit about the process the Commission has gone through in the past and then sort of where we're at from a Missouri (40:14) perspective.     Sure. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, look, the workshop that occurred over the summer was a productive process. Obviously, we participated a great deal in that. We were appreciative of all the hard work that was put into it. I think there were some constructive recommendations that came out of that from the Missouri Public Service Commission. And look, yeah, we obviously stay close to them and are engaged with them about this legislative process and continue to get feedback from them.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Thanks. And just want to quickly jump to just ﬁnancing needs. I know you talked about your cash ﬂow plan for 2017, but with tax reform, is there strong consideration for ﬁnancing at the Transmission level or at the holding company level, I think historically, you've always used holding company leverage for your Transmission investments?","Yeah, sure. It's something that's actively under consideration. Appreciate your question about our plans to fund our capital expenditures and our maturities this year. As we noted on the slides, we have about $675 million of maturities this year in June at Ameren Missouri, we've got $425 million maturity. And then in November, we've got $250 million maturity at Ameren Illinois.  So as we look ahead this year, a few things. We expect that midyear, following that maturity at Missouri, we'd likely do a ﬁnancing there. And late in the year in November, December, after that maturity at Ameren Illinois, we'd also plan to do a ﬁnancing there, I think not only to reﬁnance the maturity, but also some of the capital expenditures that we've had through the year in Ameren Illinois.  And then of course, as you mentioned, we've been ﬁnancing the Transmission business and the growth there really through the use of parent company debt, long-term and short-term debt. As we move through the year, ﬁnancing additional infrastructure investment, our short-term debt balances would grow. And so it's likely around midyear that we'd execute some sort of a long- term ﬁnancing. And we'll provide you greater details on our thoughts there as we move through the year.  But you identiﬁed, say, the relevant considerations, whether to do that long-term ﬁnancing at the parent or at the Transmission entity down at ATXI. So those are things that we are assessing. We do, like I say, expect that we will do – execute on long-term ﬁnancing around midyear, but those details are still being thought through, and we'll share more with you later in the year."
All right. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.,
"Yes, thank you. Just around the fourth quarter results, were there any drivers that you could provide around that impact of weather or otherwise? And then just to conﬁrm around the Missouri stipulation, was that unanimous or not?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Sure, Gregg. This is Marty. Let me start with the Q4 results. So with regard to the Q4 results compared to the prior year, weather was a positive. In fact, it was about a $0.06 positive versus prior year; but versus our expectations, which revolve around normal weather, weather was a negative about $0.01. We had sort of a warm year last year, including a warm fourth quarter. So it was a bit of a negative compared to expectations for the quarter.  Of course, we beneﬁted from continued infrastructure investments. Obviously, that was a beneﬁt in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. We did have a lower eﬀective tax rate in the fourth quarter versus last year. So I'll tell you that versus our expectations, it was a little higher than expected. So tax issues or items were a bit of a negative versus our expectations coming into the fourth quarter.  And then again, going back compared to prior years, we had lower beneﬁts from the energy eﬃciency programs in Missouri. You'll recall that in 2015, as we were coming to the end of that ﬁrst energy eﬃciency program, we had high take rates, if you will, on the incentives we were providing to the customers, and that translated into some beneﬁts being recognized by the company in late 2015 that didn't recur then in 2016. And so those were some of the big things. Then, of course, don't forget about the year-over-year impact of the New Madrid smelter load loss, which was obviously a negative in 2016 versus 2015.  So, again compared to prior years, prior year, plus on weather, plus on investment returns, plus on the eﬀective tax rate, minus on the energy eﬃciency impacts, and minus in terms of the New Madrid smelter, that's kind of how it all shakes up compared to the prior year. But again, compared to expectations, I would say a little bit lower than our expectations coming into the quarter due to some tax items and weather. So, that's how we shake all that up.  And then I think your second question, we'll turn it over back to Michael Moehn.     Yeah, with respect to the agreement in principle, it is with all the major parties, I would say, at this point: the Staﬀ, the Oﬃce of Public Counsel, several industrial groups, Division of Energy, so clearly the major parties in the case. Once we ﬁle the stipulation and agreement with the Commission, I hope it to be unanimous at the end of the day, but it's just a bit premature to say that."
