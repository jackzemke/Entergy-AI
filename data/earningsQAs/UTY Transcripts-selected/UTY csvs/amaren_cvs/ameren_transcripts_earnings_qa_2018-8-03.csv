Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning everyone.",Good morning Julien. How are you doing?
"Good. Well, I want to echo the last two comments here and I want to also send my congratulations to Doug, Andrew. You guys have been great. Thank you very much and all the best. Just to kick it oﬀ with a quick question here, if I can. In terms of the legislation and what it means in Missouri, just talking about sort of the meat and potatoes of lag expectations. Can you talk about the depreciation deferral accounting and just to what extent, a, this could eventually change your capital budget spending sort of independent of the two factors that are out there that are not reﬂected? And then secondly, just as you think about sort of structural expectations, particularly given a longer period in between the next rate case, how do you think about ROE lag over the next few years as well in Missouri?","Thanks. Marty, why don't you perhaps take that, talk about some of the structural things around SB 564, and then perhaps Michael Moehn, the President of our Missouri operations, can sort of chime in. Marty?     Yes, sure Julien. Appreciate the question. The biggest impact I would say of Senate Bill 564 over the next several years is going to be our expectation of deploying about $1 billion of additional capital relative to the capital expenditure plan we've put forward in December. And -- or as announced in February. The driver of that really is the ability to defer depreciation and return on those projects that go into service in between rate cases. When I say defer, it's more speciﬁcally about 85% -- is 85% of those impacts on depreciation and return over time. So that should really help us to mitigate the impact we've had on regulatory lag of capital expenditures. As Warner mentioned in his talking points, that accounting and that regulatory treatment applies to the vast majority of our capital expenditures, not just the incremental $1 billion as we move forward. So look, we're not giving a speciﬁc guidance here today on the future.  As we roll those capital expenditures and additional capital expenditures associated with wind into our longer-term capital expenditure plans and our rate base plans. We'll update our overall earnings growth guidance. And we'll tell you that a key part of our strategy is to continuously improve our operating performance and earn close to our allowed returns. That will continue to be sort of the hallmark of our plans going forward, is the work to be able to deploy the incremental capital, while still earning close to our allowed returns. In terms of rate cases, we do have a moratorium for some time, and then we'll begin to have the opportunity to have rate reviews going forward. The earliest we can ﬁle our next rate case is in May of 2019, with rates going into eﬀect in April of '20. And the latest we can ﬁle our next rate review is May of '20, with   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   rates then going into eﬀect after an 11-month review process, in approximately April of '21. So those are the next sort of the goalposts, if you will, for the timing of our next rate case."
"It just sounds -- just to clarify that, it sounds as if you can earn your allowed returns through that, perhaps, extended period?","That's going to be our goal, is to earn very close to our alloweds in the next period. Look, Senate Bill 564, to be clear, is not formulaic rate-making. There is still the impacts of things like O&M expense or variations in interest or other factors that could move earnings up or down relative to the allowed return coming out of a rate review. So -- but, as we've said many times, the things that the 564 addressed: the depreciation, the return on investment, those were the things that were signiﬁcant driver of regulatory lag as we deployed incremental capital. So 564 is on point to address those things, and it's going to allow us to deploy that incremental billion. But we'll still have to have ﬁnancial discipline, strong ﬁnancial management in order to continue to earn close to our allowed.     Which is certainly a key part of our strategy, not a new one. It's one that we've been executing on. Michael, any ﬁnal comments?     The only thing I was going to mention is I think we've said previously with respect to that $1 billion of capital, think about it ratably over the next ﬁve years. There's going to be some variability in it, but we're busy working to ﬂesh out what those plans are going to be over the next one and ﬁve years and put that in front of the commission.     Julien, thank you for your question and we appreciate your kind comments as well about Doug and Andrew.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question."
Good morning. How are you?,Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Good morning Paul. How are you?
"Congratulations, Doug. You must be excited. So I wanted to just follow up on a few things. One was, with respect to the Noranda start-up -- it's not Noranda anymore, but the smelter, I think it's expected to start up now again, is that correct?","It is. I think they're scheduled to start, I believe, two of the three pot lines. And we are not really involved in that at this point. They've entered into an agreement with the municipal co-op down there to supply that power at this point."
"Okay, fair enough. And then just sort of just to follow up on all the activity that you mentioned, and you mentioned of course that the $1 billion associated with the wind and the $1 billion associated with the other -- the grid mod is not in there. I was just wondering, are you thinking that -- are there any other opportunities that you guys are seeing, maybe, that we should maybe be thinking about? I know you guys are going to be updating the capital expense maybe in the third or perhaps fourth quarter, but just sort of wondering if there's anything more we should be thinking about there.","Paul, this is Warner. As you step back, I think our rate base growth is not just a ﬁve-year plan. We believe we have a robust infrastructure plan beyond really through 2022. And it isn't just in Missouri. We talked about grid modernization there, which is meaningful. We've talked about renewable energy investments, which, too, are meaningful and could be more in the future. But when you look at the investments that we still have in Illinois, and we're executing the grid modernization plan there. But we've talked in the past about the potential incremental investments we have to do in the gas business. We continue to deploy capital there because there's a need, but also because there's a great regulatory framework over there. And of course, in transmission, we look at not just the multi-value projects, which we're executing very well, but look, there are a number of projects that we have to continue to execute there in terms of just system expansion when you think about NERC requirements. And so when we look at our overall infrastructure pipeline, it's robust across all of our businesses. And so our objective is to now execute on the projects that we have in front of us over the next ﬁve years, but also to create and capitalize on infrastructure pipeline opportunities in the future. That has been our focus and it will continue to be."
"Okay. And then just a clariﬁcation, I apologize I didn't get it completely. The sales growth numbers, I think you said, in Missouri, weather-adjusted was 2% before the MEEIA. Could you clarify a little bit of that? I apologize, I'm just not picking up on it quick enough.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","That's okay, Paul. This is Marty. We talked about this in Missouri, the residential and commercial were up about 2%, excluding the energy eﬃciency programs under MEEIA. Industrial was also up about 1.2%, and this is in the second quarter. Illinois residential and commercial customers were -- sales were up about 1%, industrial was up about 3% there. And we reminded folks on the -- in the prepared remarks of course, in Illinois, we have decoupling. So while sales were up, and that's great, there's no eﬀect on earnings in Illinois because of the decoupling. So those are the statistics that we've provided overall for the second quarter."
"What do you make of the 2%, though? I mean, is that -- I mean that's before energy eﬃciency. I'm just wondering, your energy eﬃciency eﬀorts, I realize that you can collect them or what have you, but what would the impact be without it, I guess? Do you follow? What was the impact of it, I guess? Do you follow me? In other words...","We have to look back. My recollection is we were up maybe 0.5%-or-so, excluding the MEEIA impact. So it's still up even including, I should say, the MEEIA impacts. And I think overall, what I make of it is, it's good trends. We've been seeing on -- those are all -- actually, the numbers I gave I think Q2. those were all year-to-date numbers that I gave. And if you look across all of that, we were up for residential, commercial, industrial in those states. And I think it reﬂects some of the good underlying data too. We've seen good growth in terms of residential and customer accounts year-over-year. In Missouri, those were up about 0.8%. They're a little more ﬂattish in Illinois. But we've seen good growth in those customer accounts in Missouri. Our unemployment has been tracking well. We've seen job growth over the past year in both states. In Missouri -- in our area in Missouri, the unemployment's around 3.6% versus nationally around 4%. And in our service territory in Illinois, it's right about that national average, where we're sitting at about a 4.1%. So I think the trend data and customer accounts look good and weather- normalized sales look good. And I'd say overall, we feel like the economic conditions in both states are stable. I think going forward, Paul, we're still thinking more about ﬂat in terms of the sales growth and these are nice trends year-to-date, but we'll continue to monitor things long term. For our longer-term planning purposes, we've been thinking more about ﬂattish in terms of the sales growth because while we are seeing positive underlying economic data, we do have these energy eﬃciency plans and therefore net, we expect about ﬂat."
"Okay, great. And once again congratulations.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from -- I'm sorry. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with Exodus Point Capital Management. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",
"Hey guys, good morning.",Good morning. How are you?
"Glad to see another good quarter. You guys are racking it up, becoming like CMS and (inaudible). Very impressive. And then Doug, for you, we spoke already, so I'll just say you did a great job, as always, for 25 years. Actually, I've known you for 25 years so.",Pretty amazing.     It is pretty amazing.
"Pretty scary, actually, for all of us.",We won't go into storytelling about Doug. Let us move on.
"Anyway, so back to the Q&A. Can we just, timing-wise, just to understand as far as the wind and as far as the grid-mode relative to Missouri, new disclosures, CapEx, growth rate guidance, all that. When will that all be disclosed? Is that going to be at EI or how should we think about that?","Marty, why don't you touch -- I hit on some of this in our talking points, but why don't you touch on some of the things we're thinking about either the third quarter or early next year? And then, Michael, perhaps you'd brieﬂy touch on some of the things you're doing to prepare to move forward on those projects. So Marty?      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Sure. As Warner just said, we're thinking either at the earliest on our third quarter conference call, which we'll obviously lead in the EI, as you mentioned, or as we have done more traditionally on our year-end call, which is in February. So that's the way to think about it. In terms of the spend in Missouri, the incremental $1 billion of grid modernization, that would be expected to kick in beginning in 2019 and it'll be fairly ratable, but I'd say build some over the ﬁve-year period. And -- but that's how we see that laying out as we mentioned on the call. In terms of the wind, while we have ﬁled a certiﬁcate of convenience and need request with the commission for the ﬁrst 400, we're still working with developers on the remainder. We expect to have those done and ﬁled by the end of the year. And all of that planning and execution work will factor into our thoughts in terms of when we update our longer-term guidance. Michael, any additional thoughts?     Yeah. I think the only thing to add in addition to what you said about the wind would just be around the grid modernization. So we have some ﬁlings that we were going to -- we'll put in front of the commission early in '19 that will lay out the $1 billion. It has to be on a great deal of detail for one year and a little less detail for the subsequent four years. But we're very focused on that today, and be able to tell the story and the beneﬁts for our customers.     So Andy, all of those factors, as Marty said, will go into the overall timing. And so this is why we haven't made a speciﬁc choice. If we're ready to do it in November, we will do so. If not, we'll provide the update during our February conference call."
"Okay. And just to make sure that I understand what you were saying, that your current kind of forecast of 5% to 7%, kind of everything that's in the handout, doesn't include any of --",That's correct. It does not include the $1 billion associated with grid modernization or the potential $1 billion associated with the wind generation.
"All right, thank you very much.",You are welcome.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)
"Thanks. Doug, I think obviously it goes without saying, you've been fantastic. You've been a great peer as well as superbly professional. And we'll miss you, and I'll be jealous of all the free time you're going to have.  My question is with regard to -- well, presumption that when you give us the updated capital expenditure forecast, you're also going to tell us how you're going to need to ﬁnance that spending, right? So is it right to assume a base case of sort of $0.50 of every $1 of incremental capital is funded -- needs to be funded with equity, and the rest can be funded with utility subsidiary debt, which is roughly equivalent to the cap structure or can you walk us through your credit metrics -- current credit metrics, where they stand and how that will frame up the use of the balance sheet to fund the growth?","Yeah. Greg, this is Marty. As it relates to the credit metrics and where we stand there. With S&P right now, of course, we're at BBB+. They've set an FFO-to-debt threshold of 13%, they've got a positive outlook there. At Moody's, we've got Baa1 at Ameren overall; and then at Missouri and Illinois, A3; FFO-to-debt threshold there for all of those entities at 19%. And we don't typically disclose our exact metrics in terms of where we're at. But we feel comfortable as we sit here today with our current plan that we'd be able to achieve metrics at or above those levels. We like the ratings we have today. As you know, we've worked hard to improve our business risk proﬁle over time and to maintain good credit metrics and so we do like where they sit today.  And as you also know, when we updated our guidance at February, which we had not a lot of capital expenditure plans, but the incremental cash ﬂows and rate base impacts of tax reform, we did decide at that time to begin to issue some equity under the dividend reinvestment and employee beneﬁt plans, really with the goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet, maintaining good ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and good credit metrics. And those dividend reinvestment and employee beneﬁt plans are expected to generate anywhere from $75 million to $100 million a year in equity proceeds. As you mentioned, when we update our capital expenditure outlook, our rate base growth plans for the incremental grid modernization and wind investments, at that point, we will step back and take a look at our overall plans with respect to ﬁnancing that, and we'll be taking into account the things I just talked about: maintaining the strong balance sheet, credit metrics, credit ratings, all of that. Thinking about what's prudent in terms of ﬁnancing relative to those things. And then also, making sure we think through how best to maximize shareholder value as we pursue putting those investments into rate base and earning good returns for the shareholders."
"Okay. So I should think about it more around -- if I could theoretically come up with a reasonably good estimate of what I think your current FFO-to-debt metrics are, and assuming that they're at or above the targets that I put myself into your -- put my Treasury hat on, that I would look to manage to maintain those metrics whilst trying to maximize the value for shareholders and build the ﬁnancing plan that way?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","I think you've exactly got it right. I mean, I think from a ﬁnance treasury perspective, we're balancing all of those things, making sure we've got good balance -- good, strong balance sheet, solid credit metrics relative to our existing ratings and being thoughtful about how to position these things as we move through the regulatory process."
"Okay, thanks guys.Take care.","Thanks for your kind comments.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Stephen."
"Good morning. I mostly just wanted to congratulate Doug and Andrew. Doug, I wish you many, many happy years of retirement. And Andrew, a very well-deserved promotion.","Thank you, Stephen. We appreciate that.     We appreciate that."
"I did have a couple of questions, though. This is stepping, I guess, way back and just building a little bit on Greg's and Andy's question. The regulatory and legislative wins that you've had clearly provide some incremental opportunities, and I guess, that could be thought of as tactically beneﬁcial, sort of a tactical win, or it could be thought more of as a structural movement upward in your ability to grow your earnings power, grow your investment and with that, a proportionate increase in kind of longer-term growth expectations. So I guess, philosophically, when you think about where you are now in terms of looking out at your growth   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   potential, do you think this is heading towards a structural shift upwards in your longer-term growth potential and is that something that you can address when you do give us that update?","So Steven, this is Warner. Look, I don't know if you can call it -- whatever you want to call it, I call it a signiﬁcant strategic win. And it's a strategic win for shareholders, our customers and in the states that we operate in. So when I step back and I look at where we're at today, we now have all four of the operating segments that we operate in with constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment, important investment for the beneﬁt of our customers, the communities that we serve and serving our shareholders. And so as a result, I -- we have said and we will put more capital to work in the State of Missouri, just like we did in Illinois, when they passed constructive legislation. And just like we have been in our transmission business, when they have constructive jurisdictions there. And just like we did in our Illinois natural gas distribution businesses. So whether you call that a structural uplift or not, I call it an uplift, period, and I think it's strategic and I think it's a win-win, as I said during my talking points, really for all stakeholders."
"Makes sense. And then on thinking about your insulation against rising interest rates or ways to address that. Illinois has got a very eﬃcient mechanism. Let's just assume for the moment that interest rates did rise signiﬁcantly. Could you just talk to potential ways to enhance the allowed return on equity outside of Illinois in terms of mechanisms? I know there's an extended transmission process, but I'm trying to kind of think through other ways that, that could be sort of -- you could use that in an oﬀensive way in terms of readjusting upward the allowed ROE?","Stephen, this is Warner, I'll start, and then maybe Marty, you can add. Certainly, you pointed out, and rightly so, Illinois has a very unique and constructive mechanism to address a rising interest rate environment. It's one of the few like it in the country, and when they put that together, it was to mitigate this risk. But obviously, with this low interest rate environment, customers in Illinois have beneﬁted immensely. But it is a mechanism that obviously adjusts immediately, which we think is terriﬁc, should the need arise. And of course, you think about the other jurisdictions where we have the ability to go in for rate cases when we deem it appropriate. So while in Missouri, we have a rate freeze through April 2020, obviously, we will respect that. We'll have to come in by 2021 and we have the ability to ﬁle rate cases when we believe it's appropriate. Just as we do in Illinois for our natural gas business to ﬁle rate cases, we have a forward test year there. And so we can be mindful of those types of things to try and make sure that we match our cost of capital with changes in the interest rate environment. Transmission, a little bit diﬀerent mechanism to get that. But we think, too, should the need arise, we could go in there -- if interest rates rise sharply, we can get there in a timely fashion to address those types of issues. So I think under our existing frameworks, we have the ability to address that potential risk. And then as I said before, with Illinois, we have really a unique mechanism to doing better.  Marty, anything else you would comment on?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      No. I think I'd just note that as it relates to updating the rate cases, we talked on the call about a settlement in our gas case in Illinois, where we've agreed with the staﬀ in terms of the settlement, moving the ROE there up from 9.6% to about 9.87%, so there is that opportunity as we go through these regulatory rate reviews. I'd also mention more on the cost side, too. We've done a lot over the past several years to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment to reﬁnance debt. And as we've been doing that, have been really pushing out the maturity terms and the average tenor of our ﬁnancings to provide some assurance there in terms of the interest cost we see over time. So I know that wasn't the exact point of your question, I think Warner answered your question head on, but I thought I would add that point."
It's very helpful. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Stephen.  Operator  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition. Please proceed with your question."
"Good morning, congrats on good results. And I just wanted to also add -- thank you, Doug, for all your work and help during this time period. Marty, can I just ask, as you review your stuﬀ for the update on the CapEx plan, can we expect that, right now, if I'm right, the base of the CAGR is based on from 2017 to 2022? Well, now you've raised the guidance for, I guess, weather purposes, but can we assume that you would update the base also when you provide -- as we look forward? Or I'm just trying to better understand the parameters to change?","No. I think we would logically update the base, and we'll decide what that'll be. I mean, you're right, the current 5% to 7% compound annual EPS growth expectations that we have out there, which are 2017 through 2022, are based oﬀ of a core EPS number in 2017 of $2.83. So as we roll forward our CapEx and rate base growth assumptions, as we update our expectations on EPS growth, logically, we would establish a new base for that going forward."
"Okay. Thank you so much.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fischer for any closing remarks.","Thank you. And thank you for participating in this call and thank you to Warner and Marty for your kind remarks earlier. Thanks also to Andrew and his predecessor, Matt Thayer for their hard work and insight in helping execute Ameren's IR program over the last 10 years. And I also want to especially thank you, analysts and investors, for your friendship and for teaching me so much over the years. I will miss interacting with you.  Let me remind you again that a replay of the call will be available for 1 year on our website. If you have questions, you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Financial analyst inquiries should be directed to me, at least for the next few days, and to Andrew thereafter and also today as well. Media should call Erin Davis. Our contact numbers are on the release. Again, thank you for your interest in Ameren, and have a great day.  Operator  Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.
