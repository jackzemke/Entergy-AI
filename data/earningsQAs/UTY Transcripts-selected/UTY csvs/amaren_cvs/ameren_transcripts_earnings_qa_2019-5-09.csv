Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien today.","Good morning, Julien.     Hey Nick, how are you doing?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Hey good hope you guys are doing well too.,Doing well. Thank you.
"Just to kick it oﬀ here. I know that you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks, Missouri rate review is for the timing of some of these wind investments and what not, but just given you have the RESRAM there and then also the PISA and the fact that the fuel tracker it implies that it doesn't need to be renewed until 2021. I guess the question is why now.","Yes, sure. Nick, this is Marty and thanks for the question. So as we said on the call, we do plan to ﬁle for an electric rate case as early as July. Recall that we've beenr saying for a while that we expected to ﬁle between May 1st of this year, 2019 and May 1st of 2020. We really have to ﬁle before May 1st of 2020 in order to keep the fuel adjustment clause and of course rate case when you think about it Missouri typically takes 11 months and only allows for rate base true-ups to date about six months post-ﬁling.  So those are some considerations or constraints when you think about the timing of these cases and you think about the wind assets being completed in late 2020. So in any event, as we said in the call, the ﬁle in July it allows us to do a couple of things updates rates for infrastructure investments and other cost of service that have changed over the past few years and incorporate these lower coal and transportation costs into base rates. And then number two, it provides us ﬂexibility around the timing of that next rate review to include the wind. Couple of things to note related to your question. I mean, our last rate update was in April of 2017 it was based on a 3/31/16 test year with the true up to 12/31/16. So it has been a few years. And of course the PISA that we began to use late in 2018 again didn't apply to any rate base infrastructure investments made before that date. So those types of things would be picked up in this base rate increase.  With regard to your sort of prospective question on the wind assets. I mean you're right, the PISA and RESRAM will allow investors to make sure that their whole in terms of the return on the wind, but as you might recall, both the cash and the recognition of a full equity return will not be recognized until after a subsequent rate review. So including those wind assets in a rate review will be important in that regard."
"That was very clear. I appreciate it. I guess just on ﬁnancing the plan, I mean, I think everyone saw Moody's come out with a lower ﬂoated debt target at the parent. Has this changed your equity need for the wind CapEx at all in your mind?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah. Nick, thanks again for that question. So look at bottom line answer to your question is no, we still feel like the ﬁnancing plans, we talked about on the second quarter call are appropriate you recall that as it relates to equity that includes issuing equity through our dividend reinvestment employee beneﬁt plans over the course of the next ﬁve years it's about 100 million per year. And then also incremental common equity issuance to fund a portion of our ultimate total wind investment. And so those are the plans that we have, and we're going to stick with those. I appreciate your question about the Moody's action though, it's just one consideration amongst the number when we think about ﬁnancing our business going forward.  We are pleased with the action Moody's took. For those on the call -- recall that our Ameren Corp. issuer rating at S&P is a BBB plus with a stable outlook there, we have an FFO to debt threshold of 13%. At Moody's we have a Baa1 issuer rating with -- also with a stable outlook. And there's where, as Nick points out, Moody's lowered the threshold on the cash ﬂows from operations pre-working capital to total debt. They lowered that threshold from 19% to 17%. So we are pleased the Moody's took that action, we believe it brings us that threshold closer in line with our peers and certainly it does provide us some more ﬂexibility with regard to ﬁnancing within that range.  But again, it's just one consideration that we think about, when we look at ﬁnancing the business we've always look to maintain very strong balance sheets on our call in February, we said, one of our expectations over the next ﬁve years, was to be able to maintain capitalization structure similar to those that existed at year-end and as existed March 31 and we seek to make sure that as we carry out these infrastructure investments, including the wind, that we position those for success in the regulatory proceedings that follow. So there are a lot of things we take into consideration, but bottom line is, we expect the ﬁnancing plan we laid out in February to continue to be our plan going forward."
"Hey, thanks a lot. I'll leave it there. Congrats on the strong quarter.","Thanks, Nick. Have a good day.  Operator  Our next question comes from line of Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, good morning. Just one question on the wind investments, maybe just a quick update on beyond the 700   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   megawatts that you guys plan to have by the end of 2020. Has your strategy or outlook changed on the incremental megawatts through the 2023, planning horizon?","Good morning, Insoo. How are you doing? Appreciate the question. This is Warner. No, no the bottom line is no. As we said before, we are focused on obtaining at least 700 megawatts of additional wind generation. As I said on the call a moment ago, we continue to negotiate with developers for that additional wind generation. And we remain conﬁdent in our ability not only to negotiate successfully with those developers, but also to move through the regulatory approval process and get the facilities constructed in a timely fashion.  So while we like to point to 700 megawatts I mean, we're very pleased with the fact that as we sit here today. We have 557 megawatts not only negotiated but approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission. So Michael Moehn and his team have worked eﬀectively with stakeholders to get those deals across the ﬁnish line from an approval perspective. So we look forward to bringing more to the Missouri Public Service Commission in the future. Keeping in mind as you I'm sure, understand, that trying to ﬁnd projects that ﬁt just nicely into 700 megawatts that just is not likely just because products so come in sort of bite sizes and so. As we look forward -- we'll look forward to the next deal to get done in a timely fashion and get it across the ﬁnish line."
"Yeah, that's clear. And then in terms of the rate case ﬁling. Beyond this rate case cycle and given the diﬀerent mechanisms you do have in place like PISA and RESRAM, is it -- should we expect the next timing of the Missouri rate case to be at least two to three years down the line to meet the every four year requirement or could we see a potential ﬁling sooner than that.","Yeah, this is Marty again, look, I mean we'd like to have as much time as possible between rate case ﬁlings, as I mentioned, it's this next one, we plan to ﬁle this next rate review in July, would represent three years between the last one and this one and is somewhat being driven by the infrastructure investments made prior to PISA, but also driven by, as I mentioned earlier, the expected timing of our wind investments and the timing of the next rate case.  So, I wouldn't read anything into that other than what we've laid out in terms of future cycles or periods of time between cases. Again we said many times that the fuel adjustment clause does require us to ﬁle for rate reviews at least every four years. So I would say four years or less, but we'd like to make the period as great as possible, frankly."
Understood. Thank you very much.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Our next question comes line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.,"Good morning, Paul."
"Just on Illinois. As you know, there's a legislation -- there's lot of legislative activity, I guess, going on there [00:27:55] utilities and non-utilities or budgetary related kind of issues. And I'm just wondering sort of how you see the politics sort of working there, procedurally? And whether or not the EIMA extension bill might get wrapped in with others? Or just sort of how you see all that stuﬀ sort of unfolding? And sort of just in general the -- I know you guys don't own generation in Illinois, but just how you look at the capacity procurement legislation vis-a-vis potential -- just how it might inﬂuence you or just your thoughts on that, if you'd like to opine on that?","Sure, Paul. This is Warner, and I invite Richard Mark to add anything after I oﬀer some of these comments. Look, I'm talking about the EIMA provision -- or the modernization act that we've been talking about that I referred to in my talking points, but we certainly can't predict what happens here over the next several weeks. But the only thing we can say about that legislation is that it has produced signiﬁcant beneﬁts for all stakeholders, our customers, the state of Illinois and certainly our shareholders and I've outlined those beneﬁts in terms of reliability, aﬀordability, job creation and really driving a more modernized grid in Illinois. So as a result, when we think about what might happen here over the next several weeks. The fact that, that legislation or that policy has been so strong and has been extended twice, that puts us in a good position. We believe for legislators to take notice that this is something that we want to continue. And so, I think this is why you saw the strong votes in the committee, and Rich and his team, done a great job with many other stakeholders to position two bills, one in the house, one in the Senate to move forward.  So we can't predict right now where they stand. They stand with nothing else on them. And certainly, we will -- hopefully, that will -- the way that will continue here over the next several weeks. As you said before, you're right, there are several legislative proposals in Illinois that relate to what I would call energy policy. And look, I think, our vested interest in all of those bills is what the impact could be on our customers. And so we're at the table working with stakeholders to make sure that our customers best interest are being looked out for. Now I'm not going to comment on any particular piece of legislation at this point. Yes, there is certainly legislation out there related to the capacity markets related principally to Exelon, but it's just -- it's too uncertain to see just exactly where they may or may not go here over the next several weeks and/or in a veto session. So, Richard, I highlighted at a very high level. Is there anything else that you would like to add?      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thanks, Warner. I thought you covered it really good, but I would just add that as you said the policymakers have seen this legislation twice. Many of them have voted on extending it twice. They've seen the job creation that formula rates have brought to the state of Illinois and the value of it. So they're familiar with it and I think that's a beneﬁt as they look at it going forward.     I agree. Thank you."
"But let's just say for whatever reason because there are lots of, I mean, going beyond the merits of the legislation, just if it does for whatever reason, shocking or not, that it may be that they don't get to this session, if it goes to the veto session or next, could it be addressed -- is there any timing issue that we should be concerned about if it doesn't get past this legislation? I mean this session...","Yes, Paul. So look I think as I said, this legislative session ends on May 31. And so as you know in Illinois it is possible that legislation can be passed during the veto session. And so while that's the case look I'll tell you that Rich and his team are focused on getting this important legislation passed this legislative session not the veto session. And so for all the reasons before we were hopeful that that will happen. And if it gets to the veto session look we'll just cross that bridge if and when we come to it, but right now we're very focused on getting this across the line this veto session by May 31."
"Okay. Great. And then just on the Missouri rate case. Can you give us any sort of rough sense as to how much you might be seeking or just -- I mean, I know it's early, but you guys have ﬁled notice. It's going to be a couple of months before we're going to get the full details, but is there any rough sense you want to give to us as to what the impact can be on that?","Paul, this is Marty. No. We'll make that ﬁling and let it speak for itself. I mean I think we gave you some of the broad outline of what it will include which is not only the increased rate base and infrastructure investments over the past few years and changes in cost of service, but also noted that it will also incorporate in the base rates the lower coal and transportation costs which we've begun to realize over the past year. And so those are some of the broad things that will be included but no further speciﬁcity at this time."
"Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Thanks, Paul.  Operator   Our next question comes from the line of Greg Rice from Sun Tanis [ph]. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi, guys. Congrats on a good call. Most of my questions have been answered. Just really quickly this rate case is it going to include the wind the 557 megawatts?","Greg, it's Marty. No, it would not. I mean again that's -- I mentioned it as the key consideration because in this case it won't. The wind won't be included in the rate review until it's actually in service. And so it's a key consideration on why we're ﬁling now to provide ﬂexibility in terms of the next rate review to be able to pick up that wind investment once it's placed in service which again we expect to be in late 2020.     Yes. I would just note -- this is Michael Moehn. I mean the true-up period with respect to this case assuming it's ﬁled in July would be most likely through the end of 2019."
Gotcha. Perfect. And then just any update on kind of how negotiations are going on the incremental wind?,"So, Michael, I noted -- this is Warner, I noted a little bit before that we're negotiating with developers. And any particular insights you want to oﬀer at this point in time?     No. I'll just echo what you said is that we remain conﬁdent that we're going to get this done. We're very focused on it, making good progress and very focused on making sure that we meet the renewable standard by the end of 2020.     And to your point, look, I think Mike and his team have been working very hard to make sure we get the best deal for our customers, right? This is why we want to make sure we're thoughtful about it. Of course, we're mindful of 2020 and we're conﬁdent getting that done. We want to get the best deal for our customers and so that's exactly what we're doing.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Perfect. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan from Verition. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning, Mr. Ashar."
"Hi. How are you doing, Warner? Good earnings.",Thank you.
"Can I just ask you -- just wanted to -- you laid down the factors for the remaining three quarters. So, can you just talk a little bit about the O&M? O&M was to be a little bit lower this year, Marty, and I wanted to check how that went versus the ﬁrst quarter? Or are most of those savings going to come in the last three quarters?","Yeah. Ashar, thanks for the question. You're absolutely right. So we guided at the beginning of the year when we talked about 2019 that excluding the impacts of the Callaway refueling and maintenance outage that we expected lower operations and maintenance expenses about $0.05 year-over-year from 2018 to 2019. And Ashar, we're tracking well against that expectation. You will recall that last year some of those higher O&M costs did come in the latter part of the year associated with some outages at non-nuclear plants as well as other costs. So my recollection is those were kind of back-end loaded last year but we are on track to achieve that $0.05 year-over-year improvement."
