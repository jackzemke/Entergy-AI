Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy.     Good morning."
"Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for all the detail there. And I just want to pick up on the MISO MTEP side. I was just wondering if you might be able to provide any more color for your expectations there in the process and what could this speciﬁcally mean for Ameren over time, realizing might be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here, but just want to know if there's any way you could frame, I guess, what you think could be possible for Ameren CapEx here?","Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy, for the question. Number one, let me just start with this. We're very excited about the opportunity that we have for the transmission investment. Number one, we're absolutely convinced that transmission is going to play an integral role. And that's a fair company for our country and really executing this clean energy transition.  And we're right in the middle of it. We have been before, and we are going to continue to be. And so look, it's premature to put, I would say, a speciﬁc number. As you heard us in our prepared remarks, MISO has identiﬁed $30 billion to $100 billion of investment opportunities of potential projects. And I will tell you, where the country is going is closer to that scenario three, which is closer to the $100 billion number.  So what we're doing, what MISO is doing, what stakeholders are doing. Look, we're working together to try and make sure that we put together a good set of projects coming out of this ﬁrst NTAP that will start us on this path towards this clean energy transition. And as we look at it, if you look at that scenario one that's highlighted out there, we really think the focus will be on more no regrets types of projects as we start putting our toes in the water, if you will, maybe   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   getting up to our knees. And then from there, I think we'll see it continue to get progressively bigger over time. We think there'll be some no regress [ph] projects. And in terms of timing, look, I think the group -- our group and many stakeholders are working collaboratively to try and ﬁgure out the best projects as well as cost allocation things. These things are all things that you typically go through in this process.  And so at the end of the day, we think that MISO will propose early in 2022, these projects to their Board of Directors, it will be well informed. And then what we believe will be -- hopefully, will be an approval process that will get them in early 2022. So when you look at them in our overall plans, as we've said before, you might see some of these projects in our current ﬁve- year plan start coming into play towards the back end of our ﬁve-year plan. But certainly, in the second half of this decade, I think you're going to see a signiﬁcant emphasis and need for transmission projects.  So that's really what I can tell you today. But as I'll ﬁnish the way I started there, we're excited about the opportunity because we think it's signiﬁcant and important."
Got it. That's helpful. We eagerly await there.,We do as well.
Maybe just pivoting over to the Missouri IRP here. Just wondering if you could share with us thoughts on next steps and I guess how Rush Island plays into it? What we should be thinking about there?,"Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy. Marty Lyons has been in the middle of all those things. I'm going to turn it over to him to respond to your questions. Marty, go ahead.     Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy. Hey, how are you today? Appreciate the question. As it relates to the Integrated Resource Plan, obviously, we ﬁled last fall and as Warner said earlier in the prepared remarks, we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to several projects that would ﬁt within that 1,200 megawatts of clean energy that we plan to deliver over the next several years, consistent with that integrated resource plan. So we're continuing to work on those, and we still expect to ﬁle with the commission still this year for approval of a portion of those projects. So that work is going on.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And then you mentioned the Rush Island Energy Center. And so as you saw in our slides today, in August, the Court Of Appeals aﬃrmed District Court's September 19 order. As we said in our slides and prepared remarks, we did ﬁle for a rehearing of that decision on October 18. So we do expect to hear back from the court and quite likely by the end of this year, we expect in terms of that rehearing. So it's really premature to say what action we will take with respect to Rush Island at this point. We'll wait to see whether there's a rehearing. But that rehearing is denied and ultimately, we're faced with that decision. Obviously, it may entail scrubbers at Rush Island or the accelerated retirement of that plant, which might also include the utilization, the securitization, legislation was passed earlier this year.  So those are some of the things we're looking at, considerations as we think about those alternatives or things like customer rate impacts, replacement generation needs and importantly, reliability in investments that may be required in terms of transmission to the extent that Rush Island were to be prematurely retired. So those are some of the considerations. I'll tell you this. If ultimately a decision is made to retire Rush Island prematurely versus the date we had in our prior Integrated Resource Plan that will require them that we ﬁle an updated Integrated Resource Plan with Missouri Public Service Commission.  So stay tuned on that. Like I said, it's premature to say how all of that will turn out, but that gives you a little bit of color on the potential path forward."
"Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And just one last quick one, if I could. Just wondering if you might be able to comment on your generation position and do you see any potential customer beneﬁts under current market conditions right now?","Hey, Jeremy. It's Michael. Yeah, I think we indicated in the prepared remarks in the slide that we historically have been long in the Missouri side. And so obviously, to the extent that we're able to take advantage of that in the marketplace, its oﬀ-systems sales rate ﬂow back to customers through the Fuel Adjustment Clause. So certainly, given where natural gas prices are, which is what the impact it's having on power prices, it's deﬁnitely a bit of a tailwind from a customer aﬀordability standpoint."
Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you.,"Thanks, Jeremy. See you next week."
See you then.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please state your question.,"Good morning, Julien. How are you doing?"
"Hey, good morning. This is Dariusz on for Julien actually. Thank you for taking my question. First one is, can you just clarify, it was a little unclear from the opening remarks. Do you intend -- or are you still evaluating whether or not you'll ﬁle under a multi-year rate plan in Illinois in or before January '23?","Yeah. So, this is Warner. So let me just summarize what we've said. Clearly, as I said and as Michael said, we think this is a forward-thinking, constructive regulatory structure. And not only is it constructive that enables us to make investments that we think are important for customers, but also gives us the opportunity to earn a fair return on those investments.  Now what we said, too, is that the structure is out there, but there's still some work to be done, meaning that there are workshops that have to be taken care of next year, as you might have with any speciﬁc and comprehensive piece of legislation and we're going to work through those workshops.  Now we believe those workshops were at the table, and we expect them to be constructive outcomes. And so as a result, as we said, too, we anticipate ﬁling for a multi-year rate plan in 2023. But there's still some work to be done. And so we're not trying to hedge or be cute [ph] with this, sort of telling it like it is. But at the same time, as I said, we think it's a constructive piece of legislation that we think will bring beneﬁts to our customers in state of Illinois and certainly to our shareholders.  Michael, do you have anything you want to add?     Look, you said it all correctly. I mean these workshops will continue on through '22. And I think we'll have a conclusion of them by the fall. So we'll have even better clarity. But as Warner said, the beneﬁts clearly seem to be pretty signiﬁcant here in terms of just the overall framework itself and so.      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah. And just to give you a perspective, these workshops as you know, we talk about performance metrics. There's a performance-based ratemaking perspective and concept incorporated in this legislation. So the performance metrics have to be determined, how you work through some of the details of the multiyear rate plan. These are things that stakeholders have to come to the table. And we look forward to working collaboratively with all of them next year."
"Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful color. And if I could pivot maybe to federal legislation, if I can. Have you quantiﬁed at all or thought about the potential upside impact on your credit metrics from direct pay, if that were included in ﬁnal legislation?","Yeah, Thanks. Needless to say, that is a very ﬂuid situation just in the bigger picture. And so to say that we've quantiﬁed, in particular, the speciﬁc impacts that would be premature. I will say there are elements of the clean energy tax incentives, which I think are very good, very good for customers and could be good for cash ﬂows, especially when you look at the direct pay portions around, certainly, the ITCs and the PTCs that you have for wind and solar (inaudible) entire tax incentives. So Michael, I know that you and your team have been looking at it, but we don't -- we haven't put a speciﬁc ﬁnger on it, but do you want to add a little more color than that?     Yeah, I mean, at a high level, that's correct, Warner. I mean we are -- they get into it. I think there are some positive aspects. There are also some things that we got to just get our hands around -- head around with respect to like this minimum tax liability, which seems to run counter to some those credits as well. So those are just some diﬀerent aspects that we're really trying to balance at the end of the day. But hopefully, over the course of the next quarter or so, we'll have a much better feel for where this is going.     One thing you can rest assured is that me and my industry colleagues, we're at the table to try and make sure that we get a constructive piece of federal legislation down across the Board that will enable us to continue to move forward thoughtfully and eﬀectively with the clean energy transition."
Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on from there.,"You bet. Thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.     Good morning, Insoo. How are you doing?"
"Good morning, Warner. How are you? My ﬁrst question is on -- the question on the Rush Island and the long-term generation plan if the appeal process is unsuccessful. First of all, is it by the end of '23 that you need to either put those scrubbers on or retire? Or is it '24? And then my -- the related question to that is, as you think about potential changes to the plan if this had to shut early, given that long generation position, how do we think about some of the opportunities on the replacement side of things?","Hey, Marty, why don't you jump on in and then address that one, please?     Yeah. Thanks, Insoo. And hey, good to talk to you again. With respect to moving forward with scrubber, I think there, the expectation is that we would -- if we went that route, move as expeditiously as possible to put the scrubbers in place at Rush Island. So not sure that there's an exact timeline. Obviously, the acquisition design, construction would take some time to get that put in place.  And then with respect to the other route that you described, the retirement route, I think there, we'd be looking at how long Rush Island would continue to operate, obviously, given the things I talked about before, replacement generation needs, importantly, reliability issues around the system in the event of a premature retirement, which again may necessitate some transmission investments in order to maintain reliability.  So all of those things would be taken into consideration. And ultimately, to the extent that incremental generation was required or some acceleration of the clean energy transition that we've got laid out in our IRP, that would all be laid out in that updated Integrated Resource Plan. So again, if we don't move forward with the scrubber, if we do decide that the Rush Island needs to be shut down earlier than the date in our IRP, which was 2039, then we would move forward with an update to the Integrated Resource Plan. And again, and so that would assess all of the potential adjustments to generation need and timing that were laid out in that prior September Integrated Resource Plan ﬁling."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Thanks for the color, Marty. The second question is on the grid 2021 guidance raising that by $0.10 and as we think about the '22, I know some of the weather beneﬁt helped this year as well. But how do we think about some of the moving pieces that help '21 that could potentially carry into '22? And in that consideration slide, I didn't see a speciﬁc mention to year-over-year low [ph] growth just curious on your base assumption there.","Hey. Yeah, look, there's a lot in that question there. Let me give you a couple of pieces in just in terms of the growth itself. I mean year-to-date, we've put in there from a residential standpoint, we're up 1.5%, commercial 3.5% and industrial 1%. So about 2%, and that's really what we guided to at the beginning of the year in February. Now the mix is a little bit diﬀerent. So we're seeing some improvement in margin there, which is a driver of that increase in the midpoint that you talked about in addition to weather.  So we -- the plan remains on track with respect to that sales piece, that 2%, we see that sort of guiding in at the same point towards the end of the year. As we talked about at the beginning of the year, that will get us close to being back to 2019, but not quite. So I think the recovery continues, and we're optimistic about how we continue to see things open up here in both of our service territories in Missouri and Illinois.  With respect to the guidance itself, I just remind you again, we released in February of last year, that 6% to 8% guidance was oﬀ of that midpoint. Obviously, at $375 million, that original midpoint of $375 million. We certainly have given you some select items to think about here in '22. And then obviously, in February, we'll roll all this forward to give you another look at capital as well as give you just more speciﬁcs about obviously, where our range will be in our earnings guidance for '22 at that point in time. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color you're looking for."
Got it. Thank you and congrats Marty and Warner both of you and see you soon.,"Congrats [ph], Insoo.     Thanks, Insoo. See you next week.  Operator  Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.       Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Good morning, Durgesh."
"Hey, good morning, Warner. Congratulations and...",Thank you.
"For [ph] you as well, Marty. Look forward to working with you. Just -- maybe just can you talk about the 1.2 gigawatts in Missouri IRP? Just kind of what of that -- what -- how many -- what portion of that capacity are you going to ﬁle for with the commission or get approvals for this year or early next year? Just as you're thinking about your CapEx plan being extended another year, I'm thinking about how much of that 1.2 gigawatt might be layered in?","Sure. You bet. Marty, why don't you come on in and address that from an operational perspective, and maybe Michael, you can talk about how we think about guidance in terms of capital expenditures and those types of things.     Yeah, that sounds great, Warner. Durgesh, I appreciate the question. The -- and I think Michael will get into this and expand on it, none of that 1,200 megawatts is really included today in the rate base growth or earnings guidance we have. As I said earlier, we continue to work with multiple developers with respect to multiple projects that would go towards ﬁlling out that 1,200 megawatts. At this point, as we negotiate through those, I mean it's important to understand that those negotiations take time. There's diligence involved. There's again, multiple developers we're working with really to get the best deals we can for our customers ultimately, and there are multiple contracts that need to be negotiated with each one of the developers.  So we continue to work, again, with multiple of them on multiple projects. And at this point, I'd say again, I'd say we're expecting to ﬁle for approval for a portion of that 1,200 megawatts. I expect that will happen this year still, but also then even further into next year. So stay tuned. I think it's premature to say exactly which project or projects we'll announce this year or early next, but we're working actively on several. So that's where we stand today.     Thanks, Marty. And just a couple of other small points on that $17 billion plan that we have out there, as Marty pointed out, there's very, very little in there with respect to any of these renewable projects. Now we did indicate in that 10-year plan, that $40 billion-plus, there is $3 billion of potential projects, which what Marty is referring to.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So as we get more clarity on that timing, obviously, typically, what we do in February as we roll forward that capital plan, to be able to give you a bit more transparency about what the timing of that to the extent that we feel better about it and know it. So that's just a little bit more color on exactly what's there from a capital standpoint."
"I appreciate that detail. Then just shifting gears to Illinois, Obviously, now the -- under the new framework, the ROE goes back to the ICC and they kind of come back with an ROE number. Just any early thoughts on how might they be calculating that? I mean we and investors have talked about sort of your gas assets there and the ROEs they're getting in 9%-plus range. Just any -- from your seat, just any early color into what ROE might look like or how might that be calculated? I appreciate that. Thank you.","Sure, this is Warner. Look, Look, it'd certainly be premature to predict where the ROEs would be. I mean the ﬁling is going to be sometime in 2023, and it's a multi-year ﬁling. But what we can point to is, obviously, the 580 basis points, puts a 30-year treasury, what that yields today. What we can point to is that in our gas business that we did at the beginning of this year, put in place, say, the rate review results, that was a 9.67% return on equity for our gas business.  It's not the electric business, but it's the gas business. It is just a data point. But how that will ultimately look and what the request will be for a multiyear rate plan, and a lot of facts and circumstances will go into that. But we do see an opportunity for improvement, clearly, from our existing return on equity going forward.     Yeah. I mean -- and just think about that 9.67% is kind of traditional cost of capital kind of calculations. There's nothing that's sort of unique about it from a regulatory perspective. So it's obviously diﬀerent than moving away from this formulaic piece that we have.     Exactly. And we would expect the overall process and looking at that return on equity in terms of sort of a traditional look would be very similar. But obviously, with the multi-year rate plan, there may be some other factors that have come into us. So stay tuned."
All right. Will leave it there. Thanks guys.,"You bet. Thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please state your question.     Good morning, Paul."
Good morning. How are you doing?,I'm good. How are you?
"Okay. So what I wanted to -- ﬁrst of all, I want to congratulate you guys. Is this your last call, Warner?","Never mind. Thank you. I'm truly excited about the new leadership structure and certainly the new roles that Marty and I are taking in. And in terms of the last call, gosh, we're taking one step at a time. We're not saying this is my last call or anything like that. We'll take that one step at a time. But you can (inaudible) maybe in the EEI next week. That's for sure."
"Okay. Well, congratulations.",Thank you.
"Both of you. And so just some -- most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of quick ones for you. And I apologize for not knowing this, but what are no regrets projects? I just don't get -- that grew [ph] blank. What does that mean?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   It's probably a Warner term of art [ph], right? So really, when you look at all these projects, I mean, some you can sit there and say, gosh, when we had to get -- we're having these congestion areas when we had to get from point A to point B, we have these projects that are in the queue, there are certain of these regional projects, which really satisfy a lot of those transmission -- or excuse me, renewable energy projects that are in the queue.  And you do the analysis and you sit there and say, gosh, no one could be -- no one, we shouldn't say that. It would be hard for people to argue that this isn't a project that isn't going to be signiﬁcantly beneﬁcial to the MISO footprint, frankly, to our country. So I can't put those as no regrets, low risk, let's call them that way. Lower-risk projects relatively speaking, compared to some that may have more complications. And so when you look at that scenario one, we think from our perspective, right, beauty's in the (inaudible) holder, but from our perspective, and we think there are several of those in there that need to be -- that need to move forward.  So that's what I mean. We haven't outlined which of those that we believe are there, and this is part of the collaborative process that we go through with MISO and other key stakeholders. But that's how we think. Really lower risk is probably a better term to characterize those projects as."
"Okay. Fair enough. And then sort of a technical question. There was this discovery dispute in the Missouri rate case on the Smart Energy Plan. And it look to me like basically, they did it to address in their testimony or rebuttal or what have you. And I just wanted to make sure, has that really been resolved? It just wasn't clear to me from what they were saying, they didn't really seem to address it and the revenue requirement everything didn't seem to penalize you or anything for the recommendation. So my question is, has that issue been taken care of?","Paul, it's Marty. I can't say whether it's been fully taken care of everybody's satisfaction. I will tell you this, we do look to work constructively with all the parties in these rate reviews to get everybody the information they need in a timely basis to make decisions.  And to your point, do not believe it's an active issue in terms of a quantiﬁed diﬀerence between our position and the positions of others in the case. So hopefully, we have resolved that issue fully. But like you said, it's not manifesting itself today in any kind of diﬀerence between the parties."
"Okay. Great. And then ﬁnally, back to the 2024 question, I realize it's very early, but it does seem like a big opportunity with respect to the Illinois legislation. And I'm just wondering when you guys might incorporate it the potential outlook with it into your long-term guidance. I mean it doesn't sound like it will be anything immediate, but I was just wondering, could it be a year from now or so that you guys would feel more comfortable talking about its potential beneﬁt impact to the long-term growth outlook? Or would you be basically waiting until I guess, whenever the 2023 decision was made kind of, so to speak?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Sure. Yeah, Paul, this is Warner. It's a fair question. We'll provide a lot more guidance, right, on that speciﬁc question and others when we come with our longer-term guidance in February. We'll give you our view, right, on how we think about the guidance that we set in and how we think about regulatory frameworks and all those types of things.  So we [ph] sit here today, obviously, nothing to change, nothing to talk about other than as we've said, we think it's a constructive piece of legislation that we anticipate assuming that things go well in the workshops, so we would ﬁle for a multi-year rate plan. How we embed that into our long-term guidance in early 2022? Stay tuned. We'll be able to provide more detail on that."
"Okay. Awesome. Well, thanks so much and congratulations again and have a great one.","Thanks, Paul. You do the same.  Operator  Thanks. And our next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe. Please state your question.     Hello, David. How are you doing?"
"Hey, Warner. How are you doing? Congratulations on both you and Marty.","Thank you.     Thanks, David.     Thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"I just want to follow up on a couple of quick questions. Just the following up on the 1,200 megawatt maybe lots of Missouri question. I understand the spend is not in your stated outlook, ﬁnancial outlook, but is any of the equity for that investment in your ﬁnancing plan?","Hey, David, this is Michael. No, I mean that $17 billion plan again out there. The equity that we talked about back in February really supports that $17 billion plan. And it's again sort of there by default that win is not in there, there's no equity in there for [ph]."
"Got it. And then in an earlier question, Michael, did you say that you would be going forward your growth rate oﬀ of 2022 guidance or 2021 actuals when you were talking about the February update?","Yeah. I was just referring to last February, David, when we gave the 6% to 8% earnings per share growth guidance, it was oﬀ of that midpoint of $375 million. And so that's where people should continue to stay focused. We obviously gave you some '22 select items here to think about in the third quarter, and then we'll obviously roll forward stuﬀ and give you a speciﬁc guidance in February of '22."
"I see. Okay. Great. And maybe just a last question, I guess Marty, can you provide an update maybe on just how settlement talks are going in the rate case or whether they're still going?","Yeah. Thanks, David. The settlement talks really get going here over the next couple of weeks. We actually have, as we laid out in the slide, Surrebuttal Testimony that's actually due Friday. So I think all the parties are focused on that. And then soon after that, the parties will be pulling together reconciliations of the diﬀerences between our case and the updated positions of the staﬀ, in particular, but also other parties.  And then settlement discussions will get underway. As you know, again, is our -- right now, the evidence or hearings are really scheduled to begin right after Thanksgiving on November 29. So my expectation is that starting next week and all the way through that time period, there'll be settlement discussions, hopefully, to narrow the issues and if possible, to resolve the entire case. Obviously, we have been successful in settling a number of cases that we've had over the past several years, including the last rate review. So we certainly expect to work towards that goal. And like I said, those discussions will really be happening between now and likely the beginning of those evidentiary hearings.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Great. Thank you so much.,"Thanks, David. See you next week.  Operator  Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. So, I'll now turn the call back over to Andrew Kirk for closing remarks.     Thank you for participating in this call. A replay of this call will be available for one year on our website. If you have questions, you may call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Financial inquiries should be directed to me, Andrew Kirk. Media should call Tony Paraino. Again, thank you for your interest in Ameren and looking forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect.
