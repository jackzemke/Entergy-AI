Question,Answer
Good morning.,"Good Morning. How are you doing, sir?"
"Good. Good. Thank you. Just want to see how you think about the Missouri securitization legislation as a tool for transitioning the ﬂeet. Just wondering if any thought you have there. Are there any particular reasons, it could be more or less attractive for you to use versus kind of other considerations we should be thinking about?","Thanks, Jeremy. Look, as we've said before, we've said securitization is -- it is a great regulatory tool, and one that we don't see is necessary to execute an integrated resource plan, but certainly, a great regulatory tool. So, in the big picture, as we go down the path, if we see changes in policies, change in economic conditions or really the overall economics for renewables. Perhaps, we'll look at securitization as a tool to use. But right now, we're very comfortable and like our integrated resource plan. And I'll compliment Marty Lyons and his team, really did a nice job working with stakeholders to get that across the ﬁnish line. And so, Marty watch a come on in and see if you have any additional comments on the securitization tool that we have available to us.     Yes, Warner, well you describe it very well, and Jeremy, thanks for the question. We outlined on Slide 25, our transition over time, it's the integrated resource plan that we ﬁled last fall, and as Warner mentioned, that plan and the execution of that plan will not depend utilization of securitization. And really what you see there is our plan as it stands today is that these are low- cost reliable call it -- foundation to bring in more renewables over time and provide reliable power to our customers. But as Warner said, to extent situations change and require adjustments with this plan, it could be with securitization, it would be very good tool to have in   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   our toolbox, to perhaps make this transition more swiftly, and do it in the way that provides aﬀordable rates to our customers. So, I think a very good tool to have in your toolbox, but again not needed today as we're looking through the integrated resource plan."
"Great. That's a really helpful color there. Maybe just kind of shifting gears here. Have you seen any developments in MISO as work progresses toward year-end project updates there? Just wondering if you might be able to expand a bit more, I guess, your thoughts there and what that could mean for Ameren?","Sure. Thanks, Jeremy. And look, as we discussed really on our last quarter call, and as we talked about in our prepared remarks. We really see transmission investment as being critical for our country's transition to a cleaner energy future, and certainly MISO being right in the middle of the country, it's going to play an integral role. And obviously, we have a big footprint in MISO.  And so, as we looked at it, MISO has really done a ﬁne job from our perspective. And we're really looking out to see what some of those long-range transmission projects might be. They're not deﬁnitive yet, but they've laid out a real nice plan for us to really think about and work with key stakeholders. And that's exactly what we've been. Working with other key stakeholders and say, okay, what are these projects that we need to move forward with. I will say, MISO is still in the middle of that process with us and so many others. And as you know, they'll take that long- range plan that we outlined in our slides, and they're going to put and include aspects of that of our thinking, and MISO's transmission expansion plan, which is a process that we'll hopefully see move forward by the end of this year.  So, beyond that, I would say, the I would say, the conversations, the analysis continues. The only thing I will say is that we believe we are well position to execute any of those projects. And we believe, if you look at that future, one, that some of those projects are going to likely be in this -- that comes out here, in this year or perhaps maybe in the early next year. Because those are some no regrets projects that are in there that we need to move forward on not just in the Mid- West but for our country, so we can move forward on this clean energy transition. So, nothing speciﬁc yet. But needless to say, there is a lot of work going on around with the teams, to try and move forward on this important aspect of the clean energy transition. So, stay tuned. More to come."
Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that I'll leave it there.,"Thanks, Jeremy. Have a good weekend."
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  You too.  Operator   Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning Paul. Good morning. How are you? And we're all good here.
"Good to here. So, just a follow-up on Jeremy's question on the MTEP process, and the transmission opportunities are still pretty exciting. One of the questions I guess which sort of comes up here is, as you are aware that in Missouri, there's this clean energy line, I forgot the exact name, but you are familiar with that. It's the one that's been held up by challenges to it, but it seems like forever. It is not your line; it is more like a merchant line. But in general, how should we think about one MISO has sort of identiﬁed these, etcetera, bringing those -- assuming that you guys get a good line of sight on opportunities for yourself. How should we think about sizing or permitting, etcetera? Would we expect to sell these projects in the context of the example that I mentioned, versus some of the addons and stuﬀ that don't seem to have as much in the way of hurdles. Do you follow what I'm saying?","Paul. A bit complicated. So, let me tell you, it's Grain Belt is the name of the line that you're referring to."
"Right. That's it. So, I think that's (Inaudible)","Yes. And so, I'll make a couple of comments and then Marty, you can talk about how the green project has been incorporated, and in some respects, really comment upon our integrated resource plan. But just big picture, whether it's the Grain Belt or any transmission, obviously, permitting and signing, is an important aspect of transmission. I think this is why you're seeing FERC and others, state commissions and others, and legislators, take a very careful look at this because we recognize that, that's an important aspect of getting any of these major transmission projects done, and some signiﬁcant transmission projects are going to have be done to, ﬁrst to aﬀect the clean energy transition.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   And so one of the things I will tell you, we work very hard as a company at this, and have been very thoughtful in reaching out with stakeholders in the communities early and often, to talk about the needs for the transmission line but also how we can work with those stakeholders in those communities, so we can get the permitting and signing done in a timely fashion. Shawn Schukar and his team have done that for years and years now. And this is why you've seen the success that we had in the last multi-value projects that MISO did almost a decade ago, now, those projects were so successful, is because a lot of work was done on the front end, so we could execute on the back end. As we look forward to any future transmission project, that's exactly what we will continue to do.  Now Grain Belt, obviously, as you rightfully said, that is not our project, but certainly something that has received a lot of attention in Missouri and otherwise. And so, Marty, why don't you comment a little bit about some of the things that we've been looking at, in terms of Grain Belt as part of our integrated resource planning process.     Yes. Sure, Warner. Happy to comment. So, and I mentioned on our integrated resource plan, we ﬁled this --. And again, back on the Slide 25 where we depict our plan, that's really our preferred plan from the integrated resource plan as we move forward. But as we develop that plan, we looked at a number of scenarios in terms of the path forward to get to what people think to be the most reliable, aﬀordable path forward. And in this scenario, certainly we evaluated utilization of Grain Belt as well as many other kinds of scenarios, and where we stand right now in terms of our integrated resource plan.  As we all know, we did put out a request for proposals last year on various resources that might be available to fulﬁll our needs, and obviously our ambition is to acquire 1,200 megawatts of renewables, wind, solar, to 2025, and we do still expect to ﬁle later this year with the PSC, for certiﬁcates which could be a necessity for a portion of those planned projects. But as we go through broadly looking at just the next ﬁve years but even beyond, certainly, we will continue to consider all options including utilization of Grain Belt as we think about fulﬁlling those needs.  In terms of your question Paul, I think you're asking about large-scale transmission, smaller-scale transmission. As we go about looking at the various resources that might fulﬁll our needs, certainly we work closely with Shawn and his team, and think very much about the transmission investments that will be required to facilitate investment in any of those projects whether wind or solar, and it's an important part of our consideration as we think about the resources that would be most aﬀordable for our customers."
"Okay, great. And then just ﬁnally on Illinois. I mean, you mentioned in your remarks, and I'm just sort of -- Do you have any sense as to whether or not something happens in the next, I guess, couple months here, or -- I mean, you guys are obviously a lot closer to it than I am. I'm just sort of wondering if you had any odds on something in Illinois, what those odds might be for something getting done?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Sure. Thanks, Paul. And I learned long ago, not to make predictions about legislation, and especially in this particular case, it's a complex piece of legislation. The only thing I can say is what I've said before and I'll say again. Richard Mark and his team, they've been working tirelessly for many months now with key stakeholders to try and forge a path forward that is a constructive solution, that's going to enable us to make the investments we need to make in the energy grid and earn fair returns in state of Illinois, and in so doing, enhance reliability, create jobs, and help really state of Illinois and our country, move towards a cleaner energy future.  So, all those things are all true. They remain true today, and we continue to be at the table with key stakeholders. But now, I'm not going to make any prediction in terms of time, whether any timing, but rest assured, we're working hard at it, and we're at the table with the key stakeholders to try and get the constructive solution done."
"Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Thanks, Paul. Have a good weekend.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.     Good morning Julien."
Hey good morning team. Thank you for the time and the opportunity. Appreciate it.,Absolutely.     Same to you.
"So, perhaps just let's kick it oﬀ with our favorite subject here, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and perspectives around this June task force, right? You mentioned FERC and Ameren joining forces here, that seems like a fairly potent combination to drive real change, right? So, I'm   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   curious, what do you -- what is the focus here and speciﬁcally, what key issues are you asking them to address right, when it comes to utilities, not HPVC lines with their own challenges and prospects, but from your perspective tangibly, how can they step in and help you all that?","You bet. Well, thanks, Julien. Look, we're encouraged that the federal regulators and state regulators are not only talking, but trying to ﬁnd a path forward. Because as I've said now several times on this call, and transmission is going to be a critical component of getting these major transmission projects done for our country, and so as we all know, that the federal regulators FERC and the state regulators, they are jurisdictions or at least the issues can sometimes overlap. And so, things that are really important all the time. It's how we can sort through permitting and signing.  And clearly, another issue around transmission projects, especially these regional projects which we're talking about in large part with these MISO projects. Now how you allocate the cost fairly and appropriately. And so, what I think Julien, what will happen with some of these conversations, what we hope to have happened is that there's a better understanding of the issues. Perhaps, a bit of a meeting of the minds, and so we can start moving forward in a more timely fashion than we might have otherwise had.  And of course, when we're making the types of investments that we are making, then we want to have, let's say, greater levels of regulatory certainty. And so, these things, I think, will be helpful. I'm not suggesting that, this task force will solve it all. But I think what it will do is provide a great forum for stakeholders. Not just regulators companies like ours and others, to come to the table and say, okay, here are the things that really matter, and here's how we can lean further forward in the transmission space, which we needless to say, strongly support the need to lean forward further, faster, in the transmission space."
"Got it. All right. Fair enough. And then, if I can I mean let's pivot back to your own portfolio here. How are you thinking about transmission interconnect delays cost, etcetera, or just what you think about your own eﬀorts? And then what are you observing regionally, again, clearly the need for transmission is principally evidenced by the elevated cost, the interconnection cost, and but that translate in to a relatively stagnant trajectory of processing this queue. Are you seeing issues with your own projects? And then more broadly, are you seeing these elevated costs with other developers, in and around your service records [ph]. If you will elaborate on that.","Yes. Lots to unpack in there, and so, let me make a few comments. So number one, Marty, a moment ago, was talking about how we proceed to the integrated resource planning process and he also said, key element of the projects that we look at and select really look very hard at transmission interconnections, where developers may be in the queue in try new things forward, and that's frankly, how we were successful in moving in a very thoughtful and timely fashion with our 700 MW of wind generation.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   So, what we're seeing there, this is all part of our due diligence. Are you seeing your sort of a backup? Yes. Are you seeing now, that organizations like MISO are looking beyond just today, their looking to the future with this long-term resource planning eﬀort? The answer to that is, yes, and that's why we support it, and what we believe help alleviate in the future, if you look sort of a decade out, which is really, when you think about transmission projects, you'll look just for tomorrow, you will see a decade out, what are the things that we need to be doing today to position ourselves for success in the future. So, we're encouraged by that.  Are we seeing the increases in prices or challenges? Well, it's premature to say that and we're still going through the process, still talking to developers, working with MISO and others. But the only thing I do know is that, we have, I will unique expertise to provide the analysis, but also unique expertise to execute these important transmission projects not just for our projects but frankly the projects that'll have no regional and frankly countrywide positive implication implications to move forward the clean energy transition.  So, I don't know if, Julien, that answered your speciﬁc question. This is certainly an important aspect of what we're seeing, but it is not new to us and I'll ﬁnish with this, too, the other encouraging thing that we are seeing is that in particular, in this instance, MISO is working with the other regional transmission organization. In this particular instance, SPP, to try and coordinate even better. Now, some of these transmission projects in needs. So, we don't have surprises, right? When it comes time to try and move forward with a particular renewable energy project. That, too, is encouraging and we look forward to the results of that collaborative eﬀort from those two organizations and I'm sure PJM and MISO will be having similar conversations sometime down the road."
"All right. Excellent. Sorry to squeeze in one more, but just obviously you've Identiﬁed -- the certain renewable opportunities that are excluded from your ﬁve-year outlook, and I know to certainly think that ﬁve-year outlook is also going to be rolled forward here, and actually in six months. Can you talk about the next data point that we should watching in terms of more formally including some of those projects into your plan, just timeline probably, missed on that?","You bet. You stay there correctly Julien that, none of these large regional projects that we outlined in our slides are reﬂected not only in our 5-year plan but as you know, we look out 10 years, the $40 billion, we say a $40 billion plus well. A big plus to that item is potential for these large regional transmission projects. So, we're excited about that opportunity to be able to execute some of those.  So, what's the next thing to look at, look I think that the TM chapter, the MISO transmission expansion planning process. Kind of the really sort of your next visible sign. Now if you'll probably see, there may be some information out there towards the end of third quarter into the fourth. But the process itself which ultimately goes before the board of directors of MISO, will be really in the fourth quarter or the earliest, as I said, in my prepared remarks, that could go into the ﬁrst quarter of next year. But that would be prior that, I would say, part of the next data point if you will. But not -- but to be clear, as I said before, a lot of work is going on today   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   to try and make sure that is kind of smoothly as possible. That's what I would be looking for a little bit later, and Michael you have more to add.     Yes, Julien, I think, the only other thing, with respect to the renewable projects, the data point there, I think Warner maybe even said this in his opening remarks. Is it really that regulatory process? So, we look for those CCN ﬁlings in the back half of this year, that's really going to get those kickstarted from the approval standpoint. That's again, those are really speaking to the IRP process itself. Warner was really talking about the transmission piece.     Yes. Well said. Thank you, Michael. That's exactly right. We said, we expect to be ﬁling for some CCNs, and still here by the end of this year. So, that would be another important data point to be looking for incremental capital expenditure opportunities."
"Yes. We will watch for those, guys. Excellent. We'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Okay. Thanks, Julien. Have a good weekend.
