Question,Answer
"I wanted to ask you about the FERC Oﬃce of Energy Market request for additional information. It looked like, I guess they want some more information -- at least partly -- because of market power and also, I was just wondering what you thought about any potential schedule impact or just what you could tell us more about the interplay with that and getting these plants sold.","Yes, sure, Paul. So you're right. Last week, the FERC did have a call data request but they did ask for additional information with respect to a couple things. They asked for contracts that we have with two customers, and they also then asked for some additional information with respect to the market power eﬀects on competition. We have 14 days to respond. We expect to certainly be able to respond within the 14 days. And we do not expect that the additional information they have asked for with respect to the market power impacts to really have any meaningful eﬀect on the data and certainly no eﬀect overall on the conclusion. So you know we're going to   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   provide that data as soon as we can and we're hopeful that there won't be any impact on the overall schedule. We still expect that once the FERC receives that data, they may certainly invite some opportunity for comment on that but wouldn't expect that it would slow the FERC process down meaningfully. Such that as you heard on the call we still expect to get FERC approval and close the transaction by year-end."
"Okay. I know you guys are obviously planning on selling plants, but any thoughts just about, sort of, the RPM auction and the ability going forward -- next year's auctions -- with respect to the potential of sell capacity into PJM just seen some issues what have you, any follow-up with respect to what we saw in May and what might be there? Obviously I know you guys are getting rid of the plants, but obviously you are still working for them. I was just wondering if you had any thought about that.","Paul, I wouldn't say I have any speciﬁc thought with respect to the auction for next year. As you know, this business segment that we are divesting of was successful in getting the ability to sell additional capacity into PJM and periods beyond really the '14 timeframe looking out to post- '16. Generally, those prices still look favorable to the prices that exist in MISO today. And so I think just continuing to execute on selling what capacity can be sold into PJM is what that business segment will continue to focus on."
"Okay. Good work. Thanks a lot, guys.",Thank you.  Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me?,Yes. Good morning.
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Excellent. Perhaps, ﬁrst just going back to kind of the merchant business if you will, entertain me for one second, I would be curious if any of the latest regulations kind of change the landscape at all? 1-hour SO2 [ph] recently, Illinois draft cohosh rules [ph] were recently released. Does that change anything as far as you're concerned?","No it doesn't. You know certainly we're monitoring developments there. But as you know, the decision to exit the merchant business is a strategic decision for us, really provides us the opportunity to focus exclusively on our rate-regulated operations, and so you know Julien, while we're certainly monitoring conditions and frankly that business segment that we're selling continues to operate well and perform well, but you know it's obviously a strategic decision to exit the business."
"Excellent. Then going back to the Missouri legislation this year, just kind of a little bit rehashing and thinking about next year. Others have alluded to potentially going back to, perhaps a more of a diluted approach. Have you put any thought to that next year?","Julien, this is Warner Baxter. The simple answer is, of course, we are looking at all kinds of options as we look forward to legislation for next year. Certainly there is a bill that was presented on the Senate ﬂoor late in the session which we thought was a good bill. That's certainly an option. We also look at several amendments that were prepared to be discussed and never really got discussed on the ﬂoor. Those are potential options. There are certainly options for even a skinnier version. What we are going do and what we have been doing and will continue do, is have discussions with key stakeholders, to get their input, to see what we can do to move constructive legislation forward that will support investment in the state of Missouri. That's what we'll do. We'll continue to work with our key allies in Missouri, including all the other electric energy providers, to try and craft an appropriate approach forward."
"Great. One last detail going back to what you were talking about a second ago in the prepared remarks. I apologize if I missed this. With regards to the outage here at Callaway, any kind of sense of how signiﬁcant this would be from a timeline perspective and impact to the 3Q results, initially at least?","Julien, this is Warner again. I think Tom said, that basically we still have some more tests we have to complete. They'll take us through the weekend. Preliminary tests indicate that we haven't incurred any signiﬁcant damage. So, if everything we have seen so far, indeed carries through once we complete our tests, that means Callaway, we would expect it down another 15 to 20 days from today -- due to get it back into service. But the tests are not done. We will get those done through the weekend and have a better assessment certainly sometime next week.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Great. Best of luck.,Sure. Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Next question comes from Andy Bischoﬀ with Morningstar.
Good morning. Just a real quick question. When would you expect for a ruling after you supplied additional information by August 9?,"This is Marty again, Andy. It's hard to know exactly when they would respond. There is no speciﬁc time line. Once we got about 180 days, frankly to respond and then can extend for another 180. But obviously this request for information indicates to us that they are actively looking at our ﬁling and we would expect FERC based on past practice to move more quickly than the 180 days that are allowed. So no speciﬁc deadline but again, based on past experience, we would certainly expect again to get the FERC approval and be able to close by year-end. You know, of course there is another ﬁling that's been made at the Pollution Control Board and there the timeline's about 120 days. So in both cases, we expect to get the Pollution Control Board approval for the air variance transfer as well as FERC approval for the sale in time still to be able to accomplish a closing before year-end."
"Thank you. Moving to low trends, I guess during the quarter we have seen weakness in competitor low trends. Can you just provide a little more color on the trends you are seeing across your customer base?","Yes, sure, I will be happy to comment on that. You know, this year we've seen a bit of variation, very much like we saw last year. You know the weather-normalized sales started out pretty strong in Q1 but again, like last year, had quarterly volatility and we had a bit of contraction in the Second Quarter. Year-to-date, however, I would say our residential and commercial sales are up about 0.5%. You know we said at the end of each of the last two quarters that -- in terms of our 2013 guidance, we expected little in the way of growth. Like I said, residential and commercial sales across our utilities are up about 0.5%. That's what we are looking for, for the full year, about 0.5% of growth in residential and commercial sales. With respect to industrial, between Missouri and Illinois, they've been down a little bit this year primarily in Illinois.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Missouri is actually ﬂat to up a little bit. The Illinois trend is a reversal from the past couple of years where we saw really a -- solid increases in industrial sales but this year they've turned south a little bit. For the full-year, we expect similar kind of patterns for Missouri to be up a little bit in terms of industrial and for Illinois to be down. So those are some of the trends we are seeing. I think, when I think about the economy and what's going on, what may drive the sales -- frankly in Missouri, the growth in our sales is kind of underscored by some of the things we're seeing in terms of positive movement and job growth, both in goods producing and services jobs. Housing starts have been on the rise a little bit. Our customer counts are up, year-over- year in both residential and commercial residential, up about 0.4%, commercial about 0.7%. We're seeing some good trends, that give us conﬁdence of the 0.5% of growth will be there for the year in residential and commercial and happy to see Missouri industrial sales up a hair this year. So that's generally I guess what we're seeing."
Thanks for the clarity.,Sure.  Operator  Ian Jenkins with Wisconsin Investment Board.
"Hi. This is Dan Jenkins. I wonder if you can give me a little more background on this appellate court decision on the FAC in Missouri, and then just what the basis was for the decision and then if that will have any impact on how your FAC operates going forward?","Sure, Dan, maybe Warner, President of Missouri operations, will take that one again.     Hi Dan. How are you doing?"
Good.,"Remember when you go back to this issue, it really relates to some margins that we realized from certain wholesale contracts. Actually, back several years ago, that the Missouri Public   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Service Commission felt those margins should be provided back through our fuel adjustment clause like many other oﬀ-system sales are under the existing rules. These wholesale contracts really stem from some excess power that we had available for sale, due to the loss of load from Noranda Aluminum -- which is our largest customer -- resulting from a severe ice storm in 2009. So you go back in 2011 the Commission issued the order that we had to refund approximately $80 million of margins earned for the period March of '09 to September of '09. We indeed recorded that back in 2011. That's pretax charge. That did not take those contracts to their full duration. Those contracts went further. So in 2012, the staﬀ - Missouri Public Service Commission staﬀ -- recommended additional refund of about $26 million related to the same wholesale contracts. That was from the period from October 2009 to May 2011, whereas the ﬁrst one was for March 2009 to September 2009. That was the period under review. In 2012, just to give you history so you know, we actually ended up winning our appeal of the Commission's order before the Cole County Circuit Court, but later in 2013 -- which is the appellate court decision that Marty referenced -- Missouri Court of Appeals upheld Missouri Public Service Commission's position. As a result of all those things, the Commission yesterday issued an order requiring that refund of $26 million and that's about $0.06 per share as Marty talked about. And so we obviously will comply with that. While we're disappointed with the Commission's decision we certainly weren't surprised given recent appellate court decision. So really, as we go forward, we will continue to operate under the provisions of the Missouri Adjustment Clause. We will, to the extent that we go forward, we do not have an issue because we do not have similar types of wholesale contracts going forward. We'll just continue do the oﬀ-system sales, as we do today, and we'll provide 95% of those margins back through the Field Adjustment Clause. The one thing that you should know, during all this period of time, that we actually did ﬁle another or initiate another proceeding in the state of Missouri. This goes back to July of 2011 but we ﬁled a request with the commission for an Accounting Authority Order that will allow Ameren Missouri to defer as a regulatory asset, really the ﬁxed cost of about $36 million that were not recovered from Noranda as a result of that loss of the load back in 2009. So now that all these other decisions have been put behind us, the Commission now still has before it another docket to potentially provide us an Accounting Authority Order for those losses that we incurred as a result of that lost load. A bit of a long story, but that gives you the history of what's going on with the Field Adjustment Clause and where things stand today. There is no set timetable for the Commission to make a decision on this Accounting Authority Order request but we think the decks are now clear for them to take that up in the relative near future."
"Okay. And you do not intend to appeal that under the Supreme Court, their appellate?","No, the appellate with the Supreme Court, no we do not intend do that. There are certain provisions of the Commission's order which we may look to appeal, not the entire $26 million, but another smaller component of that, about $3 million that we think may have been addressed in a prior rate case settlement. That's still under review. But beyond that, no, we do not plan to take this up to the Supreme Court."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. And then just what's your regulatory schedule I guess in Missouri? You do not currently have anything ﬁled, but you have talked in the past about being more regular rate case schedule. Should we expect something coming up in the next few months?","You know, Dan, we haven't made any ﬁnal decisions as to when we'll ﬁle next rate case. Just as we have done in the past, we will seek to try and ﬁnd our next case to mitigate regulatory lag. That's regulatory lag resulting from meaningful capital additions as well as mitigating regulatory lag for operating costs. So when we look at those things, obviously, we just completed a rate case at the end of last year. We'll be mindful of those types of things as well as capital editions that we have coming before us in a variety of diﬀerent areas -- not just in '13, but in '14. A ﬁnal decision hasn't been made but we keep a very close eye on all these things in terms of when we'll next ﬁle rate case."
Okay. Last thing I had is you had a slide show on the cash ﬂow and the fact that it will be negative. I was just wondering if you can update us on what your ﬁnancing plans are coming up.,"Sure. Dan, this is Marty again. So in terms of ﬁnancing plans, as you probably know from looking at our balance sheet, nothing really in terms of short-term debt at this point, we have good liquidity. What we'll be looking at this year is some of the maturities that I believe we talked to you about last quarter, that we have coming up both in Missouri and Illinois. We have negative cash ﬂow really being driven by the capital expenditure plans we have overall. So we'll be taking a look again at those maturities, plus the cash ﬂows driven by the rate-based growth and then reﬁnancing those when they get to levels that we think are appropriate to take to the ﬁnancial market. As we look right now, some of that ﬁnancing may be done in the second half of this year. Some of it may slip to the First Quarter or so of next year. But those are the plans. And then, of course, next year we've got the debt up at the holding company that you're aware of that we'll be looking at reﬁnancing options come up in May of next year, May of '14. Certainly we've got the opportunity there, as we have talked about before, to signiﬁcantly lower the interest rate at the parent company, for the parent company debt. Dan, while I've got you -- one thing I want to tack onto Warner's thing that is important is the charge we took relative to the FAC when we had a similar one in the prior period, but those are fully behind us, those sales that were in question happened during a ﬁnite period of time that the FAC was later modiﬁed to address those kinds of things. So it's not an issue that will be recurring going forward. So that $0.06 item was a bit of a one-time item this year and in terms of it not happening again in the future and we did include it in our core, if you will, earnings from operating activities, but that is not something that would repeat in future periods."
Okay. Thank you.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator  Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.,
"Hi Tom and Marty. So listen, on Illinois Rivers, just agree that the ALJ recommendation was adopted largely as is. How much of an impact might it have on the CapEx for that project? Obviously there were some segments.","Steve, we have with us here today the President of that subsidiary segment, Maureen Borkowski. I think I'll let her address your question.     Good morning. I think the question is -- if the ALJ order was approved, as is, how would it aﬀect our CapEx? Realistically, what would happen is, it would probably trigger another proceeding if the order was approved as is. We would have 7 of the 9 line segments approved for routing as well as several of the substations. We would be moving out on those. Then we would need additional clarity on the remaining two segments and the substations. The issue is not really whether or not those things are needed and whether or not they're going to be built, it is just a matter of what the route is. With regard to the 2 line segments that the ALJ didn't recommend approval of, the route was somewhat in question because there was a question about where the locations that were the terminating points of those line segments should be. With regard to the substations that they didn't recommend approval of, the issue was really with regard to the use of the facilities and sites of some existing Ameren Illinois company substations that were nearby and whether or not we needed new sites adjacent to those facilities or if those existing facilities could be utilized. So it's really just a matter of getting clarity around those issues. The bottom line is if the ALJ order was adopted as is, we still wouldn't expect it to signiﬁcantly aﬀect our capital investment. We probably have another proceeding that was a follow onto clarify the remaining issues. We are hopeful though that the response that we provided to some of the issues the ALJs had raised will be clariﬁed in a commission order that's due on August the 20th. Does that answer your question?"
"Okay. Yes, that's very helpful. I think on Dynergy's call this morning, they talked about continued and worsening congestion issues in the region and potential transmission needs for that. Can you talk about whether you're seeing more opportunities in your transmission business to address that issue?","We certainly are always looking forward to new transmission investment opportunities, but as you know the regional transmission plan is really designed by MISO. So we've continued to work with the midwest ISO and with Dynergy and other entities about addressing some of the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   congestion issues but MISO has to work that through their lengthy stakeholder transmission planning process and any needed improvements have to be determined within the course of the perimeters that their transmission plan sets up. Most of the time, I would think these kinds of projects would have to be either reliability or market eﬃciency projects. We are certainly continuing to propose projects that would address some of these issues but they have to work their way through the planning process."
"Okay. One last question I guess for Tom. I think on the last call you had mentioned that there was going to be kind of a board retreat in June, response to a question on dividend strategy and dividend growth. Anything come out that in terms of thinking on dividend strategy and even just how the Company looks once this generation transaction's completed?","Sure. We did have what I would view as a very successful strategy update session with our board in June. They bought into the management's plan about growing, how we anticipate to grow the business by making investments. We are totally supportive with that approach. They're very much in favor of us, as we grow earnings, as we grow rate base and grow earnings that we would also grow the dividend over a period of time."
"Okay. Thank you, very much.  Operator  Kevin Fallon with SIR Capital Management.",
"Good morning. I just wanted to see if I can get a little bit more color in terms of the regulatory lag issue in Missouri, and in particular how fast are you incurring the lag and what's a reasonable amount of lag to accept before you ﬁle?",Hi Kevin. This is Warner Baxter.
Hi.,"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   You know you look at regulatory lag in Missouri, it's driven by a couple things. Number one, it's driven by the fact that they use historical test-year principally to set rates and another big driver is that when capital investments are placed into service between rate cases, there is not an ability to update rates for those major adjustments. So what we have been doing as a Company, is that we have been working very hard and have had success in better aligning our spend across our enterprise both capital and O&M to be more consistent with the regulatory framework we have in front of us in the state of Missouri. So we have been able to manage that. We continue to do that going forward. But of course there will be some point where we're going to have to ﬁle rate cases. What we've been very focused on is narrowing that gap between the allowed return on equity provided by commission and what actual earned return on equity has been. We have been able do that over the last several years pretty successfully. So I wouldn't say there is a magical number or a magical time frame. We just know that we're going to manage our operations in a manner that's consistent with that and keep a fairly narrow gap. That's what our plan has been and will continue to be."
Is it too precise to say that you guys are hopeful that you can stay out until you have another shot at the legislation. Or is that too ﬁne a point?,"Kevin I would say that is too ﬁne a point. We'll do what we think is right for the business, what we think is right for shareholders. That's when we'll ﬁle rate cases as well. Frankly, we think legislation isn't just about how we earn better returns. We think it's in the best interest, frankly of the state of Missouri and its customers. Bottom line we're trying to create a win-win for everybody."
"Okay. In terms of ﬁnancing plans, as we look over the next couple years you have a big CapEx build up. Can you give some color in terms of the need for equity or target capital ratios for a consolidated ﬁrm?","Sure. This is Marty again. You know we've provided these over time. I think we'd look to keep the equity content and cap structure over time around that 50/50 kind of level where we are today. So we think that's a target that we'd have going forward. You know we haven't given any speciﬁc guidance on any need for equity. Obviously, we've got a strong we believe rate base growth plan, capital expenditure plan, expect to be able to grow rate base 7% annually out through 2017 as we mentioned earlier. You know, largely, we believe that will be funded by the reinvestment of retained earnings as -- from the earnings we've got in the business and growth of earnings going forward coupled with debt ﬁnancing to the extent that we needed some supplemental equity -- which we're not issuing any currently, but we have the ability to turn our drip to 401k [ph] or utilize those programs to generate additional equity. But again, we're not doing that currently, and we would make that decision on a year-by-year basis going forward.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay. And just a last question. I just want to conﬁrm that if the ALJ position is upheld on Illinois river's project, that even if you have to seek a second proceeding to get the full amount of the substations and lines completed, that construction on the project as a whole will move forward as scheduled and it's kind of an add-on to that incremental process that you would need to go through. In other words, it won't delay the spending of the CapEx.","This is Maureen. Yes, that's correct. The encouraging news about the ALJ order is that they completely endorse the need for the project and said that Illinois Rivers is the best approach, so really this issue with regard to the substations and remaining two line segments is about where they should be not whether or not they're needed. So yes we would move out on the segments and the stations that have been approved, and then would work through the issues with regard to the routing of the remaining segments and stations. It would not impact CapEx plan."
"Thank you, very much.  Operator  Steven Berg with Morgan Stanley.",
"It's actually Rajeev Lalwani on Steven's team. Just a question on a comment you made in Missouri, that the cost referral you are seeking relating to Noranda, is that kind of a one-time thing or will that carry forward?","This is Warner Baxter. This would be really kind of a one-time thing. The event was the lost ﬁxed cost resulting from the ice storm. So it would be a one-time event. So the Commission that's in Accounting Authority Order and then if we would be granted, that order then we would seek to put the Commission's decision into rates during our next rate case."
Okay. And the other question was on Illinois. As we have seen the 30-year treasury go up why is that not impacting your expected earnings from the business or is it too small to have much of an impact?,"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. It is embedded in there so you know we have seen the 30-year treasuries rise this year, but it is having, it is up I guess about 30 basis points from where we started, our guidance at the beginning of the year, and 30 basis points for this year is about $0.015 That is embedded in the overall guidance. You know, if you look at the guidance we've provided and think somebody did this last time, took our $2.00 to $2.15 range and added back the parent and other of $0.20 to get to a midpoint of a range around our regulated earnings, which gets you it about $2.27 or $2.28, somewhere in that range. We started the year with regulated earnings expectations of $2.25. After the First Quarter we raised it to a midpoint of about $2.30. Again there is a range around these numbers. You know we didn't have anything speciﬁcally and therefore the $0.06 FAC charge frankly as Warner said earlier could have gone either way. A $0.06 charge or a $0.04 upside. The fact that we had the $0.06 charge is the reason we're bringing down the upper end of our range from $2.20 to $2.15. My point is that we brought down that midpoint only $0.02 or $0.03 based on that charge. We're seeing a little bit of upside from the 30-year treasuries and we're also controlling our costs to help oﬀset some of that. Bottom line it's steady as she goes in terms of our regulated earnings this year. We've been between that $2.25 and $2.30 midpoint. We're still there, even after the FAC charge, about that $2.27 or $2.28 range. Those are some of the things incorporating. We had a refueling outage in the Second Quarter. Result of that as we shared in our talking points, it was $0.08 for the quarter, $0.09 for the year - - right in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. So all in all things are in line through six months."
"Just another follow up question on Illinois. In terms of the new legislation there, it seems like it didn't have much of an impact on your numbers. Can you just talk about why that is? I was under the impression that it will improve at the delta between earned and allowed going forward.","Yes, you're asking about the Illinois Electric in particular?"
"Yes, sorry.","The reason it didn't have a really big impact on this year, is that it will have a positive impact going forward. So Tom went through some of the things that are underscored -- which is use of the year-end rate base, the actual year-end cap structure as well as in weighted average cost or capital returns on deferral's. One of the things in our talking points we did talk about is that coming out of the ﬁrst year of the use of the legislation, there is actually a deferral that is actually a liability back to the customers. And so when you look at the weighted average cost of capital return on that, you know that is actually an incremental obligation which mitigates the positive impact of the other two items, the year-end rate base and the actual cap structure. For the year, it was a bit of a neutral. As we go through time -- and this was in our talking points -- as we go through time and we deploy the capital in order to improve the infrastructure to create the jobs per the act we expect those deferral's to be actually regulatory assets and would   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   expect them to the weighted average cost to capital returns on those. So this year, it kind of netted out to not really having much of an impact but going forward, those ﬁxes to the legislature are necessary and will be positive overall."
Great. Thanks. Sorry I missed that in your talking points.,No problem.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium Asset Management.
"My question has been answered. Thank you, so much.",Thank you.  Operator  Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
"Coming back to Ameren Illinois real quick, I want to make sure I understand we have seen this with Commonwealth Edison. What is the amount of -- on the electric side of items, costs that the commission does not include in the formula rate process, meaning that creates a little bit of structure earnings, structural under earning. I don't think it's a huge number, but when you think about kind of going forward 2014, 2015 and beyond.","Michael, I wish I had that in front of me. We went through some of this, actually coming out of our year-end call and perhaps Doug can ﬁnd the slide. Coming out of year-end we gave our guidance for this year we actually laid out some of the items that actually we expected to cause some under earning this year. Actually Doug was able to pull it out. The things we laid out at that time, Michael were about $8 million of ICC rate making adjustments. You know, those are things that unless we are able to ﬁnd some other way to mitigate those or to get recovery those would be sort of recurring. We laid out -- this was in slide 13 by the way -- in the year-end call, we had about $7 million of electric system rework that we planned to do and are doing this year. And that would not be recoverable. However, while those costs were incurred this year   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   and last year, we don't expect that those costs would be sort of going forward costs. We believe that, that rework is largely behind us after this year. So would not expect that to continue to be a driver of under earning. And then the $1 million we had this year it was greater last year. We had $1 million this year of required donations under the formula rates. Of course we continue to make those donations going forward and those are non-recoverable. I think we laid out there was about $60 million or so of items impacting us this year, but with the expectation that, that would go down to maybe in the $9 million range next year. So that's sort of the guidance we have provided."
"Got it. When investors think longer-term about Illinois Electric business should they basically think -- look on the distribution or delivery side, you are likely to, there is nothing structure that keeps rate based math from happening meaning taking an end of year rate base multiplying whatever the equity layer is and then just taking 30-year treasury plus 580 BIPS and then maybe subtracting out those non-recoverable items.","Yes, Michael, that's right. You know as you look forward it should work obviously as we got started last year with these reviews, there were certainly some debate around some of these historical ICC rate making adjustments or how the law would be implemented. You know those historical ICC rate making adjustments will continue per the law. We believe we've gotten clarity from the legislature in terms of some of the issues that were debated with the ICC. But generally, you are right Michael. We should have rate based growth going forward. The rate making should work from likely as designed and as a 30-year treasuries, if they do rise, then that will impact the overall return. I think next year, that blue chip consensus forecast we use right now is 3.95 which would apply for next year if that held true, a 9.75 return in the Illinois Energy delivery base."
