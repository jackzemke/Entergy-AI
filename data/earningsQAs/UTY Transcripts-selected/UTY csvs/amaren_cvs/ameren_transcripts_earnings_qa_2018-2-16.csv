Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning. Congratulations.","Good morning, Julien. How are you doing?"
"Great. Thank you. So wanted to ﬁrst ask real quickly on the legislation and the previously contemplated billion dollar program. How much inﬂation in bills, does that billion dollars contemplate. How much latitude does that give you when you kind of hash that out against the tax reform, et cetera, against these new rates that they're putting in there?","Julien, this is Moehn. I don't -- we haven't really said. I mean, what we've been clear about is that we think as this legislation written 564, it certainly would support the incremental billion dollars in investment and we think that we could do it underneath that prescribed gap."
"Got it. Excellent. And then, clearly, there's a multitude of factors that would drive your ﬁnancing needs higher than your tax reform and incremental spend is successful on either front. How are you thinking about your FFO to debt commitments? Clearly I hear you saying you're committed to your existing strong credit metrics, but how committed? Perhaps, can you elaborate a little bit on the equity ﬁnancing needs if you get either of the two incremental projects?","Hi, Julien. This is Marty. Good morning. Yeah, when you look at the credit metrics and the credit ratings that we have today, we are very happy with the credit ratings that we have today. Our issuer ratings today for Ameren at S&P are BBB plus, as show in the materials, and with Moody's Baa1. To give you a sense, I mean, our FFO to debt metric, the threshold that S&P has for us out there that BBB plus is 13%. In Moody's, the threshold for the Baa1 for FFO to debt is 20%.  So look, as we go through time, and you can see this in the materials we provided today, we've always looked to maintain a strong balance sheet, strong credit metrics. We worked hard over the past several years to improve, I'd say the business risk proﬁle of the company, and we're going to continue to work on both of those fronts as we move forward.  As we look at the capital investment plan that we laid out today, the rate base growth plans, and we looked to our cash ﬂows including the impacts of tax reform, we ended up thinking it was certainly prudent that we go ahead and issue some equity under the dividend reinvestment and employee beneﬁt programs. Again, with the goal of keeping the balance sheet strong and in keeping strong credit metrics. As we look ahead and as we update the capital expenditure   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   plans looking ahead, the rate base growth plans, we'll step back and assess the overall capital plan, the funding needs, but again, with that backdrop, I wanted to keep a strong balance sheet, strong credit metrics. And importantly, make sure we're positioning those investments for success in the regulatory environment as we seek to earn a fair equity returns on those investments."
"Just a further new nuance on this, if you can. What's the timing of the commencement of expense, speciﬁcally into the legislation as contemplated. When could you actually start spending and over what period of time at present do you intend to spend that $1 billion under earlier program of proposal?","Hi, Julien. This is Warner. I think what we said is, we would spend these expenditures through 2023, that's what it would be, and a lot of this would be predicated and when the legislation is ultimately passed, but we've been clear, we have a plan out there that that's a ﬁve year plan for $1 billion. And so, so through 2023 is what we've been talking about."
Got it. And so fairly rateable?,I'm sorry.
Fairly ratable?,"Yes, relatively speaking, I think fairly ratables, a good way to think about it."
Excellent. Thank you.,"Sure. Thank you, Julien.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question."
Good morning and congratulations on everything.,"Good morning, Paul. How you are doing?"
"I'm doing great. The idea of not having to listen to another ﬁlibuster makes me feel even better, but congratulations guys. Just with respect to the 3.5% rate base growth in your slide for Missouri, does that include pretty much what you see happening in this long-term rate base growth, does that include the legislative impact?","Paul, this is Marty. No, it does not. So when you look at that slide, it includes the $4.3 billion of expenditures that are shown in the table to the left. And then, as Warner pointed out on the conference call, it includes the impacts of tax reform and the impacts on rate base we see from changes in deferred taxes versus what we otherwise would have expected."
"Okay. So to Julien's point, I guess, this additional upside that we could see in this?",Yes. Yes.
Is that a good way to think about?,Yes.
"Okay. And then, when we look at this 7% growth rate and we look at your previous growth rate in rate base and what have you. And I know that you guys have a higher base in what have you, but the lower sales growth -- sorry, the lower earnings -- long-term earnings growth on the top of the range if lowered a little bit, is that just simply a function of the change. And could you just   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   walk through that a little bit compared to now that you've got a higher growth in rate base? Do you follow what I'm saying is not completely intuitive, maybe why the top end of the earnings growth rates gone down?","Yeah, well, look I think we have a very strong rate base growth plan of 7% and I think our EPS growth that goes along with it at 5% to 7%. Compound annual is also very strong. Especially coming oﬀ of the strong 2017 earnings base that we have of $2.83, so that is the base for that. And I would say that, Paul as you think about it, it includes also all of our assumptions about funding that I just laid out, including the use of equity for those dividend reinvestment and employee beneﬁt plan, again that should produce about $80 million of equity annually. And I think the 5% to 7% which is again we think very strong incorporates a variety of assumptions in terms of treasury rate assumptions, spending levels, rate case outcomes, economic conditions and the like, but it does, it's what we believe is certainly the right growth given the rate base and funding plans that we've laid out."
"Okay. Fine. And this is -- there was some discussion yesterday at the Missouri PSC among the commissioners regarding another utility and it looks like majority of them don't -- basically or not necessarily supportive of a consolidated cap structure. And I'm just wondering now you guys make comments about your commitments to obviously the credit ratings in what have you, but just in general, I'm just wondering is there any, perhaps, have you guys have been taking perhaps there could be additional server opportunity on double leverage or anything like that?","Paul, I think if you look at your time, may we've always worked to maintain a strong balance sheets and credit metrics with all of our legal entities both the parent company, as well as our subsidiaries. We laid out on the slides that our target capitalization over time is around 50-50. And I would say, as it relates to Ameren Missouri for third time, we had ratemaking in Missouri for our Ameren Missouri utilities that was based on the utility's capital structure and we would expect that to be the case through time."
Okay. Great. Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.,
Yeah. Hey. Good morning.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity),"Good morning, Steve. How are you?"
"Hi, Warner. So just when you ﬁrst talked about doing the wind projects you suggested and here we could see some modiﬁcation of the base plan as part of it? At this point now, should we assume this as the base plant, and then, if you do the wind and if you do the -- if the legislation passes, those are just additive that there is not likely to be any meaningful adjustment to this base?","Steve, this is Warner. I think, clearly we've pointed out opportunities for additions both for the wind as well as for grid modernization. We presented our base plan and we have two meaningful opportunities that we will continue to work very hard to execute on. And so it would be premature to say exactly what we'll do with the overall plan, but the bottom line, we're not saying we're going to make any changes to the plans as we see it today."
"Okay. And then just on the wind projects, could you just -- be a little more explicit on how the CCN process works. You ﬁle us, once we have winners, you will ﬁle CCN, the renewable writer is kind of part of that ﬁling. So kind of both the project and the rate treatment would all be approved in one proceeding?","Yeah, Steve. This is Michael Moehn. You got it right. So I think what we have been telling folks as we wrap up the conclusion of these contracts that we will be ﬁling these -- for the CCN in the ﬁrst half of 2018, and you're correct. I mean, as part of that ﬁling, we would make the request to use, what's called the RESRAM, the regulatory recovery mechanism for these renewable projects. In that process, I think, we have been saying you can take anywhere from six to 10 months to complete."
Okay. Good. I think that's it from me. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.     Thanks, Steve.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Our next question is from Joe Zou with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, guys. It's Andy Levi. How are you doing?","Good morning, Andy. How are you?"
"I'm all right. Just one, -- well, maybe two questions. But on the $0.14 of Missouri incremental O&M relating to plants, could you just kind of go more into that of exactly what's going on there, that was not part of your EEI disclosures and where that came from and whether that goes away in '19?","Yeah, Andy. This is Marty. Yeah, if we look at it overall especially in a non-Callaway outage here we thought it was certainly prudent on this particular year to have a little bit about higher than normal schedule for our non-nuclear outage cost, and that's the primary driver of that number, as well as some I'd just say some other O&M that we have in Missouri this year. I would not necessarily expect that to be a recurring number year-over-year. And look, I think when you step back overall, as you know, we've been improving our end return as a company in each of our jurisdictions through time on a consolidated basis, and in Missouri, it's our goal to continue to earn very close to our allowed returns."
"Okay. So, out of the $0.14, how much is kind of, I don't want to say one time in nature, but there - - put there because of the Callaway -- backs the Callaway outage?","Yeah. I guess, I don't have a breakdown on exactly that number for you Andy, you know other than to say I wouldn't call necessarily one-time. These kinds of outages do occur through time, just a higher concentration of them this year than in some other years."
"Okay. Got that. And then on the 2.85% increase that's capped to Missouri, does that include fuel or not?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","That's an all in cap, Andy."
"So that does include fuel, so fuel would go up that would be part of the 2.85% cap?",That's correct.
"Okay. And on the wind project, is that part -- is that subject to the cap as well?","It is. Yes, it is."
Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Andy.     Sure, Andy. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Ashar Khan [ph] with Verition [ph] Fund Management. Please proceed with your question."
"Good morning, congratulations. Warner, could you just --","Hey, Ashar. How are you?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Could you just describe the timing of the wind RFP, you said you know kind of approvals for the ﬁrst half of this year, could you just tell us how we should look at that -- the timing of some kind of announcement as we look in the next three, four months?","Micheal, you want to address that please.     Yeah. Again, as we talked a couple of times, we have been going through this RFP process in our -- in the middle of serious contract negotiations, which we -- hope to be wrapping up soon and we've just committed to following the CCN in the ﬁrst half of 2018."
"Okay. And then, once you ﬁle it, how should -- what approval time frame should we look at?","The CCN process, as we've been saying that it typically falls about of 6 to 10 month kind of approval process?"
Six to 10 months. Okay. Thank you so much .  Operator  Our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.,
"Good morning, Warner. Good morning, Marty.","How are you, Paul?"
"Well, thanks. Just -- because there has been so much focus on this Senate and clearly you've cleared that hurdle, but can you give us a sense of the tone in the house?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah, Paul. This is Warner now. I'll ask Michael to comment. Look, I think that the bottom line is, as we said, the passage of this bill in the Senate is a positive step forward, but now we are going to turn our attention to the house representatives. And what we do is we're going look forward to discussing the real signiﬁcant beneﬁts of Senate Bill 564 with all the members of the house. You have to keep in mind that the Senate just passed this bill, so it's now moved on over to the house. And so we're looking forward to having those conversations.     Yeah, I would just add. Look this bill is the result of a lot of hard work and compromise. I mean, it is an excellent bill. I think as Warner said, we're going to demonstrate the beneﬁts to our customers. Obviously, the beneﬁts to us and beneﬁts of the State of Missouri, so we look forward to engaging with the house.     Michael, just to add a little bit to that. And it gets a little bit maybe to Steve's question as before. When we look at this bill, and we've been clear that a Senate Bill 564 is passed, we will spend signiﬁcantly more investments or make signiﬁcantly more investments in State of Missouri, $1 billion. This is what we're talking about. And so that is absolutely our plan. And so with that, come signiﬁcant beneﬁts to our customers in terms of not just modernizing the grid, but also again in the tools that they want to manage their energy usage. Michael talked about this compromise. This compromise took what was already a bill that have robust consumer protections made an even more robust. So these are the types of things that we're going to talk about with the house of representatives, including a signiﬁcant number of jobs that will be driven by the bill."
Thank you. That's good color.  Operator  Our next question is from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.,
Hi guys. How are you?,"Good morning, Neil. How are you?"
Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Good. Thanks. Just a question on the wins in Missouri. I think Empire sequence maybe a little bit before us. Is that proposal a good proxy for your project or would you advise us not to sort of look too closely to that proposals between you and Empire are unique?,"In which aspects Neil are you referring to? I mean, in terms of their --"
"Well, what I'm getting to is simply depending on how that process goes is there something that's negative that kind of comes out? Would that be a good read through to your proposal or would you advise us that proposal is unique versus the entire proposal?","Look, I think our proposal, again, if you just step back and you think about why we're doing that, I mean, you have the renewable standards, it's out there. It requires us to have the renewables and placed by 2021 and that's really the driver behind this. We went through a robust RFP process, which we're in the process of bringing to a conclusion. We're working through all the transmission issues the come along with that and then we're going to ﬁle the CCN. And so, that's the process that I think typically ﬁled with the commission here in the State of Missouri. So I think we feel very, very good about our overall process. I can't really comment about Empires but feel strong about ours."
"Okay, fair enough. And then just a follow-up on the capital plan. So, and I know that there's a lot of moving pieces here, but if some of the incremental spend comes through in Missouri, should we think of the base plan is being the base plan and then everything else to be additive or could the base plan be somewhat ﬂuid and there might be some capital there that will be sequenced that way?","Yeah, Neil, this is Marty again. As we've said before, the extent we have additional capital expenditures and in this case, whether they be related to the wind, whether they be related to the Senate Bill 564, we've always said we will step back and we'll reassess the overall capital plan and funding plans. But as Warner said, it's premature to discuss whether we would make any changes to the base plan that we have today. We have said repeatedly that we are certain that if we get Senate Bill 564 across the ﬁnish line that we will put signiﬁcantly more capital to work in the State of Missouri. And so I'd say that those are, those are sort of our thoughts as we look ahead and think about the possibility of those incremental expenditures.     Well said Marty. And I would you said similarly with wind, right, that's bottom line. We have a very constructive regulatory mechanism that is contained and another renewable energy   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   standard, both of those things will drive important investments in the State of Missouri."
That makes sense. Thank you very much.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) We have a follow-up question from Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.,
"Hey, it's me again.","Hi, Andy."
"I'm not -- I mean this is just make -- I'm reading slide seven, we describe legislation and then -- most of them having read parts of the legislation. Why would the windy subject to the cap, it's not part of the infrastructure spending.","So, Andy, I'm sorry if you don't mind, could you maybe repeat your question? A little bit louder. It's hard to hear you."
"I'm sorry. I'm going to take the headset oﬀ. So battery is going down. Okay. So if you look on page seven of your slide deck, and also if -- I mean, obviously you know the legislation better than I do. But my understanding was based on your slide and reading parts of the legislation that your wind investment would be not -- would not be subject to the cap. Am I wrong on that or?","So the wind does fall underneath the cap. I think what the slide is potentially trying to explain is, if these riders causing you exceed the cap either around the FAC, the RESRAM, et cetera, you are able to defer that for a future rate case as long as your again underneath that 2.85% and get that recovered."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. So, it's like an FRP, like it is in Arkansas, where it's capped to a certain amount, but then you defer and you recover in the next rate case.",Well --
"If the rate case or rate case are true up. So let's just say, I don't know, like in '19 you max out at 2.85, but there is, I don't know, let's just say, another 50 million left over, but in '20 you are at 1%, that 50 million would be be added to the 20 number, so the 1% plus that 50 million, is that kind of what you're saying?","Yeah, that's correct."
"Okay. Right, that's how Arkansas works. Okay, that's great. That clariﬁes it much better. Thank you.  Operator  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Doug Fischer for the closing remarks.","Thank you for participating on this call.
