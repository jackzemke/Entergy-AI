Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Dariusz on for Julian. Thank you for taking the question.",Good Morning.
"Good morning. Wanted to start oﬀ at Illinois gas, acknowledging that you guys have a ﬁling -- a planned ﬁling later in '23. Just curious, with the pending sunset of that QIP rider, how you're thinking about potential forward-looking cadence of ﬁlings? Or potentially is there any appetite   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   that you foresee for some kind of legislative solution may be akin to the multi-year rate plans that are now available on the electric side of things? Just curious, how you're thinking about that at a high level?","Yes. Perfect. Good morning. This is Michael, and yes, I'll start. Marty can certainly supplement. Look, we haven't really said exactly what our future canes will be. Your correct that the QIP set to sunset at the end of '23. And so, we're under getting around ﬁle a case here, and it'll be eﬀective under this QIP for the balance of 2023. I think the thing to keep in mind as you step back and you look at the Illinois gas regulation, I mean it's still very constructive, even absent of QIP, and I'll come back to that. But that means there is a forward test year, rates are decoupled, bad debt track, et cetera. I mean, there's some real positives with respect to what goes on there.  But as the team, look, we can still look at the opportunities there. I mean, we may have to have a diﬀerent cadence if it were to ultimately expire. But there could be an appetite to extend something at some point. We just really haven't engaged in those conversations at the moment, but we feel like absent even getting an extended. There are certainly ways to continue to manage that business very constructively going forward.  Anything to add, Marty?     Michael, that was well said. I would just say that, as we look ahead to our gas business, we certainly see the opportunity and frankly need for continued investment in our infrastructure to ensure that is safe and reliable for our customers. I think that the QIP that we've had over time, that infrastructure mechanism has really provided some good beneﬁts for customers as we think about what it's enabled in terms of timely investment in the system.  So as Michael said, we'll certainly utilize the forward test your capabilities that we have under Illinois law today, and continue to consider, along with other stakeholders, whether a replacement for QIP is something that we can introduce in the future or not. We will safe. Thank you."
"Great. Thank you for that. Appreciate the color. One more if I can, and this is on the 2023 earnings considerations. I realized it's not formal guidance or fully exhausted, but I noticed O&M is not included as one of the drivers. Are you planning to -- are you managing to ﬂat year- over-year? And maybe that's why it's not included on that list because it won't move the needle one way or the other on as an EPS driver? Or just how are you thinking about that cadence?","Yes. Appreciate the question there too. Historically, we really haven't given O&M guidance, especially as you think about some of these ongoing rate reviews, which makes it a little bit complicated at the end of the day. I would tell you that we continue to stay very focused on   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   O&M itself. And if you look at kind of our year-to-date results, and I think Missouri is a good example.  And you back out obviously some of this noise with COLI and some of the reﬁned coal that I got caught up in the rate review, mean we really have managed that to about of 1.5%, 1.7% sort of increase. So I think the team has done a great job from a core perspective. We have made comments before. We continue to aspire to being ﬂat. Over the time horizon, we look out over the ﬁve-year plan. And if you look at historically where we've been, I think we've shared a couple of these slides in the past, and maybe the '16 through '21 period was the last time. We're actually down over that period of time.  So I always look to make it really a non-driver at the end of the day. I think we can give you a little more color as we get to February, but again, it is just a little more complicated because of some of the ongoing reviews as well. So hopefully, that helps."
Yes. That does help. Thank you very much. I'll pass it here.  Operator  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.,
Hey. How are you guys doing? Good morning.,"Hey. Good morning, Paul.     Good morning."
"So back to that Slide 23, I was also -- and I apologize if I missed it, it just -- lots of earnings today. Just on the impact of interest rates. I mean, just wondering, if you could -- you did mention diﬀerent maturities and everything going on. And by I'm just wondering, if you have a rule of thumb of how we should maybe be thinking about things you've done to? Just what the impact of higher interest rates might be, I guess, is a something to think about? So just if you could give us any ﬂavor on?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes. Appreciate the question. I mean, we really did try to provide some of that detail on '21 to give you a sense of sort of what's happening from a redemption standpoint. Obviously, we're going to have some just normal ﬁnancings in the normal course. We didn't provide anything in there, just because of what's going on with respect to rates. What I'd try to also do, Paul, as you look at the recovery of interest rates in terms of how we think about it, the transmission business, obviously formula rates got a little bit of a positive -- obviously a positive hedge on the 30-year treasury oﬀsetting in addition to we have a formula on the interest rate within the electric distribution business.  And then Missouri itself, we're obviously in the middle of a rate review. So you'll be updating some of the capital structure and the cost of capital as we go through that rate review through the end of this year. So I tried to give that perspective just to give you a sense for what the impact would be in 2023."
"Yes. I appreciate the Slide 21. I noticed that, I guess, is -- I was just wondering, if you had a cheat sheet? And Michael, of course, it's short for what have you. So I was just wondering, I guess, we've got some sophisticated math you want us to do which is ﬁne. Okay. That's basically my only question. Thanks so much, and have a great weekend.","Okay.     Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Bash with Wolf Research. Please go ahead."
Hey. Good morning.,"-- Good morning, David. Morning."
"On the February call, as you plan to update -- are you planning to update your EPS growth target through 2027? And if so, will you roll in the expectations of the incremental Missouri renewables investments and the initial spending on the Missouri projects?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yes, David, this is Marty. Yes, in our February call, we will plan to update you on our thoughts in terms of EPS, CAGR from 2023 to 2027 at that point in time. We'll also at that time expect to update our capital expenditure plan, which right now really runs through '26. We'll take that out through 2027, and we'll also update you on our expectations in terms of our rate base carrier out through 2027. So those are all things that we plan to do on the February call.  In terms of the overall investment pipeline, as we discussed this morning, this year as a result of the Missouri integrated resource plan, that's result of the MISO approving Toronto projects, we bumped our overall 10-year pipeline from $40 billion to $48 billion. And as we mentioned in some of the speciﬁc, some of those capital expenditures we would expect to start to fall in the latter half of that ﬁve-year update. So, those are things that we'll consider how best to fold in to both our ﬁve-year CapEx guidance as well as that at rate-based CAGR."
Got it. And you think those nice. Would you make an assumption on the competitive projects from MISO spending? Or would that be just mostly on the assigned projects?,"Yes. David, I think at this point, we haven't made a ﬁrm determination as to whether what will fold in or not, I would say, with respect to some of those competitive projects. While it's a little bit of a diﬀerent thing than we faced in the past, I would say traditionally, we've been a bit conservative about rolling those things in until we have better line of sight to those projects that we would be able to ﬁrmly execute.  So I would expect with respect to this projects, we take a bit of a conservative posture."
"Makes sense. And then just on equity, remind me your equity needs for 2024 to 2026, that we says, when you last updated them, and along with that just your targeted consolidated equity ratio?","Yes, David. It's Michael. Yes. David, this is Michael. So when we roll forward our plan in February '22, so we had $300 million basically of external equity through the balance of that plan plus $100 million drip. And as indicated, very pleased where we are today than we were gotten in the '22 and '23 oﬀ of there. So you should continue to assume that $300 million '24 through the balance. We continue to target a capitalization right here and we're close to 45% over that ﬁve- year plan, so we'll stay focused on that.  And then as Marty just talked about, as we roll forward into February and roll forward on new capital plan, obviously we'll step back, address any ﬁnancing needs as part of what happens   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   with that capital plan, so that you should continue to think about $300 million at the moment."
Great. Thank you.,"Thanks, David.  Operator  There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the ﬂoor back over to you for closing comments.     Okay. Well, hey, thank you all for joining us today. As you heard on the call, we've had a strong 2022 year-to-date.

We look forward to seeing many of you. I think, it Conference, which is just a couple of weeks away. Thanks all, and be safe.  Operator  Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.
