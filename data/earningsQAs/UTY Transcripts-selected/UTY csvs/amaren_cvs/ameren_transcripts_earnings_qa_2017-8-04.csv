Question,Answer
Wow. I never get the ﬁrst question.,"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Good morning, Andy. How are you doing?"
How are you guys doing?,How are you?
"Some people don't even let me ask a question. I'm all right. So, just on the earnings revision for 2017, so should we kind of – is the new base to grow oﬀ of is the midpoint of that number, which is like $2.80? Is that kind of how to think about it?","Well, you know, Andy, obviously, the guidance we gave in terms of our long-term earnings guidance has been really based on 5% to 8% compound annual EPS growth from 2016 to 2020. And, of course, when we'd started that, we used a base in 2016 of $2.63, which was an adjusted base. Clearly, you're right. I mean, as we look at this year, we've upped our guidance for our core earnings. The midpoint is $2.80. And as we think about going to next year, any kind of long-term guidance we give, yeah, the foundation would be whatever the core earnings were for the prior year. So, that would be – that very well may be the $2.80 going forward."
"Okay. And what's the diﬀerence between the midpoint and $2.90, just in the thinking because, I mean, it's August already, so obviously you threw the $2.90 in there for a reason. It must be achievable. So, what is kind of the delta that gets you to $2.90 versus $2.80?","Well, when you say that, obviously, as we go through the remainder of the year, we don't have, for example, in there any kind of July weather that's been baked in. I mean, you're really asking, I think, about the range, and what justiﬁes the range up or down?"
"What gets you – $2.80 is your midpoint, but what would get you to $2.90? I mean what's in the thinking that gets you the $2.90 or higher?","To plug anything else for the remainder of the year, to the extent that there were sales volume changes, as I mentioned, we don't include in our – our guidance typically include normal   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   weather. Certainly, there could be some weather impact up or down. We have had some warm weather here in July, which isn't explicitly factored in. As we mentioned on the call, we don't expect that to oﬀset the negative impacts of weather from earlier this year. Probably as we sit here today, it's probably less than a $0.05 kind of impact from what we're seeing in July. But things like sales trends, reductions in operations and maintenance spending, positive weather, those are the kinds of things that can really move you up or down within your range."
And are you trending towards kind of the midpoint or the high end right now do you think?,"You know, Andy, we..."
You don't have to answer it. I just wanted to...,"Well, thanks for asking. No, we – look, wait, we give a range. We feel comfortable with that range. And, look, we started the year with a little bit lower. As we moved through the year, we started the year with a little bit of negative weather. That was certainly inﬂuencing our thinking at the beginning of the year in terms of the guidance range we gave. As we've moved through the year, we've had a constructive outcome in the Missouri rate case, which was terriﬁc.  We've got a disciplined ﬁnancial management as we've moved through the year too, making sure we keep tight control of our cost. As you know, our goal in each one of our jurisdictions is to earn as close to our allowed returns as we can. And we're executing on our strategy well, deploying the capital as we expected to, which drives rate base growth which drives earnings growth. So, we're executing well. We feel comfortable with raising the overall range and we're going to obviously work hard to achieve year-end results within that range.     Andy, this is Warner. I would just simply say – I would just add one thing. As Marty said, I think, it's simply evidence of the fact that we're executing our plan and we're executing it well and we're executing across all of our businesses."
"And then, I know I'm going to cheat here and ask one extra question. But if you kind of – and I know you haven't given 2018 guidance and I'm not expecting you to. But just kind of just very simplistically, $2.80 is kind of the midpoint of where we're going to grow oﬀ of and then you don't have a Callaway outage next year, right, that adds like $0.09 to $0.10 to 2018. Is that correct?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)",Callaway outage is around $0.08.
$0.08. And then...,"But you're right. We do not have one – we don't have one next year. Look, we're not giving guidance for next year."
"No, no, no.","But as you look ahead to next year, we certainly expect to beneﬁt from the continued investments we're making in rate base which drive earnings growth. We don't have a Callaway outage next year as you mentioned which also then would be additive to earnings."
"Right. Well, you don't have a Callaway outage and then, you're not ﬁling a rate case in Missouri, right? Probably. So there's also like interest expense savings from that that you'll capture in 2018. Plus, you get about $0.20 of growth in Illinois just from the rate base growth. So, I'm just kind of looking at consensus around $3 and just kind of adding up the numbers. So it just seems that people are kind of underestimating your earnings power. I don't know if you tend to agree with that and I guess I kind of saw it this year, too, without obviously giving guidance.","Yeah. Again, we're not giving guidance for next year and I won't comment on consensus for next year either. But – and I also wouldn't comment on necessarily the EPS impacts that you gave from the rate base growth. I mean we'll provide our guidance as we normally do as we roll into the early part of next year. I would mention that you mentioned that no Missouri rate case ﬁle. One thing I would mention is on the rate review that we just concluded where the rates went into eﬀect April 1. This year we realized about 75% to 80% of the impact of that rate review. Next year, we would incrementally pick up the ﬁrst quarter beneﬁt of that rate review."
"Plus any reﬁnancings that you have because you have some high-cost debt that's coming due at Union and that obviously you would have to get back in a future rate case, but not in 2018. Is that correct?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah. To the extent that we're able to, at Ameren Missouri, to reﬁnance the debt at a lower rate, we do beneﬁt from that savings until the next rate review. And to your point on that, I mentioned on the call that in June we reﬁnanced. We paid oﬀ $425 million of 6.4% debt, issued $400 million at 2.95%, is a 10-year oﬀering. That, for example, is about $15 million of annual interest savings."
"Right. Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. I'll let somebody else go.","Thanks, Andy.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, guys. Quick question on Missouri. And, Warner, you commented a little bit about changing generation ﬂeet. And just curious, you're one of the few utilities in the region that has not really, when you look at generation supply, beneﬁted both by sizable, in Missouri, transmission growth that leads to a sizable amount of wind generation, entering your service territory and maybe replacing some fossil generation.  Can you talk a little bit about whether you see that as a signiﬁcant opportunity, either via owning wind plants in rate base or in the need for incremental transmission in Missouri to be able to connect to the West where there's lots of great wind resource? And can you talk about what do you need from a regulatory standpoint, either ratemaking or approval-wise, to actually make that happen if that's one of the decisions you make going forward?","Thanks, Michael, for your question. A couple comments. Number one, we are in the process where we look at transmission but we also look at generation. And we've been consistent in saying that we're going to transition our generation portfolio to a more diverse, cleaner portfolio, but we're doing it in a responsible fashion. A little bit later this year, we are going to update our integrated resource plan. And that will highlight some of those opportunities we may have in the renewable energy space, just with regard to our own generation. And, as we know, we have a renewable energy standard in the state of Missouri. And, as a result of that, as renewable energy cost for new generation comes down, that's something we're going to look carefully at.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Of course, to make renewable energy work, you need to make sure that you have a transmission system that's robust enough to support all of that. And at the end of the day, we've certainly made more investments in the transmission space in Illinois. And in MISO, we've done some. We have the Mark Twain Project that we're going to hopefully continue to move forward with and get across the ﬁnish line.  So, as you continue to see greater levels of renewable generation in MISO in the broader footprint, we do see that there could be some opportunities for incremental transmission that could be done, whether it's done on a multi-value project basis, which would have to go through MISO, or potentially, of course, something that we would do under the state regulatory framework in Missouri.  And so I wouldn't say that we've certainly ruled that out. We'd see that as an opportunity. So, I'm looking at Shawn Schukar. Shawn, in terms of how you look at the space, especially in MISO, and other things? We do see incremental transmission opportunities, not just to support generation, but even just to deal with and to support NERC reliability projects and those types of things.     Yes, Warner. That's correct. We see signiﬁcant opportunities around the – opportunity to improve or to replace the existing transmission system in Illinois and Missouri, but overlaying that with as we see changing generation portfolios in the market that that will create potential new opportunity, especially given the strong wind resources to our West."
"Got it, guys. Thank you. Much appreciated, you all.","Thanks, Michael. Take care.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question."
Good morning. Congratulations on a solid quarter.,"Thanks, Paul. How are you doing?      Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Thanks, Paul."
"Well, thank you. Can you just delve a little more deeply into the Missouri process and kind of how you can possibly get more traction there? I'm talking legislative.","Sure, Paul. I'll comment on that. Michael, feel free to jump in. As we said before, of course, we've been disappointed that we haven't got that across the ﬁnish line. But the process in legislation is always one of collaboration. It's always one of working with key stakeholders to educate them on the needs. And it's always one of ensuring they understand the real value to modernizing the energy grid.  If you look at what we've been able to do in Illinois, that's really the formula that we've worked over there. It's making sure everyone understood the value. And then once you have them understand the value, deliver on those projects. And it's clear what we've seen in Illinois and what we've seen, frankly, across the country, is that modern energy policies that support investment in a modernized grid, not only brings real value to customers, it keeps rates still aﬀordable, but it creates thousands of jobs. That's been a formula that's worked across the country, and we can see that's worked clearly in Illinois.  So, that same message is resonating in the state of Missouri. It's why we have such strong bipartisan support. That's why the collaborative eﬀort that we've been working on continue to gather even more stakeholders to support it. So, really, it's one of just doing the work on the ground, the work on – with the – collaborating with key stakeholders and being mindful that the approach that we've been taking is very consistent with our – Governor Greitens has said that, look, regulatory reform is an important part of his platform to become governor, as well as creating good paying jobs. What we've been talking about in the state of Missouri is absolutely consistent with that. So, I think that has been the approach. And, Michael, you've been on the ground working with key stakeholders. Anything to add?     Look, I think, that's well said. The only thing I would add to that is just a couple of things. We're going to continue to build oﬀ of certainly the interim report that the Senate put out last fall, along with the Missouri Public Service Commission, had the working docket on – looking at issues around regulatory reform. There's also been an emerging issues task force that they kicked oﬀ here. We're going to have some more meetings here in August. All of these are indications that I think they understand that we need to take a diﬀerent approach to this. There's opportunities around. We're going to continue to leverage those going forward."
"It really comes down to one party, right? I mean, how do you ﬂip him?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Well, so, at the end of the day – Paul, this is Warner again. We do what we've been doing. We continue to work collaboratively with those key stakeholders. And, yeah, we have a small group that has opposed the legislation. But we won't be deterred, because, look, it's important for us to continue to get their input. We share our input with them. And, as we said before, while we've experienced the ﬁlibuster, there's certainly ways to – not only ﬁnd comprises in advance, but in the context of ﬁlibusters and the like, look, the key is, you continue to reduce the number of people that may want to participate in the ﬁlibuster, number one.  You make sure you're given adequate ﬂoor time to try and make sure you can address those issues and hopefully come to a compromise. And, lastly, as we've said before, I mean, there are rules in the Senate that would enable it to close down the debate. But those rules aren't used often. We hope we never get to that point. The bottom line is, we want to work collaboratively with everybody to ultimately get constructive legislation that beneﬁts our customers, the communities that we serve, and our shareholders.     Yeah. That's right, Warner. I mean, look, I think that this may sound naïve at the end of the day, but we absolutely have to convince them of the value associated with this. There are too many examples, though. Warner talked about what's going on in Illinois, but you can certainly look far beyond Illinois in terms of what's happening, in terms of modernizing the grid and the value that it creates for customers and shareholders at the end of the day. And so, we just honestly have to continue to double down that eﬀort, to convince him that the state of Missouri is falling behind if we don't make some progress on this."
"Are there any term limits to consider here, or...","In Missouri, there are term limits. Yes."
There are or not? Sorry.,There are. Correct. There are term limits.
Thank you very much.,"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Sure, Paul.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up on Michael Lapides' question. And speciﬁcally on the wind, are you guys able to sign PPAs, or do new-builds on wind generation with economics below the dispatch cost of your coal ﬂeet?","Hey, Kevin. This is Marty. Yes. Good follow-up question. Yes. I mean in terms of moving forward, clearly, there could be PPAs we enter into. We could own wind generation. Both of those are viable options. And in terms of that question, I mean, there's a couple of ways that it could happen prospectively. One, as you mentioned is, to the extent that the all-in cost of those renewables was below the dispatch cost of our existing generation. Of course, one of the reasons why maybe the penetration hasn't been as great here as maybe other places is that the dispatch cost of our existing generation is pretty low. And that's a real beneﬁt for our customers. However, the cost of renewables continues to come down, and we watch those economics very closely.  As Warner mentioned in his answer to Michael earlier, as part of the Integrated Resource Plan, we also look at compliance with the Missouri renewable energy standard. That standard actually requires us to purchase or generate 15% of our native sales from renewables by 2021, subject, though, to a 1% annual limit on rates. And really, that's been a limiter historically, in terms of introducing even more renewables into the portfolio.  In our 2014 IRP, we had about 130 megawatts of wind coming in by 2021. So, as Warner mentioned in his talking points, we're working on an update to that Integrated Resource Plan. And in answer to your question, we're both looking at the economics of renewables as compared to the dispatch cost of our existing generation, but also looking at it in terms of compliance with that renewable energy standard, within the limits of that 1% impact on rates. So, those are the two ways that, really, as we look ahead, there's the opportunity to bring even further renewables into our portfolio."
And where are you relative to that 15% by 2020 right now in terms of your ﬂeet?,"In terms of the existing assets that we have or things under purchase, we're below signiﬁcantly below that, but there are a few ways to go about compliance. One is PPAs, one is ownership,   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   and the other is renewable energy credits. So, we're looking at all options as we move ahead for compliance with that standard."
"And just one last thing. In terms of the process going forward, obviously, you guys have said that you're going to seek legislation again next year in Missouri, but is there any possibility of trying to do something at the commission before with the $1 billion of grid modernization CapEx that you guys have highlighted in past or is that something that you're just going to defer and try to seek the legislation itself only?","This is Michael Moehn. Also in respect to your question on the renewals and where we are, I believe we're right at around 5% today in terms of that 15% compliance, so."
Thank you.,"With respect to the legislative question, regulatory, look, I think, we're not obviously foreclosing any tools available to us. I think we look at a number of options that we can pursue. As Warner indicated, we certainly intend to ﬁle as we sit here today legislation, but we're going to continue to look at all options to continue to make progress. We've used regulatory tools in the past that have been constructive. So, it is certainly an option available for us."
Is there a certain timeframe that you're looking to make a decision on that before the legislation or is it just kind of a general sense that you always make those types of calculations?,Yeah. More of the latter.
Okay. Thank you very much.,"You're welcome, Kevin. Thanks.  Operator   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi. I'm sorry, guys. Apologize about that. So, on the renewables that was just brought up. So, why wouldn't you guys do the majority of it yourself if there was the opportunity and it was economical for rate base (48:38)?","I guess, Andy, no disagreement with that assertion. I mean, certainly, if that makes the most sense for the customers that would be a positive. So, we'll need to look at, as we're assessing it, what the best compliance option is for the renewable energy standard for our customers and looking at the various options and thinking about the beneﬁts, risks, costs of all of those options."
"And what's the timeframe on – I mean, because obviously things are kind of getting close here. So, what's the timeframe? When will we hear about kind of the decision-making process on that?","Andy, this is Michael Moehn. As Warner indicated, we have an IRP that needs to be ﬁled in October. So, my sense is that we'll have some communication right around that timeframe."
"Okay. And, obviously, you don't have anything in your current CapEx forecast for any of those?","Very little in the current CapEx forecast for that, given, as I mentioned earlier, the IRP we had a few years ago in 2014 had about 130 megawatts of wind by 2021."
"130 megawatts wind by 2021. And how much again came from that 5% to the 20%, I think, you said, right, is what the standard is? How many megawatts are we talking about?","Well, it's really, again, limited by the 1%. And I think rather than getting into that here, it's something we're assessing. And as Michael said when we ﬁle the IRP in October, we'll see where we're at.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
Okay. Thank you.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Doug Fischer for any closing remarks.
