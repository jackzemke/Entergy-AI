Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Julien, how are you doing?"
"Quite well. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow-up ﬁrst on the wind investment side of the equation. I just want to dig in a little bit on the 700 megawatts and the breakdown between the   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   400 megawatts and the balance, if you will. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of the timeline here with respect to the incremental, you talked about the 400 megawatts being ﬁled by June 30. What about the remainder here as far as the timeline, do you see the CapEx dollars and how should we be thinking about it if you ultimately are awarded the cadence of the CapEx vis- a-vis the plan?","So, Julien, this is Warner. I'll start with the overall timing and then I'll let Marty comment a little bit more on the CapEx piece. As we said, we expect to ﬁle certiﬁcates of convenience for these 400 megawatts by June 30 and then it is our expectation that we will ﬁll in the rest of our wind generation needs with agreements and ﬁlings with the Missouri Public Service Commission by the end of 2018. So, Michael and his team in Ameren Missouri have been working hard with many of the developers and they will continue to do so. So, Marty, do you want to comment a little bit about the CapEx and the cadence associated with that?     Julien, taking your question in terms of the cadence as when will the CapEx occur relative to our plan, I think with regard to all of these projects, our objective is to get them in service by the end of 2020 in order to take advantage of the production tax credits. Depending upon how we ﬁnalized negotiations, for example, if they were ended up being build transferred agreements, then likely the CapEx would really occur in that 2020 timeframe. And again, the goal here is approximately 700 megawatts or at least 700 megawatts with approximately $1 billion overall spending."
"Just to clarify, why is it broken up between 400 megawatts and 300 megawatts, is it basically if I were to read between the lines, the 400 megawatts you've sort of established and the 300 megawatts would be likely a build on transfer, is that the right way to interpret this?","No, it's not, Julien. It's really just the status of our ongoing negotiations. So we have ongoing negotiations with multiple developers and it is just how we see the timeline unfolding this year in terms of completing negotiations and getting CCNs ﬁled. It really does not have anything to do with the nature of the ultimate agreement, whether it be a build transfer or otherwise, it's really just a situation where you're negotiating with multiple developers for multiple sites, but at the end of the day the goal with respect to all 700 megawatts is to get those megawatts into service providing value to customers in the 2020 timeframe."
"Excellent. And then just as we come to the end of the legislative session here, sort of curious what are options, if you will, assuming there is an extension even beyond the end of the session here in the spring?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Julian. This is Warner, I'm not quite sure if I understand what you mean by options, but let me just say what we're focused on. We're focused on Senate Bill 564 which now has passed all the - - received approval by all the necessary legislative committees, it is now very well positioned in the House of Representatives. So as you've been following this, I know you have, there's been a great deal of hard work, collaborative eﬀorts and compromise to get this bill to where it is positioned now and along the way, every time as the bill has been reviewed by one of the committees, it's received strong bipartisan support. So now we have until May 18. And so, Michael Moehn and this team are very focused on working with key stakeholders, to make sure that gets adequate time in the ﬂoor and at both in the House of Representatives."
"Got it. So, it sounds like for the time being focused on the May 18 deadline and then we'll talk about anything after at another point in time?",We are focused on May 18th period.
Excellent. Best of luck.,Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul."
"We're focused on the 18th as well, but anyway, just the impact of the wind rates, could you remind me what you guys are thinking in terms of -- what you think the impact of the wind   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   projects might be on rates, we've seen some utilities talk about actual rates going down. I'm just wondering what you guys are thinking.","Yeah, Paul, this is Marty. We have not said speciﬁcally what we expect the impact could be. Over time as we ﬁle for the certiﬁcates of convenience and need and update the Commission on our plans for compliance with the renewable energy standard, we'll certainly provide that information to them.  Overall what we have said, which is consistent with the law, is that we do believe that we can ultimately own the 700 megawatt to comply with the renewable energy standard, that the overall investment that we will make and the impact on customer rates would result in rates on average rising less than 1% on average over a 10-year period, projected period following the wind being put in place, and that's really a requirement of the renewable energy standard. That's not to say, however, that we expect that rates would rise that much necessarily on average.  As you note, there could certainly be expected beneﬁts from the wind over time depending especially on what power prices are over time. So, in any event, we haven't said speciﬁcally, but we will be providing those updates to the Commission through time and we do expect that, like I said, we'll be able to deliver these projects and keep the impact on rates at that under -- that 1% average."
"Okay, great. And then on the tax side, if the legislation were to happen, how would we think about this oﬀset that you guys have, I guess booking in terms of the tax beneﬁt, if you follow me. How would we think about that -- how should we think about the tax beneﬁt impacting your earnings for the -- I know you guys don't expect this, but if the legislation were for some reason not to happen, how should we think about it?","Well, I think if. If the legislation comes to pass, number one, we would expect that the Commission would have a proceeding then to ﬁgure out how much and over what period of time we would end up providing the beneﬁts of the tax reform to customers. Again, as required by law that proceeding could be initiated. Right now as it relates to our ﬁnancial results, just to be clear, our ﬁnancial results for the ﬁrst quarter don't assume that any beneﬁt is retained by the shareholders and that we have established an accrual for the expectation of ultimately providing that beneﬁt back to customers."
"Okay, so that --","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Michael, do you have a ﬁnal --     Yeah, I was just going to add, assuming the legislation is passed, just to be clear, within 90 days we will be refunding that amount back to customers, and so that's spelled out in the legislation very clearly."
"Okay. So just to clarify, as far as earnings being reported, we shouldn't expect the legislation to impact that one way or the other from our perspective, do you follow me? Is that understanding me correctly?","Yes, we are understanding that correctly, Paul."
Okay. And we'll just wait till the 18th to see what happens.,You bet.
"Okay, great, thanks so much.","Thanks, Paul.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question."
"Just a follow-up to Paul's question, if legislation would not to pass, would it require a rate case to decide to give the tax (inaudible) back to ratepayers?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes, we have to go through the normal rate proceeding process to ﬁgure that out and ultimately give that back to customers, that's correct."
And would that be retroactive to January 1 of 2018?,Yet to be determined.
"And then just now you've kind of add another billion to the potential on top of the wind, if the legislation passes, what could your rate base CAGR be? Would you just pay some capital and reshuﬄe projects or will this be completely added in?","Paul, this is Marty. It would largely be additive. We need to bring the wind into the portfolio for compliance with the renewable energy standard and we've said that to the extent that this legislation passes, we will invest more in the state of Missouri. We talked frequently about this potential for a billion dollars of investment over a ﬁve-year period. So, we've said repeatedly we will invest more in Missouri, we have not said exactly what that growth rate would be,  And we said that overall as a company we would step back, however, and take a holistic look at our capital expenditure plan. We may make some modiﬁcation to our overall ﬁve-year spending plan, but largely this -- that $2 billion would be additive."
"So, more additive than extending the growth rate, okay. And then just on 564 in the House, what are the hurdles and who could crisp this up?","In terms of the hurdles, as I said at the outset, and I'll let Michael comment on some of the speciﬁcs, it's gone through all the legislative committees. There are no more committee hearings we have. It is on the House calendar and it is ready to go to the ﬂoor when that House leadership chooses to have a go to the ﬂoor. So, Michael, any other commentary beyond that?     No. Other than, again, just to reiterate that it has continued to experience I think strong bipartisan support. As Warner said, it's been through all the various committees, the House utilities, House rules. So it sits on the calendar and can be debated at any time. And we certainly remain optimistic that it will be debated within the next week or so.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)      Because the bottom line, we talk a lot about bipartisan support, I think it's important to recognize that key stakeholders from across the state support this legislation. And so, at the end of the day, we remain hopeful that we will have an opportunity to have this bill not only debated, but voted on the ﬂoor of the House by the end of the legislative session."
"In the past, a similar legislation has enjoyed bipartisan support, it only takes one or two, where are those parties now?","Well, I think that with the issues in the past, we've had diﬃculty getting Senate votes. This is the Senate bill in the House. I think that's just important to recognize that we did going back to February had a long feel about certain (inaudible), a good compromise, and a bill that came out of the Senate 2526, again strong bipartisan support and again it's gone through the various committees.  So we have never been this close, never been this far through the process. And so, again, we remain hopeful that it certainly gets debated within the next week or so. I think the support is there for it. Clearly the beneﬁts are there for the state of Missouri in terms of, you know, we talked about in the income tax refund, obviously the rate freeze, the rate cap, the investment in the state of Missouri, the creation of job, economic development, etc."
"Okay, thank you very much. It helps.",Sure. Thank you.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
"Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and good to see the Cardinals in the ﬁrst place.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah, they struggled for the last couple of days, I hope they will get back on track, good to hear from you, Michael. How are you?"
"I'm okay, let's get Yadier back in the lineup in the coming weeks. One Missouri question and then actually one for Illinois, and then maybe a housekeeping one, so three in total. First, the Missouri question, just bigger, broader, not just this legislation, but legislation in general, has -- in the last 30 to 60 days have any new bills made its way out of the House in the Senate and actually been signed by the Governor in the last 60 days or so?","So, Michael, this is Warner. There has been a bill that went out on environmental matters, that was approved, but it hasn't been signed by the Governor. Michael, why don't you talk about the --     Warner is commenting on a bill that's speciﬁc, obviously I think the state of Missouri continues to conduct its business. I think there's bills being passed and I can't comment on what the Governor has signed or not signed. But I do know that the legislature convenes in the progress and speciﬁcally as Warner said, we passed a bill related to some coal combustion residuals last week."
Okay. And that bill is awaiting the Governor's signature or has it been signed and it is now oﬃcially a law?,It is awaiting the Governor's signature.
"Got it. I want to ask a question about Illinois, and the need for incremental transmission and/or distribution investment, and I know you've kind of laid out your incremental -- your CapEx plan starting back in the fall for the next ﬁve years, but just curious, what are the things that could move the needle on that plan, mainly make that plan look very diﬀerent this time next year versus what you show in the slide decks now. What are some of the things that could, hey, we're not putting this into our CapEx guidance, but these are things in Illinois that could really change the CapEx outlook either on the T side or D side?","Yeah, Michael, this is Marty. I think the -- our growth rates, as you know, are pretty robust in Illinois today. We've got 12.3% kind of growth rates for gas, we got 8.4% for electric distribution   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   and our transmission business overall is growing at about a 12% compound annual rate and there's a signiﬁcant amount of that, that's actually in the Ameren Illinois business. So, already growing at pretty good clips. As we look ahead, we do see a continuation of strong growth in all of those areas.  In general, I'd say there's still quite a bit of investment to be done for replacement of aging infrastructure, for reliability, as well as capacity additions and safety. The electric business, obviously substation transformer replacements, underground replacements, line rebuilds, pole replacement, various grid modernization, in the gas business, transmission replacement, regulator station rebuilds, coupled steel systems and gas storage ﬁeld compressors, et cetera. So there's a lot of investment over the next ﬁve years and beyond as it relates to those businesses.  Same thing in transmission as it relates aging structures, you know, ﬁeld wire conductors, transformers, breakers, switches, etcetera. So there is lot of components that are in need of modernization and that investment opportunity extends beyond the ﬁve years. I don't know if there is really anything speciﬁc to point to. We've been waiting for some new regulations in the gas business for some time now, that may cause us to increase even further level of investment there.  We have in terms of modernization of our infrastructure, but certainly the expenditures that we've got planned for the next ﬁve years and beyond should put us in a good position in terms of compliance with those rules. But that is one of the things, obviously, to look forward as you think about future investments."
"Got it. And then one last item, just a little bit of the housekeeping side, the expected planned outages or planned work in Missouri on the non-nuclear ﬂeet, is that just a 2018 item? I think it's $0.11 or $0.12 headwind in 2018. Will all of that go away when we think about 2019, so it's just a -- it's a little bit of an incremental bump to '18 but it's kind of a once every 5 or 10 years thing or will some of that drag into either '19, '20 and beyond?","What we're seeing there is, we took on more of that this year in light of the fact that there was no Callaway refueling outage. So in terms of that type of expense, I would expect to see that drop down as you move into 2019. But as I noted in February, I wouldn't really consider those to be one-time expenses and I don't really think that we should look at those as something that's occurring this year, but won't reoccur next year.  It's something that the amount varies from year to year and I think you'd expect that we would do more of that in a non-Callaway refueling year. So I guess bottom line is, Michael, I would expect some further expenses of that nature next year, but perhaps not at the level that we're seeing this year."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated, as always.","Thanks, Michael.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Verition Fund Management. Please proceed with your question."
Good morning and congrats on good earnings.,Thank you.
"Marty, can I just understand one thing, I know we have under the legislation certain price caps, but is it fair to say that the investments that we would make as part of the legislation and as well as part of the wind investment that have to be done in 2020, that we should as a shareholder be expecting to get a return on those investments once that fully in by the year, I guess, 2021 as we take on the wind and all that. So, we should be able to, on the earnings, as you show them on the book, be able to get a return on those investments as they are fully completed?","Good morning. This is Michael Moehn. With respect to the caps and the 2.85% that you referenced, yes, the billion dollar income incremental investment we talked about, the wind investment, we are assuming all of those that underneath a 2.85% cap and obviously we'll have to continue to manage things closely as we have been from a disciplined cost management side, but absolutely you should be expecting a return on those investments."
Thank you so much.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.,
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I have a quick follow-up, you said that Illinois Gas beneﬁted from some tax timing issues. How much was that?","Yeah. Paul, it's a good question. It's obviously about $0.01 to $0.02 in terms of the timing impact."
And that will reverse by the end of the year?,"Yeah, exactly. The Natural Gas segment earnings were up about $0.04. And like I said, $0.01 to $0.02 for that would reverse over the remainder of the year."
"And then the fossil outages, that are going to be $0.11 for the balance of the year. Should we think that those are in the shoulder months, so we should see those in the 2Q and 4Q?","Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption in terms of those overall expenses. When I gave our guidance at the beginning of the year and we said, higher O&M in Missouri $0.14 and we talked about the scheduled non-nuclear outages, which you are right, would generally occur in shoulder months, also talked about timing of vegetation and management, routine line inspections, which would be more ratable for the year, but you're absolutely right as it relates to the outage costs."
"Okay, thank you very much.  Operator  Our next question comes from line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question.",
Good morning.,Good morning.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)
"Just a question for you. Hey, how are you? A question on the transmission business, you have a thicker equity ratio at ATXI than you do at Ameren Illinois Transmission. Is there any chance that you guys can increase the equity ratio at Ameren Illinois Transmission up to the 56%, and if so how do you have to do that?","Kevin, this is Marty. At the Ameren Illinois, we would really reﬂect the capital structure of that legal entity. So I would say to assume that going forward. And of course it's a holistic business, Ameren Illinois with gas, electric and transmission. As we noted earlier, both in the gas and the electric distribution businesses, we're targeting a 50% equity ratio there, in keeping with the agreements we have for rate making under both of those two areas. So again, Kevin, I would look -- as you look ahead, today and in the future and I'd simply look at the equity ratio for Ameren Illinois business overall."
"Okay, that's helpful. And then on the timing on a CapEx refresh, assuming the legislation in Missouri gets done by the 18th, when are you guys going to be in a position to actually refresh your outlook?","I think, Kevin, as we've been given the spot, obviously we have reported out today, both in our prepared remarks and Q&A sort of the status of the ongoing wind negotiations, there again looking to ﬁle CCNs some by June 30, some by later in the year. We updated you on the situation in terms of the legislation. As we look ahead, I think it would be reasonable to assume that we might update the plans as early as the third quarter call. But then again, as it has been more typical we've done that in conjunction with our year-end call. So I think we will, again, we're progressing well on both of those initiatives. But I think we'll let both of those things play out a little further and be thinking again either late this year or early next in terms of an update."
"And just to clarify, on the legislatively related to CapEx, you guys already have a line of sight of what you want to do, correct? Like, you know what the projects are behind the 1 billion?","Yes, we ﬁled our ﬁling back in 2016 and outlined a billion dollars and I would say that we continue to reﬁne that and make sure that we got exactly the right projects. But that gives you a pretty good glimpse of where we're headed on the grid modernization."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay, that's great. Thank you very much.","Thanks, Kevin.  Operator  Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi, guys, a nitty-gritty tax reform question probably for Marty. Have you all quantiﬁed what the ex sort of unprotected accumulated deferred federal income taxes and what's the time horizon, either in the Missouri bill or in something in the Illinois, what the time horizon is for refunding that level back to customers?","Michael, probably in the details of the regulatory ﬁlings, those things are probably embedded, but I'll be honest with you. Oﬀ the top of my head, I don't have that number and I do think that the actual timing at the ﬂow back is somewhat still up in the air as it relates to especially Missouri where we don't yet have a deﬁnitive timeline on what amount that would be ﬂowing back to customers. So, that's something, Michael, I just don't have oﬀ the top of my head. We can see if we can provide that to you over time, but I don't think either we have it in our 10-Q that we plan to ﬁle either, so it will be maybe something we will have to provide you over time.  Operator  Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the ﬂoor back over to Mr. Fischer for closing comments.     Thank you.
