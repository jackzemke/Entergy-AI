Question,Answer
"Hi, this is Robin (inaudible) on for Jeremy. With one week left in the Missouri legislative session, any updates on the right of ﬁrst refusal legislation that you've been supporting? And   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   additionally, has this or any other recent Missouri legislative developments inﬂuence your outlook for MISO or transmission opportunities in the state?","Yeah, look, you're right, we've got just a little bit of time left at the legislative session. This is Marty Lyons, by the way. Hence on May 12th at 6:00 PM and we have been supportive of right of ﬁrst refusal legislation that's been moving along in the legislature, and so you've probably been following House Bill 992 and Senate Bill 568. We certainly support the legislative eﬀorts there, both bills have been heard in committees and we'll see whether there is any action on those bills as we approach the end of the session. So we again continue to believe that right of ﬁrst refusal legislation as a positive and certainly would allow transmission infrastructure to be built more rapidly in our state and at cost competitive level. So we're very supportive of that, we'll see whether it gets through, it's hard to predict. Any piece of legislation, whether it will get through given the various priorities the legislature has. But in terms of the latter part of your question, whether that's inﬂuencing our thoughts on any of our path forward, I would say no, as we look ahead, we continue to invest in a reliable clean energy transition, meaning, both reliable energy delivery infrastructure, renewable energy as well as transmission. So we'll continue to pursue those things. We do think things like right of ﬁrst refusal are important to make sure that that infrastructure buildout can happen eﬃciently, eﬀectively and maintain a good reliable system, but we'll keep forging forward. So thanks for your question."
