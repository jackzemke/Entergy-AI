Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Paul.     Good morning, Paul."
"Sorry to have missed this, but you went over the sales growth for Missouri and Illinois, I think with 1% weather adjusted and leap year adjusted for Illinois year-to-date, is that correct?","Yeah, let me -- let me go over that again Paul just overall. We talked about for Missouri weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial were about ﬂat. Excluding the impacts of our energy eﬃciency programs, we have seen a little bit of growth there oﬀset by as you know we had a leap day beneﬁt last year. So overall ﬂat there. Also in industrial class, Missouri is pretty ﬂat as well.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Over in the Illinois area, the weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial is actually down about a percent. As you know, we increased the energy eﬃciency eﬀorts this year and I think that's being reﬂected in those lower sales. And then in Illinois, industrial was down about 4%. As we noted on the call, it's certainly important to remember that in our Illinois service territory we're fully decoupled today based on the passage of the law last December where we increased our energy eﬃciency eﬀorts, we also had decoupling associated with that. So those sales declines are not aﬀecting bottom-line results."
"Okay. And just back to Missouri, the ﬂat numbers were inclusive of your energy eﬃciency eﬀorts and leap day and weather, correct? -- weather --","Yeah, that's correct, Paul. And those are -- and all those stats I gave you too were for the 9 months year-to-date. In terms of Missouri, which you asked about speciﬁcally, we're actually seeing some positives this quarter in terms of growth in both residential and commercial customer accounts. So that's nice, about half a percent residential and almost a percent in commercial. So we're seeing a little bit of growth there and when we look at the economy, of course, as you know, this morning I think nationally, the unemployment number came out at 4.1%.  We've been staying a little actually south of that a little better than that, Missouri unemployment at 4%, and who knows, maybe even a little bit less given the announcement today that nationally move down and Illinois unfortunately has been a little higher closer to 5. So, but overall I would say the unemployment has followed national trends and I would say overall the economies in both states are fairly stable."
"Okay, great. And then Warner you made some comments about the legislation being introduced, I guess as early as December perhaps, I'm sorry again if I missed this, but I guess what timeframe are you guys thinking of your legislation being impacted. And then also as I recall there was a PSC proceeding in Missouri, just sort of look at things, sort of like what you guys are talking about a legislation. Has that concluded? And I apologize, but was there anything signiﬁcant out of that. I apologize for not remembering what it was.","Always a lot of (inaudible) in Missouri. I'll comment on the timing of legislation, then I'll look to Michael Moehn to comment on the proceedings that are going on in the Missouri looking at some forward-looking things from a regulatory perspective. Big picture, we have not set a speciﬁc time in terms of when legislation would ultimately be introduced. We are very focused to try and get working with key legislators to get legislation pre-ﬁled for the legislation -- legislature starts.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Pre-ﬁling could begin as early as December, the legislature opens on January 3rd. So we don't have a speciﬁc date, but we have been working hard over the summer with our key stakeholders, with our partners to put ourselves in as good a position as we possibly can to move forward. And so we would expect that the ﬁle legislative or support the legislative initiative in 2018.  So Mike, do you want to touch on some of the other proceedings going on Missouri?     Sure, absolutely, Warner. And also I think we're just, we're going to continue to build oﬀ the good work that we made progress that we made at the end of the session last year and now speciﬁcally with respect to the initiatives in Missouri, I think you're referring to, there was an interim senate committee as well as the PSC put some workshops on to really look at these regulatory reform issues and those both have concluded. I would say in general, they were pretty positive and supportive of what we're trying to do in varying degrees, but overall supported the idea of modernizing the grid, the beneﬁts for customers and the need for some regulatory reform in the State of Missouri to make that happen."
"But can the PSC do anything on its own now, I mean I thought they were maybe looking at perhaps changing some of their own processes, Just administratively so to speak as opposed to requiring legislation to do something. Is there anything possible on that end to happen?","Yeah, I mean, look, I think the PSC does have the ability to do -- make some certainly administrative changes to the overall regulatory process to try to help facilitate that. I think that they were also advocating for some legislative changes as well to give themselves some more tools which give us really more certainty at the end of the day to make these kind of needed investments.     And Mike, you made comment on the PSC -- they were doing some workshops on some forward thinking regulatory policies around electric vehicles and those types of things. Perhaps Paul has heard a little bit about that, so maybe you can talk about some of those things which were taking place, which state it is, what that the PSC is initiated on around?     Right and that's really around these emerging technology workshops that they kicked oﬀ, and then Warner is right, I mean that's really looking at the beneﬁts of electriﬁcation and modernizing the grid, which again I think all these point back towards some needed changes within the regulatory structure to promote some of these kind of investments and again I think that they point to some things from a legislative standpoint that could occur, you know as well, you're right, I mean, I think they have some tools available to do some of these things also.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay, great. I'll let other people ask questions. Thanks a lot.","Thank you, Paul.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question."
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul. It's the morning of Pauls right away, right? Here we go.     I guess now we're going to get Paul Duboss on your next meeting.     Here we gp, here we go. We have a (inaudible)."
"Assuming that tax reforms doesn't pass, with your wind projects, are you set up to have 100% PTC? Do you have access to safe harbor turbines?","Paul, this is Marty Lyons. As it relates to that, we have been in the process of negotiation with developers and those negotiations are ongoing and part of that is determining that in fact the developers have done what's necessary to make sure that we're eligible for the PTC and that's a key part of the diligence eﬀorts as part of this and this is going on in tandem with negotiations."
"And then you talked about a potential $1billion, if this were to come to fruition, would that be additive to your current plan or would it kind of displace some other capital?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Well the current plan is which we made pretty clear in the slides, the current plan did not incorporate any investment in renewables, so there was no spending in the current plan for these renewables. So in that sense the $1 billion would be additive to that. Now as Warner talked about in his prepared remarks, what we would do is step back, evaluate our overall ﬁve- year infrastructure investment plans in the context of that incremental wind investment and we'd expect them to present probably in February of next year what our forward ﬁve-year capital plan looks like."
"You mentioned some potential re-ﬁnancings 250, what term do you think you put on that on reﬁnancing?","I don't know, it's an Ameren Illinois oﬀering. Typically we're looking out at 10- or 30-year kinds of oﬀerings."
"And then in your 18 drivers, you mentioned potential other reﬁnancings, do you have a sense of how big in timing on that?",I think as we look out to 2018 we did mention a couple of reﬁnancing opportunities. There are -- there are a couple maturities of Missouri that we were speciﬁcally speaking of. I think they total something like $350-ish million over the course of next year. So we'd be looking at opportunities to reﬁnance those maturities. I think they're two separate maturities that add up to about that number.
Do you have a ballpark group down on this?,I do not at this time.
"And then just on legislation, obviously you've gotten, I would say, to the one-yard line before, are you making progress with the parties that could ﬁlibuster?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Yeah so Paul, this is Warner. I'll comment brieﬂy. Look, as I said before, there's been a lot of work being done here what I call the oﬀ season with a host of stakeholders. So the conversations continue to be constructive and we try to make sure those that have had opposition that we reach out to them to get their input. And so it's ongoing and we are very focused to de- leverage, as Michael said a moment ago, the really strong bipartisan support that we have in both the House and the Senate as well as the stakeholders across the state to move something forward that's in the best interest of our customers and certainly the communities we serve and certainly our shareholders.  So it's -- there's still more work to be done and the team is hard at it as well as working with our partners across the state."
I think you're making some progress. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Andy."
How are you guys doing?,"We're well, how are you doing?"
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   I'm doing very well. Thank you. So just to understand the Missouri kind of clean energy initiative. So this plan was -- is made to meet that I was just curious so we have, if for whatever reason this House bill were to end up being law and the PTC was changed as it is written in that bill, how does that work? I mean obviously I understand the economics of it. But you still have to meet that standard. Is that correct?",We do. See you're referring to the renewable energy standard here at Missouri.
"Yeah, Missouri, right.","Yeah I think something to be mindful of, within that standard I mean there is a 1% cap on customers as well that we also have to balance in all of this and making sure that we comply. And so, I mean obviously that's something that we'll be mindful of -- as we work through this, and be mindful of these proposed changes in the tax law."
"Okay, sure, how do you kind of, again whether a law -- whether it becomes a law or not, a lot of people say it's doubtful, but if it were, how do you work around this, have you thought about it, I mean it's only been a day less?","So, Andy this is Warner. I mean, look, I think the legislations' 24 are the proposal to be clear (Multiple Speakers) and so we're -- we'll assess this. And as I said in my prepared remarks my sense is this particular provision will get a lot of attention over the next several weeks from key stakeholders from across the country, but we have -- we're still at session at our cell. And so the only thing as I said during our talking points is that we understand that real beneﬁt to customers, the environment and shareholders as a result of this plan. So we're very focused on it. And so we're going to work very hard to get our arms around this potential proposal as well as looking at the existing law within the State of Missouri and also be mindful that it is our desire to transition our generation portfolio to a cleaner, more diverse portfolio in a responsible fashion.  All those things come together and we expect them as things move on to be able to give a more comprehensive update on all these things certainly in February when we come and have our year-end conference call and give you a more forward-looking outlook for the next ﬁve years."
"Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Okay. And then as we talk about more of it (inaudible) when we see it, but and then the second thing is just understand on the drivers for '18, if I kind of do the math correctly, and then you kind of maybe net out the property taxes and depreciation that doesn't ﬂow through Illinois on the formula rate. Is there about 30 to 30 plus sense of upside everything else equals?","Hi, Andy. This is Marty, obviously we're not giving speciﬁc 2018 guidance. I think it in --"
No. I think of the drivers that you gave.,"Well, yeah If you look at slide 16. I think that you'll see that we gave a number of important drivers to think about as you think about 2018 and probably we are not going to go much beyond that, but I think we've given you some really good speciﬁcity to hook into. Obviously, we've got this increased investment in Ameren Transmission, the rate base is clearly expected to go up next year from 2.5 billion to 2.9 billion next year. And, as you know a little uncertainty around what the ROE will be next year. Right now we're earning 10.8% and we'll see when the FERC rules on the second complaint case and how they rule. We've got higher rate base expected next year at Ameren Illinois Electric which is subject to formulaic rate making.  The 30-year treasuries did rise over the course of this year, we'll see what happens over next year. Gas distribution business, while we don't have a rate case next year, we do get to formulaicly adjust rates based on a rider there. Since they formulaicly we get to adjust rates based on the rider there for infrastructure investments. About 50% of our CapEx qualiﬁes for those adjustments. So that's a boost.  And then we do get a little carryover next year from the rate increase that went into eﬀect in Missouri this year in April. So we will pick up the ﬁrst quarter beneﬁt next year which we quantiﬁed on slide 16. There is no Callaway refueling outage next year, that's of course $0.08. We've had some negative weather this year, we've had about a $0.06 headwind from weather this year, if we erase that next year and go to normal, that's another $0.06 pick-up and then as you mentioned, there are some other things, pluses and minuses, we expect lower interest. We talked about that on the last call, and the reﬁnancings that we did this year provide about a $15 million annual tailwind as it relates to earnings.  Paul Ridzon asked earlier about some reﬁnancings next year. I think the exact amount for next year is something like 380 million of Missouri reﬁnancings. I didn't provide what we expect to be the coupon on the new debt, but with respect to the coupons on the debt we're replacing, it's in one case 5.1%, in other case 6%, so we'll be reﬁnancing that at whatever the prevailing rates are at the time.  And then as you noted, there are always some headwinds that would be associated with some depreciation and would expect transmission and property tax headwinds as well. So we've provided I think a pretty comprehensive list of major earnings drivers for 2018.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"You deﬁnitely have. And then just follow-up on that. So when you give 2018 on the fourth quarter call, I guess these pluses right and whatever minuses but the incremental earnings that'll be based on your weather normalized earnings in '17, so whatever that is, if it's X, it will be X plus -- plus this, is that kind of the way to look at it?","Yeah, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Yeah I think typically when we think about our growth, we don't always strip out whether to base the growth on, but yeah I think I'm not sure exactly how you're thinking about it. But yeah, you look at weather normalized 2017 and then use these things to build. Consider again whether there were any sort of one-time impacts in 2017 that you'd want to take into consideration besides weather."
"Okay. I'll see you at (inaudible) on Saturday Night, okay?","Perfect Andy. I appreciate you calling in, enjoy yourself. (Multiple Speakers)  Operator  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Fallon with Citadel. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi guys, just a question for you. Good morning. What is the actual approval process for the Missouri win that you guys have proposed? Is it that you have to get the IRP approved and then there's another stage or just how do you deal with that?","Michael, why don't you take that question please?     So yeah there is no formal approval process for the IRP itself. I mean there is a review that occurs and people will comment et cetera. In terms of the speciﬁc win projects, we do have to ﬁle what's called a certiﬁcate of convenience or necessity here in the State of Missouri, a CCN. We foresee ﬁling probably in the ﬁrst half of '18. That process is really then -- you have folks come through and intervene et cetera. And so that's ultimately the approval process that occurs so that you feel good about going forward with the project.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay, and Warner, in your comments, I think you mentioned something about rider recovery, is that how you're looking to move from the CCN to the actual build phase?","So also it's part of that CCN ﬁnally and we will make an application to use this rider mechanism that's also outlined in the law and so that would be as part of that certiﬁcate process that I discussed.     You're going to understand too. I'm sorry, it's important to understand this. This rider mechanism doesn't require formal rate case, it's all, it could stun. It's a rider mechanism outside of the general rate case. Just, that's how the provisions of that work."
Exactly the and so you guys are going to have clarity on recovery before you actually commit the capital is what I'm asking?,Correct.
"Okay. And the other thing in just terms of modeling for the FERC jurisdictions in the next year, until you have an order, you should -- we should assume that you're going to continue to book at your 10.82%?",That's correct. We'll continue to look at 10.82% until we get an order that tells us to do otherwise.
"Okay. And then, you guys have highlighted additional CapEx in there tie to potential legislation, in terms of the ﬁnancing going forward should we use like an FFO to debt target or consolidated equity target or just color on how we should assume the ﬁnance side, if it comes about?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yeah, I think that it's not probably clear bright line that I'd tell you, Kevin. I think what we'll do with whether we have additional CapEx due to the Integrated Resource Plan or we have additional CapEx due to other legislative eﬀorts or other factors, we'll take a look, we'll step back and we'll take a look at the overall infrastructure investment plan. We will take a little step back and we will take a look at the overall cash ﬂows associated with the business and then assess the best way forward to ﬁnance that. As Warner said in his prepared remarks, thinking about the credit metrics, credit ratings at the parent company, at the holding companies, the consolidated equity ratios, the cash ﬂow metrics and how best to position I would say these incremental investments too for regulatory recovery and make this additive to shareholder value.  So, well, we'll take all of those factors into consideration and then think about the best path forward for ﬁnancing those. Clearly as I think you mentioned in your question, given the $10.8 billion current infrastructure investment plan that we've laid out earlier this year, given the strength of our balance sheet and credit metrics, we didn't expect to need any equity as it related to ﬁnancing that plan."
"Exactly. So when you update capital on the fourth quarter call this is a component of it as well, whatever you guys ultimately decide to do.","I think as we roll forward with for you updated prospective CapEx plans, you should expect that we will oﬀer comments as well on how we would plan to ﬁnance that overall infrastructure investment plan and related cash ﬂows."
"That's very helpful, thank you very much.","Thanks, Kevin.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line as David Emami with Verition Fund Management. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi, this is Ashar, how are you guys doing?","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Ashar, how are you doing?     Good morning, Ashar."
"Pretty good, pretty good, pretty good. I just wanted to clarify one thing Marty. So what ROE did we book on the transmission side for 2017? Is it also 10.82%?","Yes so in 2017 we've been recording the 10.82%. Last year, we actually had a temporarily higher ROE. So I think if there was any confusion, I'd say that year-over-year earnings in the third quarter on the transmission segment were relatively ﬂat. We got the beneﬁt of the increased infrastructure investments, but we had a the comparatively lower ROE because we went from an average of 12.3% ROE in the third quarter of last year to the 10.8% that we've got this year."
"Okay. So then as we monetize we go from '17 and '18 based on facts we have right now, there is going to be no change in ROE, right, as you book for '18 versus '17, correct?","As I answered earlier in a question Ashar, we will continue to book 10.8% until such time as the FERC would tell us to do otherwise. So, as you know, there is the second complaint case that's outstanding, the ALJ in that particular case had ruled that we should perhaps move down from a 10.8% overall ROE which includes the 50 basis point adder down to 10.2 with the 50 basis point adder. As we said on the call, we've made ﬁlings to suggest that, that second complaint case should be dismissed for the reasons we discussed on the call and it's uncertain when the FERC even though they've got a quorum will rule on the second complaint case. So until that time that they do rule and until such time as they would tell us to change the ROE, we will continue to book to a 10.8%.  I would mention that for about a 15-month period after the second complaint case was ﬁled, we did accrue a reserve of about $40 million for the potential that the ROE would be lowered to 10.2% and then we would need to refund that money. So we've got that reserve set up to the extent that the FERC would rule consistent with the ALJ, but as I mentioned, again it is uncertain what the FERC will do you actually at this point in time."
"Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then Marty can I just, if I heard you correctly, I apologize for listening to couple of the other things simultaneously. You said that there was 15 million of interest savings from the ﬁnancing from this year 2017 which would ﬂow through to next year, did I hear that correct?   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","Well, we get a partial savings this year as it relates to that. And then we'll get the full beneﬁt next year. So, year-over-year you wouldn't get the full uptick from the 15 million. But just highlighting that earlier this year, we did reﬁnance some debt at Ameren Missouri that produced annual interest savings of 15 million. And then also mentioned that as we look in the next year there are a couple of other opportunities as we sit here today to incrementally do some rate improvement."
"And could I assume new issuance costs around 3.5 or something like that or something in that ballpark between 3 and 3.5, would that be fair based on current market conditions?","That might be fair. Again, I decline to comment on speciﬁcally what we'll issue. We'll between now and then consider what the best tenure is for an Amaren Missouri oﬀering given our debt ladders and other considerations and obviously price is based on the market conditions at that time."
"Okay. Okay, thank you so much.","Thank you. Ashar.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. There are no further questions at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fischer for any closing remarks.     Thank you. As we discussed today, we believe Ameren shares oﬀer investors attractive total return potential based on our strong expected earnings growth outlook and solid dividend. I'd like to remind you that a replay of this call will be available for one year on our website. If you have questions, please call the contacts listed on our earnings release. Thank you for your interest in Ameren and have a great day.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  Operator   Thank you, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
