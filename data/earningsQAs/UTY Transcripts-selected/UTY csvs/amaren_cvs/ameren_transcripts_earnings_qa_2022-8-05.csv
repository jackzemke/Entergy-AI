Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, Marty.","Good morning, Shar. How are you today?"
Not too bad. Not too bad. It's Friday.,Very good.
"Marty, let me ask you. Just thank you for the visibility obviously on the Tranche 1 opportunities, but just a two-part question here. What's your, I guess, conﬁdence level on the competitive slice or how should we be thinking about maybe your ability to capture that? Is there a technical or cost of capital facet to your advantage? And then does this -- how does this sort of interact with your prior CapEx and sort of rate base guide? I mean, some of the projects do break ground in '25, so could these be accretive to your 6% to 8%? Thanks.","Yes, you bet Shar. Good questions, and you're right. I hope you have a good Friday and a good, good weekend. But back to your questions. In terms of the competitive projects coming out of Tranche 1, as we highlighted, a little over $700 million of those. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we do believe we're well positioned to compete for and successfully execute those. I think the bottom line is that we believe we're really well positioned to eﬃciently build, operate and maintain those assets over time. The projects that are competitive are within our footprint. There are places where we have strong relationships with local communities, regulators, suppliers, contractors, et cetera. And we've been operating in this area for many years. So we know the land. We know the environmental conditions and issues. And I'd tell you, too, that we've been working for several years now. As you know, we've developed billions of dollars' worth of transmission projects and we've been working over time with suppliers and contractors to really bring down the cost of construction.  And because these projects, these competitor projects, are contiguous with other assets that we own and operate, we think we're really well positioned to operate and maintain these assets at a low cost over time. So those are some of the reasons that we believe at the end of the day we're well positioned to compete and execute on those projects. So we look forward to   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   participating in that competitive process over time. And then your second question really got to some of the incremental capital into our plan. I'll let Michael comment on that, but you're right. In terms of the $1.8 billion worth of projects that were assigned to us, we do again expect to begin those in 2025. And those cash ﬂows and capital expenditures to be incurred over between 2025 and the end of the decade. Michael, any comments in terms of the added CapEx?     Yes. Hey, good morning, Shar. I think Marty said it well. In terms of the capital plan itself, Shar, and we've talked about this, I mean, I think that it's great to start getting some clarity here around these diﬀerent projects. And as Marty said, I think some of this could even beneﬁt the ﬁve-year plan. As we have indicated, we're going to step back and what we typically do with our cadence is we'll update all of this in the February timeframe. And my sense is this has got the ability to be accretive to our ﬁve-year capital plan, as well as just additive to the overall runway as we talk about the growth story. I think as we, if you kind of remember, if you reﬂect back on the $48 billion that we have there now, that number used to be $40 billion. We captured about $5 billion associated with transmission projects. That was broadly to try to look at these LRTP projects over the next 10 years. So I think we got it in there, and now it's a matter of where it just ends up by year, if that makes sense."
It does.,"Yes, Shar."
Sorry.,"Yes, Shar, this is Marty. I think Michael touched on a good thing. As we started the year, we looked ahead to Q2, and we noted that there were going to be some important updates in Q2, and I think that's exactly what came through. In terms of the integrated resource plan in Missouri, that indicated about $2.7 billion of incremental spend between now and 2031. And then as Michael said, the LRTP adding another $1.8 billion of expenditures that we have assigned to us, as well as this potential for $700 million of additional competitive projects. So as Michael said, all those things gave us conﬁdence to add that $8 billion to that long-term capital expenditure outlook."
"Perfect. Perfect, and then just, I know you just broadly touched on it a little bit on just the Inﬂation Reduction Act. I mean, obviously Sinema proposed some changes. I think we go to a   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   vote on Saturday. Can you just touch a little bit on the tax side? I mean, some of the utilities have talked about a technical ﬁx with the 50% AMT. Are you and sort of EEI lobbying against it? Could you get a carve out? And then if there is an enactment of that AMT, how do we just sort of think about the cash ﬂows and rate base growth impact and the recovery timing? Thanks.","Well, Shar, there's a lot there, and as you noted, even based on the reports this morning, there seems to be some moving pieces as it relates to the corporate minimum tax. Let me just say this overall about the legislation, we're excited about the potential tax credits in the legislation, especially the wind and the solar, given the 4,700 megawatts of renewables that we looked to add in Missouri by 2040 based on our integrated resource plan. That's all pretty exciting. Even net of CMT impact, we think the legislation is good for Ameren, for our customers in both Missouri and Illinois because it really should lower the cost of the clean energy transition in both states. And that's not even mentioning some of the other positives in there, whether it's the credits for nuclear, storage, CCUF, hydrogen, things we talked about on the call, all of which align with our long-term resource plan. So that's all really good. The other things you're aware of, you know, things like the PTC for solar is a positive versus the prior ITC and transfer ability provisions, which are things that we really think could help us to pass the value associated with some of these tax credits to our customers more swiftly.  So like I said, net, we think that the legislation overall is good and will help facilitate a lower cost transition to this clean energy. As it relates to the CMT, it is applicable to us, given that we have pretax book income of greater than $1 billion, but probably premature to speculate on exactly what that impact would be given, as you mentioned, some of the moving pieces that aren't even really clear to us at this particular time. But at the end of the day, we do think -- based on what we have seen, we do believe that the cash ﬂow impacts would be manageable. And as would, and Michael can comment on this better, but also the impacts on credit metrics and credit ratings. So that's I guess where we stand on things. Shar, hopefully I answered all of your questions.  Michael, do you have anything to add?     Yes, I think Marty, at a high level, you gave it good justice there. I mean, I think overall we do see it as being manual. There are a lot of moving pieces here, and so I think that's why we're really trying to stay away from the speciﬁcs. But as we look at it and model it out we do think, as Marty said, both from a cash ﬂow as well as any sort of impact, Shar, on our FFO to debt metrics that it deﬁnitely is something that is manageable. And I think the important thing to remember is just the net beneﬁt to customers, just from an overall credit standpoint. Certainly, on the Missouri side as you think about this clean energy transition that we're about to go through."
"Fantastic, guys. Listen, have a great weekend and appreciate the disclosures.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)  You too, Shar.  Operator   Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy."
"Just wanted to round out the MISO Tranche 1 conversation a little bit more. And would Ameren entertain the notion of pursuing competitive processes beyond the $700 million identiﬁed, or is that the extent of what you would consider? And also, we have heard about there being kind of some incremental upside to these projects, maybe 10% to 15% of CapEx additionally for kind of ancillary components to these projects. And just wondering if you had any thoughts along those lines.","Yes, Jeremy, good questions. You certainly will look to compete for these $700 million. If there are other projects that are competitive, certainly we'll take a look at those as well. We're not limited to these, but of course, as you know, in many of the surrounding states, you have entities with rights of ﬁrst refusal. So, look, we feel good about the ones that have been assigned to us. I can't emphasize that enough. This $1.8 billion, we feel great about, and we'll go after the $700 million. If we see other opportunities, we'll certainly look to compete in those as well. I wouldn't speculate right now, Jeremy, in terms of any incremental investment beyond these. These are the estimates that really came from MISO, and as we indicated in our call, prepared remarks, we'll certainly be looking to next steps is really work on more reﬁned design, procurement, the regulatory approvals, et cetera, and give updates on what we think the overall value of these projects are, perhaps when we get around to February and update our overall plans. But for now, we think these are the best estimates to be able to provide."
"Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just as it relates to Rush Island here. If you could provide any incremental thoughts with regards to transmission upgrade opportunity here. Can you provide any estimates on what these upgrades could look like? I know it's bigger than a breadbox, but trying to kind of scope out what that might look like.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes, good question. Look, we again gave a pretty good update in our prepared remarks on Rush Island. We did indicate that design and procurement is underway with respect to the upgrade projects that MISO had approved. I mean, I think our best estimate today, and this is a bit of a broad range, probably in the $100 million to $150 million range. And but like I said, we'll be able to reﬁne that further as we go through the design and procurement activities."
Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi. Good morning, team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity. Hope you guys are well.","Hi, Julien. Hope you're well also."
"Thank you. Thank you, sir. So maybe I want to come back to the Rush Island situation. I know you mentioned '25 here, for instance, on retirement here. But I want to talk about these other CSAPR regulations and NOx, and just trying to understand how that lines up. I know that there's some proposals out there for 2026, and obviously you've got a couple other plants, Labadie and Sioux. How do you see this playing out because obviously there's EPA regs in terms of hypothetical ether, and then there's sort of reality of them lining up against your portfolio in a pretty meaningful way? I just wanted to understand sort of the speciﬁcs as to-- I mean, obviously, it's subject to litigation, but how do you see this playing out more speciﬁcally for your portfolio and as you see to try to balance things?","Yes, so as it relates to the CSAPR rules, look, it's something we're not only monitoring, but engaging with EPA in terms of providing comment. Of course, Meramec is retiring this year. Rush Island, as you mentioned, looks like it's going to retire in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Again, we don't expect the transmission investments to be fully completed until 2025. As we noted, we have proposed some limited operations between now and then, between now and when the plant would ultimately retire, all subject to the court's ruling in terms of operating parameters, as well as the ultimate closure date. But certainly, going to signiﬁcantly reduce NOx   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   emissions as we ramp down towards closure of that facility. So I think the focus really becomes, Julien, then on NOx controls at Labadie and Sioux. And I would remind you there that we've made signiﬁcant investments over time in terms of NOx controls, and we're more than complying with all the current standards that are out there.  So with respect to the proposed additional rules, I think we'll wait to comment on speciﬁcally what the impacts will be at Labadie and Sioux over time until we get the ﬁnal rules, which we expect to come out next March. But I will tell you that what we'll be doing, and we are, we're analyzing strategies for compliance and making sure that we get the full beneﬁt of the controls that we do have in place today at Labadie and Sioux."
"Yes, understood, excellent. Thank you. And then if I can, just jumping in on the inﬂation conversation. Obviously, you ﬁled here your latest iteration of the rate case. But how are you seeing sort of cost inﬂation manifest itself across your portfolio, and how do you think about balancing that, given the test year embedded in the current rate case and any other leverage you might have?","Yes. Thanks, Julien. This is Michael. Yes, look, inﬂation, certainly we're in a little diﬀerent environment today, but I mean I think as we've talked historically and we've shown you a couple of times, even had a slide I think that went through '16 through '21 and our overall operating costs were down about 3%. And so, look, we remain focused on it. You referenced this Missouri rate review that we just ﬁled here. I would tell you that's really predicated on a lot of capital investment within the Smart Energy Plan. We outlined, I think, the beneﬁts the customers are getting associated with those investments. And obviously, it's also being impacted by what we just talked about with respect to Rush Island, and the net fuel cost and operating that plant in a more limited fashion as well. So when you really cut through what's going on in that case, it's really not about O&M cost, which I think is a testament to what this team has been doing in terms of just looking for ways to continue to hold down costs wherever possible.  So in the present environment, I think we're managing well through it. As we noted on the call, we had some O&M was up, but it was really driven by some one-time thing between the COLI performance, as well some storm costs, and when you cut through it, it certainly lines up with where expectations were in the February timeframe we released guidance."
"Got it. And just prospectively here, just if I could push a little bit further. Obviously, you've done a good job sort of to date, if you will. If you look prospectively whether that's related to the cadence of labor relation negotiations, et cetera. I mean, what kind of trajectory in inﬂation are you seeing sort of in real time, if you can comment a little bit more.","Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   Yes, look, yes absolutely. Look, I'll keep my comments consistent with where we've been in the past. Marty and I and the rest of the team are very focused on these costs and doing all that we can to control what we can control. And look, we aspire to keep these O&M costs, I think we said this before that really ﬂat over the ﬁve-year horizon if at all possible. It's obviously, it's a bit more challenging in this environment. But again, as we look to our capital plan, we look to the investments that we're making in automation and digital and smart meters, I mean, we're using all of those things to increase productivity, lower cost where we can, and we're going to stay focused on it and just do absolutely all that we can because we know, again, what it means to our customers. We understand. We talked about this from our capital perspective, for every dollar of O&M we reduce, we can spend an equivalent $7 of capital. And so it is certainly top of mind and a continuous everyday focus here."
"Excellent. Thank you, team. Have a good weekend. Stay tuned.","Thank you, Jillian.  Operator  Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please proceed with your question."
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Paul."
"So just on Rush Island, just sort of technically speaking, if you don't get the-- I mean, if the courts don't completely go your way, the plant to shut down, what would actually happen, or do we have an idea about what would happen?","Yes, I guess I don't want to speculate that, Paul. I think that it's obviously a process that we're still working through with the court and the court proceedings. And so we laid out for you on Slide 9 the facts as they stand today, and certainly wouldn't speculate if we get to that crossroads. I would point you on Slide 9, we said that with respect to the court, the March 31, 2024, compliance date remains in eﬀect, unless extended by the court. So the court has got that ability, and certainly don't want to speculate as to what the court will or won't do, and we'll let these proceedings play out.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)"
"Okay, fair enough. I don't want to push that, I guess. It's all hypothetical, I guess, to a certain degree. So with respect to wind curtailments that we've been seeing in the area, I was wondering if you could tell us what you've been seeing, not just in Ameren, but the greater Ameren neighborhood, so to speak. As well as how Tranche 1 and other sort of activity occurring, like, I guess Grain Belt is talking about a 25% I think increase among other things, and there are a lot of moving pieces, I guess, to put it lightly. I'm just sort of wondering if you could just sort of comment about what you're seeing there in terms of additions of generation plants, traditional plants shutting down, and transmission, what you see sort of the current situation with wind curtailments, just generically speaking, in your general region and what Tranche 1 and other things might do with respect to the issue.","Yes, Paul, I guess I don't have a speciﬁc comment on wind curtailments, and something we can follow up with you on. That said, what I have seen recently is a map of these Tranche 1 projects overlaid against where we're seeing congestion across MISO. And I will tell you there's tremendous alignment there. Meaning, these planned projects in Tranche 1 really align well with where we're seeing congestion across the footprint, really promise to alleviate some of that congestion. And I think that's why and if you go back a year or so ago, Warner made a comment about these being, I forget the word he used, but kind of no brainer projects or something like that. And no regrets projects, and I think what he really meant by those is that whether we proceed towards future one, two, or three in MISO, these projects are very foundational, no matter where you go, and they're needed today to address some of the congestion that we're already seeing within the MISO footprint.  And as I look ahead to Tranche 2, 3 and 4, especially based on what we're seeing coming out of this IRA legislation, I think it's really going to push us beyond that Future 1 to more of like a closer to a Future 2 kind of outlook. And my sense is that some of that will end up getting baked into the extent of the projects that are approved in future tranches, including Tranche 2, which is still expected to be approved by late next year. So again, don't have a speciﬁc comment on your question about what we're seeing currently, but to your question about these transmission projects and the need to alleviate congestion issues we're seeing, absolutely they align very well."
Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much and have a great weekend.,You too.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)
"Hi, good morning, Mike. Good morning, Marty. Thanks for taking my questions.",You bet. Good morning.
"I guess, ﬁrst on the Missouri rate ﬁling, just if I think about you ﬁled in '21. You're ﬁling again in '22. We have the PISA legislation passed. Just now that you maybe have more clarity on the forward-looking CapEx plan, what kind of frequency of rate ﬁlings are you expecting in Missouri for the next two to three years?","Anthony, we haven't actually said. I mean, you're right. We have been on kind of a two-year cycle here at this point. And look, I mean, we obviously want to continue to stretch these out as much as we possibly can. But just given the pace that we've been on from a capital standpoint, two years has been sort of what the required pace has needed to be. I think the only other thing to just keep in mind is that we are required to ﬁle every four years, just because of the fuel adjustment clause. But otherwise, we do want to try to stretch them out as long as we can."
"Great, and then, I guess, lastly, this may be harder or may not even be a great question. If I think about the Futures 1 projects that the company will bid on, do the incumbent utilities-- you guys operate in that jurisdiction. It seems that maybe the incumbent utilities are more likely to submit a proposal for a more robust-like infrastructure because it's in your jurisdiction, you're looking at a having an asset, be active for 50 years, 60 years, or something like that, whereas a competitor coming in there may just meet the bare minimal of a design spec, and it makes it more aﬀordable and wins the competitive process. Is that possible or is the design spec the same for everyone?","I really think MISO is going to do their best to make sure that there are very clear scope and design and construction expectations and attributes such that you can really get apples-to- apples comparisons in these bids. And I gave a fairly extensive answer to a question earlier. At the end of the day, I just want to reinforce we really do believe that we're well positioned to eﬃciently build, operate and maintain these assets over time. But it is our expectation that there will be every eﬀort made to ensure there's apples-to-apples comparisons."
"Great. Thanks so much, and have a wonderful weekend.   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)","You too.     Thanks, Anthony.  Operator  Our next question is from Neil Kalton with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question."
"Hi, guys. How are you?","Good, Neil.     Good morning."
"Yes, so I know it's not your project. Grain Belt Express, though, there's been some recent developments. The capacity, as Paul mentioned, is going up on the project, and I would imagine IRA probably has some positive implications for the economics and prospects. I would love your latest thoughts on that project, if you will.","Hey, Neil. It's Marty. Absolutely. We laid out in this updated Integrated Resource Plan some pretty signiﬁcant ambitions in terms of addition of renewables. We're talking about 2,800 megawatts through 2030, 4,300 megawatts by 2035, and we have ﬁled a couple of CCNs related to that. As you know, the Boomtown project, Huck Finn project, a couple of projects we outlined on this call. But there's a long way to go in terms of the addition of renewables. So we have issued a request for proposal and are evaluating the best options for our customers.  As we have discussed with you and others over time, Grain Belt remains a project that is of interest, primarily because of the opportunity to bring wind energy from the west, the Kansas region, for example, into Missouri for the beneﬁt of our Missouri customers. And in fact, in our Integrated Resource Plan, it highlighted the potential to utilize that line to bring in as much as 1,000 megawatts of wind energy. So it is something that we continue to evaluate, and we'll   Ameren Corp (AEE US Equity)   evaluate as we look at the opportunities for renewables that come out of this RFP. Ultimately, as you know, we want to make sure we pick the right projects for our customers from the standpoint of aﬀordability and a good mix of assets to meet their needs over time."
"Great, thanks. And then one other question. I think in your prepared remarks you mentioned hydrogen as being a-- you sort of mentioned that's part of the IRA. Can you elaborate a bit more on sort of how you're thinking about hydrogen? Is this sort of a nearer-term opportunity or any thoughts on that as well, please?","Yes, Neil, in our updated Integrated Resource Plan that we ﬁled in June, we actually added a 1,200-megawatt combined cycle plant by 2031. And the idea there is to get to our net zero ambitions by 2045. The idea would be to construct that with an eye towards transitioning to hydrogen, or hydrogen blend with carbon capture retroﬁt by as early as the 2040 timeframe. So it's with regard to that project speciﬁcally that we think about that."
"Okay, great. Thank you.","Yes. Take care.  Operator  We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Marty Lyons for closing comments.     Great. Hey, thank you all for joining us today. I hope what you heard is that we had a very strong start to 2022. We are looking to ﬁnish strong for the remainder of this year and we remain focused on continuing to deliver signiﬁcant, long-term value to our customers, the communities that we serve, and to our shareholders. And so anyway, we look forward to seeing many of you at conferences over the next couple of months. And we, again, appreciate you joining us. Have a great day.  Operator  This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.
