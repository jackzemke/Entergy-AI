Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shahriar."
"Good morning. So just starting Bob with the business review priorities you kind of discussed in the prepared remarks and you kind of laid out on Slide 5. Speciﬁcally, kind of on the dividend comment, can we maybe try to parse through the words here a little more closely? I mean, obviously, we understand that you guys are holding the dividend at the current level for obvious reasons, and that's obviously consistent with your support for the dividend. But I guess what is the language around quote unquote potentially overtime mean, as we think about the payout ratio bounds in the near-term? I guess, what do you mean by potentially? Could this mean a faster or slower trajectory to get to the 60% range. I mean we've received a lot of inbounds on these three words. So any sort of visibility you could provide would probably be a reprieve.","Yes. Sure, Shahr. I appreciate that. As we said in our prepared remarks slightly more detailed than on the slide, our current payout ratio is 65% to the extent that that were to go up, our expectation and plan would be to return to 65% without cutting the dividend. That's consistent with what we said when we announced the review.  We're doing a business review right now. So I can't answer exactly what the payout ratio might end up. But if it is above 65%, our expectation is to get it back to 65% without cutting the dividend."
"Got it. Okay. I guess we'll wait for additional color there. And then Bob, you took a large impairment on the solar projects. I understand the test was triggered by the decision to not stay   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   on the investment ITC recognition [ph]. But what part of the impairment test did you actually fail?","Shahr, hey, it's Steve. I can take that. So just to be speciﬁc, this has to do with our contracted assets solar portfolio. And there were really two primary purposes for the development of the portfolio. The ﬁrst was to develop expertise in developing solar, so we could employ that expertise credibly across our regulated footprint, which is what we're doing right now. So in eﬀect, that task has been completed.  The second was to generate investment tax credits. We believe given the attractiveness of our decarbonization and resiliency capital investment opportunity, the capital we've used in the past to generate those ITCs can be employed elsewhere to greater long-term shareholder older beneﬁt.  So the ﬁrst sort of gating decision was are we going to continue to invest in that portfolio for purposes of generating ITC, and the answer we've said is no. That led to a subsequent impairment test where we looked at the carrying value or book value when we compared it to a series of discounted and non-discounted cash ﬂows consistent with accounting guidance, and ultimately determined that the fair market value was lower than the carrying value and that led to the impairment."
"Okay. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And just really quick lastly from me. Just from a legislative process standpoint, I guess how should we think about the likelihood of slippage into a reconvene session? I mean, put diﬀerently, if you had ﬁrm clarity on March 27, could we see the schedule accelerate?","Shahr, it's Bob. It's way too early to predict what the timing of the Virginia General Assembly, and any action on any particular bill, including ones that relate to us may be. As we laid out in our prepared remarks, General Assembly is scheduled to adjourn on the 25th of February. And then the Governor -- bills go to the Governor at that point or earlier once they've passed. And bills that arrive on the Governor's desk with fewer than seven days left in the legislative session, the governor has 30 days to act on those bills. If he chooses to propose an amendment or veto a bill, then the General Assembly, as you noted, comes back for a one-day reconvene session, and then they address those gubernatorial actions. So, I can't give you any more clarity, because we don't know what the time frame on the General Assembly may be. Once we do know something, that will allow us to address our own schedule."
"Okay. Terriﬁc, guys. Thank you so much, and I'll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Thank you, Shar.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research."
"Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks.","Good morning, Steve."
Can you hear me okay?,Yes.
"There you go, great. So just ﬁrst on the credit comment, could you -- you say you're kind of both targeting high BBB, but then also seem to imply kind of targeting above current met -- current thresholds, which I think your ratings are mid-BBB at the parent. So could you just clarify are you targeting the mid-BBB and above that, or are you targeting high-BBB, because that's a big diﬀerence?","Yes. Hey, Steve, this is Steve. I'll take that one. So on an issuer rating, we're actually high-BBB at two of the three rating agencies. At Moody, we're mid-BBB. Our objective is to maintain those targeted rating categories, and the downgrade thresholds at least at Moody's associated with that is 14% on the down and 17% on the up. As we mentioned in the call script, we intend to meet and exceed that downgrade threshold even in times of temporary pressures from costs like fuel costs and regulatory adjustments. And that has been one of the drivers of our underperformance historically, relative to our downgrade threshold. So we're still targeting high-BBB, it's where we are on two of the three agencies from an issuer rating perspective, and the appropriate downgrade threshold, at least from the Moody's perspective, is 14%."
"Okay. So for the senior unsecured rating, which we typically use, that would be mid-BBB?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Depending on the speciﬁc methodology, but yes."
"Okay. So, you're basically targeting the ratings you're currently at, not a higher rating than your current?",That's right.
"Okay. And then, on -- just on the payout comment, just to maybe clarify that a little better, trying to know, at this point in the process is purposely probably -- purposely vague. Is it fair to say you're saying that in the likely outcome, your payout ratio will be above the 65% for a period of time? And then you'll obviously get back in target to that?","Yes, Steve. It's -- I apologize for not giving you a speciﬁc answer. But what we're saying is, to the extent that the payout ratio changes as a result of the review that if they're -- an obvious point, if our EPS changes as a result of the review and the dividend remains constant, as we have said, it will, that changes the payout ratio. And what we're indicating is if there is a change in the payout ratio, we're going to get back to it, but without reducing the dividend. That's the point that we're attempting to make here."
Okay. But that's more still kind of hypothetical or theoretical for now. It's not the likely outcome of --,"Correct. We're in a business review. And as we have indicated in prior calls and this call as well, we don't yet know what the outcome of that business review will be. So yes, it's hypothetical is a good way of describing it."
"And then just lastly the timeline the overtime, is there any like timeline for the overtime?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Again, we can't set that until we're ﬁnished with the review. So, not yet."
Great. Understood. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy.     Good morning, Jeremy."
"Just want to pivot a little bit if I could towards Millstone here, interesting backdrop here. Just wondered if you can provide us updated thoughts with what's the status to state regional discussions around Millstone. How are you thinking about locking in more of this market upside to the asset?","Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. As we've talked about before, we believe Millstone is a great asset, and we believe the policymakers in New England are recognizing increasingly its value for them to meet reliability and any chance to meet the kinds of decarbonization targets that they may have.  Our focus is thinking about ways that we can ensure the long-term viability of Millstone, and we're happy to have conversations with policymakers about opportunities to do that. As we noted in our opening comments, the existing Millstone contract has been very good for customers in Connecticut in recent months and over the last year. We see the possibility of being able to take action with policymakers to give us the certainty we would need in order to extend the life of Millstone and have that valuable resource for New England for some time to   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   come. We don't have as yet speciﬁc approach to that. But, we're certainly interested in engaging with policymakers on that."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then kind of switching gears and realize on [ph] at risk of putting the horse ahead of the cart here, but as (inaudible) potential asset sales, I was just wondering does this sore impairment kind of tip that you might look to sell this asset as part of the business review, and I guess we're out with news out of black hill this morning with regards to their thoughts on LDC sales. And so, was just wondering if you had any thoughts on what could potentially be or what could be prioritizing the sale processes if you chose to do that?","Jeremy, I would say that as part of the review, we're looking at each and every one of our assets, and in consistent with the priorities and principles that we've laid out on today's call and supplement to what we provided on third quarter call, that's what we'll inform our ultimate steps as relates to the business review, to the extent that there is changes to business mix, which is again, something we're evaluating as part of review, but no decisions have been made. So we'll look at everything dispassionately to position the company to provide the greatest long- term value to shareholders."
Got it. That's helpful. And just a real quick last one if I could. If you might be able to kind of parse more ﬁnally what we might expect on 2Q business review update versus the 3Q Investor Day? Is the 2Q update really just an outcome of the Virginia legislation or potentially more updates on other elements of the plan?,"Let me do it from the reverse perspective, which is the Investor Day, we intend to provide a comprehensive business and ﬁnancial update. It will eﬀectively be at the conclusion of the review process. The spring update which is going to coincide with timing around the Virginia legislative session will give us an opportunity to comment on what if any changes occurred during the session that would impact Virginia, where are our perspectives on that, and how that informs the appropriate next steps of the business review."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question.","Good morning, Durgesh."
"Good morning, Bob. Just Steve, I think this maybe in your view house. I just wanted some clariﬁcation on the impairment. And then how does it impact your base earnings? So I know like that could impact your future earnings if you decide not to invest there, because that's what you're suggesting. But when I look at the Q1 '23 to Q1 2022 bridge on Slide 8, there is a down arrow, because of solar ITC. So I'm just -- is there -- does the impairment impact your ongoing base business earnings?","No. So the impairment doesn't change that the revenue we generate under those existing PPAs. The impairment does have a slight impact on the depreciable life, because the -- or the depreciation rather than the depreciable life because the carrying value is now lower than previously assumed.  The bridge is something diﬀerent. The bridge when we refer to that ITC -- solar ITC, it's eﬀectively the lack of solar ITCs consistent with the comments we've made on this call and previously with the regard to pivoting that capital allocation elsewhere in our business. So it's eﬀectively simply saying that, a year ago, we would have had some solar ITC in earnings, this quarter of this year, we do not have that. So the impairment is a diﬀerent -- it doesn't have any impact on that bridge."
"Got it. So basically, Q1 '23 over Q1 '22 is really lack of new solar ITCs, right?",That's right. It's about $0.04.
"Thanks. And then just one quick bookkeeping question. The Q2 timeline that you mentioned for the business review update, is that the Q1 call or like, are you going to do another meeting, or 8-K just any thoughts around that?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","It will depend a little bit on the timing, Durgesh. We do typically have our ﬁrst quarter call in early May. It may coincide, it may not. That won't keep us from sort of advancing the discussion around the business review when we have the information necessary to actually have that discussion."
"Understood. Thanks, guys.","Thanks, Durgesh.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Fowler with UBS."
"Hey, Bob. Hey, Steve. How are you this morning?",Hi -- Ross.
"Just a couple of things to clean a couple of things out. But I apologize, the call cutout, if this is already answered. But the cap -- the go-forward CapEx that you have had associated with sort of that competitive solar adjustment, can you sort of scale that for us and sort of the cash that you wouldn't be spending into that going forward?","Yes. Ross, that's on the order of about a $800 million."
"Okay. And then sort of a bigger picture question following on to Jeremy's question. And I appreciate the fact that you're in a strategic review at the moment, but just maybe even anecdotally, Bob, as you look at this -- I think Steve made some comments around the need for signiﬁcant balance sheet repair, and if we're going to get above that 14% -- meaningfully above that 14% FFO to debt ratio, yes, I think given comments -- it's clearly oﬀ the table given your   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   comments, but could you maybe prioritize other options even just anecdotally in your mind at this point as to how you sort of get back to that level?","Yes. The best priority I could give you is that our objective, as we have already described, is to strengthen the balance sheet with the goal of using the most eﬃcient sources of capital without -- with the ability to minimize external equity needs. Beyond that, Ross, we're doing a review of every line of business. And once we're ﬁnished with that, we'll be able to outline the ways that we will go about addressing the balance sheet."
"Okay. I appreciate that, Bob. And then 2023 guidance, I think your comments were that you're just -- you're not going to provide it sort of for the full year given the strategic review. So is that just to expect sort of quarterly guidance going forward as we walk through the year? And can we kind of use Q1 guidance where we're at as sort of a starting point status quo guide post, and then make our own assumptions around where the strategic review lands to sort of get ourselves to a 2023 or 2024 number, or how should we think about that going forward?","Ross, I anticipate we'll be providing quarterly guidance as we go through the year. With regard to using our ﬁrst quarter guidance as a guide, I would just say there's a couple of things. On our third quarter call, we've provided a pathway to our 6.5% growth in 2023 much of that's not changed."
Right. Got it.,"There's a couple of changes that you'll -- that have impacted the ﬁrst quarter. One is, we walked through as much as $0.30 of solar ITCs, we've obviously made a comment about that."
Right. That's helpful.,"And it's the lack of the run rate as well as the lack of the incremental as reﬂected in the ﬁrst quarter. The other major change -- really the only other big change besides a little bit of tax timing in the ﬁrst quarter that we wouldn't -- we'd expect to balance out through the remainder of the year, is interest rates, which eﬀectively in the guide we gave on the third quarter call suggested that interest rate is up 2% to 3%, that was a $0.13 to $0.19 hurt or about $0.15 at a midpoint. Those rates have now gone up about 4%, which takes that sort of 15-ish midpoint to   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   more like $0.30. So the combination of the lack of solar plus the incremental headwind with interest rate is what informs the ﬁrst quarter.  I wouldn't know that over time, we expect that interest rate headwind to ameliorate, as I think most people do unsure exactly what the timing of that will be. But that should be somewhat temporary."
Okay. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.,"Thanks very much. We appreciate it, and we'll talk to you at our next call.  Operator  Thank you.
