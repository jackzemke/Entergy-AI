Question,Answer
"Hi, thanks, good morning. So just ﬁrst question on the -- your growth rate now goes out to 2025, which would encompass I guess 2024 triennial outcome in it. Can you talk a little bit of how you're kind of including that in your assumptions, what are you assuming for that?","Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the question. We're -- as I mentioned earlier, we're only 43 days into three-year period, that's going to be reviewed and we don't even ﬁle a case for more than three years. So, not surprisingly, lots of details to come. Do you think it's important -- when we look at a developing a long-term growth rate, we look at a variety of planning scenarios, we don't assume a single outcome for the 2024 triennial or any other major planning assumption that far out in our plan. I will say one thing that is certainly assumed in all of our forecasted outcomes 2024 or any other years that Virginia regulation continues to be constructive just the way it worked over the years, which is provided our customers with solid reliability rates more than 10% below the national average and a greener and greener generation portfolio. And then I think it's also important to remember as Jim and I talked about earlier that a portion of our base rates, that, the portion of our earnings that come from base rates in Virginia as we go through time and riders and other mechanisms outside Virginia grow in importance, our growth between now and the '24 triennial and then after the '24 triennial is driven by rider investments that are outside the '24 triennial or any other triennial proceeding."
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Okay. So is -- is the punch line then you kind of feel like you've got ability to deal with a variety of outcomes for that or in the scheme of things or -- and that's kind of encompassed in there in your assumptions.,"Yeah, Steven, this is what -- this is what we do is what we've done over the years as we worked with regulators, policymakers on constructive outcomes for customers and and health of the utility, and we fully expect that we'll be able to continue that going forward."
"Okay. And then one other question related to that is -- I did notice that it does seem like the base component of the rate base in Virginia and the percentages seen lower they had been from your other recent disclosures, could you just explain maybe some of the changes there, I guess maybe, Jim?","Hey Steve, good morning, let me take that and I'm not sure if everyone has the full backend program, but for our future reference set out on Page 60 in the appendix. But you're right, the total rate base in Virginia has not changed, other than due to the passage of time and the completion of the year. But what we did do is we reﬁned the calculation of the elements of total rate base. We've been showing the schedule since like 2019, we started this, I guess our last Investor Day, where we at that time in the triennial was very far away, we were trying to make it simple, so we lost some things together. And now we've reﬁned that and the reﬁnement relates to about $4 billion of rate base that previously we had categorized as Virginia base and other -- and $4 billion is really the other and we've now -- we always do that to other categories.  So what's in the others? Those are contract where we serve various entities in the state, municipalities, State of Virginia itself, the federal government, entities like that where the contracts reﬂect diﬀerent economic construct. Some of them are just sort of negotiated, those are in the other category in our new slide and others track more, some of the riders, whether it's transmission rider or legacy ASICs riders, so reallocated to be more precise. Now Virginia base is not Virginia base and other, it's just Virginia base. It brings down that number to about $9 billion. So I think that's helpful to folks that they do math and sensitivities to have that more reﬁned division in the various buckets of our total preliminary base.     Okay, thank you very much.     Thanks, Steve.  Operator   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ford with UBS."
"Hi, good morning. Thanks very much for the time today. So","Dan, thanks for joining."
"Thank you. So this question is for you, Bob. So the Virginia Legislature has several live utility and energy economy related bills still ﬂoating around and Governor Northam has asked for a special session. Can you put all the noise if this creates for investors into perspective for us?","Yeah, sure. I don't think I can remember a fourth quarter call, we've done where we didn't get a question on the Virginia General Assembly. I guess that's a function of the timing of our fourth quarter call and the session. So I'm glad you asked us, we would have been disappointed if we didn't -- If we didn't get one this year. You know it's been, now I guess, more than 15 years since I worked in the governor's oﬃce in Virginia, but there are a few things about the legislative process that I think are probably still true. The ﬁrst one, the legislature doesn't follow the scripts. You you make a mistake or you make predictions with certainty about the outcome of legislation at your peril and I think that is still true. The second is that build for it to become law have to clear a number of hurdles. it's not just one house or the other, It's both houses and its committees of both houses and an example of that from this year session would be the one bill introduced in the Senate that related to our regulatory model was defeated in committees on a pretty strong bipartisan vote. And then the last thing that is still true about the legislature in Virginia is it moves quickly.  So I don't think we're going to have to wait a long time. This year the timing has been a little bit diﬀerent as you mentioned, the session went -- it's constitutionally mandated 30 days and then the governor called a special session, but the process is still moving pretty quickly. And so I think there's bills that you're referring to will be resolved relatively soon, because that's the way the Virginia General Assembly moves. We'll keep an eye on them, but I think it's important to remember that they got hurdles, they would still have to clear before they could become law."
"Okay, thanks very much. And I guess one also for Jim. So Jim, thanks for all the detail on the CapEx going forward as well as what's rider eligible versus not. Can you talk a little bit about the impact that the -- on the CapEx mix and the rider eligible projects will have on cash ﬂow conversion as we go through the next ﬁve years?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yeah. I'm going to do that. So as I mentioned, almost well over 70%, almost three quarters of our capital spending in the ﬁve year plan everything is in rider format in Virginia and elsewhere. So what that means is we invest that capital, there is no regulatory lag. There is a proportional increase in operating cash ﬂow from that investment. So that's quite an assistance in our plan for the sources and uses of cash, given the lack of regulatory lag and kind of the proportional advancement of our rider spin and our rider rate base growth and also our operating cash ﬂow. We think it's quite a (inaudible) feature of this structure."
"Great, thanks very much guys.",Thanks Dan.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Hey, good morning guys. Just a, just a quick housekeeping and I have a quick follow-up. Just maybe starting with the '21 guidance, obviously you've highlighted an expectation for a 10% or better growth of that 2020 base, but bottom end sort of implies about 6 % year-over-year growth. There's a lot of visibility with the plans. So just trying to get a sense on any scenarios outside of weather that could put you at that lower end? And then I know the midpoint of the range is about $0.025 cents lower versus prior. Is that -- is that South Carolina GRC delay- related, can you manage it, just sort of our conservatism built in there?","Yeah. A lot of parts of that question as normal Shar. So let me (multiple speakers) South Carolina has no impact on that guidance range, non. Let me walk through the elements of our guidance. So we have -- our long-term EPS growth guidance of 6.5%, which is intended to be more precise than our peers. It's opposed to 200 basis point range. And every year as we -- as we go along that 6.5% long-term, we choose a midpoint for our annual guidance. And around that midpoint, we have a range and every quarter we mentioned that that range is intended primarily to capture diﬀerent weather outcomes. Now, going back a few years, that range is pretty wide. In the last ﬁve years it was $0.50 and was $0.45 (technical diﬃculty) the primary reason for that range this year included is to incorporate, to accommodate various weather outcome. The midpoint of the range is 3.85 and we're very conﬁdent in making that number and continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding on weather normal basis, like we talked about for the last ﬁve years. So, this range, the midpoint -- the midpoint, again as I said in my prepared remarks is consistent with the very narrow range of potential midpoints that we guided in July. No rollouts in the South Carolina process."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got it, got it. Thank you for that. Jim. And then just lastly on the ratings, obviously you're presenting a really healthy cash ﬂow, the business risk proﬁle has obviously improved, 9% utility growth, a lot of it is rider treatment, single issue rate making, 15% FFO to debt levels, any sort of -- an agency obviously also has on positive outlook, the metrics seem to point you closer to the (inaudible) minus, any sense on how the conversations are going with the rating agencies?","Let me say it this way, I think generally across the three rating agencies, there is a recognition of the senior management focus on credit, it has been a part of all of the transactions and ﬁnancings we've done in the last -- in the years. And there's a recognition of the improvement that we've accomplished. So we're in a good spot. Going forward, I wouldn't speculate or operate, but what I -- what I would expect and maybe I'm not trying to get ahead of agencies, but what we hope for is increased recognition of the very material improvement in our business risk proﬁle from a credit perspective. Overall, the last year, there was just -- the dust has barely settled, right on the last step of that would fail on the Gas Transmission and Storage, but I would hope that that element would work its way more into the dialog and even the thresholds, that the various agencies apply to our company."
"Terriﬁc. That I was trying to get out, Jim, I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.",Good luck to you Shar.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey, good morning team, thanks for the time and opportunity. Perhaps a follow up on some of the last questions, I've got a couple real quickly, if you can. I believe you just said a second ago with respect to the 6.5% and the increased level of precision, I think Steve brought up earlier, obviously there is a lot baked into that ﬁve-year outlook into '25. How do you get yourself so conﬁdent around that 6.5% precision that you guys articulate? I mean, obviously it's purpose, you just said, if you can speak to a little bit more narrowly about the level of conﬁdence you have in these outcomes to drive that number, that's great? And then I have a quick follow-up if you don't mind.","Yeah, I mean I think I answered simply this way, Julian. We were conﬁdent in July, when we announced 6.5% growth rate and nothing has changed since then. We're still conﬁdent. We've outlined as you've heard today some roll forward of our CapEx. We've got a lot of clarity on rider recoverability of that CapEx and all of that contributes as we sort of develop our   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   assumptions around our long-term growth rate to maintaining the conﬁdence that we had last summer in that 6.5%."
"Got it. Fair enough. And then, turning back to South Carolina quickly, if you can. Obviously, I heard what you said about '21 here. How do you think about prospects for settlement timeline there, given some of the gyrations then ultimately CapEx, obviously, we're paying attention what's going on with (inaudible) Carolinas here too, how do you think about CapEx opportunities as well?","Yeah, so on settlement, we are working through the pause that was ordered by the commission that we agreed to, with monthly reports on that and we're always optimistic about our prospects of settling cases because we think we're very creative in ﬁnding ways that we can resolve issues that are beneﬁcial for customers and for the company. Ultimately, it requires all the parties to agree to settle and it's -- I can't tell you what's in the mind of the counterparties, I can just tell you that we're working very hard towards that and we have an endpoint that the commission said if you haven't settled, we'll start the case back up again. So we'll get there either with settlement or we'll ﬁnish the case and it's a strong case. We are very conﬁdent in the case that we ﬁled. We haven't had a base rate case in eight years and we've invested substantially in the system and improved the system and we're entitled to return on those -- into a return on those investments. So we think it's very strong case. Hopefully, we can settle it, if we can't, we're very comfortable with our ability to defend the position that we took in that case.  As to potential future growth, I mean obviously, we need to get through this rate case and see, and that's our focus at the moment, along what they ensure that we maintain our commitments that we made in the merger process. The IoT process obviously suggests that going forward, there may be some further investment opportunities. I will certainly take advantage of those, but right now, what we're focused on is getting this ﬁrst rate case resolved in a constructive manner."
(Inaudible) Best of luck.,Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi guys. I'm wondering if -- to what extent has additional tax credit extensions and some of the renewable stimulus planning that you're expecting to see from the Democrats over the next few   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   months built into the plan? And is there a potential for upside, especially when I look at like the solar (technical diﬃculty) and maybe even -- just in terms of customer aﬀordability, maybe you could aﬀord to do some more work, maybe undergrounding or grid transformation?","Yeah, that's a great question, Michael, and you're right. For us in the regulated environment that we're talking about, the extension of the ITC and various tax credits is customer rate beneﬁcial and doesn't change the investment return, but deﬁnitely reduces the rate that the customers pay. So we'll look at whether there are opportunities. We have a pretty aggressive plan as you've seen and the Virginia Clean Economy Act last year passed an aggressive plan. So we're moving very quickly. If there are opportunities to advance will take them. But the main fact of ITC extension is going to be beneﬁt the customers on rates.     One think Michael, I'll add to that, it's Jim, is when it comes to ITCs that we -- that we recognize, the earnings beneﬁt from outside the regulatory context, that just to be clear is not really a growth industry for us. Most of what we do, that relates to ITC is in a regulated format where it beneﬁts our customers as Bob said. But two years ago at Investor Day, we gave some guidance that ITC recognition in earnings would be somewhere in the -- up to $0.15 per year range. And where we've been is really below that. In '18 we were $0.09, in '19 we were $0.11, in '20 we were $0.16, but we still plan to trend within that run rate up 15% -- $0.15 year guidance. So that's not a big impact in that period, mostly on that regulated customer beneﬁt side, as Bob described."
"Right and just to be clear the ITC doesn't reduce the rate base any of the projects that you're working on a regulator side, rightinaudible?","Yeah, that's exactly right."
"And my understanding is the strategic undergrounding is driven the limit -- there is a limit to the amount you can invest there by law, is there any talk or perhaps maybe expanding that, considering that these things might be getting more aﬀordable federal tax credits?","Yeah. So that's a legislative -- cap is in legislation that you're referring to it has to do with the percentage of overall rate base. There is no legislation pending in Virginia right now on that issue. So, if it were to be extended, it's unlikely that would happen this year."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Okay, great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.",
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
(Technical diﬃculty).,"Hey Jeremy, we could barely hear you."
"Sorry about that, is that better?","That sounds much better, much better."
"You outlined a decarbonization opportunity through 2035 today. How do you think about customer growth and other investments for that period? And given the magnitude of you're clean spend here, do you expect this to capture an increasing share going forward, absent large changes in customer growth?","I'm sorry. We can talk a little bit about customer growth, I mean we've had pretty consistent growth in -- in our electric utility over the course of the last decade or so that we would expect to continue on a Virginia side, for example, 35,000 new customers connected a year or so. On   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   the gas side of our business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, strong -- very strong new customer growth, but I'm not sure I totally followed the second part of the question, I apologize."
"Just the relative share I guess of the green CapEx, is -- just wanted to see if that's going to continue to be a large portion of what you're doing going forward or are there other chunky investments in the non-clean side, we should think about there?","Yeah, no it's the outlook is very much and I think it's really reﬂected on the slide, it shows at $72 billion opportunity, that is all -- these were all decarbonization related or enabling investment. So that's going to be the absolute lion's share of our investment going out and we would expect that to continue even beyond that long-term period. Obviously 15 years from now is a long time in this business, right."
"Great, thanks. And then how much timing and recovery ﬂexibility do you have with CCROs eligible CapEx for the second triennial review period. Does your plan currently assume kind of bake in recovery of any of the spin explicitly?","Yeah. As I mentioned, we have a variety of assumptions not one single assumption related to the 24 triennial. We do have a slide that shows what's eligible and the total there and we'll sort of take advantage of that as circumstances warrant. It's too early for us to know how much of it, we would expect to use in the '24 triennial. We just know what we're likely to have available, you can see that on that slide."
"Got it, thanks. And one last one if I could. You talked about Virginia legislation and just wanted to see about South Carolina legislation and its securitization came through, how would you deal with that?","Yeah, we think securitization makes sense in certain circumstances, storm recovery for example, makes a lot of sense. Obviously, we didn't think it made sense with respect to new nuclear. So we'll see if it passes, it passes in a way that would be constructive, that's great. We'll just -- will have to wait and see how it goes. I know that bill has been introduced a number of times in South Carolina in the past and hasn't been enacted, but in circumstances like (inaudible) makes lot of sense."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Great, thanks so much.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.",
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, on Slide 20, I'm just curious the cash ﬂow sources and you just go through '23 and the (technical diﬃculty). Am I reading too much into it or are there diﬀerences in the kind of the company, the composition of cash, sources and uses in '24 and '25 as you ramp up your oﬀshore investments?","Yeah, Durgesh, thanks. The reason we went to just a three-year average view here is that over ﬁve years, the numbers get pretty big. And maybe a little bit more diﬃcult to bridge from where we are now and where we were in '20, but you probably are reading too much into it. We have elsewhere of course disclosed our equity ﬁnancing plan through the end of the period on the next slide. So you can see that the ﬁnancing is going to continue. What will change is the operating cash ﬂow, which will grow on a ﬁve year basis and the investing cash ﬂow which will grow slightly it increase a little bit moving back in the ﬁve-year plan. But nothing more interesting than that as said."
Understood. Got it. Okay. So more sort of granularity and conviction in near years and -- but no signiﬁcant changes in the makeup of sources and users.,"Bigger numbers. Okay. All right. Then just quickly following up just on Slide 10 and maybe Bob for you or perhaps even Jim. Just the largest regulated decarbonization plan of it, but in terms of -- when I'm thinking about any legislative support that you need, is it fair to assume that this opportunity of $72 million sort of -- is -- you can accomplish this with the Virginia Clean Energy Act or do you need further legislative support that can act on some of the big opportunities?     No, your assumption is correct. This is based upon the Virginia Clean Economy Act and the Grid Transformation and Security Act in 2018. So all of this is already legislatively authorized. Now we obviously have to seek approval from the commission for projects and we've demonstrated on solar, and as I mentioned in earlier remarks, we've had three solar ﬁlings approved by the commission already and we've had our electric transmission spend and those kinds of things approved consistently over the years. But we don't need additional, we're not looking for additional legislative enactment to carry out this 15-year regulated support.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
Excellent. Thank you for the update today and much appreciate the added disclosure. Thanks a lot guys.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets.
Good morning and thanks for the time guys..,Good morning.
"Just -- I just wanted to circle back on your comments just on bill aﬀordability as you implement your capital plan and Mike Weinstein actually raised a good question. As we saw the extension of the ITC at 30% at the end of the year, could you potentially talk to how that's going to -- how it may be quantiﬁed or how it's going to impact customer rates and making things more aﬀordable. Are you implement your capital plan?","I don't think we quantiﬁed that yet. So we ﬁled a integrated resource plan earlier this year and/or last year, I guess, we are 2021. The 2020 integrated resource plan, we showed a 10-year lock that 2.9% that we talked about. I am conﬁdent the updating us -- we certainly have an ROP update later this year in Virginia and I would expect this part of that will run the numbers on customer rates. But we don't have -- we haven't quantiﬁed customer rate impacts of that ITC at this point."
"Okay, great. But I would assume that it would give you a little bit more ﬂexibility when we are looking down the road here.",Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   That is absolutely true. It's going to have beneﬁts to customers in rates and oﬀers us ﬂexibility as we go forward.
"And just -- I gusee just to stay along that line, I know you are looking at little bit farther out that -- maybe you can touch a little bit about some of the programs -- I don't know if you're way to qualify, but how are yo thinking about controlling cost to create more head room to continue to implement you capital plan over the say ﬁve to seven years?","Yeah, let me, let me talk about, about that. It's Jim. ITC is one element which will beneﬁt customers for sure, but the other is O&M and let me give some kind of high level (inaudible) on that. When we talk at our last Investor Day about ﬂat normalized O&M so normalized is normalizing for new riders and associated required O&M or things like pension beneﬁts, which discount rates in like make that number go up and down, so we normalize all that, and then we keep it ﬂat. And in 2019, we gave an estimate that by keeping it ﬂat for three years across our entire business, we are going to stay versus a 2% escalator, like additional $200-ish million on a cumulative basis and we did. So now still ﬂat and we're rolling that out for the full ﬁve-year period.  Now, we did have some savings and actually went down a little bit in 2019 -- sorry in 2020 from COVID, now that's permanent, but our eﬀort to keep that ﬂat O&M, so negating inﬂation, our wage increases and things like that, it's not easy. But it's not through big things like some of our peers have talked about, step changes in OEM, discovered during COVID. We had some COVID savings for sure, but our approach is a little bit diﬀerence kind of programmatic, it is pushing cost savings as part of the system, the culture. So, ﬁnding ways to use technology and work smarter throughout the business. So, we have examples of that that helps us keep that ﬂat O&M they are tiny in comparison to Dominion. Electronic time sheets and electronic signatures and they've got a long list, they're all tiny, but they add up and that the kind of thing, the small eﬀorts throughout the company every state, every location that allow us to keep that normalized O&M ﬂat and the reason we do that is to make room in the customer bill, it helps out on customer side. And potentially also it creates room in that bill for the capital spending, that also beneﬁts customer. So that's kind of our -- our other lever we have in managing customer bill is continuing to manage that ﬂat O&M."
Got it. Great. Thank you very much for the time.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachc.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question and great slide deck today, lots of detail. I have two questions, one, can you remind us as a percent of rate base or dollar millions, what is the coal generation in rate base both in Virginia and South Carolina?","We said that out on a whole company basis. Michael, on page 32 and as a percentage of total investment base, which is very, very plus the ﬁxed assets PP&E for for our smaller contracted assets is 7% of rate base eﬀectively. And just this is ﬁve year plan. Given obviously the spending on other areas that goes to 4% by 2025 and down from there."
"Got it. So if I think about it at the Virginia level and you've done a signiﬁcant amount of coal retirements in Virginia. If you wanted to retire facilities, even earlier than planned, some of the coal facilities there that would accrue or account as part of the CRO with 2021, 2024 timeframe. Mike there. Am I thinking that that's also an alternative not just investing new capital that would necessarily get a cash return. But the write-downs of some of the older coal plants might as well.","Yeah, a couple of things there, Michael. One is obviously we don't make decisions on phosphate retirements, based on the timing related to our regulatory proceeding that's we make those decisions based on the sustainability of those plants going forward or if there is a change in the law or those kinds of things. So I think that's an important thing to keep in mind. And then the other is that you are sort of conﬂating two diﬀerent topics.  I think one is this customer credit reinvestment oﬀset which is provided for by statute, those are projects that are either grid transformation projects or renewable projects where that capital investment can be applied as as essentially. The customer beneﬁt in an earnings sharing mechanism When you calculate what the when the triennial review is done. And there are available earnings, there was an earning sharing mechanism  And then for the customer portion of that, could you to be a refund or one of these renewable or through transformation project. I think what you're thinking out is if there is if we retire plant early. There was a write-down and then that expense will be treated logically as an expense in the period. If there are available or. And that's the best for customers. It's long-standing practice has been in Virginia. So to sort of slightly diﬀerent things you're talking about there. Both have some impact on the calculation in the triennial, but we're obviously a long wait away from the second triennial here."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Understood. And just coming back to the coal generation question, do you think your coal units in both states, given how much power prices have come down, given how much CapEx costs, both renewables and storage have come down, do you think the coal units are currently economic still, the existing operating coal units and is there a dramatic diﬀerence between the ones in Virginia and the ones in South Carolina?","Yeah, I don't know that I'd say there is a dramatic diﬀerence. We obviously look at the economics of those plants regularly and make the determine -- make a determination, whether they are viable in the future and whether they are properly valued. So we'll do that -- continue to do that on a regular basis."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated for taking the time.","Thank you, Michael.  Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question comes from Srinjoy Banerjee with Barclays."
"Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for -- thanks for taking the question. Just on FFO to debt metrics as well as the rating. So obviously, you guys have seen a consistent improvement to those metrics 15% in 2020. If you look at the S&P and Moody's targets for (inaudible) will be -- I guess S&P was 15% and Moody's 17%. And so -- how do you see your FFO to debt metrics evolve over the plan period. It would you expect to stay around 15% mark or expect an improvement given the providers that we have?","Srinjoy, thanks a lot. Good to hear from you. Yeah, the way we think about that is, we've add from an easy to achieve the improvement that we showed along that one slide to get to the solidly mid teens level and that's where we expect it to stay. So I think maybe you are suggesting, is there an upgrade in the air, of course not against that. But, what we really hope comes to pass with some providers again further recognition of the business risk proﬁle improvement. So I wouldn't expect material changes in the metrics and where we are and from what we've achieved, and where we landed. I think that's in a good spot. Further, we will stay, but we'd love to have a little bit more headroom to that recognition, I mentioned and we want that headroom, not because we want to blow through it, but just because we think it's more the better. So that's kind of where we are on credit."
