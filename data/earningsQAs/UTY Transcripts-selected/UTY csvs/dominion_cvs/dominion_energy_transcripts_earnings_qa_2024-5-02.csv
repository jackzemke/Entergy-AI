Question,Answer
"Hey, guys. Good morning.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Maybe I can start with a two-part question on data centers. Bob, I know you made prior comments in the media around self-generation and self-supply. What are you seeing within the pipeline you just discussed as it relates to these two items, which can obviously mitigate some of the low growth you highlight? And secondly, how are you sort of thinking about rate design and tariﬀ changes to make sure Virginia customers' beneﬁts are at least held harmless on things like interconnection costs? Thanks.","Yes. Shar, both really good questions. I may take them a little bit in reverse order. We've worked with data centers for many years, and we have very strong relationships with them. As you know Loudoun County is home to the largest data center market in the world, and we have had an opportunity to work with our data center customers for 15 or more years.  So with those relationships, we're certainly looking into alternative rate designs and discussing potential structures with them. Obviously, anything that we would do there would need to be approved by the SCC. So nothing speciﬁc to oﬀer, but we certainly continue conversations with these customers that we've worked with so well for so long.  As to behind-the-meter solutions or some sort of self-supply, I suppose there could be some speciﬁc situations where that might make sense for some customers. But we think, given their need for reliability and aﬀordability, we think the majority of those solutions are going to want to access the broader network of system resources that are in front of the meter. And I think it's really important to keep in mind, regardless of the source of generation, substantial transmission investment, which we've noted before. So fundamentally, given our long history with data center customers, we're quite conﬁdent in our ability to ﬁnd solutions that work for them, for other customers, and for our shareholders."
"Got it. Perfect. And then maybe just touch on resource adequacy for a second and kind of your plans as it relates to the upcoming capacity auction. Are you electing the FRR, which is due by the 17th of this month? And more importantly, just elaborate a bit more on the IRP update and incremental generation spent. Could this kind of be accreted to the plan? Thanks, guys.","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes, again, I'll take the second part ﬁrst. So as to potential incremental capital, as we said in our prepared remarks, toward the end of the plan, we could certainly see some additional capacity. We described the way data centers are ramping in faster than they have before, that their requests are bigger than they've been before.  We don't forecast demand based on engineering assessments. We do that based on signed contracts. And then in the later years, customer intelligence, we're pretty conﬁdent in our ability to do that. So there may be potentially some upside there as we go out. As I said in our prepared remarks, our investments are going to be driven by policy and customer needs. We'll be very thoughtful about our balance sheet and our business risk proﬁle as we make additional investment decisions.  Fundamentally, it's just a very exciting time for the industry, particularly for us, given our experience with data centers. As to PJM, as I expect you know Shar, from 2007 to 2022, we participated in the PJM capacity market through the reliability pricing model. In 2021, we announced we were going to elect FRR because that made the most sense for our customers.  Now with PJM's most recent capacity market reforms and assumptions, it makes sense for us to return to the capacity auction starting with the '25, '26 auction. Returns us to the way we did business for many years, doesn't change guidance, doesn't change the way we operate our system, or the way we think about the world. In fact, all the auction planning parameters released by PJM in April are quite consistent with our view. We're going to see substantial load growth driven by electriﬁcation in data centers for the foreseeable future."
"Got it. Thank you very much. Super helpful. Congrats on the results, guys.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  We will take our next question from the line of Nick Campanella at Barclays."
"Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.","Good morning, Nick."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Good morning. Hey, I wanted to ask on South Carolina. I think HB 5118 has been kind of progressing through, and it's our understanding that can maybe kind of change a few things on the regulatory footprint there. Can you just kind of talk through if that aﬀects your capital plans or your assumptions at all, and how we should kind of think about that?","Yes, Nick, I appreciate that question. The legislature is scheduled to adjourn next week. In keeping with our standard practice, I'm not going to talk about pending legislation today. We'll know where everything lands next week. I can tell you what we're very focused on in South Carolina. First, the constructive outcome in our electric base rate case that's pending right now.  As we mentioned in our opening remarks, we've invested $1.6 billion on behalf of our customers since the last case. Our rates in South Carolina are low. Our reliability is outstanding, so we think we're in a very good place with respect to that case. And then beyond that, we're very focused on continuing to serve our customers well and getting closer to earning our authorized return in South Carolina. If you just sort of look big picture, South Carolina is a great state to do business. We want to be in a position to continue to invest in growth capital as the state grows. So that's what we're focused on, and we'll see how the legislature lands here in a week or so."
"Hey, I appreciate that. And then I guess just on the shift, these shift to be certain, you kind of talked about de-risking the project timeline, and you seem ahead of schedule. Is that versus the ISD, the '24 to early '25, or is that more relative to where it falls in your kind of current oﬀshore wind construction schedule? And then maybe you can kind of remind us what's in the plan today for future contracting opportunities for that shift after you're done with Virginia Oﬀshore Wind?","Hey, Nick. I'll take the second part ﬁrst with regard to what we've assumed. So, we've made some assumptions of the ability to contract the vessel to third parties at the conclusion of the work it does for CVOW. And we continue to see robust interest in that vessel, given sort of the unique nature of what it provides. So we feel like we've made reasonable -- reasonably conservative, not unduly conservative assumptions on that, and that's included in the guidance that we provided with regard to the Dominion Energy contracted energy segment in the investor day materials.  With regard to the timeline and sort of what it all means, no change to the expectation that the vessel will complete its sea trials in late '24, early 2025. And with the termination of the charter that we discussed in the call, that doesn't change the broader expectation for timeline for the project. What it does is it allows us to make sure that we can stay on track of that schedule. It gives us opportunities to begin installation when weather is most favorable. It'll allow us, without that ﬁrst charter, we won't need the time to reconﬁgure the vessel's outﬁtting between charters to accommodate our project's turbine size.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So think about the vessel availability as on track, consistent with how we've thought about it in the past, to the extent we're able to bring it forward. That's great to the vessel, to the project, but I wouldn't think of it as bringing the back end of the project in. It's just another way that we can mitigate what will be, I'm sure, things that happen along the way that we don't currently foresee, but we want to build as much cushion as we possibly can. And that's what this will accomplish for us."
All right. All very clear. Thanks for the time.,"Thanks, Nick.  Operator  Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please pose your question."
"Yes, thank you. Good morning. Just one quick -- hey, just one quick question, do you have a number for kind of where you stand on the ATM for this year as of now? How many shares you've issued?","Yes, we haven't issued any shares of the ATM yet, Steve, and that's a function of -- during the business review, our ATM shelf registration expired, and so we actually didn't have the registration statement available to us. So we will be implementing that here very, very shortly, and then that will allow us to begin that program."
"Great. And then just going back to the kind of tie-in with the data center and IRP and the like, Bob, you mentioned dispatchable generation and then potentially guest storage. Could you just give a little, it sounds like maybe you've got like a winter tightness that maybe you need to deal with and just would you be investing in the storage or yes, just how we should think about those needs?","Yes, just to be clear we're looking potentially at, we got a couple big combined cycle plants not too far away from each other being able to have some gas LNG storage that is available to those two that's the kind of thing that we're talking about. More broadly as we've discussed we're building a lot of renewables which all of our customers are looking for but we need to make sure that we can operate the system reliably that's why we've been talking about that storage I just described as well as some combustion turbines at our Chesterﬁeld site.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Okay, great. I will leave it there. Thank you.",Thanks Steve.  Operator  Our next question this morning will come from Jeremy Tonet at JP Morgan. I hope I said your name correctly sir. Your line is open.
Hi thanks it's Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan.,"Good morning Jeremy.     Hey, Jeremy.     You've got competition on this call Jeremy."
I guess so that's right. But continuing I guess with the data center line of thought if I could and appreciate that this is a sensitive topic overall but just any thoughts that you could provide with regards to the uncontracted Millstone capacity and that could possibly supply power to data centers and how conversations with stakeholders evolve there?,"Hi, Jeremy. This is Diane. Really nothing new to report from what we said before. In February of '23 we signed an MOU with NE Edge, to work together on development of a data center on Millstone property and they are continuing to work with the state agencies and legislators to gain approval to move that project forward. If the permits are granted then we remain ready to support the project and that would include providing land and a long-term PPA for power from a portion of Millstone which would be about a few hundred megawatts.      Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And Jeremy I would just note and I think we disclosed this earlier we've not made any assumptions in our ﬁnancial plan associated with a co-located data center at the Millstone power facility so."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And continuing with this line of thought, if I could, I believe there's legislation passed in Virginia to possibly recover some costs of SMR development in the state. And just given how Nucor provides the 24/7 base load that seems to match up well with data center needs, just wondering any thoughts you see there on the potential over time. We see Ontario Power really moving forward swiftly on SMR development. And just wondering any high-level thoughts you might be able to share there?","Yes, Jeremy, ﬁrst, I think that legislation conﬁrms a continued commitment in Virginia among policymakers in support of nuclear power. We operate four units in Virginia and have well for many years. The Navy has a substantial nuclear ﬂeet. Many of those vessels ported in Virginia. And there are other parts of the nuclear industry that are all represented in Virginia.  So I think it was a very positive sign that that legislation passed that continues to support nuclear power in Virginia, we included SMRs in our last IRP out toward the end of the plan. We continue to investigate the opportunity to be able to deploy SMRs on behalf of our customers. But I would add, just like with every other investment that we think about, we need to make sure that it's customer-friendly, that it ﬁts within the parameters of our balance sheet and our business risk proﬁle. So we're continuing to explore SMRs. As you point out, they are dispatchable and non-emitting. But we've got a ways to go yet."
"That makes sense. Thank you for that.  Operator  And next, we will also hear from Bill Appicelli at UBS.",
"Yes. Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. But just piling on the data center, just a couple of comments that you made there. You commented that the ramp times have been accelerating. Can you maybe just describe how that's playing out? Like, for example, the 15 that you're connecting this year, when would you expect them to be at full run rate?","Yes. Bill, I don't think we know speciﬁcally on those 15 how quickly they're going to be at full run rate. It really is just a matter of the amount of time that some of them, that we've seen in the past   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   would take to ramp fully into the capacity they asked for. They're expecting to ramp in quite a bit faster. But we don't have speciﬁcs regarding those 15 that we expect to connect this year."
"Okay. I mean, is there, I guess, a historical precedent of how long it's taken on prior data centers?","So, this is Diane Leopold again. So, typically, when they had capacity, they might ramp into that capacity over like a 4 to 5 year type of period, and now that same capacity that we're interconnecting could be closer to a 2 to 3 year period."
"Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess just more broadly, again, on the same topic. Can you just share a little bit about the process of evaluation with the data center developers and how you structure the contracts and their commitments in terms of having the load show up and so that you're structuring the cost proﬁle appropriately to protect ratepayers?","Yes, Bill. Great question. They are -- data centers are on a rate schedule that applies to all our large customers, and that's been that way for some time, and the State Corporation Commission would have to make any changes if we were talking about, approve any changes if we were talking about any changes to that, which not on the table at the moment. The sort of thinking about the way we structure contracts, they have contract minimum demands that they are obligated to achieve in order to cover the incremental cost of the infrastructure that we're building for them, and that has been in place for us for some time."
