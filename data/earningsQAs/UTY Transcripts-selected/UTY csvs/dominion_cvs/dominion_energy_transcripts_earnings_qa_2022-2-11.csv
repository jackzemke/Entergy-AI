Question,Answer
"Just wanted Just wanted to start oﬀ here. If you could walk us oﬀ from the prior planned CapEx to today's and the impact on targeted equity included the expected LDC sale proceeds, and just wondering, are there any other non-core assets in the portfolio you might look to sell an asset such as Millstone for equity source?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Hey, Jeremy, it's Bob. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Jim to -- I'll take the second part, turn it over to Jim to walk through the ﬁrst part. Our announcement related to Hope was about scale. As we think about, as we mentioned in our remarks, Hope Gas is great company, but in terms of customers, it's a quarter of the size of our next smallest LDC.  And so as we thought about capital allocation, it made sense to us to think about divesting that great company, and I think, the our colleagues who work there are also going to a great company. As to the sort of broader question, we like the mix of assets that we have and we think they support our growth rate and allow us to continue to execute, which is what we're most focused on is executing on that strategy regulated pure-play.  Now, like every company, we obviously regularly evaluate assets to see what makes sense with respect to credit, earnings, accretion all those kinds of things. But we're very comfortable that the asset mix that we have today, supports the growth rate that we've outlined and we're just focused on executing on that. And I'll get Jim to talk a little bit about sort of tying that capital plans and equity.     Yes, Jeremy, good morning. As I mentioned in prepared remarks, we provided a lot of detail on our growth plans and capital spending in the Appendix. So wouldn't expect anyone to digest it all that. Yes, but I would draw attention to Page 34, which is a bridge from our prior ﬁve-year capital growth plan to the new one, $32 billion to the $37 billion. And let me just quickly tick through some of the changes.  The most material single change is simply moving from one 5-year period to the next. Drop 2021, check that box, add 2026. And just in doing that, you're also incidentally including the full time frame for oﬀshore wind spend. Then if you look at budget changes for some of our capital programs. For example, the budget we discussed in November on oﬀshore wind is actually fully neutralized in our ﬁve-year capital spend plan by postponement for further evaluation as we talked about in November of our pump storage project and our Virginia CTEs which are further out in time outside the ﬁve-year period. So that nets to zero.  And then, you'll see some other drivers there. Just true ups of our capital spending across gas distribution, R&G and all of our other decarbonization investment programs. So that's what bridges the prior plan to new.  And then Jeremy, you asked a lot of sub parts to that question. You also asked about equity. So let me say few things about that. We -- I observe that we're one of few companies that actually gives detailed guidance on equity issuance. So I'm happy it's noticed. There's no change in our equity guidance for '22. There's some very modest weeks, $100 million in some years, $200 million in others thereafter. Keeping in mind that spending is up. So equity is up, cash ﬂow is up, debt is up a little bit.  So how could that change? If spending in our ﬁve-year plan as we move forward goes up, which would be good, these equity amounts could trend up slightly as well. Conversely, if it goes down, which we don't expect, they'd go down a little bit. But we think this level of constant equity through our existing programs, as I mentioned, 1% to 1.5% of our current market cap is, I   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   mean it's accretive, it's modest and it's appropriate to keep us in the right spot from a credit rating metric perspective."
"Got it. That's all very helpful there. Thank you for that. And just another one if I could hear, the inclusion of Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions in the net zero commitment is a big step forward there. What are the impacts? I guess that, that drives in your long-term CapEx in the plan. Just wondering if any of the CapEx plan is attributable to that? And then speciﬁcally, can you provide an update on your RNG plans in light of these commitments?","Yes, let me start and then I'll turn it over to Diane to talk a little bit more speciﬁcally about RNG. As we described in our opening remarks, Jeremy, Scope 2 and 3 emissions reductions by 2050 are going to require technology and supportive regulatory environment. So a lot of this that we would be thinking about are sort of longer term, it's hard for us to put as much deﬁnition around it as we can the Virginia, particularly -- Virginia regulated rider investments in some of the others that you're seeing in that 15-year chart.  Obviously, nothing in the ﬁve-year plan what we think would move the needle there, but lots of opportunities we believe and we think it's important that's what our customers are looking for us to do, it's what our shareholders are looking for us to do. So we'll have opportunities to ﬂush that out. There's, as we mentioned, we've already got a fair amount going and a big chunk of that right now is our investment in RNG, and I'll ask Diane to talk a little bit more detail about that.     Okay, good morning. So our RNG program, our capital program has really increased over this last year. So we now have 10 projects under construction and one in service, but two of those under construction, both Dairy, will be in service in the coming days and weeks. We expect six projects to come into service this year. So we're really kind of ramping up even though it's very small right now. But we see that pace continuing of new projects, and during the construction stream and more coming online in these next few years.  So we do see this what we've said before is about $2 billion of capital investment through 2035, through our main platforms of the dairy and the swine with our partnerships with Align and Vanguard. So that's on the development side. On the LDC side speciﬁcally as it relates to Scope 3, we really see that program eventually moving towards a long-term strategy of having RNG directly into our regulated gas customers.  So we already have that on a voluntary basis in Utah and it's been very well received there, and just got approval in North Carolina. And looking to work with stakeholders to increase the amount of RNG blending into our local gas distribution companies. So whether we build it or not, whether it's part of our program or not, we're really looking to see more RNG access for our customers in our LDC program.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)      Got it. That's all very helpful. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research."
"Yes. Hi, good morning.","Hey, Steve."
"Just -- hey. So Bob, just -- there was a lot of focus late last year on the Virginia election and new governor and alike. And maybe you could just talk a little bit about how things have been going with registration and if there's any kind of maybe speciﬁcally the political support you're seeing or not for the oﬀshore wind projects.","Yes, Steve. So things have been going well with the new administration and the general assembly. Obviously, the session in Virginia is less than -- little less than halfway over, but Virginia session moves pretty quickly. It's really energy just has not been a big focus. As we discussed I think on the last call, the campaign was focused on education and taxes and that's what the general assembly has been focused on not surprisingly.  And so energy has not been a huge part of the equation. So we'll, obviously, you make predictions about the legislative process at your peril, but we're participating and ﬁnding that we continue to work well with both Republicans and Democrats as we have for quite a long time. As regards to oﬀshore where there continues to be very strong support for oﬀshore wind as we discussed on in our opening remarks. There is a great opportunity for Virginia with respect to new jobs and new industry, and our project is recognized as one that can bring a lot of beneﬁts to the state. So still seeing great support for oﬀshore wind."
"Okay. And then one other question oﬀshore wind. Just Orsted a week or two ago talked to cost pressures that it sounds like things that you had already maybe reﬂected in your budget. But one of the things they speciﬁcally pointed to was vessel cost for like non -- not to Jones-Act vessels, but for other things like the foundations and alike. Just -- could you just talk to is that part of the mix of what you have locked up already?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Yes, in fact. Diane and I met with the executives at Prysmian and Demi who are handling, we talked about these large packages there that transport and install. So they're doing the cable and installing the monopods. We just met with them earlier this week and things are very much on track with them. So our -- and as regards our own vessel, the installation vessel, the steel for that example has been on site for quite some time. So I think the premise where you started the question, saying that, the pressures that you may have heard about were factored into our contracting is exactly right. We entered into these contracts late last year with counterparties who are very experienced every, every single one of them is very experienced in this industry. So we still feel very good about that project both in terms of schedule and budget."
"Great. And one quick follow-up on Hope Gas. Just curious -- been the debate about the future of LDCs, it looks like you got a good price here for it. Just could you give us some sense of the competitive dynamic of that process and or and just what your kind of what do you think it means for kind of thinking about the value of your remaining LDCs?","We feel very good about the value of our remaining LDCs as we have for some time. As I mentioned, this was a decision that we made related to scale as it pertains to our LDC for LDC businesses. They are growing, they're in what we describe as premium states, very pro-business states, strong customer bases, very supportive of natural gas and with customers who want natural gas for cooking and heating their homes. So this was not, from our perspective, a reﬂection on our thinking about the LDC business going forward. And that being said, we have a lot of interest obviously in this process and we feel very good about the price and equally important about the quality of the counterparty. So I think it was a good outcome and one that we think will be very well received, but we expect to continue operating our LDC as well."
Great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Fowler with UBS.,
"Good morning, Bob. I hope you and the team are well.",
Good morning.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity),
"I just wanted to walk through Slide 11 one more time to make sure I understand very clearly what you said. So we know the CapEx is up playing the plan, basically as you are adding '26 and taking '21 away. So what you're saying is there's no change here to '22 equity, a small increase to equity and '23 forward. And that whole proceeds are really going to be used to repay debt, and that capacity turns around to be available for regulated CapEx. Did I frame that correctly? Is that what I heard you say on the call?","That's exactly right. On the equity sources and uses, the overall sources and uses I should say. So to simplify it a little bit, what are we doing here with the proceeds from the small sale? After tax proceeds, we're paying down parent level of debt. And then in coming years, we'll use that debt capacity modest as we invest in our spending programs across our key regulated states."
"That's perfect, Bob. Thank you. And then on your comments on solar on the call. So you noted that costs are up and prices are tight here. But then you've gone in a lot of '20 procurement already. So that stuﬀ is on track. And on '23, you're on track, but you're watching it. How much of '23 have you already procured and how much is maybe still out there that maybe a swing factor for maybe pushing projects to '24?","So this is Diane Leopold. Thanks for that question. So for 2023, as Bob talked about, we are seeing some shortages of panels and other items, but we are actively in the stages now of working out the contracting for these projects. We are well along the way in that process and project by project getting access to the modules we need. So I won't say it's simple and not without some additional cost, we're managing it and I just say that we're well along the way."
"All right, great. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from our Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.",
"Hey, good morning team. Thank you for taking my questions.",Morning.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Good morning, Bob. Just Jim, a quick clariﬁcation. You mentioned $800 million if I heard that correctly on the Oﬀshore CapEx that was indexed. Is that $800 million part of the $7 billion locked or is that $800 million out of the total roughly $10 billion projector project cost?","Yes, Durgesh, good morning. That $800 million is part of the $7 billion locked across those ﬁve project components that we announced in November. The remaining amount, as you recall, is the onshore transmission and contingency."
"Got it. Perfect. So $7 billion of the roughly $10 million locked and $800 million is a component of that. Then just maybe just quickly, Jim, I just want to understand the rate base growth disclosures. And then on Slide 10, for Virginia, I would have expected the rate base CAGR to be higher given the higher spending versus the last year plan? Is that sort of a starting point issue? Because if I compare Q4 last year to Q4 this year, the rate base CAGR is actually lower with the spend actually materially higher.","Yes, Durges. We are happy to connect. We have, as I mentioned, a lot of detailed backup and the appendix, but what you're mentioning there is just a timing issue from the starting point. There's not a material change to the programs or the overall pace that's just timing quarter-to- quarter."
"Understood. Thank you. And really appreciate all the all the disclosure in the appendix. Thank you for continuing to provide that, appreciate it. Thanks.  Operator  Thank you.
