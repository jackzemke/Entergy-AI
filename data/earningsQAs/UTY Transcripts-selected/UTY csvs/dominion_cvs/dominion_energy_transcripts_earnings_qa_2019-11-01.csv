Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"So Tom, you obviously highlighted -- a couple of questions here. You obviously highlighted the huge opportunity you said you guys have with oﬀshore wind, right? And we know the development cycle could be kind of long. We've seen it with Vineyard. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit around how you're thinking about contingencies around permitting, construction and contract terms. And then as the projects started to go through construction, maybe just a little bit on ﬁnancing. I mean should we think about the ﬁrst tranche of the projects self-funding future projects with the cash ﬂow they're generating? So maybe how we should think about sort of the ﬁnancing of what could be a very large capital outlay.","Thanks. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Paul Koonce who's spent an enormous amount of time working on this development. The -- and Jim Chapman can answer any further questions on the ﬁnancing. I would mention we are expecting rider recovery, and we'll seek rider approval for all three phases. We've been working on this project for six years. We bought the right lease option, the lease rights, in a 2013 auction that was run by BOEM. And ever since that time, we've been working with a variety of stakeholders to make sure we had the right plan and we had the right folks to help us do the pilot.  We got approval from the State Corporation Commission. It's been through BOEM. We had the permits from BOEM. One of the things to keep in mind that diﬀerentiates us from the New England situation is we own the entire lease for the entire coastal region of Virginia. And it's 26 miles oﬀshore. It is not in ﬁshing grounds, and it is not visible from the shore. So it's a very signiﬁcant diﬀerentiating aspects of what's going on here in Virginia and what you've seen happen in New England but -- from the macro level. And now I'll turn it over to Paul to answer the balance of your question.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)      Thanks, Tom. As Tom mentioned, we've been at this for quite some time. We expect, as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks, to ﬁle the construction and operating permit about this time next year. We've got ample time to get the BOEM permit in place in order to meet the ﬁrst phase construction. We will be starting the work now, the ocean mapping, the geotech work, the environmental studies, and that will take place over the course of 2020. And having -- as Tom mentioned, having just gone through it on the CVOW project, while that was a research area permit and this is a commercial and operating permit, the process is identical. So we know the stakeholders, we know the process, and we feel really pretty good about it. I'll ask Jim to comment on ﬁnancing.     Yes. Two things, Shar. One, as Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks, in our existing plan that we walked through in some detail back in March, we highlighted $1.1 billion of spending in oﬀshore wind in our plan from 2019 through '23. So obviously, recent announcements are much larger dollars than that, but the vast majority of the increase is going to come in those years of completion, '24, '25, '26. So the majority of the spending to come in our current planning horizon is already in our plans that we walked through. And the rest, we'll update over time as time comes closer. But given what Tom and Paul just described, this is all in a regulatory construct to be ﬁnanced at VEPCO. It's certainly achievable, but the details will come in the next period."
"Got it. That's helpful. And then just around the VRP, the retirement plan, is there any status? And then I know your past comments is its supportive of your growth. Maybe just a little bit of a sense on how that program is going, how it's shaping the O&M proﬁle. And sort of bigger picture is VRP, oﬀshore wind, the rate plans you have in Virginia, is there a point in time when you can change the way you guide to growth, i.e., moving from 5% plus more of a range, especially as we're trying to model what the incremental accretion is from oﬀshore wind? Because it just seems like between Cove Point, your plan is becoming much more visible. So is there a point in time when you can start to layer in more of a deﬁnitive growth range versus 5% plus?","Sure. You linked quite a few things into one question there, good job. Yes. Look, the oﬀshore wind, what that does to our guidance, I mean, it's beyond our ﬁve-year planning horizon. So the spending and then the associated earnings, as I just walked through, the $1.1 billion, including the pilot, I mean, that's in our plan. It's in our earnings guidance. There are no changes for now on that front.  On the VRP, you're right, that's kind of done and dusted earlier this year. We talked about that as being a savings of, call it, $0.05 to $0.06 this year, maybe double that on a full run rate next year and diminishing over time as it's getting back to customers. So that -- we talked about that as being available savings to oﬀset unforeseen headwinds, and that's still the case. But as an   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   update, this year, as you know, the vast majority of our business, 95% of our business is not commodity exposed in any way, the 5% that's not regulated or regulated-like is. And within that 5% of our operating earnings, there are a couple of things.  One is, obviously, the gas commodity environment is weak and our business is largely immune to that. We have a little bit of exposure mostly around our single remaining processing plant, which is in West Virginia and that's a little bit of a headwind as those businesses go from like very small to even smaller this year. So that's a little bit of a headwind. More materially, though, this farm-out program, that has been very successful. As you know, Shar, this is monetizing acreage and mineral resources below our storage ﬁeld. We announced that program in early 2015, and we gave guidance to the end of the decade of $450 million to $500 million of pretax earnings, and we've been ticking along that kind of like clockwork. We're 75% through that guidance.  But given the pricing, given the commodity environment and the pricing that's available to us today, we're choosing not to transact on a farm-out this year. And we're going to hold that acreage and that value for farm-out transactions in future periods when there's an improvement in the commodity pricing environment. So what that means is, obviously, we've just reiterated our guidance, same midpoint. So that means we've overcome any unforeseen headwind, previously unforeseen, relating to our decision not to transact on a farm-out this year. So that's basically the VRP savings, which we're using it pretty much as we described we would, VRP savings and other initiatives to overcome that decision. So no change to our guidance. Those are the parts."
Perfect guys. Thank you so much.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
"Yes. Hey, good morning.",Good morning.
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So -- hey, Tom. So the -- your oﬀshore wind is obviously diﬀerent from really any other so far, and that it's going to be done -- plan to be done in the regulated business. How do you know that, that structure of it will be approved? Or could there be people that want to try to bid for it, et cetera? Could you talk about that?","Sure. Well, we're the only one that owns the oﬀshore lease. We own 100% of the oﬀshore lease. We paid for it in the auction. Nobody else can build a wind farm oﬀ of Virginia. Governor Northam, a few -- I guess a couple of months ago now, called for the construction of this wind farm because it's his intention to help Virginia develop into the center of the oﬀshore wind industry along the East Coast, and that's a challenge that we embrace.  And he speciﬁcally said that, he recognized that there may be some who want to push back on that, on whether it was necessary, required or a good thing for Virginia, that he was going to work very hard to ensure that the public policy and regulatory support is in place to carry out this plan. And it was only after those statements that we went ahead with our announcement to full deployment, although we had been working obviously because we ﬁled for the PGM -- PJM interconnection agreement. So there's obviously a process in front of us. We are highly conﬁdent that it will be carried out to fruition.  There is a lot of public support from this -- for this project, including from political leaders on both sides of the political fence, both Democrats and Republicans, that want to see this thing happen. So we have -- obviously, there are -- a long way to go on it, but we have high conﬁdence level in it going forward. It'll be the only oﬀshore wind farm in federal waters. It will not be visible from the shore line.  So you don't have any of these visual impacts that concern people. The environmental community is very supportive of the project going forward. The economic development people in Tidewater, Virginia, are very supportive of this going forward. So obviously, we don't have any guarantees of that, Steve, but we have a very high conﬁdence level in the outcome."
Okay. Great. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Hey, good morning, Tim.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"And congratulations to all those receiving promotions here. I know there's a number. Perhaps just to pile on, on this oﬀshore wind question and perhaps to complement that, you talked about potentially ﬁnding ways to mitigate cost to consumers. Can you talk a little bit more precisely about the game plan, ﬁrst, for qualifying on the tax credit front just given the longevity of the plan, but obviously, as you're starting today until you qualify some of it? And then separately, when you'll come out with more deﬁnitive plans and ﬁlings, except maybe following the last question here, to actually pursue this at the SEC level?","Well, ﬁrst, let me just give you a macro answer, Julien. And the folks who got the promotions are in the room, they heard your congratulations. On a macro basis, I'll turn it over to Paul Koonce.  We are very concerned here about customer rates. It's something we focus on all the time. And because our goal is to ensure that our customer rates stay very competitive, well below national averages, below the regional averages, they are now. And we intend for them to stay that way, including with the construction of this wind farm. So we will be working very hard with the fabricators, developers, installers. We will be the operators to ensure that we get the costs down as low as we can as we go ahead, which will be important for everybody involved helping us with the project. So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul.     Thanks, Tom. Again, just to follow up on Tom's comments about costs, I think that's one of the key reasons why we broke the project up in three phases so that we could continue to let the supply chain mature, let the costs continue to come down so that the impact to rates are minimized. Just in terms of ITC and safe harboring, of course, as you know, in order to qualify for ITC, a treatment for an oﬀshore wind farm, you have to begin construction this year. We're looking at that. We don't have anything to comment about that, but we're aware of that timing. There may be some things that we can do to safe harbor certain of those costs. So we're exploring that, more to come on that in 2020.  In terms of plans and ﬁlings, we're not -- as Tom said, we're going to ﬁle for the BOEM application this time next year. We're not prepared to say exactly when we're going to ﬁle for the SEC application, but I can tell you that we will be conducting many public meetings over the course of 2020 as we make the environmental assessment. Obviously, marine life, plant and   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   birds, we'll be doing ocean mapping and we'll be doing geotech analysis or subsurface analysis. So you will begin to see all that sort of play out in 2020, and I think that will be a good way to sort of pace when we might expect to make an SEC ﬁling."
"Got it. But just to clarify the last question, too. How much of this is in the ﬁve-year window? Do you see it perhaps Phase 1, if you will?","Julien, we're -- as mentioned, we've got $1.1 billion in total in our ﬁve-year plan as we walked through in March. And for now, that's the number.     The $7 billion is additive to that.     That's right. Everything else comes in '24, 25, '26."
Okay. All right. Fair enough. Excellent. And then just to clarify the prior one on the order. Does that change the criteria that the SEC is going to be applying in that process?,"The -- Julien, this is Paul. The GTSA ﬁnds that oﬀshore wind is in the public interest. Now the SEC process is well known, whether they -- and how they conduct a market test. Anytime we build generation for the beneﬁt of our rate payers, there's a certain process that we follow and that's a process we know well and we'll just step through that when that time comes."
Thanks for the patience guys.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Please go ahead.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Thanks guys. Shar's question was like the question from back-to-school, one question but in 27 parts, right? On ACP, when I ﬁrst read the release, I felt like it was kind of -- my ﬁrst reaction was, oh, this is kind of negative. It looks like there could be slippage in the biological permit. But now that I'm hearing your commentary on it, I feel less -- I guess we should feel less concerned because you feel like even if the permit comes in after the turn of the year, you've scrubbed your construction cost forecast and you still feel like you can move the schedule around and come in on budget.","Thanks, Greg. I'll turn it over to Diane Leopold who spent a lot of her life working on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Go ahead.     Yes. When we look at it, I think you have it exactly right. We -- when we gave guidance earlier this year, we looked at a lot of diﬀerent scenarios and a lot of diﬀerent contingencies to try to capture a variety of outcomes, including going to the Supreme Court, including when we would restart construction. And so just given -- looking at the diﬀerent segments of the pipeline, we feel comfortable with -- that we are well within what we've incorporated for both cost and schedule at this point."
Can you give us some sense of why the permit may have slipped a few more months? Is it just that they're being extra careful to make sure that they comply with all the nuances of the remand and don't get another stay? Or is there something else going on?,"Greg, I don't think we're trying to imply that we think the permit has slipped. What we're trying to say is even if it does, we're still on the schedule and cost."
"Okay, great. My last question --",Not implying that we think it's going to slip.
"Sorry if I misconstrued that. The last part of my question. You talked to negotiations with the oﬀ- takers on the pipe who are mainly utilities. This is a demand-driven pipe. They need the gas,   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   which is why you're building it. It's not a supply push situation. I think investors are concerned that with the cost overruns, this winds up being a pipe that doesn't earn its cost of capital. But you seem to be positioning it in such a way that you should be able to potentially share the burden of those unexpected cost increases with the utilities who are taking the capacity. So can you talk through like how much of that you're -- you think you'll be able to share given the unforeseen delays in the pipe and what type of return we should expect on the pipe if you're successful?","Yes. This is Diane Leopold again. I won't get into the actual expected project returns. I will tell you, as Tom said in the actual script, the customers very much need this pipeline for regional security for their own customers' needs. This is clearly a demand-driven pipeline. And we are in very constructive negotiations with the customer for fair rates to their customers as well as fair returns for us, and we're comfortable with the returns that we'll get for the pipeline."
Okay. Thank you very much.,Thank you. Greg.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Christopher Turnure with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Tom, I think you spent a lot of time in your prepared remarks on the political environment in Virginia and kind of how you guys are thinking about that and the legislation from last year. But could you give us an update to both the South Carolina and North Carolina -- pardon me, South Carolina and Virginia regulatory environments right now and political environments and also just the latest on your South Carolina regulatory strategy for next year?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Sure. The -- we announced the South Carolina -- the SCANA merger, I guess, late in -- I guess it was '17 and then spent the year '18 going through the process. And it was a relatively hot political climate in South Carolina over -- because of SCANA and Santee Cooper's cancellation of the expansion of the Summer nuclear plants. We went through that whole process, very transparently answered all the questions, went to all the meetings. And then as we closed the transaction, we said to policymakers that our intention was to stay out of the headlines, do our blocking and tackling, provide reliable service, both gas and electric at reasonable and much reduced electric rates, and just be part of the community.  That was our goal, and that's exactly what's happened in the state of South Carolina. Things are very -- moving along very well there, progressing well. We're out of the headlines except when we do things in the communities we serve, including the extraordinarily prompt restoration of the loss of electricity for 40% of our customers, got all our lights back on in three days. All that helps community understand their new neighbor. We will be ﬁling a rate case next year. We are under earning in South Carolina. It's well known to everybody. And we're formulating and completing that regulatory strategy now, but we will be ﬁling in -- I do want to -- May --     You have to ﬁle before May 1.     Before May 1, 2020. I'm sorry, in North Carolina, we have a great case going in North Carolina. We've settled all but one or two. We consider them to be relatively small issues, got agreed on 9.75% ROE, very constructive regulatory environment and economic development environment in North Carolina."
"And in Virginia, if the legislature stays Republican, would that change some of the plans that you've been talking about today or kind of shift your capital spending at all in a diﬀerent direction?","No. We have a long history of working with whatever parties in the majority in whatever -- the two houses, with Democratic governors, Republican governors, Democratic leaders and Republican leaders. So don't expect any changes to our plan."
Okay. And then my second question is just on equity needs going forward. I think you partially addressed this in your prepared remarks but some. Will the sale of the stake in Cove Point mean that you will not need any equity internal or external for the next several years?,"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes. Going back to our -- it's Jim. Going back to our guidance from our Analyst Day back in March, we had shown a projection through '21 that had equity component to support our regulated capital spending of $300 million of DRIP as on and $300 million to $500 million per year of ATMs, so all done under our programs. With the Cove ﬁnancing, we are using 100% of those proceeds by year-end, $2 billion to pay down parent-level debt, as I mentioned. But we will eﬀectively oﬀset the ATM portion of that prior guidance in '20 and '21. So taking a midpoint of that $300 million to $500 million range, $400 million, so that goes to zero. But the DRIP is just always on, so that will be the only remaining program that's active for equity in those years."
"Okay. That's clear. Thank you, Jim.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Hi guys.,Good morning.
"Hey -- on Cove Point, -- good morning. Is there any interest in selling an additional stake in Cove Point at this point? Or is this now -- you're now at the minimum desired level of ownership?",Thank you for that question. We -- there's no interest in that. We're in our desired outcome.
"Okay. And in the discussions with the ACP customers, I just wanted to be clear that the talks are overall cost increases above the, I think, $6.25 billion that's currently in the agreement, embedded in current agreements?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes. It's -- I won't disclose anything in the contract, but it's basically negotiating cost increases up to the current anticipated levels."
And is there anything you can say about what those contracts obligate each party at on the face of it at this point before negotiations?,No. No. We don't want to disclose that. Thanks.
Okay. And just one last question I had is about the renewable tariﬀ. I think you had some major C&I customers in Virginia looking to -- for alternative suppliers. And have you guys -- has Virginia -- has the Virginia Utility received permission to have its own renewable tariﬀ at this point so that they can compete against these renewable suppliers?,"I'll ask Bob Blue to answer that question.     And Michael, it's Bob. We have pending an application for a 100% renewable energy tariﬀ. As you know, in Virginia law, customers can seek service from a competitive service provider unless the utility has 100% renewable tariﬀ. We ﬁled for one earlier this year. We'll have hearing on that in November. The State Corporation Commission staﬀ ﬁled their testament yesterday and did not raise signiﬁcant objections to our proposal. And the one that we have ﬁled is modeled closely on one that was approved earlier by the commission. So we feel very good about where that will go."
