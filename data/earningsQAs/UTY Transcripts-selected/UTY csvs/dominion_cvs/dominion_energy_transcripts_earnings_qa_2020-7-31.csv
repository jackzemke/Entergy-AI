Question,Answer
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Good morning. Can everybody hear me?,"Yes, we can. Good morning."
"Well, thanks for taking my questions. And before we start, congratulations to both you, Tom, Bob and Diane for the announcements today.",Thank you.
"Just two real quick questions. On Slide eight, you discuss -- you discussed an Investor Day style ﬁnancial update, which will include a rolling forward of the capital plan in a rate base estimate. Would this include a year-by-year and -- or a segment-by-segment program breakdown of the capital spend, as well as the associated rate base-by-year and segment?","Hey, James. Good morning, it's Jim. Yes. So we -- we're in the planning stages for that for the fourth quarter rollout of that Analyst Day Investor Day style refresh and we hope to do at least the kinds of things we did last time around last March where we did provide by segment and mostly by year rate base and other growth data. So if we can improve on that a little bit. We're thinking through how to do that. We welcome feedback. But we do expect to provide kind of everything you just mentioned on the fourth quarter call."
"Okay and I mean and just staying in that vein, since you've already given sort of some of the ﬁnancing through 2024, we're going to be rolling forward a year, will we probably roll this out to -- will this be like 2021 through 2025? How are you thinking about that?","Yeah, I haven't signed that yet, but that's a possibility for sure and I would say, let me add that our existing disclosure, it is not -- it's not so out of date. Last March we set out $26 billion of growth capital spending from 19 to 23. We updated some of that on the ﬁrst quarter call this year, for three programs under the VCEA in Virginia, obviously longer term, our gas transmission storage capital spend, which is about 3.5 billion comes out of that, but our existing guidance is still largely intact and relevant but we will be providing that roll forward with more granular updates on the fourth quarter call.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"And then just last question on this part of it is and really just kind of sticking to the 2025 sort of time frame. You've given a lot of line of sight on the ﬁnancing through 2024, but your CapEx really as you start to do the -- oﬀshore wind starts to really building up in 23, 24, just wondering if you are looking to sort of move your CapEx forecast out a little bit farther to kind of talk about the ﬁnancing plan as we move into 24 through 26 and the oﬀshore wind starts coming online.","Yeah, fair enough. I mean, those numbers do get big and there's a lot of visibility around that oﬀshore wind spend, but I would say that on an overall basis the cadence of that $26 billion that will build number and update number, and this -- it's pretty, it's pretty much a run rate so you have a slight increase there. So, you know, if we -- kind of we provide additional detail or an additional year of capital spend, we'll also support that with information on our ﬁnancing plan, but I wouldn't expect a drastic departure from our kind of run rate numbers that we've talked about today."
(Technical Diﬃculty),"Yeah, James, you were cutting out there a little bit but, yeah, that kind of run rate, again, we'll provide an update on the fourth quarter call, but it's not going to be a drastic departure from that if that was your question."
"Yeah, yeah, no, that's perfect. And then the last question, I apologize, but clearly there's been a lot of press in the last week surrounding political spending practices and vehicles. On Slide 20 you brieﬂy address your rankings in the CPA-Zicklin index, which highlights user trends that are under their methodology but I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more To your past and current use of social welfare organizations like the 501(c)(4) and do you plan to modify your political strategies at all in light of the recent investigations?","Sure, thanks for asking. First, we have fully disclosed 501(c)(4) contributions for many years. Zicklin center you referenced is an independent organization that works with the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, to look at a huge, a very wide variety of factors and they rank all these companies on their disclosure practices and our disclosure is ranked among the highest in the country, certainly among the highest in utilities or its transparency. Now, like I say, we've disclosed all of them and over the last ﬁve years, I think our contributions have been under $500,000, 70% of which went to an organization that associated with American Petroleum, it's to supporting pipeline projects.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So we are -- fully disclosed everything. It's not a -- it's a very small part of what we do, under $500,000 over ﬁve years and we have no intention of changing our practices because they are perfectly appropriate, completely compliant with every state and federal law by wide margins. We are -- we have nothing to be concerned about with respect to any of our political giving or giving to these so called 501(c)(4)s."
"Great, thanks for all the time and sorry, sorry about the phone breaking up there in the middle. Have a good weekend.","That's okay. We heard you, we heard you. Thanks, James.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from Shahriar Pourreza with the Guggenheim Partners."
"Hey, good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Just on the equity guide, some people may be struggling with it, buying back this year and starting to issue next year. Can you touch on this thought and why not decide to delever and further sort of improve the credit metrics versus buying back, which could be sort of multiple accretive in and of itself? So, but -- and I just have a quick follow-up.","Yes, Shah, let me start, let me start there. So, look, our balance sheet is already in the right place and I don't want to take time to go through all the history but I think as you know we've made just a ton of progress in that area over the last several years and it's even better pro forma for the sale of the G&S business so that sale, almost $6 billion of the $10 billion transaction value is really from our perspective debt retirement so I think agencies have recognized that also in their commentaries. I just talked about positive outlook from S&P.  So given, given that, the status of our balance sheet and the related improvements from this transaction, we feel pretty good about our plan to provide the net proceeds back to our shareholders in this, in this buyback, which we're, as I mentioned, we're targeting for completion by the end of the year. But that said, we do have a a sizable clean energy and   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   related capital spend program, just talked about that with James and it's only increasing as we go through the year slowly.  So therefore we do -- even though we're doing the buyback and we're giving the net proceeds back to our shareholders, we think it's prudent, with that strong balance sheet position we're in, we do plan to recommence some equity issuance, even if it's just in the form of DRIP in 2021 and beyond. But I think, I think perspective is important. I mean, for spending programs of the size of what we're doing to be starting out with DRIP less than 0.5 percentage point of our market cap a year and a pretty eﬃcient program like DRIP and later just with other eﬃcient programs, all our ATM, we think it's overall pretty modest and we think it's the best way to go."
"Got it and then just honing in on the buyback, what speciﬁcally again driving the upsizing, can you sort of quantify? And then on the timing, seems that 4Q purchases could be a little bit conservative on your viewpoint. Can you buyback sooner even if you don't have the proceeds in the door, you know, and can you potentially close this transaction sooner than 4Q? So what's driving the upsizing and can you start to buyback sooner than 4Q even if the proceeds aren't in the door? Thanks.","Yeah, so we have a couple of things there. We have Board authority to commence our buybacks with immediate eﬀect. We do not need to wait until the transaction closes. But we haven't bought any yet and we retain kind of full ﬂexibility. We could do that with open market purchases. We could do it with accelerated share repurchase of the tender, a Dutch auction, so more guidance to come on that through the fall as we go. We do expect still to complete that by the end of the year even if we start sooner. We're not guiding to any diﬀerent closing timeline than, kind of early fourth quarter. All of that all remains on track. But then as it relates to the amount, the quantum, yes, we mentioned there is upward bias. So where is that coming from? It more -- we'll provide more detail on that too as we go.  But that comes from, ﬁrst of all, just a conservative ﬁrst cut on what the tax, cash taxes would be on this sale. We indicated about $700 million. So there's interplay there between the tax aspects of the sale and the tax aspects of the -- then it was pipeline abandonment and impairment of supply header and the interplay of our sizable tax credit position. So as we continue to do more work on that, we see probably if anything a downward bias in the taxes payable from 700 and therefore an upward bias in the size of the buyback. And it's not huge. I mean, again we'll come to the guidance as somewhere between zero and 200 million, kind of that magnitude. Then we'll provide more guidance. But again, conservative ﬁrst cut, probably improving from there modestly and we'll provide more detail on all that as we, as we go through the fall."
"Got it. Thanks, Jim. And Tom, congrats on phase two of your career.","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Oh, thank you, Shah, appreciate it.  Operator   Thank you. Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to you, Tom, as well.","Thank you, Durgesh, thank you."
"So maybe just starting oﬀ, I actually have one question only, just the other questions have been answered. Jim, has -- so the credit rating agencies oppose the transaction, obviously came out with a positive view. I didn't see it, but is there a chance that your FFO to debt metrics get adjusted year going forward now that the business mix is is very diﬀerent?","Thanks, Durgesh. By that do you mean kind of the downgrade or upgrade thresholds from the agencies?"
"Exactly, yes.","I think they're -- I can't speak for the agencies there on the downgra -- on the downgrade side. There hasn't been that action yet. I would think that as we continue to execute on this plan and improve on our business risk proﬁle, de-risk our proﬁle, that that would be a logical thing to discuss but we're not, we're not the kind of folks to expect that in the near term, but I understand the question and we'll see what happens."
"Understood. Thanks, guys. And great quarter again. Thank you.",Thank you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi, good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Good morning. Hey, yes, congratulations, Tom, Bob and Diane, both -- all three of you. I just want to ask about the -- as we get closer to the triennial review, I think you're going to -- you should be ﬁling it pretty soon if not already, what should we be looking for there in terms of timeline and dates and hearings and things like that?","Hey, Michael, it's Bob Blue. So obviously we're focused on that triennial. We will ﬁle in March of next year and it will be litigated over the course of that year, with the decision by the end of November. So that's the cadence for that."
"Okay, great. And in terms of the oﬀshore wind project, it wasn't really much mentioned in the presentation this time around, but I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on, I guess, the ﬁling, which I think you're still planning towards the end of the year, right, with BOEM?","Right. We expect to ﬁle the comp with BOEM at the end of this year and it's progressing well. The survey and geotechnical work and preparation of that are going very well. So we're pleased, just as we were pleased with construction on the test terms."
"And is that project included on that -- the slide that shows the 15, over 15% increase in renewable generation over 2035?",Yes.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)
"Okay, so -- and it's a relatively small part of it, it looks like solar's the vast majority of it, right?","That's correct. It's a large solar build. I don't really think of the commercial product as small however, it's the largest in the Americas."
"It looks like it's going to get to work by, by solar. Is that all in the state of Virginia and South Carolina, I suppose?","It's within the PJM footprint but we're talking mostly in Virginia, yes."
"Great. Alright, thank you very much, guys and congratulations again and have a good weekend.","Thanks, Michael, you too.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research."
"Hi, good morning.","Morning, Steve."
"First -- Hey, Tom. Congrats to you, been a long time and also congrats to Bob and to Diane. Well deserved, so.","Thank you, Steve.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
In good hands. So I guess just could you just remind us what you need to do to actually get the transaction closed in terms of approvals just so we're tracking that?,We just have HSR really and that's progressing along just ﬁne.
"Okay, great. And then, I mean, there'ss not going to be a lot of time to actually execute on the buyback in Q4. It's a decent amount, the stock, so could you just talk about kind of how you're thinking about doing it?","Yes, let me go there, Steve. So again, we don't have to do the guidance on that yet and we'll provide more through the fall, but I just mentioned all those kind of options we have at our disposal to get that done, but we don't necessarily need to wait until the fourth quarter to start. And we probably won't. So it could, it could be, it very well could be a mix of approaches, market purchases and other approaches in addition to or in place of fourth quarter tender style event. So I know that's pretty broad but we don't need to compress that into just a month or two in the fourth quarter. We have the authority to start now."
"Okay. And then maybe just when you look at -- I guess that -- I know you said you're going to be doing a lot of continued marketing on the company and story in the kind of the new clean energy, further refocus there. Just maybe you could give a little color on what kind of feedback you've gotten so far, because obviously there was big news with the ﬁnancial changes and then this refocus, what kind of investor feedback you've gotten so far.","Yes, let me start there and that was just three weeks ago or so when we made this announcement and, yes, we did get quite a bit of feedback from across the spectrum, diﬀerent types of investors and we took it all to heart. We sat around and considered a lot of it pretty carefully including notably the feedback from retail investors who are very focused on dividend and income invest -- income fund investors. So we get that and took that to heart. But the feedback from, I guess, maybe longer term investors, institutional investors and those investors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that are in North America or elsewhere that increasingly are thinking about their investment decisions through the lens of ESG topics, that feedback was pretty positive on the long-term prospects of this transaction, repositioning the company in this way, strengthening the balance sheet, increasing the growth rate, highlighting all the already underway ESG spending programs, clean energy and related. So that feedback's been pretty good, but it is a change, a material change for Dominion.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So we have been already and we highlighted here that we're going to spend a lot of time in the next few months just reconnecting with people. Existing investors, prospective investors are walking through that story, making sure everyone gets it, not only what we've done, but exactly what we're doing under the spending programs and the size and scale and cadence in the ﬁnancing. So there's a lot to talk about and one thing that's been consistent in all of our interactions with investors, just in perspective in the last two weeks, is everyone really wants to spend more time to make sure they get it and are understanding all the dynamics, but overall it's been, it's been pretty positive."
"Okay, great. Thank you.","Thanks, Steve.  Operator  Thank you. And our last question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan."
"Hi, good morning. Thanks for ﬁtting me in here. Just a multi-pronged question in natural gas if I could here. Just wondering how you think the needs in your service territories have changed over time since you ﬁrst announced ACP and with the ACP cancellation, what are your expectations for gas distribution CapEx into the fourth quarter refresh here? Is there an upward bias (technical diﬃculties) competing for capital? And ﬁnally, if I ﬁt into the picture over time here?","Thank you for the que -- I'm just on a -- let me -- I'm going to answer the very ﬁrst part of it and then turn it over to Diane. The need for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in our service territory, of course, the service territory for us was Virginia and North Carolina and potentially South Carolina. Well, the need has not changed at all. The result of it is that need will go unmet as a result of the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The pipeline was over 90% subscribed for 15 years by utility companies that were going to use it to serve gas distribution customers and convert coal plants to natural gas facilities over the years to come. That need will now go unmet so with respect to that one project, no change. The balance of the questions, I'll turn it over to Diane.     Okay. Good morning. So with respect to the LDC capital spend and fresh look in the Q4 call, but we really don't see any change there. So we really have jurisdictions that are in very supportive states for our programs and they're in high-growth areas. So we have North Carolina, Utah, Ohio, West Virginia in the key jurisdictions. We have pipeline replacement   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   programs in essentially all of those areas that are signiﬁcant and are commissioned for those programs and the need to have that infrastructure replacement for safety, reliability and sustainability so really don't see anything but growth projects to meet the increasing demand in these high growth areas.  So really no change on the LDC side. With respect to hydrogen, we do see that there will be an increase in hydrogen utilization in the energy mix over the next several decades and we've certainly spent a lot of time studying it. At the moment, at least to our knowledge, no continental US LDC is blending hydrogen into supply mix today. We committed a couple of years ago to making sure our LDC system is ready to accept up to 5% hydrogen by 2030, so just in the next decade and our initial pilot is in advanced planning stages in Utah. So high level, we think there's going to be a lot of activity in this area, but for the most part it's still in that study and preparatory planning stage but expected to be ramping up and look forward to sharing updates."
"That's very helpful. Thanks. And just back to the gas situation real quick. With MVP, do you think that there is any role for that to play, I guess, in meeting some of those needs that are going to go unmet without ACP?",Not that we can see.
"Got it. And just one last one if I could. With regards to the upcoming election here, just wondering if you had any preliminary thoughts on potential impacts at the federal or state level for Dominion overall?",I have no intention whatsoever of commenting on the upcoming elections in any respect.
"Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And this does conclude this morning's conference call. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day.
