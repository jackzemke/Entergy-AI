Question,Answer
"Hey, guys, good morning.","Good morning, Shar.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)      Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Bob, just as one of my favorite questions to ask you is, obviously, as we're getting closer to the Investor Day, I guess is there any changes to your expectations for kind of this turnkey event now that you've sold Cove or could there still be some contingencies on potential ongoing sale processes? So with all of our questions be answered as we think about the balance sheet, base earnings growth rate, et cetera, as we head into that event.","Yeah, no change, Shar, and we would expect to your questions to be answered. As we've said, our objective is to eliminate as many input variables as possible by the time we get to that Investor Day, and we're on track to do that, so no change."
"Okay, good. And then, it's good to see on the oﬀshore wind you guys have locked-in additional costs there. And I don't need to like ask a blunt question like this, but it might as well, but can you just tell us if you've had any interest in the wind stake option at all at this point, just given what we've been seeing around?","Yeah, Shar, as we've said throughout the business review, we're reviewing from top-to-bottom, taking a look at everything in the business. By statute, there is an option for us related to oﬀshore wind and we're reviewing that as part of the business review, but I can't update you anymore on it."
"Okay, okay. And then, just lastly, one of the Millstone units obviously heading for another outage this fall, I mean, can you just talk about sort of talk to the quantum, like that O&M there and it seems like there has been some issues with the units this year, is there any kind of major capital investments you may be facing there? Thanks.","Shar, this is Steve, I'll take, with regard to the fall outage I mentioned we'll see about $0.02 of that hurt in Q3 and the remainder of the hurt in Q4. It's fairly standard. Think about, typical planned outage is about a $50 million O&M hurt given how we accelerate that work during that time period. And then of course on top of that, there is loss margin from that unit not actually producing electricity to sale. But there's nothing unusual about the planned outage in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, the performance of Millstone in the second quarter is very   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   uncharacteristic and it was something we're taking very, very seriously as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Those units will continue to operate at very high reliability going forward. There was no fundamental issue that we discovered that we expect is going to require massive amounts of capital investment going forward to remediate going forward."
"Okay, all right, perfect, guys, that's all I had, so we wait for the Q3 update. Thanks, appreciate it.","Thanks, Shar.  Operator  And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy.     Good morning, Jeremy."
"I was just wondering if you could help me -- help me out a bit with I guess earnings trajectory for the business overall. If we look at kind of year-to-date results in 3Q guide, and the 4Q is ﬂat year-over-year, it seems like it's down a bit year over here and so I'm just wondering if you could share any other thoughts as far as trajectory and what could revert next year to may -- with '24?","Hey, Jeremy, it's Steve. That's really good question, thanks for that. So let me start with this, at the Investor Day, which we intend to have in the third quarter, we're going to provide very clear direction on our company's post-review earnings and earnings growth outlook, including a buildup of the parts to that consolidated forecast. I would just say that 2023 is very much a transition year for us and I understand that it does make it more challenging to model. But since the initiation of the review, I think we've tried to be very transparent as we've delivered results around key drivers that are going to impact 2023 results, including the DEV rider role and interest expense, and we don't see that those major categories have changed much. So we haven't given full-year guidance as we mentioned, but I would say we're cognizant of   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   investment community's interest in what the earnings potential of the company is going to be and the good news is that we're going to be very comprehensive in how we address that as part of the Investor Day."
"Got it, makes sense. We will stay tuned for that. Maybe looking in the rear-view at this point if you're able to oﬀer more commentary in Virginia now with being approved, what is the reaction from regulators and stakeholders then to the DEV rate reduction there? Just trying to get a temperature check on everything in Virginia.","Yeah, as you would expect people are pretty positive about a rate reduction. I think that if you look at the history of our regulatory outcomes in Virginia over the last few years, you see approval of the variety of new clean energy programs, approval of subsequent license renewal investments, approval of transmission projects, we've I believe worked well with stakeholders and the regulatory process and achieved strong outcomes. And I think if you look at the big- picture, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our reliability is high, our rates are competitive, substantially below the national average, that's a very good place to be when you're in front of your regulators."
"Got it, that's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  And our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to just start oﬀ on the demand side, do you feel PJM's peak forecast kind of accurately capture the growth that you're seeing in Virginia? And maybe how do you think about that in the context of your forecast for electric sales growth in Virginia going forward? It seems like it's pretty in line for 2023, but just kind of as you think about 2024 and beyond.","We've spent a lot of time talking to PJM over the last few years on what we're seeing in terms of data centers and we believe that is reﬂected in their most recent sales forecast, which is robust. But we're seeing robust interest and as we described in our prepared remarks, we're seeing strong demand growth this year in line with what we would expect over the course of the next   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   few years. There's just no evidence that we can see that this kind of growth is abating, where more and more interest from data center customers in our service territory and so I would say the PJM forecast is pretty reﬂective of what we expect the future will look like."
"Great, that's helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up kind of, I appreciate all the updates that you provided on Virginia, just wanted to touch on the nuclear life extension program. Can you just talk about kind of what investments are included in that initial $1.2 billion? And then what other potential phases of that program could look like?","Yes, so the overall investment we expect to be $4 billion and it is a variety of programs. A chunk of what's in that early $1.2 billion for example is, we have a lot of big piping at our stations that we've put up sort of carbon, ﬁber inlay, and that will allow them to be quite reliable for many, many years. There are -- the host of other projects, large and small, that will be included in that $4 billion, but will put us in a strong position to be able to operate at North Anna and at Surry for an additional 20 years. We can give you some more speciﬁc detail post-call if you're looking for it, we've got that in the ﬁlings."
