Question,Answer
"Hey, good afternoon guys. Good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"So good details on your CapEx projections with solar, onshore wind, oﬀshore wind post the passage of the legislation. And obviously you guys increased your capital budget for clean energy investments through your planning period. Is there anything you could point to structurally that could hinder you pulling additional spend forward as your total investment opportunity set is materially higher, i.e., bill headroom permitting? Obviously oﬀshore wind may have some hindrances, but how do we sort of think about further onshore or solar spend being pulled forward? So trying to get a little bit of a sense on any potential upside to the near-term plan and your current plus 5% growth trajectory, which is proving somewhat manageable.","Hey, Shahr. Good morning, it's Jim. Thanks for that. Yes, what we've done here is we have not obviously done a Full Monty roll forward of all of our capital spending and addressed more holistically our long-term growth rate, et cetera. All we've done today is we've addressed an update, a roll forward for a new ﬁve year period, just for three programs, just within one segment. So we, of course, do the more holistic view less frequently. We did in '16, we did in '19, so that's not for today. So we'll ﬁnd a time in the future where we will do a full walk through and be able to provide a little more color on other moving parts other than just these three updates on the speciﬁc spending programs within DEV."
"Good. Got it. So like, so I guess the take away, and correct me if I'm wrong, if the plan is becoming much more sustainable, much more, you'll be able to ﬁne tune that 5 plus percent growth rate in time?","Yes, keeping in mind when we said, when we set the 5% plus growth rate, when we announced that last March, we had in our minds that this kind of spending program is going to continue or maybe even increase in Virginia and elsewhere, but that's right, we'll come back and address   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   something more holistically when we're not kind of in the midst of a global pandemic. We didn't think this is the right time."
"Got it. Got it. Agreed there, by the way. So just a real quick last question on ACP. You know, you kind of state a timely resolution to the Nationwide 12 permit, right? Is there any more color you can provide on this, I mean, when would you start to re-evaluate the timing of the resolution was pushed to a later part of the year? And then Tom, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on your latest contract negotiations with customers? What's been sort of the debate? Or what's been sort of the push-pull or there is it more focused on COVID and that's been a bit of a slowdown? So just maybe a little bit more elaboration on the negotiations and I'll jump back in the queue. Thanks.","Thanks. Shahr, I'll talk. I'll answer the ﬁrst part of your ﬁrst question, Diane will answer your second question. So the key dates for us is as we said is the tree cutting season, which runs through the end of, through March of next year. We need now 10 weeks or so of tree cutting period 10, 12 weeks to complete what we need to. You need to keep in mind, we already have 250 miles of trees cut on this 600 mile pipeline, and not every single mile has trees on it, actually 100 of miles do not. So that's the tree, that's the real key for us is getting into that tree cutting season. So we'll see what happens. A lot of people were quite surprised by the judge's decision. And there is a lot of-- I think you should expect to see a lot of a [ph]Amicus briefs being ﬁled, pointing out that this, I mean, what he talked about was all forms of utility infrastructure, not just an oil pipeline in Montana. It was every single utility infrastructure program in the country. So it seems like a, maybe a strong action by the judge, may be not completely justiﬁed by the case before it. So we'll, well, we just have to see how that goes. Of course, you can go to the 9th Circuit after that and things. But we'll judge that as it goes along.  On the second part of your question, I'll turn it over to Diane Leopold.     Okay. Good morning. And I believe your question was related to the customer negotiations, and if I'm not answering, let me know."
Okay.,But the customer negotiations are complete. They have been ﬁnalized throughout the quarter. So the rate and all the other terms and conditions have been completed to ensure that there is a fair rate of return for the project and it balances customer needs and customer costs.
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got it. And any change in the return assumptions that's material to disclose?,No.
"Excellent. Thanks, guys. Congrats. It's a very resilient plan. Congrats.","Thank you.     Thanks, Shahr.  Operator  Thank you. And moving on to our next question. This comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, sir."
"Thanks. Good morning, and hope all of you are doing well. I'm looking forward--","Thank you, Steve."
"Jim I'm looking forward to Full Monty roll forward. Looking forward to the Full Monty roll forward, Jim.",Now (inaudible) little too (inaudible).
"But just, just maybe to ﬁll that picture and a little bit the, the, any color on kind of ﬁnancing need changes with the higher capital plan, maybe that would come with a roll forward, but how should we think about that?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Yeah, I think that's fair. That will come with the roll forward, but we're outlining here spending plans that are large but over a 15-year time period. So when it comes to ﬁnancing, we're going to continue our process of getting that one year and sometimes multiple years in advance. There is no change in the near term, and certainly no change this year but we'll revisit what the ﬁnancing mix will be kind of across the board as we, as we do a more holistic update. I would note though for the avoidance of doubt that for these programs, we've talked about under the VCEA all the ﬁnancing will be at DEV, so VEPCO legal entity. So we're not considering project ﬁnancings or other things like that. It will be a mix of regular rate ﬁnancing at VEPCO. But more to come, when we provide more holistic updates."
"Okay. And then maybe kind of a, a bit of a speciﬁc, but also a high-level question for Tom. So just the whole picture of Virginia with this plan obviously seems to be very, very green, clean sustainable focused program. So maybe you could just give a little color on kind of the whole what the state is trying to do with this, and kind of the view of, view in the context of the state. And then speciﬁcally this part of the plan, the new plan on the Jones Act that's all, just any color on how that would work can ﬁt into, may be ﬁt into kind of this whole Virginia plan?","Sure, Steve. So, just to refresh everybody on the state of Virginia politics. For the ﬁrst time, and I think it's 30 years in this session of the General Assembly, we had elections last year. We are always oﬀ year for our state legislature both in the Senate and the House of delegates and for the ﬁrst time, it's either 20 or 30 years, I don't remember which, how many decades. You had Democratic Party in charge of both houses, plus the executive branch. And there was a lot of interest among the new members of the House and Senate to advance a number of policies on many fronts, not just in energy, there was all sorts of legislation around gun rights, for example, and a variety of other things, minimum wage et cetera. And there had been an eﬀort, we had worked for years with a number of groups on solar in particular and how to make sure that that came into Virginia in an eﬃcient cost eﬀective way, and we worked with a wide variety of the policy makers to ensure that these goals are achievable and still aﬀordable for our customers. And you can see from our IRP that was ﬁled last week, that we expect even with this spending plan, our plan B, under the IRP is the most likely plan, at least we think it is, the most likely plan. Others will weigh-in of course.  We will run a little bit of, right around traditional inﬂated rates of inﬂation. And we've joined RGGI in our rates, well, when you now compare our rates to the RGGI states, we're 40% lower than the average RGGI state. We're half of the highest RGGI state. And so there is a lot of room in there for us to stay extremely competitive. So Steve, I think overall, from a big picture view, it was part of an overall eﬀort across many diﬀerent parts of policy making to have a more progressive outlook as those policy makers would call it, a more progressive outlook on a variety of factors.  Your second question had to do with the vessel, which I'll turn over to Bob Blue.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)      Hi, good morning, Steve. I would put the vessel in the context, not just of Virginia, which Tom, did a nice job of describing, but in the entire East Coast. If you look from New England, all the way down to Virginia, there are a host of oﬀshore wind projects in various stages of development. All of those projects are looking for a Jones Act solution for installation, ours among them. So we're excited to be a leader in a consortium of potential infrastructure investors other participants in the industry on a vessel that will allow the installation of larger turbines compliant with the Jones Act, so we think that that project ﬁts very nicely into the context of what we're seeing in terms of oﬀshore wind development oﬀ the East Coast.     Can I, can I, in terms of--"
"And just, would that be in Virginia-- Yeah.","Sorry, sorry about that. Just when it comes to the, the proﬁle of that vessel, just to clarify, that will be fully contracted long-term proﬁle. And we don't have a number for our planned percentage ownership. We'll be an owner through our contracted duration segment, but we expect infrastructure style returns from that, business proﬁle, and therefore expect interest from infrastructure investors and other industry participants to cope fund that project."
Interesting.,Thank you.
"Okay, great. Thank you.","Thanks, Steve."
"Thank you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.",
Hi. Hi guys.,Good morning.
"Hey, the-- Good morning. Sorry about that.",Good morning.
"Hey, the Jones Act vessel is that going to be part of, is the cost of the investment as a part of the cost of the oﬀshore wind going forward, is that included in the CapEx proﬁle for that?","No. Michael, good question. It's not, the, the amount which is to be determined will be invested. Our stake will be invested through our Contracted Generation segment, not in DEV and not part of the capital spend, we outlined for oﬀshore wind."
Right. And what is the timing of-- it looks like about another 2.6 gigawatts of oﬀshore wind that you're planning on over the next 15 years. What's the timing of the second 2.6 gigawatts is that clearly after the ﬁrst 2.6?,"Yeah, absolutely. Still to be determined, where that might be, if you look at our IRP we show that coming in, in 2034, but it will be after our initial project which Tom described that we would expect to be in service at the end of '26."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And I apologize if you, you mentioned this before, but also the timing of investments in storage, battery storage is that, how is that case out going forward, are you waiting for any speciﬁc technological improvements before you begin to put signiﬁcant capital into that?","Yeah, it's Bob again. No, I wouldn't say we're waiting for speciﬁc technological improvements. As you know, we have mandate in the statute by 2035. We would expect to pay storage out during that period, it will take us a few years before we start layering it in. But again, if you look at the IRP. This is obviously generic storage. We don't have speciﬁc projects scoped out at this point, but we start layering it and around 2026 is when you would see that start to go into service. Based on the models we're describing here."
"Great, and one last question about data centers. Data center load is up, is that, that's on current data center is actually, I mean, is it running at higher capacities. I guess it's [ph]probably more home that you're sort of your does not?","Yeah. Again, it's Bob. The answer to that is, yes. So they're ramping. There is a ramp rate with data centers. We would usually see them start to hit a peak later in the year but they're peaking earlier this year. I don't know, you could, you could surmise, it's related to what's going on with the pandemic and more broadly, but we just know it's happening."
"Are you aware of any plans to expand and build more data centers as a result, like more than what have been built prior to the crisis?","Yes, we've had strong data center growth in our service territory for some time, and expected strong data center growth for some time to come, and we have seen no slowdown in that at all, would expect very strong data center growth going forward."
"All right, thank you, very much.",Thank you.  Operator   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Thank you. And our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.",Good morning.
"Good morning. Sorry if I missed it, but just, Virginia obviously looking pretty strong here, South Carolina. What are you assuming in the 2020 guide is as decline trends for the rest of the year?","It's the, I didn't hear the last part of the question.     Yeah, Durgesh, we couldn't hear quite the last part of your question? What was the assumption - -"
Sorry.,Or what for 2020.
The South Carolina demand decline trends in your 2020 guidance?,"Got it, Durgesh, sorry, we are having some technical diﬃculties. I got you. So what are our assumptions there? So year, a couple of things, we're obviously in Virginia, not a material impact yet, but we are seeing now these steps get underway economic reopening in Virginia and South Carolina, and South Carolina have announced yesterday, so modest steps underway, but we are not expecting like an immediate snap back. That's not the assumption that impacts our guidance. We're expecting that that will slowly recover through late summer. So when it comes to our guidance, we've obviously reaﬃrmed the annual guidance and long term, but there are a couple of gives and takes there, so one is weather, not your question but, we had $0.09 of weather-hurt, so the rest of the year like last year, we expect to make up some of the ground   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   that we lost in the ﬁrst quarter on whether. Virginia as you mentioned, no impact and we would expect in the same. And then in South Carolina, we expect that the loads bottomed out, and then we're going to again going to see that gradual recovery through late summer."
"Got it. Thank you so much. And just a quick follow-up on ﬁnancing costs. So, just can you quantify for us or just versus plan, what, you've done a ton of ﬁnancing here. So what's, what's the, what's the impact versus on ﬁnancing costs versus the plan you had in place at the beginning of the year?","Yeah, Durgesh. Good question, because our ﬁnancing plan while intact on a full-year basis is a little bit modiﬁed, because we accelerated a number of our ﬁnancings into that March time period I talked about in my prepared remarks. So this ﬁnancing costs for the year is something we're watching pretty closely and I don't have a speciﬁc number for you, but a little bit of color. Obviously we raised $5 billion earlier than we otherwise would have some of that short-term debt, but some of that just replaces what already would have been in our planned commercial paper. As one example, one of those short-term ﬁnancing one year ﬁnancings that come to mind that we did in that period was at LIBOR plus 50 with no no fees, so kind of not too far oﬀ where CP would have been anyway.  So not a big driver. And now as you look forward from here, the markets have recovered in dramatic fashion. As you know, the ﬁxed income markets. And the issuance rates from here on out for the next three quarters, the way it looks right now is they're even lower, all in than they were in January. So yeah, a little bit of pressure from doing things earlier within our plan than we would have expected otherwise, but now we expect probably to make some of that up as rates have, all-in rates have decreased."
"Got it. Thanks so much guys. And the detailed disclosure by segment on COVID is super helpful. Congratulations on a solid print and appreciate all the disclosure,.","Thank you, Durgesh.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"Just wanted to follow up on ACP-- thanks. A bit more on your ACP, thanks for all the color that you provided so far. Just want to clarify I guess, do you need Nationwide 12 permit for a FERC approval to restart construction here. And are there any other potential hurdles that FERC here that you see?","This is Diane Leopold. So obviously we need to have our major permits in place for the majority of linear construction. But again, as Tom said before, the key thing that we're really watching with respect to our forecast is a productive tree-felling season between November and March. So while there is in the Nationwide 12 you do not need to have that for hand-felling of trees, it is not a regulated activity under the Army Corps Nationwide 12 permit, so subject to FERC approval, we may be able to begin hand-felling trees through the season. We would look to have to have that for full ramping up of linear construction."
"Got it. Understood, thanks for that. And then, to stick with ACP here, what factors could impact project cost and timing between now and the tree-felling window or just do you have line of sight to current estimates as long as permits are in place prior to November?","Yes. The range of forecast that we have given that have not changed since the last quarter, it has a wide range of scenarios that is not materially impacted, again so long as we have a productive tree felling season this winter."
"Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking my question.  Operator  Thank you. And our ﬁnal question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, sir.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)",
"Oh, hi. Thank you for the time. Can you guys hear me?","We can, good morning. Good morning."
"Just, maybe just to pivot a little bit to the other regulated businesses. I know that you guys had delayed the rate ﬁling for Dominion Energy South Carolina, but I was, as you can push that oﬀ into the fall and kind of given what's been going on, I guess with demand trends, do you guys see an opportunity maybe to propose something a little bit more formulaic down there or maybe try and see if you could, do a rate plan that includes decoupling as part of that proposal?","I don't, we're still, of course, in the process of developing the plan. But right now, the schedule would call for us to ﬁle notice on July 15 and ﬁle the case actually in August. We expect that to happen at this point barring some other developments. We're still developing that rate case and we'll see how it comes together and when we ﬁle the notice."
"Great, thanks for the time guys.","Thanks you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And this does concludes this morning's conference call, you may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day.
