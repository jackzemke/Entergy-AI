Question,Answer
"Can you hear me, Bob?",Yes.
"Excellent. Just -- obviously, congrats on the sale and getting the review to this point. Just on the process itself, can you just maybe speak a little bit more in depth of the bidding interest and why you settled on the sharing structure in the agreement? And just to conﬁrm, this is a true sort of 50/50 pro rata sharing through the $11.3 billion, right? So, the 1% diﬀerence in Slide 10, this is just tied to the potential movement of the withholding amount, is that correct?","You have that exactly right, Shahr. So, it is 50/50 through $11.3 billion, and then there's the adjustment that we described. So, on the process, we've attracted quite a bit of interest from ﬁnancial and strategic counterparties. We talked a little bit about that on the last call that we were in late stages with several attractive parties. And they diligenced this project extensively. They came in with their own experts in oﬀshore wind, obviously teams related to regulation, ﬁnance and so forth. And what was really encouraging to me was to hear unanimously from   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   parties who participated how well this project is going. So, there was nobody who got in diligence who was concerned about the project at all, and that was really helpful.  So, then as we thought about how we were going to choose a partner, if you refer back to some of the things that we've said before on the last call, we noted the importance of having pro rata sharing of costs. And we've achieved that here and we feel very good about that. We said that we needed a transaction that made sense for our customers and our shareholders and that was in keeping with the objectives that we set out in terms of the business review, and we believe this transaction with Stonepeak meets that extremely well. The cost sharing with protection from any hypothetical or unforeseen project cost increases but having a well-capitalized partner to help us there was critical. And improving our credit proﬁle means that this is going to be extraordinarily beneﬁcial for our customers and our capital providers. So, this is a very good deal. We're very pleased with it. We're pleased with the way the process worked."
"Got it. And then so, Bob, you have an option -- do you have an option to form down a stake again in any sort of succeeding oﬀshore wind projects, let's say, CVOW 2?","This legislation that permitted this partnership structure, I think, was designed for this project. And so, we're focused very heavily on on-time, on-budget, on oﬀshore wind right now, and we've got a very good partner to work with to do that."
"Got it. And then just lastly, not to get too far ahead of next week, you've obviously sought to minimize external equity through this whole process. I guess how does this announcement today inform your views around this, especially as we're thinking about an ATM versus a block? Are there sort of any other eﬃcient sources remaining we should be aware of, thinking particularly around the vessel here with RNG maybe oﬀ the table? Thanks.","Thanks, Shahr. Steve. I'll take it. So, what we've said is that the oﬀshore wind is the ﬁnal strategic step in our process, and that next week, we look forward to sharing our comprehensive strategic and ﬁnancial plan. We're not going to comment today on any speciﬁcs with regard to ﬁnancing plan. I'd reiterate what we've shared since the beginning of the review that we're seeking to meet and exceed our downgrade thresholds, while seeking also to minimize the amount of external equity need. We think that the transactions we've announced to date have been very supportive of our objective, but we'll provide a fulsome plan next week, and I think we're going to hold oﬀ on giving pieces and parts until we get there."
"Fantastic, guys. Congrats, and we'll chat next week. Thanks.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Thanks, Shahr.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead."
"Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions and --","Good morning, Nick."
"-- good to see the announcement today. So, yes, congrats. Hey, so I guess just -- you had the view in the slide out on 2025 considerations on the third quarter call, and the drivers are largely the same. But you've also kind of introduced this pension and ITC disclosure. So, I guess just as you kind of think through the $0.08 to $0.10 of detriment, and then from pension, and then the $0.03 to $0.04 of ITC, is that kind of incremental to that 2025 view?","Yes. Nick, this is Steve. So, just to be clear, we haven't - we have never given 2025 guidance and we've been very careful not to do that. On the last call, we talked about sharing that list to emphasize the fact that in order to create a view on 2025 as an external party, you need to be thoughtful about a variety of factors, many of which we haven't given any information on. And we went through that list just to highlight what some of those could be. We don't have insight into what folks have assumed around ITC or EROA in any of their internal models or estimates. So, it's very diﬃcult for us to be in a position to sort of describe how they ought to consider our updated information on those topics today in their view. And we're going to hold oﬀ from sort of providing anything like that. What I can say is we look forward, again, to sharing what we think will be a very compelling result next week. And we've tried to be thorough in helping folks understand, again, what some of those drivers that they ought to be considering should be."
"Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. And I guess just it's great to hear that agency feedback does seem like it was positive, and you're highlighting 100 basis points increase FFO to debt this transaction. I guess just from a numeric perspective versus where the agencies want you to be out of this review, where does that kind of put you holistically?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes, Nick. Again, we're not going to disclose kind of where our pro forma credit metrics are going to be. We'll provide that next week. Certainly, from a qualitative and quantitative perspective, the agencies have been publicly forthcoming with regard to their support of the steps we've been taking in the review. And so, we'll -- again, we'll -- not trying to be coy, but trying to be consistent with how we've approached the review for the last 15 months, we're not going to give you our sort of pro forma credit view. We'll provide that next week."
"Understood. Looking forward to next week, and congrats again. Thank you.","Thanks, Nick.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from the line of Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. One moment, please. Please go ahead, Jeremy."
Hi. Good morning.,"Morning, Jeremy.     Morning, Jeremy."
"Hi. Just wanted to kind of follow-up on that last line of questioning a bit. And appreciate some things that won't be said today will be said next week. But some of the agency communications that we had seen said that current FFO to debt with this type of arrangement would look very strong. But then over the construction cycle, that would soften and put pressure there. And was just wondering if you have anything you can share there as far as thoughts on how that stacks up, if the agencies have previewed this transaction? Or just any other thoughts in general, I guess, over the time period, the pressures, that cash drag this project had.","Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. So, what I would say on that topic is, generally, I think we agree with eﬀectively how the agencies were describing it, which was some pre-funding of some very heavy capital plans that we have in our plan, which we've talked about in previous calls. We   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   haven't given speciﬁc numbers. Tomorrow, when the K comes out, you'll see our capital investment this year is $10 billion, which is relative to an average of $6 billion for our company. And so, there was some -- eﬀectively some pre-funding from asset sales, and I think that's what they were signaling. Just generally, on our relationship with the agencies, we just -- we don't speak for them. And I will say that we have been very deliberate throughout the process in making sure that they understood in some detail, some conﬁdential detail, how we were thinking about the review and gathering their perspectives as it related to how they think about our company.  And that has extended some -- I can share, it's extended to some formal engagements with rating agencies that have allowed us to make sure that we have a good sense of where they are relative to how we're thinking about our plan and our business risk proﬁle. And with regard to this transaction speciﬁcally, as I mentioned, and as we typically will do, we walked them through in some fairly detailed manner the terms of the oﬀshore wind partnership transaction before we signed and made sure that we were comfortable indicating in our script today that we think that they'll view it as unambiguously credit positive."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And just wanted to pivot a little bit. Maybe might have missed it here, but language around the dividend, dividend outlook here, is there any new messaging that we should take away or should we just be waiting for next week?","There is no new messaging. It's the same as it has been since we started, which is we are 100% committed to the current dividend.     And Jeremy, I'll go out on a limb and suggest that you won't hear something diﬀerent next week either on the dividend, sort of beat that like a drum this whole time period. So, I don't want people to think that we're saying that today and we'll change our tune next week. We're obviously aware of trends in the space around payout ratios. We're aware of that, but no change. And you shouldn't expect a change next week from what we've said publicly around our dividend and where we see the dividend going over time."
Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   (Operator Instructions) Due to diﬃculties -- technical diﬃculties, we lost participants who were in the queue, so if you could please re-queue at this time. Thank you. (Operator Instructions)     Operator, it sounds like there's a technical issue. I know there were some other folks in the queue before that. We apologize, of course.  Operator  We are getting people re-queued now.     Okay. All right. Thanks.  Operator  Okay. We'll take the question from Jeremy Tonet next. One moment, please. Please go ahead, Jeremy with J.P. Morgan."
"Hi. Good morning. Figured I would take another shot here if there was room. And just realizing all the news today is very fresh, but maybe if you could provide any more color with regards to stakeholder feedback at this point or from the regulators, I guess, just how you're expecting this transaction to move forward.","Yes, Jeremy. We just talked to the regulatory staﬀ this morning after the announcement went out. But let me just talk sort of generally about how we expect this to be received. So, just to start with the process, we need to get approval from the State Corporation Commission in Virginia, the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We need some administrative approvals from BOEM, but the primary approvals are at the state level. And as I mentioned earlier, and as I believe you know, legislation that was passed unanimously in Virginia last year enabled this partnership structure that we've put together.  So, it has to be approved by the SCC under the Utility Aﬃliates and Transfers Act. And the standard there is adequate service at reasonable rates have to be maintained, and that the arrangements are otherwise in the public interest. And then we need Aﬃliates Act approval in North Carolina as well. In Virginia, that Aﬃliates Act approval has a statutory timeline of 90 days. The other regulatory approvals don't have particular timelines on them, but we think it's reasonable to assume we'd get approval by the end of the year.  So, that's the process. But if you for step back for a moment, both Virginia and North Carolina policy makers, both understand the value of a strong balance sheet. If you look at Virginia's   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   general obligation bonds, they've been rated AAA by Moody's since 1938, by S&P since 1962, and by Fitch since 1991. And I can tell you that when you talk to policy makers in Virginia about the AAA bond rating, they usually use the adjective coveted.  And that's because they realize that a strong balance sheet for the state allows them to provide the best service to their constituents, and the same is true for our company. If we have a healthy balance sheet, we're going to provide the best customer experience, we're going to be able to invest to meet the state's goals. That is a very compelling reason for regulators to approve this transaction, and I'm highly conﬁdent that they'll see the beneﬁts and approve it."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. Thanks. And maybe if you might be able to talk a little bit more, I guess, on the emerging PJM transmission opportunity, with PJM recently increasing the 10- year local low-growth CAGR and Dominion's ability to capitalize on these needs.","Diane will talk a little bit about that, and Jeremy, we're quite impressed with your ability to navigate the technical issues here, so.     Yes. Good morning, Jeremy. So, yes, you're absolutely right. The latest PJM forecast was somewhat higher than last year. So, we're at about 5.5% a year in Dom's zone. Some of that is with our neighboring co-ops that are within our zone. We continue to see a lot of transmission investment opportunities. In the last PJM open window, there were about $2.5 billion of additional projects that were awarded to us. Much of that supports growth in the data centers and we fully expect there will be additional projects in future years to keep pace with that demand growth."
Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  And our next question, please state your name and company name before asking your question. Please go ahead."
"Hi. This is Steve Fleishman, is that me?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Operator  Yes.","Hey, Steve. We can hear you."
"Hey. Okay. Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Thank you.",Thank you for hanging in there.
"Yes, my pleasure. That was interesting. The -- I guess just -- I assume, can you -- you can't really comment on where the FFO to debt is laying out overall, but should we assume based on kind of the downgrade thresholds that we've seen in the past are likely to stay the same by the agencies from this review?",Yes.
"Okay. That's helpful. And also, just a side question on -- it was a quiet legislative session this year, as far as I can tell. I just want to make sure there was nothing going on in the legislative session that we should be aware of.","Steve, your characterization is accurate. The major issues the General Assembly was dealing with didn't have much to do with energy. They obviously elected the SCC judges. And there were legislative proposals related to energy, but there are none that are still active in the General Assembly at this point."
Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.  Operator   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And we'll take our next question from the line of Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead.,
Morning.,"Morning, Ross.     Morning, Ross."
"(inaudible) yes, good morning. So, a couple questions. Commercial load growth was up almost 9% in 2023, and I think you guys talked a little bit about data centers. But if I remember correctly, there were a lot of constraints in sort of putting data centers into Northern Virginia because of transmission. How do you think about that growth going forward into 2024? Is there a constraint that limits that in 2024 or should I be thinking about something of the same scale over the coming year?","So, when you say Northern Virginia, it was one area of Loudoun County, Virginia, which is where there are a heavy concentration of data centers, and we did have some transmission constraints. We've undertaken several shorter-term projects that were -- we've either completed or about to complete. And then we have ultimately two transmission line, 500 kV transmission line projects, one of which is underway, the other is in the regulatory process. Those -- frankly, that ﬁrst one of those two 500 lines will relieve the constraint in Loudoun. And we've been able to start up connects on data centers.  We had a brief period where we took a pause to make sure we understood exactly what we were doing, but we've restarted. But I think the broader question is we will absolutely be able to serve the data center growth that we expect is coming. It will require investment in transmission. Diane just talked about that, out of the most recent PJM open window. We've had a lot of data center growth in our company, in our service territory for some years. We have very good relationships with the data centers. And we expect to see that growth continue, and we expect to be able to serve it."
"That's great, Bob. Thank you for that update. And then one more, if I may. I appreciate you can't answer a lot of questions around a lot of things today until we get to the Analyst Day next week. But hopefully, one you can discuss, ﬁxed costs are now, I think, at 92%, or just north of 92% on this, and there's about 700 -- just south of $750 million of unﬁxed costs. How are you thinking about your capabilities and timeline to lock more of that unﬁxed costs in on this project?   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)","Yes. It will come in sort of gradually as we move closer to the end of the project. The way it worked earlier, we would lock in a contract, and you might get a pretty big chunk at one time or another. From here on out, it's some onshore transmission, it's fuel for vessels that will be doing the oﬀshore construction, and that's just going to sort of come down over time.     And the only other is miscellaneous project management costs, just our own project management through time. So, those are the largest factors."
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I'll leave it there.  Operator  And we'll take our last question from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,You managed through.
"Yes. Good morning. I made it. Two quick questions. Sorry. I just want to be absolutely clear. The - - with the announced oﬀshore sale, this is the last asset sale that we should be expecting or other portfolio optimizations we should be expecting heading into the Investor Day next week?","You're correct. That's the last one. As we signaled on the last call, the potential for an oﬀshore wind equity partner was the last strategic step. We've taken that step."
"Got it. And then just one small knit. Maybe this is for Steve. When we talk about the ITC accounting change and then the pension accounting change, Steve, can you just remind us what is embedded in your '23 representative number there, EPS number there? What is currently baked into that number?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yes. In 2023 -- you'll see in footnote 22 of the 10-K tomorrow, you can actually calculate it. We disclose all this. You'll see that in 2023, we'll have generated about $0.40 of earnings associated with pension-related income. And so, going forward, we've talked a little bit about EROA. There's another driver that I'll talk just brieﬂy about that would bring us from $0.40 closer to that average of $0.20. We, like the majority of corporate sponsors of pension plans, we calculate one of those key number as our expected return, which like interest cost and service cost as a component of the net income or expense for pension. We eﬀectively smooth the actual asset returns over a four-year period and apply our expected return on asset to that sort of smooth asset value. And that's not only permissible, that's standard.  Some people smooth, I think, over ﬁve years. We smooth over four years. Again, that's pretty standard. And because of 2022's performance, at least in our portfolio where we experienced a very signiﬁcant loss to value across, to be honest, both the equity and ﬁxed income portions of our portfolio, which again, I don't think is unusual for folks, what you'll see between '23, '24, '25, and '26 is you see that smoothing occur such that the impact of that loss is fully recognized by 2026. Now it's not just as simple as saying '22 was down and I'm going to take a portion of that each year. Every year, we do that.  So, you eﬀectively have this stacked Excel spreadsheet, where each year, you're adding a little more of that -- the prior year, and some years are dropping oﬀ that schedule. So, it kind of -- it's a net look of your asset value with this smoothing construct. Hopefully, I haven't just confused you. But as a result of 2022's hurt ﬂowing through, that will be a driver. If you're asking -- if you're at $0.40 today and you're telling us it needs to be closer to $0.20 and you've given us a sensitivity around 100 basis points, how would you get to the next? That's a big driver of that remaining amount.  For ITC, in 2023, as a result of the switch to deferral method, I think we'll end up with something like $0.03 in our 2023 results, and again, what that's from is the recast of historical results. We go back and we say, hey, if we had not accounted for this as a ﬂow-through, if accounted for it as a deferral, some of that value is over that 30-year period. So, as I mentioned, $0.03 to $0.04 of expected operating EPS from ITC credit going forward, and that's about where we would be in 2023 as well."
"Perfect. And Steve, just to be clear, I apologize, this is under the weeds. But -- so if I'm thinking about prospective EPS, net-net, we should be -- versus '23, $2.85 in 23, we should be $0.20 lower, net-net, right? ITC being just kind of the same and then pension being $0.20 lower.","Yes. It's not probably quite so precise. We're using -- we're giving you $0.20 as the average over '25 through '29, and there is some ﬂuctuation in that. But generically, versus 2023, $0.40 would be moving something to closer $0.20 over the '25 through '29 period."
