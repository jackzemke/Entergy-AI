Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"First, congrats obviously, to Jim and Steve, and I guess this means, Mr.Ridges Park City skiing days are over with, but congrats to both you guys.","Thank you, Shar."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Bob, if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on your prepared remarks as you're looking at sort of a range of scenarios. I think, many would assume you start with looking at a monetization of the contracted of assets. But in our view, to really know why you're trading at a discount or why the stocks underperformed, some would argue the performance may be driven by local politics. I guess, could we see more drastic actions like divestitures, where you would only focus on Virginia? Or even a sale of the company to really maximize shareholder value? I guess, what is all this is going to -- what is this going to look like in the end? And it seems like an update in February is a very tight time frame. So I guess, are you really progressed in this process? Thanks.","Yes. Thanks, Shar. And let me take the last part of that ﬁrst. This is not about corporate M&A, if that's what you're asking about. This is about a business review. A top-to-bottom business review, as we made clear in our prepared remarks, looking at strategies that maximize value business mix capital allocation all those kinds of things, and we're going to make decisions as we would any strategic decision we made with respect to the company and what's in the best interest of our shareholders, of our employees and of our customers.  Fundamentally, we took a look at how we're doing, how our share price is doing. And the market is telling us that we're not performing the way investors expect, and so we think it merits a complete review from top-to-bottom. We're early in the process and we're going to obviously in addition to shareholder value and our share price performance, we've thinking about the macroeconomic environment we're in and making sure that we can deliver on our growth program to the level that we expect. So we laid out played out in opening remarks and I'll just reiterate as -- we're guided by our commitment to our state-regulated utility proﬁle, to our credit proﬁle and our current dividend and to transparency and ensuring shareholder value.  So as we thought about it, we could keep on the same course. As we said, we have a path to 2023. Some would suggest that doing the same thing over and over and expecting a diﬀerent result, doesn't make a lot of sense. Or we could have just announced something, but we thought it made a lot more sense to announce that we're doing this review, get some shareholder input and ﬁgure out what's right for our shareholders, our employees, and our customers going forward in the long run."
"Got it. And then just lastly, Bob. Just on the 6.5% growth rate you have out there, obviously, you're implying on Slide 13 and your prepared remarks that you could change the target pending the review. Obviously the share price reaction this morning is implying a cut in the growth rate. But it -- but could a scenario actually be accretive or even supportive of the target you have out there? Especially if we assume the trend with privates and ﬁnancial players paying relatively healthy multiples for assets with proceeds you can redeploy organically at 1x rate base. I mean, does the deal need to be dilutive to growth? Are you concerned about the numbers?","Yes. We're obviously closer to the beginning of this process than the end. So we're going to have to work our way through, and see what the ultimate outcome is before I can comment on   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   that, Shar. And I understand your interest in getting more clarity in that today, but until we've done the process, that question is impossible for us to answer. Again I would go back to the fact that we're very focused on earnings quality and earnings predictability, that's what our shareholders are telling us they want, that's we're going to focus on as we're going through this review."
"Okay. Terriﬁc. Thank you, guys. I'll jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.  Operator  And our next question comes from Ross Fowler from UBS. Your line is open.",
"Morning, Bob. Morning, Jim.",Good morning.
"Maybe, shifting to oﬀshore wind, I'm sure, there's going to be a lot of other questions on the strategic review. But just touching on the oﬀshore wind for a minute as we look at Slide 6 and in sort of Slide 8 in the deck. I think the settlement done obviously is could be approved, what is -- in sort of shifts investors thoughts of risk from sort of that performance guarantee or a capacity factor, now there's a shift to cost. So maybe you can frame the risk to cost from here given the cost sharing arrangement.  And then the second sort of part of the question is, you say 75% ﬁxed as of today. And then working to that 90% in the ﬁrst quarter of next year? Can you kind of just give us some framework? What is ﬁxed tag should we imply or mean? Has that walked and settled, can that move at all? What we have there ex the contingency?","Yes. Let me start with the ﬁrst part of your question. And as we said on the last call, the performance guarantee put a level of risk that our investors, we knew, would not ﬁnd satisfactory, didn't make any sense any sense. We've been focused on the cost of constructing this project from the very moment we can conceived that, that's what we do. We built Cove Point on time and on budget and we absolutely expect we're going to build this project on time and on budget the same way. And we're very advanced in the development here, and as you noted and as we said in our opening remarks, 75% of cost ﬁxed expecting 90% by early in 2023.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   So we're very much on target, we're very comfortable with the estimates, the amount of contingency has actually increased since the time we ﬁled, which gives us even more conﬁdence. As we said in our opening remarks, we're working very well with the regulators, working our way through the environmental permitting process. So project is very much on track. We have a high degree of conﬁdence in our ability to build it on time and on budget. And I'm going to ask Diane to walk through a little bit more detail on that.     Okay. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So let me just give a little bit more color to the diﬀerent aspects of the project. Kind of as you walk through, the ﬁrst thing would be permitting. And as Bob just said, we're working through the process of the draft environmental impact statement. It is on time to come out by the end of this year. And we're working closely with the regulators with DOM and with NOA in addressing issues as they come up to minimize any risk of schedule issues.  And then, I'd want to remind you, we're really focused on de-risking the schedule from the start by having two piling seasons, two construction seasons to put those monopiles down. So we don't even install the turbines until the second season. So that allows for de-risking in the construction, and we look at that as we move forward with the project. The next are our vendors and our suppliers, and we picked the worldwide experts in the oﬀshore wind industry to ensure that, we weren't adding any risk in our contracting. And of course, they were ﬁxed price contracts, and as we move through the pieces that were variable in the oﬀshore, were commodities and fuel. And that's where you see 75% ﬁxed as of now.  So as we're looking to continue to move towards fabrication, we have all the manufacturing slots nailed down, much of the steel plate has been ordered and deliveries have actually already started. In fact, fabrication for our oﬀshore substations and our cables have already begun. So that's, as you're seeing, the 75% moved to the 90%, that's what's going on. The mills are operational, our vendors are not concerned with them shutting down due to fuel issues in Europe, anything like that. And as Bob said, as we looked at the entire projects throughout this time, we've been able to preserve and even add to our contingency. So we're feeling very good about where we are.  On the -- so I think I've really answered that additional question of ramping from 75% to 90%, it's really as we're getting those deliveries and locking in the remaining part of the metals and the fuel, and the ﬁnal piece of moving from that 75% to 90% is on the onshore side, on that onshore transmission unlocking in those contracts."
"Great. Thank you for that. And then, Bob, maybe one for you on the strategic review just following up to Shar's question on the growth rate. I am trying to just I guess sort of understand what you're trying to communicate there with a little more clarity. 6.5% was where you were, what you're set for '23, right, in the long-term growth rate. And you see a path to that today absent the strategic review. And I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but I think what I heard you say was, the results of the strategic review could lead to diﬀerent outcomes in 2023. And then you have to think about, what the long-term growth will look like after that? But your rate base growth at the regulated utilities is about 9%, which is higher than 6.5%. And so if that's   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   your focus, I think that's a good thing. And I don't think you're saying here today that you're going to do things in the strategic review that are dilutive to value.","Yes. I think what we're saying it. Again, I know you're looking for certainty here, but it's early days, and we're just getting started. So what we are focused on, you've correctly identiﬁed, is regulated high-quality earnings, predictable earnings going forward. How the numbers all settle out at the end of it, we'll report when that time comes. So that's why we're saying today, we have a path and a status quo scenario. But the outcome of the review could lead to diﬀerent growth qualitatively and quantitatively."
"Okay, thank you. I'll jump back in the queue.  Operator  And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.",
Yes.,"Hey, Steve, good morning."
"Hi, Bob. So just ﬁrst on the kind of status quo scenario. I think, for '23, you mentioned that you could do it, but you would need to do more unregulated investment. Could you just comment a little more what you mean by that?","Yes, let me get Jim to walk through the pieces and parts on that.     Yes, Steve, let me go to a little bit higher level than your speciﬁc question, but I'll address that too. So what's going on with our guidance? So for 2022 -- I know it's not your question, but for '22, we aﬃrmed, we narrowed, we're on track, EPS and credit for '22. For 2023, we never give forward year speciﬁc guidance on our third quarter call, and we're not doing it this time either. I'll come back and talk about that in some more detail though to give some color.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   And then for our long-term growth rate, we haven't changed it, we have withdrawn it. But as you noted, we also haven't explicitly reaﬃrmed it given the review. But we see these paths, as we show on Slide 13, path to achieving our long-term guidance. And tools, we have to overcome some of the macroeconomic headwinds that Bob mentioned with increased investment on the unregulated side and other initiatives, but some of those tools and businesses are the same ones that are subject to this review cause. Of course everything is subject to review. So Bob, as he mentioned in his prepared remarks, cautioned that long-term outcomes consistent with our existing guidance are really achievable in the status quo result to the review. So anyway, long story short. That's the color on the '22, '23 and long-term.  But on this Slide 13, we give drivers for 2023 targets. So let me walk through and provide some detail on each line item that's in our path to make our 69% into 2023. So 4.10 for '22, that's the midpoint of our guidance that we just narrowed, then 69% the simple math is, of course implies and our consensus -- analyst consensus is 4.37. So 4.10 to 4.37 and of course, there's some helps and some hurts to bridge that.  So let's go through those, as listed on the slide. Sales growth, sales growth we talked about on the electric side is clipping along at a healthy rate 1% to 1.5% slightly higher on the data center side. But that in ﬁnancial impact, together with the impact of margin, is probably ﬂat. And we've given some additional detail on margin dynamics including Virginia on Slide 31. We're happy to follow up after the call and walk through all that. The combination of those two things ﬂat. Regulated investment, which we've talked about is the long-term earnings growth driver for this company, call it $0.27 year-over-year. Rough number, $6 billion of growth CapEx, 50% equity ratio, 10% across all their businesses. Millstone margins, $0.08 year-on-year help. And here too, we provided additional disclosure, it completed 32 of our hedging position for Millstone for the next several years.  ITC. An increase in ITC, we have opportunities to complete projects and increase our ITC contribution in 2023. That could be in solar as we've been doing in mid-teens for years now or it could be an RNG ITC recognition. So $0.05 to $0.11 is a placeholder. And for RNG, that would assume sort of to $200 million to $400 million of projects reaching COD in 2023.  Then other, the last help I mentioned other. $0.17 to $0.20, a lot of things in there. It includes O&M initiatives, it includes regulatory outcomes including in Utah. Some help on the Wexpro side, RNG, non-ITG contribution, and other. But in that bucket, $0.17 to $0.20 a quarter of that impact is just the regulatory outcome in Utah. And then some hurts that we have been mentioned, the double outage at Millstone every three years, like clockwork, $0.06. Interest expense, let's just take numbers from the outside looking in. We have a lot of tools at our disposal for hedging and more dynamic management of this. But if you just say, okay, almost 20% of your debt balance is variable. Let's just say, rates year-on-year are up 2 to 3 percentage points, that would be $0.13 to $0.19 of hurt, and then share dilution, modest $0.03.  Finally, pension we talked about. For most of this year, I've been saying, it's too early to talk about pension. Only one date matters in pension world for us, 12/31. But as we sit here in November, it's coming closer, so we can kind of put it in a box, and those are headwind, our assets are down like everybody, our discount rate is up 2.5% or so like everybody. The headwind from that is modest. We're putting it in the high single-digit pennies range, so $0.06 to $0.09. So those are views on one path we have to continue along with the 6% to 9% growth   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   rate through 2023 and formal guidance along with updates on the status of our review will come on the fourth quarter call."
"Okay. Sorry, I have one other question. I didn't expect such a long answer, but that was helpful.",Yes.
Thank you.,My last chance to talk you for a while. So --
"Yes. So just -- I guess, this is a bit of an unorthodox way of going about something like this. And -- but just to trying to put some perspective on how you're looking at things in this review. What do you, Bob, and the Board think the reasons are the stock is underperforming? Do you think it's due to the small amount of remaining non-utility businesses, or is it really -- is it Virginia and the kind of unique structure there, some of the noise you had? Is it the oﬀshore wind? Like what do you -- it's kind of hard to have a perspective on this review if we don't know what you think the reasons are.","Yes, Steve, I think it could be a little bit of all of the above of what you just described. And maybe I'd phrase it a diﬀerent way is, what investors are telling us they're looking for? What they're looking for is predictability, what they're looking for is earnings quality, they're looking for conﬁdence in long-term growth. And so again, as we go through the review, those are the things that we're going to focus on to try to achieve for investors."
"Okay. I mean, obviously, by doing this, you've created more unpredictability. So it's got hard to - - it becomes kind of like a circular loop here.","Steve, what I would say, maybe it's unorthodox, although I think other companies have announced reviews, maybe it's a little unorthodox. But again, as I talked about before, continuing to do the same thing we've been doing may well just end up in the same results that   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   we've achieved before. And we're going to listen to the market. And we look forward to the opportunity to engage with investors and get their perspectives as we're working our way through this. Again, our goal with this is to land on an outcome that provides predictability and quality, and we want to do it in a very transparent fashion."
"Okay, thank you.  Operator  And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.",
"Hi, good morning.","Hi, Jeremy."
"Hey, just want to continue with the review a bit here if I could. I just wanted to see maybe asking a little bit diﬀerently, what options might be oﬀ the table here, beyond the non-regulated businesses, could you look to sell from the LDCs here? And we've seen others in the space with a lot of success on this side? And then separately, just as it relates to the customer build pressures, as you said, if you could address what steps could be taken by Dominion to address that? And is there a way to address that, that isn't EPS or credit negative?","Yes. So let me start with the ﬁrst one, Jeremy, what's oﬀ the table versus what's on the table. And the answer to what's oﬀ the table is the same as the answer to what's on, which is we've kicked oﬀ a review top to bottom, and again, guided by the principles that we described in our opening comments. And then on the second part of your question, sort of policy initiatives, we described examples of things that we have done in our states over the course of the last few years to help customers, whether it was forgiving arrears, recovering regi costs through base rates, spreading out fuel over multiple periods of time.  As we work with policymakers and think through the most logical ways to assure that current customer bills don't get in the way of long-term customer investment, we'll be thinking about those same approaches that we've used in the past and making sure that we achieve constructive regulatory outcomes, which I think we've demonstrated over the course of many years we're very good at achieving here."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got it. That's very helpful. And just pivoting, if I could here. Obviously, a lot of focus on the review, but just want to touch base on the RNG side and see what kind of new initiatives are there, or if you could just update us on your thoughts?","Good morning, Jeremy, this is Diane. So the backlog just continues. It's going very well. As Bob brought up, if you do the count, we have 20 projects underway right now, 4 producing, 11 under construction and 5 more to be in construction by year-end. And those that are producing are producing as designed, and we're seeing very strong CARB scores out of them. So just how carbon negative they are, just focusing on this Ag RNG business in the dairy and the swine side. So we have invested or will have invested $1 billion in this and expected to produce somewhere in the range of about $200 million by 2025. So it's going very well."
Got it. Great. If I could sneak a last quick one. And just going back with the review here. Does the upcoming triennial impact your thought process at all here?,"No. Again, it's -- there are a lot of factors at play in our business and you can't identify any one of them, where -- as we said, the focus is our share performance and what can we do to make sure we maintain our long-term capital investment programs."
