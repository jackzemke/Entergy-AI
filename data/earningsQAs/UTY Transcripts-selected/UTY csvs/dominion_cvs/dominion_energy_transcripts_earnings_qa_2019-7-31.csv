Question,Answer
"Thanks. Good morning, guys.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Two questions. One, numbers related question. Looking at the adjustments from GAAP to operating on an operating basis, you obviously had a really great quarter. Congrats on that, but pretty signiﬁcant charges associated with merger integrated and merger -- and integration costs, the retirement, et cetera. Are those numbers consistent with your expectations for the year on the delta between GAAP and operating? And are there any signiﬁcant incremental charges we should expect as adjustments for the balance of the year and going into 2020?","Yeah, Greg, it's Jim. Good morning. Thanks. The future non-operating charges are of course, diﬃcult to predict. So we don't know exactly what those will be, the nature of the beast. I would expect some continued charges related to our integration of SEG, the former SCANA business. Mostly in terms of accounting systems and implementations and things along those lines, the major charges related to customer beneﬁt and VRP and related restructuring, have been kind of tackled in the ﬁrst half of this year. So some numbers would continue, but there will be -- we expect a more modest than what we've seen so far."
"Thank you. My second question goes to your conﬁdence in your ability to get the Fish and Wildlife Service to eﬀectively mediate the concerns associated with this second certiﬁcation of their permits from the 4th Circuit. In reading that document, I've had varying opinions, you heard varying opinions on how high the hurdle is, that the Fish and Wildlife Service needs to get over in order to issue a valid permit given some of the pretty strong language in that.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   While it was a detailed -- they gave very good detail as to why we felt that the decision was arbitrary and capricious. Some people who needed that, the standard that they put the Fish and Wildlife Service to and the details of what they have problems with might be a very diﬃcult to meet. So can you just comment on why you think, based on your reading and your experts reading that -- that you can meet those hurdles with just more information on the three other species and adequately doing the survey on the (inaudible), sorry such long-winded question.","Well, all right. Go ahead, Diane.     Okay. Good morning. This is Diane Leopold. Really what I would say as we look at the four species is there was an enormous amount of information and analysis that went into the process to begin with. While we were in formal consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service. And based on the amount of information that they have and the surveys that we have completed, we believe based on, there is nothing surprising that's coming out of it that would make us think that they cannot resolve it with the enormous amount of analysis and information that they have.     I would just add one thing, the surveys, the one issue they had is, they didn't think enough surveys were done around the beach [ph] and we've been doing those survey since mid-June, they'll be done this quarter, and there will be more than suﬃcient facts we believe to justify issuing the (inaudible)."
Thank you. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.,
"Hi. Excuse me. Good morning. Could you guys maybe just give a little color on how you're -- how you characterize your natural gas midstream system in light of some of the concerns on Appalachia gas? I know it's mainly regulated and with long-term contracts, but just, obviously you saw Blue Racer very timely, just maybe give some color and context of that.","Good morning. Diane Leopold, again. What I would do is, say, that part of the reason that we divested the Blue Racer is that, really wasn't core to us. When we look at our gas infrastructure, our high focus in both our existing customers and our growth projects has been in end-use   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   markets. And end-use markets actually beneﬁt from the low gas prices that you see. So while we understand the Appalachian gas prices are quite low, what that's done is, it's driven higher industrial growth in that region and more end-use and PowerGen customers. So as Tom talked about in the Analyst Day back in March, a lot of our focus is towards the end-use rather than the producers."
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then, I guess the other question would be just on the savings from the voluntary retirement and the beneﬁts of that. So when you look at unexpected pressure is the only one that I could think of right now would be ACP related. I guess, since they are unexpected, there is not any others that you see right now, that could be out there in terms of dealing with the -- using these beneﬁts or needing the beneﬁts.","That's right, Steve. I mean, unexpected is unexpected, so hard to comment. I mean, we think about the -- let's put in context. So we -- we mentioned, I mentioned and we have on the slide there, that the net impact, none of the mitigants I described. For this year in the $0.05 to $0,06 range for the second half of the year. So you could easily annualize that for a year in the coming years. Of course, over time that's giving back to our customers through rates (inaudible) like. For 2020, fair enough to think about double that amount. So $0.10 to $0.12. So just to put that in context, so $0.04 of weather hurt this year, six months, we don't know what that will be the rest of the year. But of course in 2020, that kind of thing, it stands ready to oﬀset.  When it comes to ACP, as a reminder, our guidance on the contribution from ACP in 2018 last year was $0.7, this year it's $0.11, next year, we have a little more visibility, but not on a granular basis, yet regarding the exact timing of recommencement and the sculpting [ph] of capital spend through 2020. So what the contribution in 2020 is we don't yet know exactly, but call it mid-teens to high teens, the best contribution. This $0.10 to $0.12 stands -- for things stands available to oﬀset various unforeseen challenges, but that kind of puts it in context versus ACP, which you're asking about it's smaller."
"Okay. And then one just clariﬁcation on that. The $0.10 to $0.12 is that after any future kind of pass-through to customers, through clauses and such. Is that, that's just -- that the net number that would not pass-through?","Yeah, that's right. I mean, over a number of years that we'll go back to customers as mentioned, but for the near-term number $0.05 to $0.06 is net of the amount, that is immediately passed to customers through rider tax treatment, and that holds true for 2020 as well. After that, it tends to blend back to customers over time. But for 2020, it is net of that factor."
Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.
"Hey, good morning guys, sorry about that.",Good morning.
"Just real quick, Tom. Good morning, guys. You commented, Tom, a little bit on sort of brieﬂy touched on the administrative path and potentially looking at like a land swap, similar to what we've seen with MVP. Are there other sort of administrative solutions that you could be looking at outside of just the land swap?","Yes. There are a number. And as we said before, we really don't want to get into a lengthy discussion about what all those options are. There has been some discussion from the developers of the MVP pipeline that, as I've said a few minutes ago, we would expect all of those solutions to be available to us as well."
"And then just from a timing perspective of when you're ready to discuss publicly the administrative or legislative path, is that sort of at a point when SCOTUS aﬃrms whether they would hear this case or not?","We're completely focused on that right now. This is -- the 4th Circuit decision is a very poor precedent. We think for energy policy in the United States, setting up a 2,000 mile long barrier wall to bring energy resources from the Midwest and South, the western parts of the country into the East. I don't think that's what congressional intent was. So it's very important that the precedent not stand."
"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Got it. Okay. And then just, I don't know if you can comment on this, but there is obviously been some headlines around the retail business and potentially looking at a transaction down there, is there anything you can elaborate on that and how the process is going?","Yeah. Shar, let me give some -- let me give some color on that point. And obviously, for the norm, we don't really comment on material M&A, but let me give some color on the way we think about this. So we are always considering ways to create shareholder value to derisk our plan, to take our exposure to regulated and regulated like businesses, which now 95% and take it up towards the 100%. So last year in 2018, obviously we made a lot of progress in that respect, as you know. And this year, that continued, but on a totally diﬀerent scale. We're really focusing on that last 5% for the most part of things that are non-core or not-regulated, regulated like.  For example, we divested, a 15-megawatt fuel cell asset, we had in Connecticut, it's called Bridgeport, it's $35 million this year. We also divested our stake in NedPower, the wind facility in West Virginia, the amount wasn't disclosed, but it is modest. And we're also ﬁelding and thinking about what to do with another wind asset we own in Indiana, which is Fowler Ridge, no decisions there yet early, early days. So that kind of thing we're always thinking about it, but it's very modest.  Now, I'd say that, to put it in context, for retail, which is your question. So there are press reports about potential sale of our retail gases, and there also, we've been ﬁelding inbound inquiries on all of it, on the part that is in Georgia, that was formerly SCANA business, on the legacy Dominion business. And we're thinking through that there is certainly no decisions. But importantly, we are thinking about what to do generally. So it's not so focused on the process. Should we keep it status quo? How could we grow it? Could there be ways to grow through the JV, for example or some other structure. So it's more thinking along those lines, as opposed to, let's sell this thing because we're probably not going to do that if it's not accretive. So no decisions, lots of thought processes, but no, nothing to share and not sure there will be."
"Got it. And then as we think about like redeployment of proceeds in case, there is a process, is that strictly into delevering and strengthening the balance sheet?","I would call it, yes. But I would call it -- I would put that in the kind of the general corporate, and we're talking about not huge numbers in the scope of all of Dominion."
"Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.",Thank you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.
"Hi, good morning.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Okay. Just a couple of follow up questions. The $0.10 to $0.12 voluntary savings the voluntary retirement savings, do you said that you expect -- that would eventually fade in a few years, as the savings are shared with customers. How much do you think you'll retain in the longer-term, once most of the savings have been shared?","Yeah, I believe, we don't really have such a number. I mean, it will -- with every year we don't, we don't have a material rate cases with all that much frequency. So it will be chipped away over time, but we don't have a speciﬁc number to bifurcate between what's kept long-term and what's not."
"But just, I mean, roughly speaking, half would you think or below half or more than half, maybe?",Half would be fair. We don't really have a number in mind.
"Okay. Okay. And then on how much capital has been put into ACP to-date at this point? And what is the assumption that is going into that mid-teens EPS number, that I think you mentioned earlier from AFUDC next year?","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Yeah. As of June 30, the total cash invested capital is $3.4 billion from all parties from all forms. Half of that is funded, as you know with the construction facilities at the project level, and you'll see that in our quarterly reports, that's $1.7 billion, so twice that. The other half is the total and the other outcomes pro-rata from the -- as equity contributions from the sponsors were 48% of that. So $3.4 billion is the total. As I mentioned, we don't have available at this time, granular guidance on the capital spend for the end of this year or the scoping of it through 2020. But it assumes recommencement of construction by the tree clearing season in the fourth quarter of this year."
"So when you say mid-teens for the next few years, that's sort of an assumption that you are going to get most of this built-up right up until the Supreme Court decision?","It's mid-to-high teens, so mid would -- mid would be with less under construction through 2020 or later in 2020 and higher would be, again, most of it."
Got you. Okay. Thank you very much.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning, Julien.     Good morning."
"Hey, so perhaps just to follow up on some of the last questions here. Can you talk a little bit more about what else might be considered sort of not necessarily non-core, but as you think   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   about kind of ﬁne-tuning the portfolio here within the regulated piece? And more speciﬁcally I'd be curious given some of the developments here around Millstone that have been achieved. I mean is there any way to de-risk some of the volatility from that as well over time? And as for instance within that example?","Well, I'll talk about Millstone. We have derisked Millstone with the legislative and regulatory solution that's in its ﬁnal -- ﬁnal weeks right now, with a very signiﬁcant portion of the output being sold to local utilities for a 10-year period. So we consider that to be more than suﬃcient derisking the Millstone asset. I'll let Jim and others answer the rest of the questions.     I think that's a good answer and going back to the way I started my answer to Shar, I mean we don't -- we don't comment on the material M&A. But is the -- the review of real material things which are non-core including Blue Racer, so we talked about last year, and our last remaining fossil merchant plants last year, I mean for big items, that pretty much exhaust the list."
"And then just coming back to the question around VRP, I know it's been asked a few diﬀerent ways. But as you look into the back half of this year, could you -- just thinking about like the pluses and minuses here, clearly, it's a big plus. Any oﬀset in terms of execution? That it sounds like that's already been largely recognized in the ﬁrst half to achieve this. And maybe the punch line is, how do you think about this trending for the full year '19, given the 3Q guidance you've already issued and what that means for 4Q as well?","Here we talk about -- let me talk about a little bit. I know it's a little bit funny to talk about that savings has been kind of available for unforeseen headwinds, whether it's the most prevalent. We always talk about the potentially material impact of weather, now in Virginia and South Carolina, on our earnings guidance ranges, and where we end up. So it's hard to point to any one thing, because we feel pretty good about where we are at this stage, given what's to come in the next two quarters. And let me address that a little more. So last year as we sat here on our second quarter call, and we looked at kind of what was remaining, what we needed to do after our ﬁrst two quarters, to get to the midpoint of our guidance range. We needed $2.03.  So this year as I mentioned in my prepared remarks the cadence is diﬀerent. We have a back- end loaded proﬁle to our EPS accrual through the second half of the year. So, last year it was $2.03, this year it is $2.36, so bigger company, more earnings, but we also need to have a little bit of catch-up, it's back-end loaded. The reasons for that, and the reasons we're comfortable with that, are those things that are generally set out in that right-hand side of Page 7 in our debt. So the Millstone outage $0.08 to $0.10. Last year, it was in fourth quarter, for the most part, this year done in spring.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   The net capacity expense from PJM with Greensville in the mix now starting in June, $0.06 to $0.08. The VRP also in the mix, $0.05 to $0.06. Southeast Energy Group didn't have it last year, $0.04 to $0.06. And then another basket of things are smaller but regulated investment across our utility business for the next six months. And the Millstone PPA we mentioned, assuming that comes into place October 1. And then the continued impact of O&M to the next six months. So in our minds, we don't really have one thing, that the VRP will oﬀset. It's just there and available.  So we anticipate Julien that a question, which was what if nothing comes up, this year or next year? And there also, we're saying, I've said that it's not additive to our guidance. So if nothing comes up and we're in the lucky position of not having any headwinds that aren't expected or such event, what I would do is identify areas in O&M to advance spending, in order to use that VRP savings to derisk our guidance -- our earnings guidance for a longer period of time. So not a very direct answer to your question but that's the way we think about the VRP savings and what it will potentially help us with over the next period."
"Right. So maybe said diﬀerently, 2019, there is a lots of puts and takes. You feel very comfortable still. I don't want to put words directly in your mouth on '19. And then it's been the story for '20, again, this is going to be more about accelerating forward O&M, that you might otherwise need, for instance, in '21 or something?","Yeah, if no other headwinds pop up. That's right."
"Okay, great. Thank you all very much.",Thank you.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
"Hi, good morning.","Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Good morning.     Hi, Stephen."
"I just had one follow-up on Atlantic Coast Pipeline, assuming that a revised biological opinion and incidental take statement is issued but is stayed by the court yet again, what would the next process steps be at that point? Is there an appeal process or where would you go at that point if the (inaudible) is yet again stayed?","Well, you can do a preliminary -- you can appeal a stay. You can -- it will depend, I'll depend on what the stay was for, if one was entered at all. Would it be the entire 600 miles or would it be a segment? Also it's kind of diﬃcult to answer that question. There are a variety of remedies we can pursue but without a real detailed issue, it's hard to answer that question."
Understood. That's all I had. Thank you.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup.
"Hi, guys.",Good morning.
"Moving a little away -- hi -- moving a little bit away from ACP, wanted to touch on oﬀshore wind. I know you talked about it and emphasized on the call the opportunity on oﬀshore wind. Firstly, wanted to understand the economics that you're seeing and the beneﬁts you're seeing on the technology side. And given the investment that you've talked about as a potential opportunity,   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   is that going to put pressure on bills and would that constrain the opportunities? So just a little bit color on that will be helpful.","Praful Mehta, this is Paul Koonce. Of course, we are under construction on the two oﬀshore wind turbines now, doing the onshore construction next summer will complete the two test turbines. In terms of the oﬀshore wind economics, we've been watching very closely what's been happening throughout New England. I would say that the life cycle cost equivalent, LCOE, in those markets have been, call it, $85 and potentially higher. There is some speculation what may happen with production tax credits for oﬀshore wind. Might they be renewed or not? We don't know.  In Virginia, we're looking at the need to get the life cycle cost equivalent down closer to maybe the $80 range, which means we need to see about a 15% to 20% capital cost improvement. We think that those costs can move in that direction once we stand up the US supply chain. That's been the real beneﬁt that they've seen in Europe is being able to scale up the supply chain.  And we also think that the development of larger turbines, 11 megawatt and greater, will drop those costs down closer to what we think we need in order to really see the build-out in Virginia. So we're watching all of that very closely. We think the time frame that we have in mind, which is '23, '24 and kind of beyond. We think that those cost reductions are achievable. So we're bullish but we're going to do what's right for our customers."
"Got you. That's super helpful color. Just can you put in context what could be the size of the opportunity from an investment perspective post that 2022, '23 time frame?","Well, I think what we said at the March 25, really, we've only given sort of guidance out to 2023, which is $1.1 billion. Now $300 million of that $1.1 billion is the oﬀshore wind pilot that we're doing. That leaves $800 million to go toward the ﬁrst phase. But I think in round numbers, we've said in excess of 2,000 megawatts. The limiting factor becomes sort of the wake eﬀect that you have with one turbine sort of stacked up behind the second. But we clearly see line of sight in excess of 2,000 megawatts. And I would pencil out maybe a $3,000 per kilowatt-hour installed. And if you do that, you come up with a sizable investment, but that would be out over the entire decade."
Got you. Super helpful guys. Thank you.,"Thank you.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Operator   Thank you. This concludes our time for Q&A. I'll now turn it back to our speakers for closing comments.     Thank you for everyone's time this morning.
