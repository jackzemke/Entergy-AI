Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Shar."
"Good morning. Maybe just, Bob, if we could start with a kind of a sequencing question regarding the Investor Day as it kind of draws closer. Should we be expecting kind of a turnkey Investor Day reset or could it still be contingent on potential ongoing sale processes? And the origin of the question is that, the wind stake sales seems to be taking a while right now. You have that option now. So just trying to get a feel for what level of closure you're targeting for the rollout?","Yes. Shar, we're targeting as we have said from the beginning, being able to give a very good sense of the long-term for our company. So no change from what we expected when we started or when we most recently updated."
"Got it. Perfect. And then, Steven, you mentioned in the prepared that you continue to look at cost eﬃciencies, albeit within the context of all the work you've done to-date. I guess, how should we think about the opportunities here? Any color on scale or timing as we look ahead to the review and beyond?","Yes. Thanks, Shar. I think on the third quarter call of 2022 when we announced the business review, we did make some commentary on our focus on continuing our track record of being a very eﬃcient operator. And I think what we said at the time, which I think was well put by, Jim Chapman, was that while we believe there's opportunity and we're constantly focused in looking at that, we don't view it in the -- through a lens of a gamechanger amount of incremental savings to what we've consistently accomplished.  So as we're working through the business review, we continue to expect to ﬁnd incremental eﬃciencies, but we've been driving a lot of those eﬃciencies -- ineﬃciencies out of the business for a number of years as reﬂected in our O&M eﬃciency metrics in our rates.

"Perfect. I think that -- just one last one, I guess, just on the SCC. I guess, what are your kind of expectations for lawmakers, I guess, to ﬁll the two vacant seats at this point. Sounds like there's been little progress in Richmond. I guess, one of the pathways forward here? Thanks, guys.","Yes. Shar, I think it's important to start oﬀ by noting that the Commission is functioning eﬀectively, as evidenced by orders just within the last few weeks, that I mentioned in our opening remarks on our clean energy 3 ﬁling, 800 megawatts of solar and storage, and on the transmission line, that's important for us to be able to serve data center customers in Northern Virginia. So the Commission is functioning well in its current conﬁguration.  I can tell you that the process and the Constitution of Virginia is that when there are vacancies, the General Assembly can elect judges to ﬁll -- Commissioners to ﬁll those vacancies. If they're not in session, the Governor could make an appointment for a term that would last until 30 days after the start of the next regular session. So that's the process.  But I think it's important if you sort of step back and think about the regulatory construct in Virginia. If you look just at where we sit in Virginia, we've got low rates, we've got strong reliability. We've got a clear mandate from policymakers for energy security within an energy transition. And as our IRP indicates, we've got very strong load growth. So we're sitting in a very good spot moving forward in the Virginia regulatory process.  So the Commission is functioning now. There's a process for adding two new Commissioners, but sort of in the big picture. We're very well positioned in Virginia for strong regulatory outcomes in the future."
"Perfect. Thank you, guys. That's all I had. Have a great weekend. See you.","Thank you, Shar.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research."
Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you.,"Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)  Good morning, Steve."
"So just -- good morning, Bob. So just on the framing of the Investor Day, the -- a lot of the balance sheet ﬁx at least seems like it could come from asset sales and the like, and markets kind of keep moving around and the like. So just -- well, as we go into the Investor Day, should we assume that asset sales, if you're going to do any, are actually kind of announced by then, or that this process would kind of kick oﬀ by then? Yes. Thanks.","Hey, Steve. This is Steve. I'll take a shot at that as well. And I think as we think about the Investor Day, the goal is to have isolated as many variables of the review as possible at the time that we address the market with the repositioning of the company for the long-term. And obviously, given the business review is underway, it's a little bit diﬃcult to provide sort of more speciﬁc guidance than that. But we are well down the path on the review. As Bob mentioned, we're pleased with the progress that we're making, and we look to use the Investor Day to provide a refreshed strategic and ﬁnancial outlook that will cover earnings and credit and ﬁnancing and capital investment. And I think based on the progress we've seen to-date, we will be well- positioned to do that."
"Okay. Makes sense. And just on the performance provision in the ROE in Virginia, can you just talk to kind of, is there any clear barometer for how they're supposed to judge performance upside or downside?","I think there'll need to be some work done within the Commission on how that will work. It's -- there was a similar provision in the law, really starting back in 2007. And so we see it as an opportunity to demonstrate our excellent performance when we're in front of the Commission. But I think it's a little early to establish exactly how that will play out."
"Okay. And then lastly, just on the data centers. Is there any better clarity on who's really supposed to be servicing this data center load and planning for it? Like is that your obligation as part of PJM and the Commission? Or because they have choice, is it -- is it not? Could you just give us some sense on how to think about that aspect of the load growth? Yes.","We have an obligation to serve customers in Virginia. It's our obligation. And we build generation, transmission, and distribution as necessary to serve that load. So that's the way that it has worked. That's the way it's going to keep working in the future. So we've got investments to make as you see from the IRP.   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)"
"Yes. I mean, even the ones that maybe, if they do have onsite generation, they're typically connecting to you as well and using Dominion, at least, for wires and backup and the like, is that correct?","Well, absolutely. Yes, that -- and these are large loads, 24/7, they need a grid."
Great. Okay. Thank you.,"Thanks, Steve.  Operator  And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan."
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning.     Good morning, Jeremy."
"Just wanted to touch on the IRP scenarios a bit and just see, what factors are, I guess, in play between the diﬀerent scenarios. Just wondering if you would note any notable highlights and resource mix considerations across these scenarios and how that would impact?","Sure, Jeremy. As you know, we laid out in the plan ﬁve diﬀerent scenarios. Some of them required by the Commission from decisions in earlier proceedings. We have plans that, as they should comply with the Virginia Clean Economy Act. Others, as I noted, required by the   Dominion Energy Inc (D US Equity)   Commission that don't necessarily comply with the Clean Economy Act, but the Commission asked for those scenarios as well.  Across all of them, what we look for is the appropriate balance between investing to serve our customers reliably and the cost of that service, and compliance with all the rules and regulations that govern us, including the Clean Economy Act.  This is -- the IRP is a snapshot in time. It's what when we look out 15 and then in -- and with certain parameters 25 years, what we think our demand will be as projected by PJM. And then the investments that we need to make in order to serve that load. This changes as you know, over time. When we have further proceedings, it will be adjusted, I'm sure.  But we, as of the time of this ﬁling, think that -- believe that this document lays out a pretty clear roadmap for diﬀerent ways that we'd be able to serve what is very robust demand growth coming over the course of the next decade and a half or more."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And a small point, just wanted to pivot for Millstone, just wondering if there's any updated thoughts that you could provide there, given, I guess, changes in the market?","Yes, as we've said in prior calls, Jeremy, we think Millstone is an incredibly valuable asset to New England, both for reliability and decarbonization purposes. Our team operates that plant extraordinarily well. And as we think about the future of Millstone, we just see that it's very well positioned."
