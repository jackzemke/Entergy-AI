Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. This is Clara for Julien.","Good morning, Julien.     Hi, Clara."
"Hey, good morning. Good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. My ﬁrst question is recognizing that you guys will continue to work on regulatory approvals for Wind Catcher. Can you give a little more color for what other conﬁgurations or what other projects you could replace it with that will still take advantage of the when one PTCs and the other PPA contracting structure as well. Just curious about any options there? Thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah. So, Clara, we continue to look at other opportunities as well. We have the renewables projects in Ohio, for example. We obviously continue that process. There will be other opportunities, but tax reform is certainly -- has certainly changed some of the economics of some of these projects, particularly with lower capacity factors. So, we'll continue to look for opportunities to replace. But remember, Wind Catcher was incremental to our base plan. So our base plan obviously supports 5% to 7% growth rate in the investment, in transmission and in other areas in our regulated companies.  So with Wind Catcher, obviously, we'll continue to look at not only options if Wind Catcher were not to happen, there is still be opportunities for those kinds of resources to be applied, do our resource plans in those particular states. So -- but, obviously, don't want to miss the opportunity for Wind Catcher, because it's a great way to deal with the resource plans in all the states at one time rather than independently with perhaps less eﬃcient projects. So we'll continue to take a look at it."
"Great, that's really helpful. And my second question is, this is a little earlier I think for your CapEx update. Can you give a little more color as to why you're doing it before November. And potentially any color around --more than just the 75% wires, how you're increasing about your 2020 run rate?","Yeah. So, let me answer the ﬁrst one Clara. We keep getting questions about how solid our go- forward plan is. And what's the ability to keep investing it organically in our own businesses and we wanted to provide some clarity to that to show that we have plenty of runway to invest organically in our own system, primarily in the wire side of the business with some regulated and contracted renewables as well.  So, people are asking, how long can you keep doing that for? And we wanted to provide some clarity, it's out there and we have plenty of runway to keep doing that and felt that the disclosure at this time might be helpful to people as they think about our stock.     There seems to be some confusion about whether Wind Catcher was required for us to continue with our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. The answer to that is, no. It's not required to do that. Our base plan is built around 5% to 7% and Wind Catcher was incremental.  We just want to make sure that that was abundantly clear and that people weren't looking across the cliﬀ and expecting something diﬀerent regardless of the outcome. Now if we get it, that's great. But if we don't, well, okay, we'll move forward with our plan."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. That's helpful. I'll drop out of the queue. Thank you so much.,"Thanks.  Operator  Now we have a question from Ali Agha. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Ali."
"Thank you. Good morning. First on Wind Catcher. Nick, to be clear, if either Texas or Oklahoma does not approve can the project still go forward or do you need both of those approvals for this project to happen?","Yeah. My going-in assumption is, we need both of those approvals, because these are regulated jurisdictions, and that's where the needs are. And so our -- certainly our strong preference is for that project. It is sized based upon the ind farms, that's an existence with the transmission line and to do something diﬀerent and that would be suboptimal. So we're really focused on making sure that all of the jurisdictions approve it."
"Okay. And then secondly, we've seen it now few times the sort of what I would call the drop- dead date keeps getting shifted back now you are telling us it's end of August. So in reality, when you look at the physical aspect of having it all built by the end of 2020, when exactly do you need to have this started. And I guess, related to that I'm sure you've been observing, your stock has been under a fair amount of pressure, while this uncertainty is out there. So at what point do you make the call that -- the base plan is so strong, that we are may be better oﬀ getting this uncertainty oﬀ the table and walk away here?","Yeah, Ali. Already -- we've already started with the right of way. We have also done other construction related activities, because we don't have time. And so, your question is a very fair question though from an investor standpoint. We cannot aﬀord to continue to allow this thing to languish given construction has started, the company is incurring expenses associated with it. Our supply contracts I think that is probably know now that the target dates for ordering long lead time equipment and that kind of thing through these major contracts was around that August 6 timeframe and we were able to negotiate and look at the project plans and do a deep dive in terms of what we could possibly do. And that's where the end of August came from.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So -- and in deference to the commissions -- and those commissions are certainly appeared -- Chairman Murphy wanted to take more time and Chairman Walker wanted to take more time, which they had more time. We tried to accommodate that by the additional time necessary to get passed. I know, there is a lot going on with election season and all kinds of things occurring. So, we're saying the end of August, and that's where we're at. And for us to go beyond that is going to be -- going to be extremely diﬃcult with major commitments of these large capital items and that's just not going to happen without the approvals necessary.  So -- and it is not because we're trying to be -- just trying to make sure the commissions are pushed in a very hard fashion. That's not what we're trying to do, because we are getting pushed. And it's unfortunate that we didn't have several years to evaluate this project, but the PTC is the 100% value. The PTC's we're trying to secure for the customer beneﬁts and we've got to be able to ﬁnish the project in time to enable that to happen. I mean, it's a 60% oﬀ sale. And if you don't want to take advantage of it then just tell us.  And I think that's basically what I've been saying to the commissions. We've oﬀer this opportunity and it is a real, distinction and positive opportunity, but we need an answer. And we need an answer by the end of August and certainly from the -- it bring up the elements of risk as well from a deal parameter perspective. We've been in negotiations with parties in all of these states and you're seeing the combination of multiple sets of negotiations with varied parties. And I think we'll round up with the best balance we possibly could.  So I'm hopeful that the commissions will look at that and look at the track record and look at what we're trying to do. And keep in mind, we're spending money to get an answer to help customers. And so, we're ﬁne with doing that because it's a really -- it's a really great opportunity in our opinion. And we're intent on trying to provide as much beneﬁt as we can to our customers and that's what we're focused on.  So, I hope that answers the question."
"Yes. I really appreciate that. Brian, one quick one for you. Can you just remind us, of the rate increases that you had budgeted for 2018 in your guidance, how much are now locked in for you?",So we recon for a little bit over 300 million and we're about 80% or so locked in.
Okay. Got it. Thank you.,"Thanks.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  We have a question from Steve Fleishman. Please go ahead.     Hi, Steve."
"Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. Hi, Nick. So, I guess ﬁrst, just to clarify the 5% to 7% growth rate. I think oﬃcially you've only given that for 2019, but should we interpret that with this capital plan it would extend through this 2021?","Yeah. So we've given that -- we have given the detail around it through '20. Now we're giving an incremental year, but we see that 5% to 7% growth rate as far as we can see."
"Great. Okay. And then secondly on Wind Catcher. So one, there's a reasonable chance that one outcome can be approval with conditions, so that then it leads to another process do two conditions work or not. So, when you're giving this kind of end of August deadline is that -- you just need to make a go, no go call by then or --","-- Yeah, that's right. That's right. And it also -- it also means and -- you're exactly right. On the deal parameters we saw the sense of urgency, so when we send a letter into the commission, it was really responsive because really the discussion is been around the 103% on the cost GAAP, while SPS was 102.5, so we change it to 102.5. I mean, those things that Chairman, John Walker [ph] was bringing up. Okay. We said, we were going to match up the SPS then we had the hold harmless provisions, it went even beyond. And I think the -- and that was really responsive to her and her concerns and the other commissioners as well.  And, of course, the Oklahoma commissioners too. So, we put our best foot forward to say, this is the parameters of what a deal would look like. And I would say that, and I mentioned this earlier in my comments, and I guess it was on purpose. But there is -- you can play around with the edges, but the main parameters of a deal have been discussed for - -really for a year now and with multiple parties. And those provisions are pretty well deﬁned.  So for us, to take on more risk beyond those parameters is not likely to happen either. So, I guess, I'm just saying, we sort of cut to the chase and we cut to the chase based on the responses of what the commissioner's were telling us. And we put our best foot forward. So our best foot forward is there from a parameter perspective, our best foot forward is there from a timing perspective. And what I said all along, we need an answer and back to Ali's question of --   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Ali's question of we've had pressure in our stock, well, because no one knows exactly where we're taking this. I guess, I'm just reinforcing to you that we're about to take this to a closing one way or another. Because we've got to get on with other decisions to be made relative to enhancing our shareholders' value and that's what we're going to do."
"Okay. And then, I guess one other question I like. So if you go back about, I think, 6, 12 months, you had talked about concern about the Oklahoma regulatory environment. I don't think you are that happy with the rate order early this year and then we'll see what happens with Wind Catcher, but just -- is that still kind of an issue that's in play based on the outcome here?","I think, actually -- I think we've made a lot of progress from an Oklahoma standpoint, just because of the dialog that we've been having relative to the Wind Catcher case. And the dialog that we've had post rate case environments and pre rate case environment. I think the issues are becoming more known from an Oklahoma perspective. And I think we've done a really good job of trying to do the best we possibly can for Oklahoma customers. And I think that's starting to get recognized and I really believe that we have the real potential of being on an upward trajectory as it relates to PSO, because of -- And I can tell you that there has been a lot of discussion post rate cases and that kind of thing.  But the kind of discussions we've had relative to Wind Catcher and really the stretch that we've put in here to try to do the best we can for Oklahoma customers has not gone unrecognized. And so -- and as I mentioned earlier, there will be another rate case ﬁling in the third quarter in Texas and in Oklahoma and that will be -- I think, that will be sort of a new beginning and one where we can really look at the issues in Oklahoma. I think there is a better understanding of the issues. And I think we have some great commissioners there, they really understand what the issues are. So, we're hopeful that we can make progress there."
Okay. Thank you.  Operator  We have a question from Paul Patterson. Please go ahead.,"Hi, Paul."
"Hi. How are you doing? Just procedurally what should we expect, I guess. What procedurally is expected to happen on Thursday in Texas. I know you guys have lengthen the period for decision making, but I was just wondering what -- is it possible to get a decision on Thursday?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. I think it's probably, in my mind, a couple of options. One is, the commission does decide to vote on the arrangement based on the input that we provided. The other option probably could be more likely would be that Chairman Walker had talked about, coming up with a list of questions and we respond to one's we knew of, there may be other questions. So there could be questions answered in the nearest two weeks. I think 2 weeks from then is another commission hearing. So whether we are on the dock or not, I don't know, but there is opportunities now that we've given to the end of August for that kind of thing to occur.  So that's up to the Commission. But that's sort of the way that the two alternatives that I see. I'd rather (inaudible) Thursday, that will be great."
"Get some closure here. And then also, just to clarify on Ali Agha's question. There is really, I guess, no sort of Wind Catcher light or I mean, basically, it's kind of -- you guys like to do other things, obviously, you are always looking for things and other opportunities, but it sounds like, essentially, it's kind of -- this deal is kind of -- is kind of a pretty much not really given to any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation. If this doesn't happen -- if there is a rejection or something like that, we shouldn't think of there being sort of Wind Catcher light opportunity per se with respect to the project. Is that correct?","That's correct. I think you can see -- I mean, obviously, with the integrated resource plans that we ﬁled, you may see smaller projects develop in some fashion, but they could be renewables, may not be renewables. So you really -- but you won't see another Wind Catcher light project, because that one has -- that one is very unique in its scope and scale and the beneﬁts provided. And so, you're probably moving to either less eﬃcient type of opportunities. And there certainly will continue to develop those kinds of options. So keep in mind, you look at AEP as a 5% to 7% foundational growth stock with all these little incremental opportunities."
Awesome. Thank you so much.  Operator  We have question from Angie Storozynski. Please go ahead.,"Hi, Angie. How are you?"
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hi. How are you? So I got a bigger picture question. So, I mean, the utilities -- the electric utilities industry is clearly evolving and I'm trying to have some lessons learned from what has happened in Europe. And I'm asking this because, about 60% of your CapEx plan is transmission spending through 2021. And yet, we have seen it in Europe that transmission CapEx or transmission investments have been falling because utilities are choosing instead to go with distributed generation sometimes back by batteries. And we're are hearing the same type of ideas now coming up from Midwestern utilities.  And so my question is, one, do you think that you need to do some how diversify your growth plan. And two, was the Wind Catcher basically an attempt to become less dependent on transmission spending or was it somewhat completely independent? It's a big question.","Angie, you should be involved with our strategy sessions, because there is no question that this industry is changing dramatically and we recognized that at some point in time transmission will essentially saturate in some fashion, but that horizon is really a decade out, because in the US which is -- I really talk a lot to the people that RWE Energy, Anil, other areas of Europe as well. And they are much more compartmentalize, but they're also from a renewable perspective, the renewables are starting to slow down somewhat, at least largely renewable. But in the US that's still developing. And what we have to think about though and you're exactly right.  As you bridge from the transmission related investment, we see the incoming growth strategy around the innovation on the distribution side. So, in the past, if you think about the way we've been investing a huge amount of what we invested ﬁve, 10 years ago was generation related, then it became transmission related. Now you're seeing the continued development of transmission and then eventually that will saturate. But the growing part of it now is the distribution investment at the operating companies focused on bringing about the -- eﬀectuating the new technologies and development associated with even distributed resources, big data analytics, all the optimization activities going on.  Those are clearly opportunities for us in the future and that's why we're so focused on the customer and focused on making sure that we are able to deliver those types of technologies. We're part of -- we're the only US utility that is part of a international consortium that does essentially a shark tank around the world. And I just got back from California where there were 2000 startups that were evaluated and was called down to a list of 15. We're doing pilots with four of them at least at this point and that's where the future is starting to develop.  So you're exactly right. And the way we see is, bending the O&M curve is a big part of what we're doing, because obviously with optimization, eﬃciencies, digital experiences, all those types of things we are near to that beneﬁt, but the capitalization will continue to be transmission and then you'll see an emerging distribution component of it as well. So, so far as the eye can see we're in a great shape from an investment standpoint because of that transition."
Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),Thank you.  Operator  We have a question from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead.
"Thank you so much. Hi, guys.",How are you doing?
"Good. So, thanks for all the color on Wind Catcher. I guess -- and you're reiterating ﬁve to seven growth. I guess my question is, if Wind Catcher does go through, is the right way to think about it is that, Wind Catcher will be all incremental growth to the ﬁve to seven or will there be some capital allocation limitation where you say, the ﬁve to seven doesn't all add up with incremental Wind Catcher, but it's somewhere in between. How should we think about that kind of mix if you did get Wind Catcher?","So, think of it is incremental, what we've announced today some of that could be pushed out in time, but still within the 5% to 7% growth rate. Does that makes sense?"
Okay. But there is a little bit of room of something getting pushed out just to kind of Wind Catcher CapEx in there. Is that right?,Absolutely.
"Got you. All right. And then given the strong quarter and the weather helped, I guess in Q2. Is there any reason why a kind of guidance was maintained right now at the same level?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. So, you know what a big swing for us the third quarter is. And they're big items that will be ins and outs. I think Nick talked about some of the expenses that we're having with Wind Catcher as we go forward in time. It doesn't make sense for us to change the guidance at this point. The way we see it, we're still inside that range that we've identiﬁed and if there is any change to that we would likely be making that after the third quarter.     And there are things that we -- we usually use whether as an opportunity to move O&M. So you could see some O&M move, that was 19 to 18 or that kind of thing. We typically do that on a regular basis, because we do want to show that certainty and consistency around 5% to 7% in our earnings guidance. Now you can only do that to a certain extent. Right. So if you do wind up for the rest of the year like the ﬁrst part of the year, than who know how much you can -- you can absolutely -- that you can do.  But our view is really that credibility around the guidance that we put out and making sure that we can deliver on that regardless of what's going on with weather as we demonstrated last year. And then continue that as we go forward. So we will -- and as Brian said, typically we wait for third quarter to determine what the future holds in terms of guidance."
Got you. That's super helpful color. And then ﬁnally just -- now that -- you'll soon have some form of decision on Wind Catcher and tax reform kind of is done and or at least mostly known in terms of what the play out scenarios are. Is there any strategic review that we should be thinking about that you guys are looking at in terms of your business mix or just anything that needs to be cleaned up internally or do you think currently the kind of combination of businesses or utilities you have is the right ﬁt and there is nothing really to be done on the strategic side?,"Yeah. We've already done it. We already done sort of a major housecleaning. So, we're pretty pristine stock. And when you -- now that being said, we're always looking at ways to optimize our portfolio and -- but you also have to look at the uses. Right. So we have a lot of sources, we have a lot of uses. And so -- and certainly our balance sheet is strong, so we can do a lot of things. But obviously, they are all centered upon ensuring that we are able to deliver on the guidance and the growth rates that we've -- that we've laid out. And that's why we show -- you can -- that sort of comes and goes. I mean you can have a jurisdiction or a state jurisdiction that says, okay, it's suﬀering and maybe we should be something.  Well, it takes a little time to really ﬁgure out, is that a -- just a systemic problem or do we need to do something about it, but that's really the way we look at it. I mean, it is Portfolio Management, but it's smart portfolio management around the delivery expectations around our growth rate in our guidance."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got you. Thank you so much. Super helpful.,"Yeah.     Operator, we can -- we have time for one more question.  Operator  Okay. We go the line of Anthony Crowdell. Please go ahead."
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.
"Hi, Nick, I direct you to give Brian a little break from doing all the talking. Just quickly any agreement that you reach or the details that you reach in Texas or Oklahoma, but is there a most favored notion that hold harmless guarantee will apply to the other two jurisdictions?","Yeah. So all the jurisdictions have a hold harmless provisions. So -- and that's really the key part of it. I mean, every adjustment we make is not just an adjustment in that jurisdiction, it's a adjustment across the board. So that's why we had to be particularly careful from a risk perspective and that's why we've laid out in the letter what our expectation is. And then, FERC customers are obviously treated diﬀerently because of their own arrangements, but that's really the way it works."
Is that a biggest hurdle you believe for the Oklahoma and Texas commissions. It just hold harmless or are there other details that or what's delaying it in those two states?,"Well, I think certainly election season in Oklahoma is pretty distracting and also you have some parties in the states like the attorney general in Oklahoma that -- they did a settlement -- they   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   call it a settlement deal, I don't know what it is. But with the staﬀ that had provisions that were way oﬀ base. So a lot of discussion about that.  I think there is just a lot of confusion out there and sometimes you focus so much on the margins of what could happen to this and could happen to that. It's almost like ﬁnishing up the contract versus looking at the amazing beneﬁts across the board that are out there. So you are getting it hung up in a lot of that kind of dialog. And then in Texas, you've got industrials and other there will see attorney for the industrials that are using diﬀerent gas forecast and all that kind of stuﬀ and it sort of confuses the parties that are listening. So when you get past all that and you get just to the facts, then I think we'll be in much better shape."
"Great. (inaudible) family wasn't selling Chevy's [ph] in other parts of SWEPCO, it was probably one of the easier state for Louisiana.","Yeah, my dad used to be used car salesmen, sold Chevy's in Louisiana."
Maybe you should have rethought about Texas or Oklahoma. Thanks for taking my questions.,"Yeah. Thanks.     Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call.
