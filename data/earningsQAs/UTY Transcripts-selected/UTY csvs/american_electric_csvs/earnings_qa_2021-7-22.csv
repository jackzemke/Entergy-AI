Question,Answer
"Thank you for all the remarks, I'd say it's the pace that you guys were just talking, I wouldn't mistake, you guys are sitting in New York or something like this. I am going to try to catch up, but everything that was just said, but may be in summary on the logos I hear you. I think the critical comment you made was mix. Where you trending against our guidance range here as you think about obviously third quarter matters critically, obviously kept intact the total load growth here. Any comments to just resolve that against the full year number, I mean, I know we're still early in the year.","Yeah, I think you sort of answered the question, we're still early is in the year because third quarter is particularly meaningful. And we typically look after third quarter to see where we -- where we actually stand. But, but again as Julie mentioned O&M goes up commensurate with all the customer expansion as well. And we have a pretty sizable customer expansion, you look at the industrial and commercial numbers, they are up considerably.  So and I think it obviously is out stripping our estimate, going end of the year of what overall load growth would be. But range being seen because I think we're sort of in a -- in a very   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   cyclical period of trying to ﬁgure out what the future holds in terms of whether this other variant of COVID is going to have an impact or what happens, actually is there just pent up frustration, then it starts to moderate. What is promising is though that we're seeing -- we're still seeing residential load, although it's negative to 2020, it's still a positive overall. So, our original thesis of more residential load going forward and if we can tie that together with improved industrial and commercial load as well, it could be very positive. But we certainly have to feel our way through that, and really understand that so the past third quarter before we really have a good feel of that, Julie.     Yeah, just maybe add a little ﬁner point to, if you're thinking sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our load growth rates are expected to moderate in the second half of the year based on prior year comps. So when you think about it restrictions were most severe in the second quarter and by the third quarter of last year, so by the third quarter of last year. The service territory had begun essentially a phased reopening. And so as a result, the 6.3% growth for the second quarters by not only the highest growth in the quarter and actually it is the highest growth in AEP's history, but will also be the highest load growth stat during the recovery.  So if you think about the second half of the year, I would expect that year-over-year to moderate a little bit. And so we're just keeping a watchful eye on how the trend continues to click along, I know, I saw in the Wall Street Journal this morning CFOs commenting on where they think the economy is going to go. It does not look like anybody is changing their estimates based on COVID trends, but we're keeping an eye on that."
"Got it, excellent, thank you. And then if I can pivot to Texas, obviously you will have a pretty meaningful footprint there. We've seen various legislative eﬀorts underway. I'm curious as best you can tell, thus far. I know it's early. Any kind of context you can put, especially on the transmission side of potential project here. We're hearing something reappears about potentially meaningful shifts.","Well, certainly, obviously, it remains to be seen as far as transmission investment and it really we think of T&D and what part of the business is associated with T&D. We have made some inroads in terms of, in terms of backup generation those kinds of things, in terms of transmission, I really think there is probably continued opportunity for development of storage capability of other transmission related investments on the grid to ensure that we're able to adjust for us.  We're doing a lot in terms of line in slide into the transmission grid itself. Continuing to expand our ability, continuing to focus on our ability to have even more Transmission in place because if you're looking for additional generation to be placed in various areas where transmission is a big part of that solution as well. So is that and I think, Texas sort of microcosm of the country when you start re-evaluating the system based upon the needs from not only a natural gas perspective, but also from a renewable perspective that brings in the whole planning eﬀort and communication in real-time associated with the operations of the Transmission and for that matter, the distribution system as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So I think they're making the right steps and I think there are more steps to be made. So, and it's going to be a sort of a multiyear type of eﬀort and of course, you know, we're a big part of the transmission in Texas. So we'll be certainly very focused on how the T&D business can be expanded to improve the resiliency of the T&D eﬀorts. But that means Texas is really going to have to start thinking about resources and a broader view of resources like we're having to do for the rest of the system. And transmission technologies and for that matter distribution technologies are going to have to be recognized in its ability to provide a more resilient grid, you can't have these strict lines drawn between generation and transmission and distribution, because that's not the world we are in anymore. So we'll continue that focus every legislative session, every regulatory session, will be centered on that eﬀort."
"Excellent Just last Kentucky. I know you can't say much, but what's the level of interest, if you can give any kind of parameters.","Yes. Obviously, I don't want to get into too much detail there. I think again you answered a sort of right at the beginning. It is a conﬁdential process, but I can say that we do have credible interest. And it is a competitive process."
"Excellent, thank you all. Take care.",Okay.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.     Good morning Steve.
"Hey, good morning. Can you hear me now.","Good morning, oh yeah I can hear you ﬁne.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay, great, thanks. I might have missed this, but just where are you on the $600 million of equity plan for this year, how much of you issued so far.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Steve. We've actually used the ATM to issue just under $200 million. I think it was around $195 million that was associated with the ﬁnancing of the Sundance North Central Wind facility. And we'll be continuing on with the rest of that program. As you know, about 100 of that 600 is also associated with the DRIP, so that continues to play in the background, if that helps."
"Okay and then just, this might be a little bit hard to answer, but just in terms of thinking about the $1.4 billion for next year that's in the plan, obviously, if you were to sell Kentucky, some of that could maybe oﬀset some of that. So just, could you just give us latest thoughts on how to think about the Kentucky outcome relative to that $1.4 billion for next year.","Yeah, Nick can add a ﬁner point from a strategic perspective. But, purely from a ﬁnancing perspective, you're right on the money, Steve. So we got $1.4 billion embedded in our plan, and for those of we are following along that page 39 of the cash ﬂow if you want to take a look at 2022. About $100 of that again is associated with the DRIP about $800 is associated North Central Wind ﬁnancing and then we have another $500 million just associated with general funding of growth CapEx. And so to your point, Steve, to the extent that we would ﬁnd ourselves in a situation where we were able to transact and bring dollars in the door. We would absolutely be able to work oﬀ some of that otherwise equity issuance, inside step that so I don't -- I can't give you a number, we don't have a transaction. But that is absolutely the thinking and how we're modeling diﬀerent scenarios, inside the house and I do not know Nick If you have any comment.     I think, I think you covered it well as far as, it's great to have a ﬁnancing plan assuming Kentucky, sale a Kentucky doesn't happen but also it's great to have options available to further optimize what that ﬁnancing plan looks like. So and I'll say again the timing, particularly with reverse being the last one, it's a largest one, in ﬁrst quarter '22. That times up pretty well with this process. So, so we'll get this resolved and there'll be ﬁnanced one way or another, but at the end of the day, the timing of it and the process is continuing on plan.     And then just if I could, to follow-up, Steve again just to reiterate, the plan as it stands today, as you know assumes no asset rotation. And again, I want to reinforce that the 5% to 7% is well intact even if we don't have a transaction.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay. And are you, do you have a bias within that range at all or just, that's the range.",That's the probably we cannot answer at this point.
"Okay, so you're being very unbiased, I mean very smart move. Okay, thanks so much.","Yeah, sure.  Operator  Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.     Good morning Shar."
"Good morning, guys. Wanted to start with the recent event and get your sense on the Mitchell order in Kentucky. Sort of rejecting the rate increase you sought, obviously, it's not a surprise fall on the AG strong comments prior to decision. Nick is this sort of a signal that the state and the PST in general of they're starting to commit to maybe a little bit more of a rational thinking around an economic approach to coal. Like the least cost approach to starting to bend further towards renewables, so how do we think about the viability of the plant in the state. And could we see some acceleration of that 1.4 gigs of solar and when you brought into plan for the state on the prior calls, a direct read. And then is how do we sort of think about West Virginia's rate request coming oﬀ the Kentucky order.","Yeah, sure, it's sort of interesting. I mean it's multi jurisdictional. As you know, in Mitchell is wheeling Kentucky Power, and I think we have to get resolved. Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. West Virginia is yet to speak on this issue, but, and it's only the ALJ in Virginia. So we'll hear more from Virginia on that. But I think it's really important for us to really hold on to our cards for now, because we got to get through a state process. It's good to have clarity. And I think Kentucky obviously is the ﬁrst shoe to drop in this regard, but we've also made it clear that these are multi jurisdictional units. So, we have to make sure that there is some compatibility of the jurisdictions that are involved. We'll go through the process, we'll get the initial views of the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   commissions. And then if they are on diﬀerent, diﬀerent tracks, we will have to further analyze and resolve that with the commissions. And there's a law resolutions that could occur some are shorter, some longer. But we have to understand where all three commissions are before really doing anything here. I think it's good to get clarity though and I think it's pretty important that, whether it's the ELG or the CCR if they approve -- if they approved CCR investments, but don't improve approve ELG investments. Then that eﬀectively brings the generation retirement dates back from 2040 to 2028. So that's something we have to consider along with those commissions, but we'll know more about this in the August time frame. But I'd be hesitant to say you know what, what Kentucky it's pretty interesting that they would be looking at the ELG part of it and I think there is becoming more of an awareness of that there has to be a plan. Now what that plan is we've got a fully resolved with all those commission. So more to come on that."
"Got it. And thanks for the visibility around sort of the Kentucky process. And I know, Nick, you obviously mentioned that further optimization is always a possibility. Minus tips like that sugar point is the shaping of that, for instance, at 16.6 gigawatts of renewables you discussed in the prior call. Obviously Kentucky will more than likely backﬁll some of your North Central equity need. So, as we're thinking about further optimization, should we be watching like the outcomes at the IRPs the PSU approval of how much you plan to own versus PPAs. Which I guess which stipulate your incremental equity needs and the resulting size of potentially further optimization measures.","Yeah, yeah. So, and just like we've gone through probably a couple of years now of discussions about how North Central is going to get ﬁnanced. And we're ﬁnally getting to a point where ultimately we'll know how it's being ﬁnanced. The 16.6 gigawatts and is certainly we made a pretty credible case that we ought to own a signiﬁcant part of that, I would like to own all of it. But certainly, if -- but operationally and from a contracting standpoint and certainly the ability for us to respond as system related activities, it's important for us to own and control those assets.  And I think that as we go forward. You're right, it will be the integrated resource planning ﬁlings that are made, they will start that dialog, now we're in the process of doing RFPs to get more information, obviously from the market in terms of what's out there from a development perspective. And that process is ongoing, so that, that will certainly fortify any CCN ﬁlings, we have to make or anything like that. After the resource planning ﬁlings. But the resource planning ﬁlings will be your ﬁrst real dialog around how quickly this transformation will occur in each one of the jurisdictions. And so we're feeling pretty good about it because it's getting to a point where we have to decide from a capacity standpoint how we support these utilities and it's pretty clear to me the movement is to that clean energy economy, the movement is to toward as long as you have some element of base load 24 x 7 capacity, that renewables will be the big part of that. So a lot of that's just becoming -- I think it's becoming much more transparent. And in our jurisdictions, I think the conditions both federally and from a state perspective there just a better realization of what the options are. And the timing of those options and that's what will drive forward through that resource planning process."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it and then lastly for me, and I apologize if I'm putting you on the spot, the news just broke out this morning. But is there any kind of read through to the FirstEnergy deferred prosecution agreement, that was announced this morning to the SEC investigation at AEP.","No, not, like I said, said before we're on the outside looking in, we have no knowledge of any of that activity and so if the report is true, I'm glad to see that there is some element of putting all this in the rear-view mirror, because naturally now said before AEP has been hung up in the wake of that and I am certainly hopeful that there are some closure brought about from that. So, but yeah, I have, it was, it was a surprise to me and we knew nothing about it. And certainly there is really nothing else that we've -- that AEP can say other than, what we put on our website. And naturally, there is just nothing to report from our perspective."
"Terriﬁc, thank you, Nick and Julie. Congrats on today's results.","Yeah, okay.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
Thank you. Good morning.,Good Morning.
"Congrats on a constructive update and on [ph]we've been in mentioned both Carly Simon and Foo Fighter, I may be at ﬁrst.",Yeah all right.
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So I just wanted to discuss on Kentucky, if there are approaches that can help minimize tax leakage, how are you thinking about sort of ability to bring proceeds back and sort of the impact of taxes.","Yeah, thanks for the question, Stephen, as you know, we're a little tax ineﬃcient right now. So given the tax basis in Kentucky and the diﬀerent hurdles that we're considering. I wouldn't see that one being a show stopper and quite frankly that might give us an opportunity to enhance or improve our tax eﬃciency without getting into a bunch of numbers. I wouldn't let that trip you up in terms of what things could stop us moving forward."
"That's helpful. And then maybe just thinking through the upcoming RFPs, you mentioned the APCO and SWEPCO, RFPs. Could you just talk a little more detail in terms of color around the timetable there and I'm sorry if I missed that, if you did go through it. I didn't quite follow there, I'm just thinking about sort of what that might mean for timing of incremental spending and sort of how we should think about those processes.","Yes. So we've certainly gone through the basic requirements for the RFPs for all of these areas. But as we go through that process, there is at APCO, we issued an RFP there for 300 megawatts of solar and wind resources, really for a completion date of 2023 or 2024. And then in May of 2021 APCO issued an RFP to obtain I guess was 100 megawatts of solar and wind energy via PPA in RFP, for the renewable energy certiﬁcates only, which is consistent with the Virginia and what their requirements are. And then SWEPCO issued an RFP for own resources up to 3,000 MW of wind and up to 300 MW of solar resources, with optional battery storage, by the way, that can achieve completion by about 2024 to 2025. And they are also seeking 200 MW of capacity in the '23, '24 range and another 250 in the '25 to '27 range. So those bids or due in mid-August.  And then at PSO, we in June, we notiﬁed the regulators in terms that we intend to issue an RFP seeking up to 2600 MW of wind and up to 1350 MW of solar again with options for battery storage consideration. And that's meeting capacity needs by 2025. So and then PSO plans to issue the RFP in October of this year. So those are the ones that are on the board right now and have really some near term related requirements and most are capacity related requirement. So and again they're being done pretty much the same way as the others with North Central that we will certainly do more of a turnkey type of thing where we take ownership at the time it gets approved in rate. And then of course we'll go through the process of approvals by the various commissions along the way. So, but that's the plan right now. And then, we'll continue to, as a matter of face, we're spending a lot of time with our Board, focused on the strategies related to these types of these types of ﬁlings and the plan long term, and it's important for everyone to understand this is going to be a continual process. And you're just seeing the ﬁrst part of these really driven by capacity requirements and not just sort of an energy convenience.  So I think they're really good to go out with right now. And that's why we have at this point.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
That's really helpful. That's all I had. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.,
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, how are you doing."
"Good, good. Just wanted to pick up on Kentucky a little bit more if that's possible. And just want to know if you might be able to comment in any degree to whether the strategic review process has received more interest from strategic or ﬁnancial players. And then as well, kind of given strong prices achieved in recent industry transactions and the strong interest, you know here in Kentucky, has this process made you thought about more asset rotation beyond Kentucky to increase balance sheet headroom overall.","Yeah, so for the ﬁrst question, we started out this process saying that we expected to get strategic's and ﬁnancials and we have strategic's and ﬁnancials. So, both are involved. And then as far as your second question is concerned, as I said earlier, with the Foo Fighters dialog. This is going to be a continual process for us and if we're practically fully regulated. So we have the opportunities to look at, if we're building 16.6 gigawatts of renewables resources during our transition than we got to have to have everything on table in terms of sources and uses.  So we're going to go through that process and of course, Kentucky is sort of a ﬁrst stop and, but we'll continue to evaluate our assets as sources and if it makes sense based upon what the other opportunities are, then that's the kind of framework that we want to move this company towards."
"Got it. That's helpful, thanks for that. And then there is news coming out of FERC with regards to kind of the transmission planning process and just wondering if you might be able to provide some thoughts on -- your thoughts on what's been said recently and what you see is kind of best practices here.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. So, obviously, we'd like to see much better transmission related planning across regions. And AEP does a pretty good job itself in terms of transmission planning, because we do have a large system to consider. But at the same time RTO to RTO type of planning process to try to make them more consistent. So you can have just this large transmission being built across regions and across states. If you're going to get that going particularly as you're trying to get renewable resources to load centers, we're going to have to resolve these issues around multi jurisdictional, multi RTO type of analyzes and making sure that we're consistent. The other part two is we're going to have consistency in terms of rate making. And this notion of reevaluating incentives, structures and those types of things is not good for making decisions relative to transmission or, and is not good relative to the RTO model itself. So I think I think really needs to sort of step back and take a look at. If I think it's a real positive approach to be focusing on the planning aspects in addressing RTO to RTO boundaries, addressing areas where, what's competitive, what's not competitive, all those types of things. That's ﬁne. But -- but we have to have a clear planning process and ﬁrst of all you can't have coming back later after a project multi millions of business spend on a project to say we're going to stop the project that has to -- that has to change. And the other part of it is we've got to be able to make these investments with some sense of certainty. And be able to move quickly to make that happen. So I just -- I think there's only so much value -- there's a lot of value and being in an RTO for customers. But there also has to be value for the companies involved to make the investments that beneﬁt customers in orders of magnitude greater than what the costs are related to any incentives related to transmission.  And if you want to send a bad message for anybody to join an RTO or any by the stay in an RTO, it's just not good to start messing around with what the assumptions are relative to the future recovery of transmission investment. And now you know when you start questioning incentives, you're really questioning anybody who is trying to put a multi year model together to show the beneﬁts of transmission has to take that in to account. That's something may change as we're trying to make an investment in a coal unit, with clean energy activities going on in Washington. So you really do have to really think this process through and think about what you're trying to achieve. Sorry I went long on about that a bit."
"No, that's helpful, thank you for that. I'll stop there. Thank you.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hey Durgesh, how are you."
"Hey, good morning, Nick. Thanks for taking my question. Hey you addressed sort of a lot of transmission questions in the Q&A. Maybe just like the MISO transmission opportunity that the MISO has ﬂagged perhaps just sort of unveil towards the end of the year. I know a small sort of a set of assets for you in that -- in that location but could you compete for some of those projects, could that be an upside for you there.","Well, yeah, we could, we could compete there with our Transource entity, which we have been, but yeah, we could, and it's actually a small impact for us as it stands. But certainly we could certainly participate in any of that."
"Understood. And then just anything you're hearing if you're level and your peers and through the sort of the EI organization. I mean that infrastructure bill has a pretty sizable CapEx on the transmission side, or investment on the transmission side just anything you're hearing from that on the federal front.","Yeah. So obviously we have the, I guess it's $1.2 trillion the infrastructure bill that -- it's interesting we talk in trillions as opposed to billions now. But in terms of the hard infrastructure side of things, it appears there is some kind of convergence in Washington on that particular issue although more has to be done on the actual language and things like that. But as far as pursuing the advancement of certainly transmission investment, but direct pay and those kinds of issues are clearly important, along the way. We also have to -- have to -- as far as renewables and clean energy PTC's, ITC's, extensions of those, I think that makes sense, particularly [ph]RSRI delays because of COVID and that kind of thing. So I think there are opportunities for that. And then as far as electric vehicles, certainly we'd like to see electric vehicle infrastructure continue to be developed. So I think all of those areas are positive, the issue is how you leverage into the private -- to private companies like ours instead of the government funding and for transmission, for example, we think that mechanisms already exist for the development of transmission as long as you keep all the incentives and all that kind of stuﬀ. But, so federal government funding of that now. I think you have to sort of think about what level of encouragement and what area. So if they -- if they can make citing much better, if they can make certainly the focus on planning those issues that enables transmission to get investments. We have no problem ﬁnancing transmission investments.  So I think the government probably ought to pick and choose between what they truly want to focus on that, that's not already leveraged into the utilities for example. They can certainly encourage the development electric vehicles with the focus on charging station infrastructure and those types of things that would be a beneﬁt. And then as far as the renewables transformation or the clean energy transformation, any kind of hard infrastructure around being   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   able to move more quickly from a renewable standpoint whether tax incentives and also other technologies like storage.  And then also, we'd like to see beneﬁts related to either tax incentives for coal ﬁred generation to reduce the undepreciated plant balances for example. If you want to have a national plan around moving to a clean energy economy, then the more quickly, we can reduce undepreciated plant balances the better we're able to make decisions and commissions and states can make decisions about what future resource replacements would be.  So I think there are several ways to really focus on this, but we're all moving toward a clean energy economy. We just need to make sure that the government doesn't try to do too much across the board as opposed to very selected areas that enable investment to continue in the private sector, that would be my view."
"I appreciate that Nick. But real quick, just good to see FirstEnergy resolve the DOJ investigation or at least have an agreement this morning they highlighted, just any update on the SEC subpoena you got any more color that you can share with us.","No, nothing, nothing new there. We have been communicating with the SEC and were responsive to any requests they have from a documentation standpoint. And we're going to continue to work with them. And be supportive and constructive in the process. But nothing, nothing new to report there."
"Understood, thank you for taking my questions.",Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. And our ﬁnal question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"(Multiple Speakers) Michael, the guy who is excited about the changes in the Southeastern Conference they had. Hey, guys, real quick question or two. First of all, one on O&M this year, obviously O&M at the VIU segment is up a lot, how do you think about what the second half of the year, O&M trajectory looks like versus the ﬁrst half. And how should we think about both for VIU and T&D kind of segments, the long term kind of the 2022 and beyond trajectory for O&M.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, I'll just generally say and Julie can certainly follow up on this, but as you have expansions in customer load, you're going to have higher O&M associated with that. But that's a good, that's a good expansion. The issue for us, what we typically do is we're evaluating the true impacts of our Achieving Excellence Program against what our forecast needs to be in terms of bending the O&M curve. So, we continue to take account of the good O&M that supports expansion from a customer load perspective, but also continue to not only optimize that but also continue the overall optimization of the O&M budgeted sale. So, yeah, you may see and that's why, obviously we're watching what third quarter looks like and fourth quarter with the load does, but we want to make absolutely sure that we are continuing to make progress consistent with that plan of consistent earnings and dividend improvements in that 5% to 7% growth trajectory. So that's what we're doing, we're not just saying, yeah loads going up, let us spend more O&M, it really is a measured approach from our perspective. Julie?     No that's spot on Nick, and thanks for the question Michael, as I'm sitting here thinking about this and as we were preparing for the earnings call one of the things I'm looking at is to Nick's point you look at where loads coming in and as I mentioned in the previous answer to your question, we do expect that load on a relative basis when you compare to last year for the second half would not be as pronounced. although we do expect it to continue to improve. So that's a good thing and that allows us to be a little more comfortable with O&M cost where they are, because that does help the customer in the long run. So we keep that top of mind and continue to be very diligent about managing cost. But if you're trying to model for the rest of the year. Let me start by saying this we are not changing our guidance, but as you know once we start the year and we give you that plan. So you see that waterfall that we give to you how we get to the end of the year obviously changes right because it's a dynamic business. So I wouldn't be surprised if relative to that plan if you saw O&M be running a little richer. But I would hope that load will be hanging in there too. And then as you know, we're doing well on the Transmission Holdco segment already kind of clicking along where we thought we would be for the full year, so there may be some beneﬁt there too so do keep that in mind when you go back and compare and contrast to that guidance walk that we gave to you, I think, it was on February 25 during our earnings call.  And then, we're happy to help you with any modeling that you have oﬄine."
