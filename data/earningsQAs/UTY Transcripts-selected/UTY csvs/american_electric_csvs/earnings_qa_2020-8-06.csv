Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy.     Good morning."
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here.,Yeah.
"Just want to start oﬀ by a couple of, I guess, opposing items, inﬂuencing AEP going forward here. North Central Wind getting over the ﬁnish line, obviously a big positive, COVID headwind, on the other side here. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about how these two factors inﬂuence, I guess, your 5% to 7% range with North Central Wind? I think, we're just looking to see if that could really help you here or just want to see how everything was shaken out I guess, going forward.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah. so I mean, we look at -- and as Brian mentioned, on the COVID activity and the load activity, you're seeing residential load be pretty strong. And certainly, as you look forward, I think, residential load is going to continue to look strong with the work-from-home environment and the business cases that are developed afterwards. And then, if you have commercial and industrial pick up as well, it could be a positive from a ﬁnancial standpoint.  The other regarding North Central and other wind projects and solar projects, we have a real opportunity to transition to that clean energy economy going forward in our service territory and that will really makes us -- again, we would be disappointed not to be in the upper part -- upper half of the 5% to 7% range, because you have to be bullish about not only where load is going, but also, in terms of the transformation from a -- just a pure and simple energy policy perspective regardless of who is in the White House in the next election, we'll continue moving toward a clean energy economy.  And then also, I think, bolstered by the other opportunities we have whether it's mid-range of broadband or other types of activities, electric vehicles and so forth, that we're going to see the further electriﬁcation of the society. So I'm really bullish about this company, in particular, but as well the industry."
"That makes sense. That's helpful, thanks. And maybe just kind of building oﬀ that with my second question. I think AEP is guiding to $1.3 billion of equity issuance at the fund North Central at this point. Just wondering, if you could update us there on your thoughts with regards to, is this deﬁnitely the path or is there the potential for portfolio optimization, is that still an option?",Yeah.
"I guess, how do you think about...","It absolutely is still an option and we're looking at all those options to see how to best ﬁnance it. We have plenty of time to make those things happen. Nick said that Sundance might be pushed out to the ﬁrst quarter of 2021, but we're not going to see the rest of those projects coming in, Traverse and Maverick until the end of '21. So all those things are in play, whether it's equity or rotation of capital. But for planning purposes, we were guiding people to two-thirds equity for that project in aggregate."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got you. That's very helpful. Thank you.,"Thanks, Jeremy.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. And your line is open.     Good morning, Andrew."
"Good morning. First a question on dividends. So at the end of the deck, you showed dividends in 2022, $1.5 billion versus $1.4 billion previously. I also see the footnote that dividend should grow with earnings. My question is, is that increase of $100 million a function of more shares outstanding after the North Central Wind equity or does it imply a step-up in dividend per share along with a step-up in EPS or perhaps both?","I think, it'd be some of both because obviously, with North Central additional equity involved there, but also, as you said, I mean, our dividend will move with our earnings capability. So I'd say both."
"Okay, great. Next from me.","Brian, do you have any comments on -- okay.     No, go ahead."
Please go ahead.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No, I was seeing if Brian wanted to comment on that, but he said I covered it."
"Okay, great.",Yeah.
"On CapEx, you mentioned that you're pulling back $100 million of the deferred CapEx. I just want to under -- be sure I understand what drove that. Is that a function of speciﬁc projects being more necessary or more appealing or is it more a function of the better than expected cash ﬂows?","Yeah, I think that's a positive story. Some of that is related to our new customer connections and so, it was clearly evident that we needed to move that forward. But also, we had the capability ﬁnancially to move it forward. We talked about this last time, the deferral of the $500 million, we weren't changing the ﬁve-year capital plan, we were going to maintain that level and the $500 million was merely being deferred, so that we could understand what the COVID issues were going to be. And so, we're continually looking at our process going forward in terms of putting that $500 million back in, in various stages. So what you saw this quarter was the ﬁrst stage of that."
"Very good. If I could just have one more here to clarify the last question from Jeremy. The 5% to 7% range, you're pointing to the upper end of that, is that a function of North Central Wind now being included or is it more that you're pointing to the higher end with or without North Central Wind as a one-timer?","Well, certainly we looked at North Central, but obviously, we continue to track and we believe that the upper half of that guidance range is certainly achievable and something that we again would be disappointed not to be able to get there. So that's clearly an opportunity for us and based on the things that I talked about earlier.     It should. North Central Wind should certainly solidify our position in the upper half.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. And keep in mind too. At the same time, the Achieving Excellence Program is continuing to grow. So we already have plans in place and you're seeing sort of a crescendo of savings associated with that plan. And the ﬁrst year 2020 is -- some of it's in there, but not much. And when you look at the future years, that continues to grow substantially and certainly, as I've mentioned earlier, the addition of two ACE and the focus on digitization, automation in combination with the learnings from COVID, I think is going to further accentuate the beneﬁts from Achieving Excellence."
That all sounds great. Thank you so much.,"Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. And your line...     Good morning, James."
"Hey, good morning, guys. Can you hear me?",Yes. I hear you. Yes. Good morning.
"Okay, great.",Good morning.
"Real quick question. I know you had outlined the bending the cost curve EI down to kind of $2.8 billion and as COVID took over, we are now down at $2.7 billion. It seems like year-to-date, if you just look at it on a after-tax basis, you guys are already kind of running above that kind of $100 million sort of run rate. How should we, I guess think about the non-tracked O&M versus   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   the additional O&M that you are actually pulling out in response to COVID? And as we think about 2021, is there any guidance I guess, you could give us on how much of that you think will be retainable as we move into the next year?","Yeah. So, we're at this point, James, not able to provide obviously speciﬁc guidance on 2021. But I'll say, the incremental $100 million that we're able to garner is a combination of sustainable and one-timers and I think, it's a matter of managing our way through the downturn in normalized load and just working as hard as we can to pull out all the stops to make sure that we meet our commitments to shareholders and really target the middle part of that range without impacting customers, and so far we've been able to do that.  There have been some unexpected things that we've seen, maybe some things that aren't line items in O&M that have come out and I think, as you have things like traveling expense, conventions that people go to, things like that, meals, just buildings' expense that you have, things that just don't happen when everyone's working from home that I think are more like one-timers, that as people go back to work, we'll start to put those things back into place. But you've seen our track record over the last nine or 10 years now and it's been keeping a very, very tight range on untracked O&M and we're using those skills that we've learned over the last several years to make sure that we're able to manage our way through this circumstance.     Yeah, I would say -- and as Brian mentioned, I mean there's a lot of learnings from COVID-19 and the impacts and how we've operated and the eﬃciency of which we've operated and I think it sort of changes the perspective and changes the threshold of even what one-timers are and ongoing, because I think, the learnings we have from the year, we're going to be much diﬀerent in our approach related to many of these activities. And actually, you would be surprised and I'll certainly talk about this more at the end of the year of what Achieving Excellence is showing us, the things that were buried in the organization that we obviously have an opportunity to take advantage of. And so, there's no question that you should expect a continued eﬃciency around the savings of O&M. And that's in the non-tracked area.     You've seen on page 34 of the presentation, you've seen the tight range we've been able to keep it in. In terms of bending the curve, as we go down to $2.7 billion and untrack, we actually are bending that curve downward at this point.     Yes. I'm bending the warping, so that's good."
"No, that's great. And I guess, just as a follow-up, I mean obviously, the run rate has been very, very good. I mean, you did a heroic job I guess in 2Q just the bulk of it from year-to-date   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   perspective has kind of showed up, but as you move through the rest of the year, do you feel like you have additional room whether it'd be one-time or again, Nick, like you're talking about through just kind of change in workﬂow to continue to sort of press that down if you need to, if we get sort of resurgence in COVID again?","Yeah, I think, number one, really I'll think about -- the processes are in place and the focus of the organization is in place to be able to adjust. And I'm perfectly happy with the foundation that's been put in place for this organization on an ongoing basis. I mean, because if we look at our Achieving Excellence Program, it's not just a one-time program, it's a regular process we're going to go through in budgeting and it's also, a regular process that will go throughout the year for us to be able to adjust. So we will do what we have to do and there is no question that we have the foundation to be able to do it."
"Okay, great. Well, thank you for taking my question and best of luck guys.","Yes, sure.     Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.     Good morning."
"Hey, good morning.",So there is -- Hello?
Hey. Can you hear me? I'm sorry.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Yeah, I hear you.     Yes."
"Great. Okay, great. Just I wanted to follow up on the O&M $100 million number. What of that $100 million was actually achieved in the quarter?","It will be -- the O&M CapEx for the O&M -- Oh, I'm sorry, O&M cuts. It's going to be achieved ratably throughout the balance of the year. So from second quarter, third and fourth, think about it being achieved ratably as we work our way through that."
"Understood. And I apologize, there is like a echo in my -- in -- when I'm speaking. So and then the potential labor initiatives that you outlined, is that an addition to the $100 million?",It's all incorporated to get us to that $2.7 billion number.
"Understood, guys. Thank you so much.","Sure thing.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Sophie Karp with Keybanc. And your line is open.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Good morning, Sophie."
"Hi. Good morning, guys. Good morning...",Good morning.
Congrats on the quarter.,Thanks.
"And thanks for the time. I'm just curious about maybe, I can ask you more of a high-level question. Given the landscape -- market landscape that we are seeing right now, do you see an opportunity, maybe, an opening to do some rotation in your portfolio of assets maybe high grade it a little bit, if you will, and divest some and is there an opportunity for M&A for a more wired focus or like assets and tax evaluation?","Yeah, Sophie."
Tax expense[ph]. I want to hear just your thoughts on that.,"Yeah, sure. We've certainly been consistent in the discussion around any M&A activity or in terms of what we can do in terms of rotation, that's always an option that's available to us. And this company is moving toward a portfolio management approach where obviously, we have sources and uses and those sources include the assets we have and certainly, we will continue to look at those as opportunities and tie them with investments that we make. So we will continue to do that.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Regarding M&A activity, we have a high threshold, because we certainly have the ability to invest, we have the ability to -- we have the largest transmission system in the country. Certainly, our investment, our distribution businesses are continuing to grow considerably and so, if we can invest that without a premium, that's a good thing for our shareholders. Now that being said, we look at strategic areas that make sense to us, but certainly that threshold is high and we'll continue to evaluate that. But make no mistake that this company is focused on its ability to continue to grow but grow eﬃciently for our shareholders and we'll continue to do that."
Thank you.,"Yes.     Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. And your line is open.     Good morning, Paul."
"Hey, how are you doing?",All right. How are you?
I'm managing.,So am I.
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That's all we can do, I guess. So I don't think of you guys as being a primary beneﬁciary or primarily impacted by HB 6, but is there any ancillary or anything we should think about with the potential repeal of HB 6 in Ohio that could impact you guys?","Well, certainly, with the repeal, it's how it's replaced, is the issue and obviously, how it's repealed, because there are some things, some interconnections that occurred between HB 6 and the regulatory process, where we had regulatory recovery for areas that we need to make sure that's a clean transition that occurs, but on its face, the issues that were involved with that for us should be pretty well taken care of. So that's why we're saying it should be a minimal issue for us.  I think it's more of an opportunity for us, because if we're able to and really, if the state focuses on a clean energy economy going forward, that's going to provide us some opportunities to really do this the right way, including nuclear for the -- for our customers going forward."
But if it's not replaced just because we don't know what's going to happen legislatively...,Yeah.
And who knows. How should we think about the potential impact?,"Yeah, so if it's not replaced and it stays the way it is, then we should be ﬁne. Because..."
"I mean, it's repealed and they don't -- they repeal and they don't replace it if you're following...","Okay, so Brian...     Second part. So that -- we'll be ﬁne in that circumstance, Paul. We already had decoupling in place for residential and small commercial customers. We were already getting recovery of OVEC through 2024 through the regulatory process rather than 2030 and it allowed us to enter into bilateral contracts with customers, but we haven't signed any bilaterals to-date. So we think,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   we'll be absolutely ﬁne if it's repealed and not replaced, but as Nick said, I think there are opportunities to do it right and replace it with something that's more positive.     Yeah, we've done bilateral contracts just not with that structure, so."
"Okay, great.",Yeah.
"And then, just on the PJM 205 end-of-life transmission planning and ﬁling. I know you guys are protesting that with almost every other transmission company. Do you have any sense as to what the potential impact would be from a shareholder perspective on transmission CapEx or anything else if that 205 ﬁling is accepted by FERC?","Paul, we think it'd be pretty minimal to us.     Yeah."
"Okay, good. Awesome. Thanks so much.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no other questions in queue. Please go ahead with any closing remarks.
