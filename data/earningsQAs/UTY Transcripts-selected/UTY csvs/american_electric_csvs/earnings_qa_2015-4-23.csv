Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Hi Dan, how are you?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Great thank you.,"Good, good."
"On the Ohio generation conversation you've gotten a little more public as far as your prospective plans for exiting that business. If we thought about kind of a timeline of progression of thought, how much clarity do you guys need to see around RPM or around maybe First Energy's PPA process in Ohio before you feel like you're at a point where you're going to optimize the value of those assets?","Yeah. So certainly we need to see, as I mentioned earlier, the capacity performance. Hopefully, FERC will approve that. We can get on with the capacity auctions. We have some interim auctions as well as a result of that. And then we also have some auctions on the Ohio side that occur in April, May timeframe. So – and then, so that's one set of issues and that's on the right side of the ledger.  On the left side of the ledger is the PPA issue itself. And it sounds like FE is going to be in hearings some in June, July timeframe. So we would want to hear directionally where the Commission is going regarding the PPAs. Obviously, we've got the open door in terms of the last order we received. They said it was legal and we could do the ﬁlings. But we really need some directions in terms of what that means going forward. Now whether that's deﬁned by the FE case or our rehearing or our case remains to be seen. But certainly with the new leadership over at the Ohio Commission, we're hopeful that we can see a more consistent approach to this and make sure we get these orders out quickly so that the market, particularly in Ohio, can understand where we're going next. So those are two big value propositions that we need to get a sense of in this overall process."
"And I guess you guys talked about you're using that money, presumably I guess to go in a transmission investment or back into the utility business. How quickly can you scale CapEx at transmission if you were to get that large amount of sale proceeds back in? Is it a multiyear process to deploy the capital? Or how speedy can you be using that money elsewhere?","Yeah, so with our transmission business, we have a really good speed toward moving projects forward. I mean, we have a whole litany of projects that are ready, willing and able from a capital standpoint. So we're ready from that perspective. But typically, it'll take a couple of years before   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   we start to see the earnings from these facilities to be put in place. So it remains to be seen. It's something we'll have to feel our way through in terms of whether share buybacks, earnout, or something like that in a transaction. Those things are critically important to determine the amount of dilution during that period of time and, obviously, we're trying to mitigate any dilution that could occur during that period. So lot of work going into what the options are – that are available to us. But just know that we are focused on trying to mitigate any type of transition from that respective."
"Got it. Thank you, guys.  Operator  And our next question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.",
"Thanks. Looking at page 15 on the key drivers for the Vertically Integrated Utilities, there's a $31 million favorable in the quarter from decreases in unrecovered PJM charges. Can you both talk us through what that speciﬁcally is? And is that going to annualize or is that sort of related to polar vortex issues?","Greg, this is Brian. Good morning. It was mostly related to the polar vortex issues and it was related to costs associated with reserves and operating expenses at PJM passed through to us in the real time during those polar vortexes that over time and rates we could get reﬂected, but given that it happened in real time and we couldn't get those in rates immediately, we had to eat during 2014."
Great. While we're on the subject of PJM is the deadline for FERC to allow PJM to extend its tariﬀ and hold its capacity auction later in the summer than the current schedule is tomorrow. Is it your expectation that we're going to get an extension?,"Certainly that would be the best outcome. Who knows what FERC will come up with, but I would suspect with the actual operator in terms of the options requesting that because of the disruption that would occur relative to the market itself I think it's probably – it should be a no- brainer, but it remains to be seen. But our expectation – I mean, we would surprised if they didn't at this point."
"I think so would the market, but...   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)",Yeah. Yeah.
"Thank you very much, guys.","Thanks.     Thanks, Greg.  Operator  And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin with UBS. Please go ahead."
Hi. Good morning.,Morning.
"So, perhaps to follow the sales question, can you comment a little bit about the River operations and where you stand on that? And the thought process about that in the context of a regulated mix a little bit?","Yeah. So, as far as River ops is concerned, we obviously announced that we engaged Morgan Stanley to work with us on that process. That process continues and it's another one of our commercial businesses that we're looking at relative to the valuation and disposition of that business. And they're doing a great job and the company is in great shape, but we want to make sure that it ﬁts strategically within the framework that we have going forward. And so that process continues and I really can't say anything more about it at this point in time."
"Do you have a timeframe that you're thinking about though, just broadly?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Well, my view is that that transaction, if it were to occur, certainly has less issues with it in terms of milestones to get through. So I would say that the ease of that transaction is probably very diﬀerent than the rest of the unregulated generation on the commercial side."
"Got it. And then turning to the regulated business here, let's go down south, Arkansas. In terms of Turk, can you comment on the process to address that and kind of avenues for this year?","Yeah, so at this point I mean, SWEPCO is in a situation where the market with natural gas and those types of issues are of legitimate concern. So you want to make sure you can put the best foot forward whenever you do go in for recovery of Turk. And the legislation certainly helped out in terms of bypassing a CCN process and being able to ﬁle part and parcel to a rate case type of environment. So we've got to make sure that from an overall rate case standpoint, that it would make sense to ﬁle in Arkansas, not only in terms of valuation of Turk and be able to put forward a credible case, but also where you stand from an overall spend situation in Arkansas as well. So we're going to have to ﬁgure out the timing of that kind of ﬁling.  Meanwhile, SWEPCO continues to work on other things to reinforce the valuation. We have a large steel customer that's coming online later on this summer, and also we've got several other cases in Louisiana and in Texas with the recovery mechanisms in place there, with formula rates and so forth, and transmission actually true-ups of those kinds of investments. So it's sort of a patch work to ﬁll in until such time we can get Turk in line."
"Gotcha. Excellent. Well, thank you.",Okay.  Operator  And our next question is going to come from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, how are you?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning, Paul."
"Looking at slide seven, just kind of the residential sales were very strong last year, down this year. But this isn't a weather-adjusted slide. Is this just kind of modeling errors on your weather- adjustment because things were so extreme?","Yeah. Paul, we've been debating this one for a quarter now. But it's sort of interesting and I'll give my rendition and, certainly, Brian has a lot deeper information on this. But when I was doing load forecasting early in my career, it was down in Texas and you'd have 45 days of 100- degree weather. And you'd see this thing occur that wind up being a step change in a super peak. And I think it wound up with customers deciding to heck with it, I'm going to turn my air conditioner on in this heat. So you sort of see a step change.  I think you saw the same thing in the polar vortex in 2014 where it's consistently sub-zero for a long period of time and at some point people just sort of decide they want to be comfortable. And so you're sort of measuring a present day versus an anomaly and that sort of drives a skewing of the residential information. That's why I said earlier we want to see how that settles out from quarter-to-quarter going forward so we understand exactly what the steady state aspects of that is. Brian?     Paul, just adding to that a little bit. I think across the industry, we saw weather normalization in residential in the ﬁrst quarter of last year look similar to ours and it looked a little bit out of whack and it sort of normalized over the balance of the year. That's why, as Nick said, the quarter-on-quarter comparison of this year to last year looks kind of negative. We're interested in seeing how the balance of the year ﬂattens out and what that looks like. But really believe last year's ﬁrst quarter weather normalization to be a bit of an anomaly."
"So it's an art, not a science. Okay. And then last year after a very strong ﬁrst quarter, you started to talk about pulling forward some O&M from the forward year. At what point are you comfortable doing that in 2015?","Yeah, Paul, we're starting that process now. Actually, we've already started it. We do have some O&M we've identiﬁed that could be pulled forward, but at the same time it becomes – we can pull $60 million forward last year. So, now you're really getting into areas where okay, can you pull forward from that perspective. So it becomes little bit more diﬃcult so we're having to reach deeper and think really hard about how much we can actually move forward. So that process is continuing and something that we're very mindful of, given that we started the year somewhat ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Is it reluctance to do it until you get a little more of the year under your belt? Or is it just you...,"No. No, I think we've identiﬁed and started that process and we'll continue it on. Now keep in mind, last year, we had a relatively mild summer. So we'll continue looking at the levers and looking at the quarter-by-quarter performance, and we'll make adjustments accordingly, and we've gotten pretty good at that."
Thank you very much.,Yeah.  Operator  And our next question in line will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.
Good morning. Can you hear me?,"Hello, Paul. Yeah, I can hear you."
"Just ﬁrst of all on the trading business, that seemed to be pretty beneﬁcial this quarter, what are the expectations for the year?","Yeah, so we think it's in line with what we previously stated for that business, Paul, there are a couple of things going on there. They continue to do their normal activity. So the trading and marketing that they do, they had a couple of big deals that they got closed in Texas, which were positive for the quarter. But don't forget that when we laid guidance out for 2015, there's about a $0.35 hit associated with changes in capacity revenues in that business. So we think we're on track. We're a little bit skewed towards being ahead for the quarter, but the real drags on that   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   business are going to be the latter half of the year as we experience the fall-oﬀ in capacity revenues."
"And what happened to Texas, I'm sorry if I missed that?","We just – we had some normal ongoing marketing activity that we do down there. And so as we own these businesses, we're going to continue to operate them with an eye towards the long- term. And they were able to renegotiate and change the terms a bit on a couple of contracts that they have down there, which is normal ongoing business for us, but that was beneﬁcial to the quarter."
"Okay. Then in terms of just Ohio, I mean, is everything pretty much is going to be – I mean, obviously, there's all this focus on PUCO and stuﬀ, is there any potential for the Governor or any other sort of direction just sort of come from I guess legislative or the executive branch in terms of the direction that the state wants to go into? Or is it really just going to be something that PUCO is going to be sort of wrestling with on its own? Any thoughts about that?","I think for the time being it's going to be centered at the Commission because Andre Porter has moved over as Chairman. He previously was involved with the deregulation that occurred some three years ago, and so he knows and understands the issues and also hopefully understands the lessons that have been learned since then as well. And I think he and the Commission under his leadership will continue to provide direction, but also consistency and get these orders done. He has also brought on a new chief of staﬀ, which we have certainly met and he appears to be very, very professional about what he's doing as well. So I think with some sense of consistency around leadership and in terms of direction associated with the staﬀ itself, at least I'm hopeful that things will start moving pretty expeditiously in Ohio."
"Okay. And then just ﬁnally, you see this issue between PJM and MISO, there's been some activity in it and I think there's been sort of push on the part of FERC to move things along. Do you guys see any signiﬁcant impact from that positive or negative? I mean, you guys are sort of in diﬀerent areas there and, of course, we've got questions about what's going to happen with the merchant sector anyway. But anything we should be thinking about with respect to that and how it might impact your merchant plans?","No. I don't think we see much impact from our perspective. And as far as MISO is concerned, I mean, one thing is for sure, they really need to start thinking – PJM and MISO need to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   administer that contract they have with each other from an operational standpoint. I know there's been issues that have come up relative to how they actually administer the ﬂows over the lines. But I think as far as we're concerned though, we're in pretty decent shape."
Okay. Great. Thanks so much.  Operator  And our next question will come from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.,
Hi. Good morning. Just a quick one.,Morning.
"On the 4% to 6% EPS CAGR growth rate outlook. In general, is there a Brent crude oil price environment that you're thinking about when you reaﬃrm that guidance. I realize these things are sort of probabilistic, but it would be helpful to know if you've got an oil price in line?","No, certainly we haven't gotten down into the fundamentals that much, but from our perspective it's really around natural gas pricing. And as far as oil pricing is concerned, it's a measure of how much the rig count changes. And – but that's reﬂected in natural gas as well. So from our perspective, we continue to look at least our factors relative to the industrial mix that we have and the impact of energy prices because even low oil prices can reﬂect well in the economy that we serve. And so, we have sort of a natural hedge going on here where oil and gas pricing has beneﬁted some counties with shale gas production and that kind of thing. But on the other hand, low natural gas prices have helped chemical manufacturer, car manufacturing and so forth. Brian, do you have something you want to add?     No, that last point that got – kind of nailed it in my mind, Nick, in that we do have that natural hedge going on and we see things like transportation, equipment manufacturing is positively impacted by the low oil and gas pricing. So where we see some delays or closures in terms of economic expansion, we also see some expansions going on and those things to-date have really oﬀset one another."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Appreciate it. Thank you.,Thanks.     Thank you.  Operator  And the next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, guys. I have a question on slide six on I guess in three of the business segments. You guys had some cost-cutting error or some cost management where O&M was or operating costs were a positive driver. I mean, how much more can we expect of that going forward? Or is this more of a timing issue?","Some of it's timing, but overall, you'll continue to see O&M continue to be consistent from the perspective of ensuring that we mitigate any increases, because obviously you have overheads, salaries, those kinds of things continue to go up. But we're mitigating that in many respects from an O&M perspective. So our O&M stack continues to be relatively consistent from year-to- year. We expect that to happen. So Brian, you have (46:28)...     Yeah. Anthony, we've worked really hard to keep that O&M ﬂat to down over the last several years. And then looking out into 2016 as we have this capacity revenue challenges in that year, we're very, very focused on keeping O&M in a very tight range. We've been able to keep it in that $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range, even with some of the natural increases that you'd expect that we'd have associated with things like our transmission expansion. So the Lean activities that Nick talked about have us very focused on O&M, keeping it ﬂat to down over the long-term. And what you see on slide six is what you should anticipate seeing going forward as well.     So I think it may be a part of both, but keep in mind that there'll be a consistent view toward that perspective."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. And just lastly, I know you've probably spoken ad nauseam of it, just the unregulated generation in Ohio. If I understand correctly, before any decisions made on how AEP handles it, you want some clarity on the capacity performance auction and also the Ohio PPA process, is that accurate?",Yes. That's accurate.
"Great, thank you so much for taking my questions.  Operator  And our next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust.",
Thank you.,"Good morning, Ali."
Good morning. How are you?,"Fine, ﬁne."
"Just listening in to the commentary and from the results as well, is it fair to assume that ﬁrst quarter puts you somewhat ahead of budget? Obviously, it's very early in the year. And if so, how much cushion is there for you right now? You talked about pulling forward some expenses. Is there any way to quantify how much cushion you have as we look for the rest of the year?","I think we have enough cushion to be comfortable with starting to take steps on and being more aggressive about what we do relative to moving O&M up and doing other things to reinforce the issues that we have in 2016. So just as with last year where we got ahead, we'll be looking at taking additional steps and we'll manage that from quarter-to-quarter.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So in this case though, I think you have a quarter where certainly it looks – it's really positive. But you sort of have a diﬀerent set of underlying factors to consider like last year at this point in time there really wasn't much of a rate stack to ﬁll in or anything like that. And this time there's some larger swings that can occur. So I'd say overall, we're very conﬁdent about our ability to aggressively pursue in a positive way. I mean, obviously it's a better problem to have than if it was on the down side. So we feel good about where we're at.     Ali, you kind of come to expect from us over the years that we're going to manage our way through a year and across years and that's exactly what we're doing. So, the guidance that we laid out we're still comfortably within that guidance for the year. And as the year goes on depending on what happens with earnings and cash ﬂows and the like, you're going to see us managing our way to stay in a range that puts us in that guidance and then within that 4% to 6% growth range that we've talked about over several years."
"Okay, got it. And also just to clarify another point on the merchant. In the past, Nick, you've been fairly consistent that you expected to reach a resolution over the summer timeframe. And we've talked about some things getting pushed back. Even if the PJM capacity gets pushed back, I think they're still talking June through August, so I guess technically still in the summer while the PPA rider maybe further down the road. So, is summer time still what we should think about? Or how should we think about given some of these delays and some of these milestones?","Yeah, I think it's diﬃcult to tell at this point because obviously PJM is trying to push aggressively to get the auction done as quickly as possible. So, if we hit early summer and that kind of thing. And then the previous questioner obviously was asking somewhat the same thing. From the Ohio perspective, we just need to know directionally what Ohio is going to do. So, whether that comes from our re-hearing or FEs PPA case or ultimately our larger PPA case, we just need to understand what that sense of direction is going to be. And so, I'm not going to say it's going to fall back at this point from a decisional process. Certainly, the delay takes away some of the wiggle room that you had for the summer. But it's really hard to say at this point, and we'll have to keep our ear close to the ground in terms of what FERC is doing and what the Ohio Commission is doing to resolve that issue. But I guess my main point is that we've gone through the analysis. Our board had been involved every step of the way. So our reaction time is very minimal at this point. We just need the factual information."
"All right. And one last quick question. In your longer-term transmission growth slide that you've shared with us, you've had higher growth case scenarios, particularly for 2016 and 2017 that are fairly meaningfully higher than base scenarios. Any of those projects yet that have moved into base as we look into 2016, 2017 outlook?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Not in that timeframe. We've been able to ﬁll in some of the gap in 2015 so far. But, Ali, as you look at some of the earlier questions that we got, if there are going to be transactions in terms of use of proceeds, that's primarily where we'd be focused on ﬁlling in the gaps."
Got it. Got it. Thank you.,"Thanks.  Operator  And our next question...     I mean, our focus is really on 2016 and the issues around that because we certainly want to give some sense of continuous improvement in terms of earnings and be able to really approach that in the right way. So 2017 and 2018 and beyond, we'll probably have more color on that by the time EEI rolls around in November.  Operator  And our next question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs."
"Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start of the year.","Thanks, Michael."
"When we think about last year, you had a great ﬁrst quarter and you talked about moving some O&M into 2014. And you've talked a little bit about doing it this year, although sounds like there's not as much wiggle room there. But one of the other things you did last year is you moved up a couple of hundred million dollars of transmission spend into 2014 or you raised your transmission CapEx view for prompt year. Just curious whether you're likely to do the same thing this year, given such a strong or healthy start to the year?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Michael, a couple of things on that. One is we had about a $200 million planned and funded to higher transmission spend. We've been able to move dollars out of other CapEx buckets that we've had into transmission, and that includes both the Transmission Holdco and the Vertically Integrated Utilities transmission spend. So of that $200 million, we've been able to fund about $80 million of that. And then, just on the prior question from Ali, if there are to be proceeds from transactions that might happen later this year, the primary place for that to go would be the transmission spend."
"Yeah, and I'm just thinking outside of transactions because that's kind of bigger dollars versus where I'm focused here. I didn't know if you're making another increase to expected transmission spend given a strong ﬁrst quarter 2015, similar to like what you did in the ﬁrst quarter of 2014?","Not at this point...     Not at this point. No. But just know that we continue to advance our transmission spend and if conditions wind up that way, we'll be happy to do it."
"Got it. And because when I start looking, Brian, at the balance sheet and kind of your capitalization ratios, they're getting pretty healthy. They've been getting healthy for the last couple of years, but they're now reaching I think your FFO to debt is on a percentage wise getting at or even better than some of your targets. Just curious about when the health of the balance sheet, regardless of having had such a strong ﬁrst quarter, enables you to deploy more capital into transmission maybe a little bit earlier than you thought?","It's a very good point there, Michael. I think the CapEx that we spent last year, the $4.4 billion that we spent this year were predicated on those improving credit metrics. Again, if we were to change the portfolio of businesses that we have, we think we'd have even more balance sheet capacity. I think you saw Duke get an upgrade on the sale of its competitive generation business. We would expect similar actions by the rating agencies if we were to transact going forward, which would give us even more balance sheet capacity. And if and when those things happen, you know where we're going to be spending those dollars. It's going to be on that transmission growth story that we have going on."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. Last question just thinking about transmission, we've seen some changes come out of the FERC regarding transmission ROEs. We've seen a multitude of cases in other RTOs in the Midwest ISO and in ISO New England. We haven't seen a lot of activity regarding that in PJM. Just curious for your view on kind of why PJM is one of the few regions where we haven't seen a lot of Section 206 type cases for FERC ROEs.","I think you haven't seen ROEs out of the realm of the reasonableness. So there is a bandwidth for that. And certainly I see FERC continuing to encourage the investment in transmission. And so you see some of these one-oﬀ type of cases and they have their own situations whether it's their RTO premium, that kind of thing. And when you look at the aggregated total from an ROE perspective, we're still within the range of reasonableness comfortably. So we don't expect much change from our perspective."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.","Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Thank you. And that'll come from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie Research."
"Thank you very much. So I have two questions again about the merchant power business. So just so we're clear, assuming that the capacity auction clears at strong levels, would that be bullish indicators for a possibility of PPAs in Ohio, in a sense that that would allow you guys to prove that those PPAs would be beneﬁcial to rate payers?","Angie, you bring up a great point and certainly one that we think about a lot, because there's two sides of the equation that are working here. And as you talk about PJM and what FERC could do and the capacity auctions. If the capacity auctions improve considerably, then that may in fact have a negative impact on the ability for PPAs. And I'm saying negative from our perspective because the market is saying the value of that capacity is going up considerably.  So you look at what Ohio is doing and Ohio looks like a long-term PPA customer to us. And typically, long-term PPA customers will enter into contracts when prices are lower so that they can lock in value for customers in the future. And my concern is, is if the market continues to increase considerably that we'll be looking at investors saying: well, why are you entering into PPAs with a market going up considerably and that'll be a problem for us.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So I think the Ohio Commission and the state of Ohio really needs to think about that in terms of the long term stability of Ohio and where it's placed in the market right now because we've demonstrated that the PPAs are a beneﬁt to customers over the long-term. And so a decision needs to be made. So to me, I think in some cases the race is on, and we've got to get this resolved."
"Okay. And secondly, assuming that you do sign those PPAs for 2,700 megawatts and that – or similar things happened to FirstEnergy's assets and potentially other diversiﬁed utilities in the state, so how do you think those PPAs are going to impact the value of the remaining 5,000 megawatts that you will be planning to sell on an auction basis?","Yeah, so the units that are placed in the 2,700 megawatts, they're ones that – or still ﬁt well in the market, but they're probably the most at risk. And Ohio has to look at that from, we want to keep the generation, we want to keep it running, we want to keep the taxes, the jobs, but they're still a beneﬁt to customers. So the other generation will continue to ﬁt very well into the market. And then from the PPA perspective of generation ﬂeet itself, if it's approved the way we presented it with a long-term approach that's essentially life of plant and those kinds of things, it becomes somewhat neutral because you have a situation there where it is quasi-regulated.  So I think it could wind up being a really good ﬁt because you would have the certainty around a portion of the portfolio in Ohio and then Ohio could still take advantage of any market ﬂuctuations that may occur, just like we do with any other portfolio we have. There's a ﬁxed portion. There's a variable portion. And I think that's ultimately best for customers, just like we do fuel."
