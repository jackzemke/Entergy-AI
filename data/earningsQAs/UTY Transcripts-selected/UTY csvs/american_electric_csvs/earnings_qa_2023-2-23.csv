Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning guys.",Good morning.
"So, couple of quick ones to share. Looking at just the West Virginia fuel cost recovery. Hearings will obviously held in 4Q and there was discussion about moving to quarterly time periods as well as securitization. I guess, can you give us maybe an update on how you're looking at the situation where we might be headed from here?  There's a lot of moving pieces. I guess, so how is the dialogue going, and sort of any sense of bill impact ranges, especially with the recent gas price collapse?","Yeah, so appreciate the question because it assures, I'm sure you can imagine, absolutely top- of-mind for us and as Ann mentioned in her comments top-of-mind from a CFO perspective, most deﬁnitely. As you know, we did get an order, the staﬀ is going through its paces. As we got to work through the prudency review and in the background, what's playing is, legislation that could potentially accommodate securitization of the dollars we have outstanding are deferred   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   fuel balance in West Virginia is $520 million. So it's not insigniﬁcant and it's extremely important to be able to digest this in a way that can accommodate customer rates.  So we're hoping that we'll be able to be in a position, we'll be able to utilize the securitization legislation if approved, to be able to smooth this out and take care of customer needs in terms of the bill impact. Ann (Technical Diﬃculty) do you have any other thoughts on that and how we might do that?     Yeah, no, it's absolutely right, easily utilizing the securitization allows us to spread it out over time and minimize actually keep our customer rates relatively ﬂat, which is really the intention."
Got it.,Now this will take some time. It will be eﬀective in June and we need a commission order. So we would expect the securitization to take place in the ﬁrst half of 2024.
"Got it, okay, perfect. And then just lastly on the ﬁnancing needs. Obviously, we've noticed that you now include both the $1.2 billion expected cash proceeds from Kentucky as well as I think for the ﬁrst time we expected $1.2 billion from the contracted renewable sale. I guess looking at the sources and uses why wait to update your funding needs on the equity side, especially if you're including the proceeds already is joining, we should be thinking about here.","No hidden message there all Shar. We want to make sure that we get both of these transactions in the bag, get them taken care of, and then we'll recalibrate. As you know, our objective is twofold. We want to make sure we have a strong balance sheet, because we don't want anybody worried about any dilutive otherwise actions that we would have to take. So that's ﬁrst and foremost, so top-of-mind for us is, is making sure that balance sheet is in check.  And as you know, we put out a target goal for FFO-to-debt of 14% to 15%. That being said, to the extent that we will then be able to eliminate future equity needs. We don't have a signiﬁcant amount of equity ﬁnancing. When you look out over the horizon, but if we're able to kind of call that back a little bit and still hit the objective on the strong balance sheet will absolutely do that.  So no hidden message obviously both of these are moving along contracted renewables, new for us. We know that that will close-in in the second quarter. We believe that's the plan to close- in in the second quarter. And as you know, Kentucky, it's pending with -- it's two or three applications. So stay tuned.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We just want to make sure that we got this completely right for you all and that you're not concerned."
"Fantastic. Guys, congrats on the execution. Appreciate it.","Thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead."
"Hi, good morning.",Hey Jeremy.
"Just wanted to pivot towards the retail business a little bit. And if you could just go back, I guess a little bit how that process stands at this point. Just wondering any thoughts there would be considered here of why that would remain in the portfolio or might prevent you from selling it? And just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more color of what's in that business, EBITDA, earnings or anything else to wrap our heads around there?","Yeah, absolutely. And I love the question because that's exactly what we're doing in our house right now. We're going through the places to determine exactly does it ﬁt -- if there's anything that does ﬁt, what does that look like. So stay tuned. That will be a ﬁrst-half story for AEP. So expect us to be coming to you probably in the second quarter with a little more granular detail because we're literally going through that analysis now and working with the troops to make sure we have that ﬁnely tuned, so we can get back out to you. As far as quantifying how big is this business and what does it mean currently to AEP, the net asset position or I guess equity position, if you strip out the liabilities. We're talking about $193 million, the vast majority of that is working capital to the tune of about $150 million of 193 and the rest is largely IT software and then we have a little smidge of goodwill in there of about $15 million. To give you some parameters.  And then I would think about what does that mean from an EPS perspective. In 2022, this retail business contributed $0.05 of EPS. And in 2023, we have $0.04 embedded in our guidance.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thinking of that goalpost, hopefully that helps."
That's very helpful. And just going back to the renewables sale here. Was there an EBITDA number that you might be able to share with us or have shared on that?,"We haven't disclosed an EBITDA number, I can tell you that in our guidance for 2023, we're looking at a penny that renewable business contributed. I think it was $0.08, does that sound right, Ann? Yeah, $0.08 in 2022 to give you those parameters."
"Got it. That's helpful. And just one last one if I could, touching on what Shar was talking about fuel balances. What have you and I guess diﬀerent moving pieces here. Getting back to what the agencies are looking at, how should we think about the cadence of fuel balanced normalizing any other items as we get to the 14% to 15% FFO to debt target range by year-end '23 I think?","That's right. We expect to get our up to the -- to get the ball between the upgrades in the last part of the year, we do expect to have a little bit of pressure in the front end. As we continue to work through some of the fuel balances. As I mentioned, when you look at West Virginia standalone, it's about $520 million. That sounds right, Ann?     Yeah, $520 million. And as I mentioned, the securitization of that will take some time. So likely won't be done by the end of this year. But in terms of our other fuel balances in other jurisdictions, we have positive mechanisms to recover that. And also natural gas and power prices are declining, so that will help them."
"Got it, very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Okay, thank you.  Operator  And next, we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks. So just a similar question on the deferred fuel. If you just looked at the year-end number on FFO to debt. How much do you think deferred fuel represents in terms of that impact that's lowering that number? Given like FFO to debt.","Yeah. So we're at 13.2% as of year end. And so if we get above that 14% ish range by year-end of 2023, I don't know that looks about -- I don't say entirely 100 basis points, but it's pretty signiﬁcant. (Multiple Speakers)     Yeah. I think it might be a little bit from 100 basis (Multiple Speakers) when you think about it, we had $1.7 billion deferred through our full year."
"Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.",You bet.
"And then. Just on the ROE improvement. So the 9.4 in this year's guidance, is it --there any states that are really driving a lot of that and are there any states that still kind of the most room to go after '23?","Yeah. So here's what I'll draw your attention to and I know we have the little equalizer chart here in the slide deck somewhere. I think it's on page number 41. And so you can get a sense of kind of where we are hanging out on each of the respective operating Company entities. But what we do have in play right now is it it PSO's Oklahoma. We have a base case underway. So that should help us to begin to heal the ROE -- the earned ROE at PSO, so stay tuned for that. So base case in-play there.  And then as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we recently were able to ﬁnalize our Louisiana base case and then reactivate this formula rate plan. So that will get underway to again to help move SWEPCo's ROE back up closer to its authorized levels. Kentucky, obviously, you know what we're doing with Kentucky and APCo. I think, APCo -- that's why the legislation, Virginia become so important to us because we're in an under-earning position right now. We got the outcome of the Virginia triennial case which should be beneﬁcial to us in 2023, but I would still expect APCo's ROE to be under pressure until we get hopefully some resolution around   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Virginia legislation that -- to the extent that we're able to modify the regulatory recovery methods that are being employed in that particular state. We'll begin to see some healing on that particular ROE to sell our triennial versus biennial AEP is going to lean more toward a biennial or an annual type look versus -- that triennial can push anything us in an under-earning position. So stay tuned, we'll see how the Virginia legislation process moved along.  Our team is absolutely at the table with all the other stakeholders. So that sounds constructive. So we're hopeful and we'll see this developing situation through and then we would expect something to be in the improvement territory for APCo."
"Just for clarity on that last point. In Virginia, why there is -- what are the things that would help you in Virginia laws, will it go into the biannual? so I don't want to go so far between cases or something else?","Anything shorter. Steve is going to be better for us. So that will move us in a more productive situation or direction for APCo in particular. I mean in annual rate will be ﬁne too. But again, you can see the direction, so that'll be important for us as we worked through the diﬀerent solutions that are being contemplated now because. I know we have -- I think bills that are being evaluated or shopped in Virginia. But as I mentioned AEP is absolutely at the table and we'll see how this ultimately shakes out. Obviously, the beneﬁt needs to go to the customers, but then also our investors as we work to improve the ROE."
"Okay, great, thank you.","Thanks, Steve.  Operator  And next, we can go to Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead."
"Hey team. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess just very clear from the ﬁlings that have been made so far on the Kentucky transaction that the parties are committed here and you're working towards closing what is somewhat of a tight deadline. Can you just kind of give us a sense, how that changes if your funding strategy changes at all at this deal wanted to go through and how overall kind of change your strategy if it went there? Thank you.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. Nick, I still appreciate the question and I'll let Ann jump in here in a second on what our thoughts are on funding, but I have before -- I do that I have to say, we're committed to the transaction. I know you point that out. And I know we do have a tight timeline that's precisely why I think that out there in my opening comments, the objective is to, I'll say, push for the take because I know we've got that April 26th, but importantly. I mean you guys have this takeaway, both the AEP and Algonquin team members continue to have a regular dialogue and work closely together, so we're all-in and we'll continue to push to try to do this as expeditiously as possible, but I think we're also in a good position from a ﬁnancing perspective. Ann, can you talk a little bit (Multiple Speakers)?     Yeah, absolutely. So, I mean, should Kentucky not well -- as we would expect to keep our equity needs the same, so no new equity if that happened. We'll just be managing our FFO-to-debt as tightly as possible and don't expect any changes."
"Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that and then I guess, just I know we've talked a lot about deferred fuel but we noticed that the CFO is slightly depressed in '23 versus kind of what you outlined at the Analyst Day, and I think you're making up for that in the back part of the plan, but is that purely just deferred fuel impacts or is there something else fundamental there? That would be helpful.","There's really two main drivers just deferred fuel is the biggest piece, but the other piece is, we've had some return of collateral from a mark-to-market, due to the reduction in natural gas and power prices impacted that as well."
I appreciate the time today and thanks.,"Thanks for the question.  Operator  And next, we will go to (Inaudible) with UBS. Please go ahead.     Hey, Bill."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hi, good morning. Just going back to the Kentucky sale. I know you said that the -- providing for a 45-day comment period. So that was -- look like it was going to be supportive of maybe an expedited rolling, but will we get further indications from FERC, if they will rule an expedited manner or we have to wait-and-see?","Yes, so the next stating item for us is March 31, that ends the commentary period and we'll just proceed from there. We know the other backdrop for us -- backstop for us, as I mentioned in my comments in the April 26th date, so that's top-of-mind for us as well. But here's where.  I continue to go in my mind, none of the beneﬁts yet to the customer until we close the transaction, you don't start them in advance, so that's incredibly important and I think we've got everyone's attention.  And the other thing that we were particularly sensitive to and I know Darcy pressure this with you if you called in the interim here, but we really made an eﬀort to take this blueprint to make sure that we were accommodating or addressing the concerns that FERC voiced as it relates to taking care of customers and making sure there's no harm.  And as a matter of fact, if you look at the application, I think we're going pre through the neutral three application and pretty granular form. I think it's Pages four, ﬁve and six clearly I've run this a few times, take a look at that if you want to get a better sense of what the parties have come up with to be able to take care of the customers in the State of Kentucky and speciﬁcally Kentucky Powers footprint.  So I think everybody is going to be working on an expedited basis and schedule, and clearly, we very much appreciated the Shortened Comment Period, because I do think it's indicative. So we'll continue to work through it and rest assured that both the AEP and Algonquin team members will continue to be in regular contact with one another. Because at this point, we're partners and all this."
"Okay now, that's very helpful and then I guess what happens if we get to the April 26th date and we don't have a decision to work -- it will be extended or...","Excellent question here how I can answer that I mentioned that the teams are in constant contact and regular contact. I would expect that as we get closer to that date, the teams, I'm talking speciﬁcally about this, so stay tuned."
"Okay, great, thanks very much.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, you bet. Thanks for being on today.  Operator  And excuse me. Next, we'll go to (Inaudible) with Evercore. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Just ﬁrst quick clariﬁcation the -- I think you mentioned $0.08 for the renewables business EPS. That's just half year, right?. So that's what's embedded in the guidance in the full-year earnings are double that to $0.16, right?","No, $0.08 is last year, so the 2022 EPS from renewables, as we mentioned for 2023, we expect that to be one."
Got it So that's a full-year contribution for 2022.,"That's correct. Yeah, $0.08 for 2022 and one cent for 2023. And so the way I would characterize it, and I think that's how we had in the press release, neutral to maybe slightly dilutive to the tune of penny. So, I'm from my chair, I'm not worried about it."
"Got it, okay. And then just again. I want to go back to the sort of the ﬁnancing slide. Can you just updated thoughts on use of proceeds here clearly the renewable sale is on-track and you get $1.2 billion in cash. So how should we think about the use of proceeds? Should that at least eliminate equity for 2024?","(Multiple Speakers) if you want to take that.     I have a little bit of a cold. No, right now we are not going to reduce any equity in the outer years. But as Julie mentioned, once we close the Kentucky transaction, the Railroad's transaction, we're going to re-evaluate and see whether or not we can responsibly take out equity in the future, while keeping in mind and having a strong balance sheet.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"I understood. I appreciate that guys, thanks for the time and look-forward to working with you.","Thanks so much.  Operator  And next, we can go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead."
"Great. So I guess the ﬁrst question. Right now, the sales proceeds from the two transactions actually are in excess of the equity that you had identiﬁed last year. So we should assume though that the sales proceeds don't eliminate your equity needs, they just reduce it, is that -- is that a fair characterization?","I think that's a fair characterization. And just as a reminder, because Ann wasn't here when we made these announcements last year. But Paul, you may remember, we took out of the 2022 plan, $1.4 billion of equity, because we assume that the Kentucky transaction would have closed, we never put that equity back in.  And so right now, we're just kind of waiting to have that particular transaction close. And then we introduced the contracted renewables transaction on top of that, so what you see today is versus what we originally had planned, we had already stripped out $1.4 billion of equity. So, that's already assumed in this plan versus what we originally had when we announced Kentucky.  And so as Ann mentioned what you should anticipate is, we've already assumed all the proceeds from these, but both of these transactions are assumed in the multiyear forecast, you have on page 39, and that once we close on both of them. We like cash we like cash coming in the door. So once we close on those, we'll be able to recalibrate to make sure we're doing hitting two objectives. Number one, make sure that we're getting to that 14% to 15% FFO-to- debt and then being able to tweak meaning otherwise translation reduce any of those equity needs in those future period.  So I don't anticipate us just wiping all of that out, because we've already assumed the Kentucky utilization was in there, but we may have some wiggle room here to take some additional dollars out in terms of equity once we close on the transactions. And so no hidden message there, we're just waiting until we have dollars and we'll be right back to yet to be able to take some of those equity needs out, assuming we can get the metrics that we need to hit from a FFO-to-debt perspective and I think we can do it.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Great. And then moving to Virginia. You guys where there is a bill. I think that's under consideration SB 1075. Would you expect that to survive come out a conference and ultimately be adopted or I guess, what's your thought process on what will happen in Virginia?","Yeah. So here's what I have. I have that SB 1075 was amended in the house. And then when it was transitioned to a biennial and then we're continuing to work with our legislators and governors to reach some consensus on the language. And if this does pass, what you should anticipate is that AEP or APCo would ﬁle its last triennial in 2023 and that would cover the periods, 2020 through 2022, so we'll see if we can get this across the goal line.  I know we've got some other competing bills or legislation that is being proposed as well. Also looks like a biannual situation."
Great. And can you break-out for 2022 just contribution from generation.,"From all of our generating assets, the generation (Multiple Speakers)"
"(Multiple Speakers) the merchant. In other words, the merchant generation contribution in 2022.","Yeah, I can give you the renewable part that was $0.08. I have that oﬀ the top of my head I can give you the retail -- so I'm going to work a little bit backwards. I can give you the retail piece of the business and that's not the generation component, so that was $0.05, so then you've got, what $0.13 [ph] there of the total earned.  We can circle back with you, Paul and get you that number (Multiple Speakers)"
"That would be great. And maybe the last question from me. The income tax changes and other in -- Corporate and Other, can you maybe give a little ﬂavor as to what drove those?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   One second they don't have that (Inaudible) me.     Yeah, so the income tax, there is a little bit of geography here with respect to the parent company loss. That's driving that impact and then. The other is just a lot of very small items that I wanted together."
