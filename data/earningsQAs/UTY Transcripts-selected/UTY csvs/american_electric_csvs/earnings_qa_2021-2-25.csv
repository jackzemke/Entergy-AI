Question,Answer
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning guys.,Good morning.
"Good morning. Just a couple questions. Just a couple of quick questions here, just on the Ohio settlement. It seems like you've been kind of close to a resolution for some time now would sort of the procedural schedule being paused to make room for continued dialog. Is there sort of any pushes and takes we should be sort of thinking about at this juncture. I use the noise in this state at all impacting the conversations?","No -- there's a no impact there. We continue in discussions with the parties and if -- the typical issues of distribution riders and ROEs and that kind of thing, so nothing unusual and like I said, I think some discussions are going positively and the parties continue to engage with one another, and we all know we have March 4th, and I think that could actually be two or three days diﬀerent as well. But nevertheless -- everyone's focused on getting it concluded."
"Excellent, and then just -- under the Racine hydro sale, obviously, had an immaterial impact to sort of the ﬁnancing plan, but it does sort of show kind of your desire to focus on the core business. So how are you sort of thinking about further acid optimization that could potentially oﬀset, some of the equity needs related to North Central, whether we're thinking about a full utility transaction with an underperforming asset for instance or a partial transaction may be similar to The Duke GIC deal, any sort of any sort of updated thoughts here on incremental opportunities you're seeing in the near term?","Yes, there's a lot of creative ways obviously and Duke showed one of those. But there's others as well. Yes, we'll continue to look at all of our assets actually. And as I mentioned in the call, the time for half measures and talk is over. So we've got to get about the process of ensuring that we're making the way to move to that clean energy future. That means we're going to have to make sure that we're rotating capital eﬀectively and dealing with assets from an optimization standpoint in an eﬀective fashion going forward. So that is the prime motivation for us, particularly with maintaining our balance sheet structure the way it is. We want to make absolutely sure that we manage this process actively in all of those ways, so that's why Brian is over in the strategy area to focus on some of these activities as well. So we'll continue that approach and you'll see more to come."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. That's helpful and lastly for me, just on walk forward to and perky, any sort of additional thoughts there on the replacement generation and potentially what the implications could be sort of this ﬁve-year capital plan you presented this morning? Thanks.","Yes, so, the 3300 megawatts is an incremental 2400 megawatts of what we had before and some of that is related to perky obviously, we got our Rockport that's still yet to come. So there's still plenty of analysis getting done of all of our operating jurisdictions, and that's what I've talked about before where we'll come out with our plans, which will be reﬂected in our integrated resource plans and that would accommodate Rockport in any of the other measures that we have in place the mood to that cleaner energy future. So you'll see that, but like I said by the time we get to the ﬁrst quarter earnings call or before."
"Got it. Congrats, and I'll jump back in the queue. Great execution.","Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. And your line is open.     Good morning, Steve."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks. So just I guess ﬁrst question in terms of the 2021 guidance increase. If you go back to the segments, I think EI [ph] I think a lot of it is in the corporate another segment. Could you just clarify better like what's driving that?","Ye, so -- in 2020 that corporate and other investments, there were some tax-related issues around the tax provisions that were put in place relative to COVID. And then also there was some investment returns that were actually around -- we had -- we were an early investor in ChargePoint and certainly we had some opportunities there to monetize by the end of the year. And there were warrants that we held. So we continue to invest in diﬀerent technologies. We have investments that have gone positively, we've had investments that have gone negatively. And this is -- this happened to be a year where it was positive from an investment standpoint.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, -- but from an ongoing perspective it really is not so much driven not there still is some investment related activity that bleeds over into '21, but I'd say the story of '21 is when we had November, yes, we didn't know exactly where load was going. Didn't know where the economy was going or feeling much better about that and the progress in 2021 and also our Achieving Excellence program. We continue to advance in a very positive away from that perspective. So we feel like -- we felt certainly the conﬁdence level was much more for us to raise guidance. But also continue to encourage that will be in the upper half of that guidance range.     And Steve, this is Julie the items that we're calling out here, obviously, we're much more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and speciﬁcally as it relates to an investment gain in some income tax items et cetera, and if you if you look at Page 31 in the slide presentation, you can look again at that full year of view 2020 actual versus 2021 projected or revised projection. And you'll see that we still have a little bit of an investment gain associated with ChargePoint in that particular column around corporate and other. And then we'll have a little bit of pick up on the O&M front and oﬀsetting this is going to be some increased interest expense largely due to continuing to fund the investment program. So we have slightly higher long-term debt balances out there."
"Okay. Just to clarify, because I just want to yes --",Go ahead.
Yes. I was just looking at the guidance you gave at EI for 2021 and then the guidance that you're giving now for 2021 and I think the corporate another is $0.08 better. So it sounds like that's mainly due to mix of interest savings and then the ChargePoint gains or some other things continuing?,"As well as some O&M pick up. Yes, improvement I should say."
"That shows up in the -- okay, and that's in the corporate segment.","Yes. Bingo [ph]. Yes, ﬁrst is what we showed you in the EI. Yes.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Okay. Super helpful. And then one other question just on the SWEPCO new renewable megawatts. Do you have a sense how much of those you are going to be able to own or those all are owned or some of those maybe PPA? Or how do we know -- the mix that --,"We would certainly like to own as much of that as possible, because I think, it's really important from a capital structure perspective and these companies to be well funded and have a ﬁrm foundation within the states we serve, we feel like that these generation resources particularly the renewable resources need to be vested within the operating company. So we'll continue that approach and that those are the followings that will make and obviously some portion of it may wind up being PAA's, but I think we have to get their message across that it's important to the vitality of the operating companies and the operating utilities in these states that we continue to ﬂourish from a capital standpoint.  And so I think obviously too, the weather events and SPP demonstrate that and I'm going to be probably testifying again on this pretty soon. But I really think it's important for the utility to have a view of what generation looks like in these particular events and the interaction and interoperability of these resources with the transmission and distribution system is incredibly important. I started my career and as a electrical engineer and system operations, and I went to an ice storm in actually, I'll tell my age now, it's been 1984. But mills were tripping with coal, top line was freezing, valves were freezing, all these activities were occurring. And it was our ability to re-dispatch and utilize the ties and those kinds of things there were important for us to be able to manage through that crisis. And that's why I think it's important for there to be control features in place and from an ownership perspective be able to focus on ensuring those beneﬁts for our customers.  You look at even some of the coal-ﬁred generation that was in place that mitigated some of the impact from a fuel cost perspective going forward with natural gas prices going up so much. So there's a reason for each part of the portfolio and I think it's important for the utility to be the party that runs those particular facilities. So that's my view and certainly will go into these cases with a ﬁrm view toward that."
Great. Thank you so much. Take Care.,Thank you  Operator  Thank you. Our Next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. And your line is open.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning. How are you?
"Good, good. Just want to start oﬀ with on O&M if I could just want to see what you guys are seeing there, because it seems like it's a nice little step down even versus what you guys had EEI there? And just wondering if you could provide a bit more color what you see now versus then in really the durability of those savings as you think about 2022 plus just sticking around all these cost savings that you're pulling out?","Yes. This is Julie. Thanks so much for the question. Yes, O&M was a nice beneﬁt to us in 2020. And we're going to try to hang on to as much of that may be a little bit more for 2021 as you can see in our forecast. So the things that we're looking to would be things that are not only one time in nature, but then obviously sustainable and try to take the learnings that we were able to glean from the pandemic really, and how we had to operate in diﬀerent ways. So things that were talking about include things like data analytics, automation, digital tools, drone usage, outsourcing, workforce force planning, and then other related items essentially those types of things that I mentioned in my kind of preamble the beginning of the call here so reducing non- essential travel and training. I mean we've been able to be very successful in a virtual format, so that actually brings a fair amount of cost savings into the pocket as well, reduce materials and supplies to the extent that we can continue to reign in on advertising minimizing over time et cetera. So we're looking at this from more of the sustainability or sustainable perspective and we'll see what else we can kind of pull out of the hat in terms of additional earnings as we go forward.  So it's a little bit of everything so I can't particularly point you to one thing. In fact, it's a variety of the entire team pulling together to be able to make this test come to fruition in the track records there we've been able to do it. So we're going to continue to turn the crank."
That's very helpful. Thanks and maybe just pivoting over towards the renewables. I think you mentioned 10 gigawatts of wind and solar generation in regulate states by 2030 looking to add there and just wondering if you could provide a bit more color and where you think that could fall out jurisdiction. Why's it seems like SWEPCO has a good focus here. Just wondering where else you might be seeing the potential over that time frame?,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. That's a number that continues to be in play. Obviously we originally had, I think those like 8,000 [ph] megawatts of renewables last time we showed, and then adding the 2400 was -- is gets the 10,000 or so. And then as we further update this analysis, like I said by our ﬁrst quarter earnings call from you'll see more renewables being placed in and as well, so I think it's a work in progress."
"Got it. Okay, we'll stay tuned there. Thanks, and we'll just last one if I could, post the election chair just wondering, Biden's plan for 2035, if that impacts you directly and also with the new FERC -- out of FERC here. Just wondering what that could mean on the transmission side if you see kind of more supportive actions there and what opportunities that could bring to AEP?","Yes, I think we'll see -- continue to see supportive actions by a FERC related to transmission, because obviously the build-out necessary to support renewables and clean energy is something that the Biden administration is taking on. And I'd be highly surprised if there's any let up on that matter of fact, they're probably more aggressive than what the industry feels like they can do at this point. But certainly -- in order to do that and aggressively meet the kind of targets that are being placed out there transmission will play a critical role and that means AEP."
Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.,"Hi, Durgesh. How are you?"
"Hey. Good morning, Nick. And Gladiators is this is one of my favorite movies as well.",Yes.
"So just Julie real quick, I just want to make sure I have this right. The storm, the last week's storm related costs I think when you add those numbers up between PS1 SWEPCO roughly north of $1   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   billion, $2 billion call it. The ﬁnancing plan, the interest related charges, are those incorporated into your 2021 guidance numbers?","Not yet, no. And so, we have not yet updated our ﬁnancing plan. We're actually holding tight just a bit here until we get a little more clarity on exactly how this stuﬀ is going to roll out and we have ﬁrming up of all those numbers as I mentioned we made an application at the commission in Oklahoma. So that's another piece of that as well. And we will update you as we continue to move forward and make those crystallized plans for you. But as I mentioned, what you can largely anticipate is, taking on a little bit more debt, obviously to picking up on that would be an increased potential interest expense. And obviously looking to be able to be sensitive to the customer needs as they try to absorb this cost, but then also managing the balance sheet in the metrics that we really need to have to stay at that BAA to stable, type rating and arrangement."
"Got it. Okay, understood. So I guess maybe just in terms of the interest charges and other things, looks like at least near term you're going to borrow debt. Is there sort of plan to oﬀset that with O&M or other savings in the business?","Yes, as a matter of fact a couple of things that I would point out, number one, we're always going to work to mitigate any potential unforeseen risk, right. So plan do check adjust as we move through the dynamic year, and the other thing that you may recall making a statement about speciﬁcally in my opening comments here, that application that we made at for PSO in Oklahoma speciﬁcally called about the fact that we were looking for regulatory asset with a mechanism that included a whack. And so that's incredibly important to us as well. I know Nick made the comment several times through his opening comments regarding making sure that our balance sheet metrics are intact, having a whack helps us do that. Because we need to be able to preserve the ﬁnancial integrity of the operating companies as well as the entire enterprise. So those are the things that we'll be looking at."
"Understood. Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up on the Ohio -- Ohio settlement discussions on the rate case there the March 4th, is that the drop-dead date or can that be extended?","Yes, it can take can be extended. But, obviously it runs through geared toward March 4th, but it could be extended."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay, thanks guys. Much appreciate the update.","Okay.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin Smith from Bank of America. And your line is open.     Good morning, Julien."
"Thanks. Hi, good morning. Thank you team. Thank you, Nick. So, Nick maybe just to start here, you seem passionate about it, and I'm quite curious and you guys have a footprint that stretches our TOs here, how you think about what reforms in weatherization looks like here and how that could impact your capital budget. I hear your comments about reserve margins et cetera. I'm just curious if you can elaborate little bit further. What are your lessons learned from 2014 and 1984 here as you see them being applied, perhaps in Texas holistically and especially as you see your speciﬁc dialogs kicking oﬀ weather in Texas frankly the other adjacent states as well?","Yes. So in 2014, I really testify over three issues. One was capacity markets and understanding the value of capacity and certainly 24/7 base load generation. But also the second part of it was the -- at that point in 2014 it was the dash the gas it was gas and renewables if we're going to depend upon natural gas for substantial part supply this country than we really we really have to reinforce the ability for natural gas to perform during these types of events. And that means someone's going to have to be able to pay for it and markets will have to compensate generators for those kinds of investments. And then for the utility system itself, it really is around infrastructure to support resiliency and hardening of the system.  And also one of the other areas I talked about in 2014 was how quickly we retire units and what the replacements of those are. And how we're changing the nature of the generation mix and those have diﬀerent factors associated with the planning and operation of the grid. So those are critical areas where I think for really, if I were to opine on Texas it be more around market reform to support weatherization market reform around communications that exist during crisis times, because it's important for operators to know and even T&D operators to know where the generation is coming from to make adjustments from a transmission and distribution standpoint.  And so when you think about some of these opportunities that exist for us, it seems projects on the seams of the RTOs is particularly important to have interchange capability now for Texas. It may be more DC ties. It could be well obviously could be more transmission in general, but   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Texas will have to decide that, but I think there's opportunities for more levels of interchange, more ability to put infrastructure in place to support weatherization and then market changes to support the ability for capacity to be valued the way it should be based upon its contribution to the total grid. So those are key points that continue and really we sort of see -- let me -- with California you sort of see the same thing. I mean, they're depending on heavy level of imports from out of state. If out of state has issues then they have issues internal within the state. So when you think about all those things, I think the planning and the optimization of what occurs is going to really carry the day in terms of our ability to better take care of these types of situations."
"Got it, excellent. And if I could just quickly clarify your earlier comments here, so -- you I think you use the expression the time for half-measures and talk is over. Can you elaborate a little bit on the timing there just as you think about it and obviously you're ready moving is probably a question for Brian horse (inaudible) but what's the timing of this just to make sure we're on the same page here, whatever they --","I think you have to see that those decisions start this year because when you think about -- I think what's crystallized for us is really the path that we're taking, we're moving to a clean energy future. We need to be able to move from a regulatory standpoint and sure that we're achieving the balance sheet capacity to do the things that need to be done for the transition and the optimization of the grid and I think it's really important for us to be able to manage internally not only from an O&M perspective, but also our assets what generally what the assets are that contribute to not only an improved return for investors, but also in terms of optimization of the business itself, so that will be part of the path because you have to -- you really have to maybe three forcing functions, but one of those is a movement to a clean energy economy, the other is the capital structure and balance sheet of the company, and then the third is really focused on those two objectives, but ensuring that we're moving forward with infrastructure development and grid development to support resiliency and reliability of the grid. Those things together along with electriﬁcation or I think are really going to be tailwinds for this industry going forward, but in particular AEP is the largest transmission provider. We have a large distribution footprint and we have signiﬁcant amount. As I said in the last earnings call, we were on the precipice of clean energy transformation. So, a lot of opportunity for AEP. We just need to make sure we manage all those throttles to ensure that were consistently driving forward."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Best of luck.",Yes.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Next we will go to line of James Thalacker with BMO Capital markets. And your line is open.     Good morning.
"Thanks so much. Good morning. How are you, guys?",Just ﬁne.
Great. Welcome back Julie. Great to hear your voice.,"Thanks, James."
"Julie addressed some of the asset rotation to mitigate your ﬁnancing needs. But Nick, it's been a while since you've kind of I guess, updated how you're thinking about how you prioritize growth via the diﬀerent channels that are in front of you. I mean, obviously Chuck working on the non-regulated side on renewables and you've got plenty of opportunities of regulated growth on the renewable side transmission. I'm just wondering like, how are you thinking about inorganic growth, may be on the regulated side or how are you prioritizing sort of all those diﬀerent opportunities in front of you?","Yes, so obviously our priorities are around transmission, distribution, infrastructure. Certainly on the regulated transformation of the resources, they're ongoing. Chuck's business is really with AEP energy and so forth. They've done a great job of managing risk around that business, but they've also done a great job in terms of their allocation of capital and being able to imagine not only within their own part of the business, but also in total of the entire enterprise, so Chuck is more than willing to turn capital over if it's a better use anywhere else in the corporation and vice versa. We would like for that business to be less than 10% of the overall business. So and it continues to track that and it gives us the ability to not only further optimize that business, and you're seeing continued really continued opportunities on that part of business with AEP on-site partners on special relationships with customers around resources, that really drive tremendous beneﬁt for us because we can also approach that on the regulated side as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So I think there's an opportunity there, but certainly our focus is ensuring that we're able to move forward with this clean energy transformation and all the optimization around the grid and the grid resiliency and the issues there and do it in a very pragmatic way. That means we're going to have to make sure that whoever is progressing better from that perspective. That's where the equity is going to go and we need to ensure that we're managing that portfolio in that fashion so we can now look at this business like it's a fully regulated business and we can make decisions based upon their -- there are obviously are things that we look at like, what's the quality of the service territory? What's the quality of the regulatory environment? What's the ongoing view of valuation of any particular entity for us for someone else and what that means in terms of rotation of capital in terms of optimization, so we are continuing that approach and I would say that that we said in the past, that if we -- for all of our utilities if we see the ability to continue sustainable growth and quality growth in those jurisdictions. They make a lot of sense to us. And then of course, we have to look at also those that are challenged and understand what those challenges are. Can we erase those challenges? Are they are they systemic challenges? Those are the kinds of things we have to look at and we'll continue to do that and that's what Brian is doing."
"Okay, great. And just I guess just one last follow up on that because I know we're running up on time here. But I mean when you look at like all the opportunities like you just rolled out another 2400 megawatts of renewable transmissions always been something you've had plenty of opportunities to, like these still look at those opportunities like where you can put earning assets in it like 1x rate base as your best opportunities, or do you see do you see, as you look across the landscape like inorganic, maybe M&A or regulated properties or something that makes sense or is it just better to kind of stick to your point in the jurisdictions where you see the growth is visible and you've got a good regulatory sort of opportunity to achieve as well?","Yes, I think our primary focus is do it at one time. And with the organic growth that's occurred and that's really why the previous question about, whether we want to own the renewable assets or not. The question is, if we own those renewable assets and that gives us more capacity to be able to invest and we can take full advantage of tax beneﬁts and other things that enable us to continue to organically grow. And as I said earlier, we have a very high threshold for M&A because we do feel like that we have plenty of opportunities. We just have to manage the portfolio in a way that optimizes that going forward. And so that's the way we sort of think about it and then from an M&A perspective, it has to be it has to be strategic has to be accretive for shareholders it has to be something that really produces strategic beneﬁt for us in some fashion of what we're trying to do. But again, that's a high threshold."
Great. Thank you so much for all that.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Vlasov [ph] with Scotiabank. And your line is open.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Good morning, Andrew."
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the good detail on renewable. I just want to dig into one or two relative to your CapEx outlook, you mentioned the, incremental capacity at SWEPCO and then you mentioned that you'll do an AEP wide regulated renewable plan in the coming months, would a lot of that the incremental to the $37 billion? I know a lot of the spending will probably come after 2025, but do you think of that is upside to the plan?","Yes, we would -- it's early to tell, but we would like it to be incremental. So, we'll be working to help support that. And obviously as you said, some of us 2025, some of us 2028. So as we progress, we want to make sure okay, if cash ﬂow increases, load continues to improve, optimization of capital deployed makes lot of -- has a lot of beneﬁts associated with that. Then there's a lot of parts in the puzzle sort of like when we did North-Central, we didn't know what the ﬁnancing plan for that was and we continue to focus on that one and then we'll also continue to focus on trying to make sure that they are seen as incremental, that's our focus. So whether we have to obviate some of that with redeployment of capital or not remains to be seen, but the target is for it to be incremental."
"Okay, great. Then on the RFP at SWEPCO you mentioned that you'd prefer to own those assets? Do you plan to bid in from the contracted renewables business as well as from the regulated utility?","Well, then the contracted renewables business, our contracted renewables business or maybe rules associated with that. But, we just talked with North Central we did sort of a turnkey top thing that really and allows us to Tom [ph] the recovery with the investment itself. That's always sort of a preferred opportunity for us because it's really is handled well from a ﬁnancial standpoint and also handled well from a risk standpoint relative to the construction and customers. The risk to customers as well. So I think we've probably stick with something like that.  And whether our contracted businesses is on the back end or not is another question. I mean obviously, we don't really care if it's our contracted business or someone else's as long as at the end of the day we wind up owning it."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. Got it, that makes sense. Then one last one just to clarify. I think you'd said you still want that contracted renewables to be capped about 10% of the company. Did I hear you right? And giving the, overall growing demand for renewables across the country and support out of DC. Does that mean that you'll be more selective in your projects or look for higher returns or lower risk? How do you think about that dynamic?","That's exactly right. We've always managed that business around higher returns. We want to be commensurate on a levered basis with our regulated businesses. And we will continue (inaudible) we turned away a lot more projects than what we actually move forward with and as you probably have seen, I guess it seems to get more aggressive all the time about what the return levels are and is really the diﬀerence is really, what people say at the end of a contract what that terminal value is, and we really don't want to get into that kind of war. We really focus on those relationships with customers and developers that help us move forward with very positive projects. And that's the way we'll continue to look at that business.  And then OnSite partners and others with speciﬁc, customer related issues like for example here in Columbus, we have several businesses that have signed up for a joint renewables project that we continue to focus on and we do aggregation of customers in Columbus, which was approved by referendum vote that AEP Energy would be doing. So if those kinds of things that we can mix and match and tailor the relationship that the customer is looking for. I think that's what we're after.     Just to circle back real quickly too if I could. The ﬁnancial comment as it relates to that threshold in terms of business mix there are couple reasons why that 10% makes sense for us. Number one, to a credit proﬁle risk management perspective that's very important for us. So that's something we'll keep top of mind and the other is really on tax shield associated with debt. So we've got a couple things that were sensitive to and just continue to high-grade the earnings opportunities from our unregulated contracted renewables business. But that gives you probably a little bit more perspective if that wasn't already top of mind for you because it surely is for us."
"Yes. Okay, very helpful. And just want to echo the congrats to Julie and congrats to the team on another strong year.",Thank you.     Thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  Thank you. Our ﬁnal question will come from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. And your line is open.     Good morning.
Good morning. How are you guys?,Just ﬁne.
"Good to hear your voice, Julie.","Hey, Paul."
"Just some quick follow-up just on the Oklahoma ﬁling. I haven't had a chance to look at it, the -- how long do you guys expect to my understanding if I heard you correctly that you're asking for a weighted average cost of capital. I was wondering how long do you expect to have the -- how long will it take to amortize the asset? I guess. And what's your ﬁlings?","Yes. Well, actually we haven't been in prescriptive in our ﬁling so we've got a little ﬂexibility there. And so that's another reason why I kind of mentioned was taken about any potential ﬁnancing in the interim and how that would map to any potential outcome there. I do know that one of our peer companies out in Oklahoma made a similar ﬁling and I believe that it was ten years on theirs as well as a whack to give you a kind of perspective, but we want to be sensitive to customer bills as well as. I'm sure you can imagine."
"Okay, sure. And when do you think we'll get some sort of feedback from the commission?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Probably a couple of months.
Okay.,I don't have a timeline yet.
Sure. It's all early.,Yes.
"And then just on, a really quick one on APCo As I recall, you guys were granted rehearing in the yes, the case and you guys are also currently ﬁling an appeal and I was just, if you could elaborate a little bit more on that, because I thought there wasn't it.","Yes, that's right."
Okay.,"Yes, we did ﬁle for rehearing and it was granted and the parties are ﬁling briefs and that it stands with the commission. But also, we ﬁled in the Virginia Supreme Court. So Because we're not wasting any time."
"Okay, so, so just to sort of understand a procedurally do you expect to get something from the Supreme Court before the commission or the commission? I would think normally before The Supreme Court?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, so normally the commission before The Supreme Court, but obviously we felt like a such an important issue and focus on what we believe state law says that it's important for the Supreme Court resolve that issue in case the commission doesn't."
Okay. And do know when would be the commission might come out or any is their schedule on that or is it just whenever they want to?,"Yes, I think it's whenever they want."
