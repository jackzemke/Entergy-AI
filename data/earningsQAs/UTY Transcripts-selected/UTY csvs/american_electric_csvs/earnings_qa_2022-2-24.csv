Question,Answer
"Yeah. Hey, good morning. Can you hear me, okay, Nick?",Yeah.
"Okay. Great. Thanks. Just the -- on the renewables assets that you're selling. Could you give us maybe a little info if you have it, maybe for 2021 actuals, even just the earnings or the EBITDA,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   cash ﬂow of those, that business, those assets?","Yeah, and it's round $0.15.     Yeah. Steve, this is Julie. I'll jump in here with some ﬁnancial details and I know Nick will jump in with some additional color. Let me talk about how we're thinking about this for 2022 because as 2021 was a bit of an anomaly with storm Uri, so that kind of led to some diﬀerent earnings streams that probably are not indicative of the asset base. So for 2022, what we're thinking is -- and there's a little bit of wiggle room in here, talk about mid-teens in terms of sense, in terms of contribution to 2022 earnings. So if you want to kind of put a band around it, I don't know, $0.13 to $0.17 associated with those assets in particular that gives you a little order of magnitude there."
That's helpful. And do you have a sense of kind of EBITDA?,"I don't have something to share with you today. And as you know the renewable portfolio in terms of contracted assets is comprised of about what, 1,600 megawatts of capacity and that yeah, obviously varies from project to project. And as we said in our opening comments, we would be looking to monetize a portion or all of that over a period of time. So obviously, that will vary by asset and project speciﬁcally. So that's the only reason I'm being a little opaque on the EBITDA statistics.     And you'll see some sales occur probably in 2022, and then more in 2023."
Okay. That's helpful. And then the -- can you just -- one last ﬁnancial question on that. Do you -- just remind me what the -- if there's any debt directly on those assets or not?,"Yeah. Steve, again, this is Julie. There is a project speciﬁc debt and there's a tax equity obligation component to it as well. So as of 12/31/21, the debt component was around $252 million, tax equity about 123 million. So all in, you're talking about talking about 375."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That's super helpful. Thanks. And then one other question. I'll leave it to others please. Just the - - curious just on the renewable. There's been a lot of cost inﬂation pressure on renewables. Obviously, there's inﬂation pressure on conventional as well, maybe even more. But just, how are you feeling about kind of managing that within your RFPs and still showing that economically this makes sense your key states?","Yeah, actually feel good about it. Because, the -- with Traverse coming on line, that's really the last major physical addition for this year. And then most of the renewables that are being applied for are in that '24 and '25 range. So you still have time for supply chain to pick up and certainly from a pricing perspective to be able to adjust. So we feel really good about our position because we're not in the middle of something we're having to adjust and then -- so that's -- we're in a good position going forward."
"Great, that's helpful. Congrats on the announcements.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. And your line is open.",
"Good morning, guys. Just one -- Nick, one kind of fast through the one point in the prepared remarks, but I guess can you elaborate again, how you're thinking about additional asset optimization opportunities, should the IRPs at the various states kind of work in your favor? I mean, I guess strategics, privates, infrastructure seemed to continue to want to pay up for assets, which we're obviously again seeing this morning. Did I hear you right that the message is that as you're thinking about incremental capital opportunities to fund the renewables through the IRPs that issuing traditional equity is a last resort?","Yeah, and actually -- and I've said this we're -- we have to pinnacles of growth. We've got the transmission side, which we have plenty of capability, relative to project ﬂow to be able to check and adjust along the way. There -- it's huge. And then of course, on the renewable side of things. We have approximately in there about 50% estimate for ownership, which is sort of a view going into it, but I can say that because of after storm Uri, after many of the eﬀects in terms of utility ownership, we believe that ownership level is going to be higher than that. Matter of fact, in the Virginia side, it looks like 75% of it is owned and the other ﬁlings we're making is primarily a 100% owned.  So as -- and that really says to -- you're seeing a continual progression of really the standard view of portfolio management going forward. I think you're in the age of that and asset optimization to ensure that we're putting our capital in the right places. And that says, there's a   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   prioritization scheme as we go forward. Now, I can't say today what that prioritization scheme looks like, but certainly Kentucky was an example of that ﬁrst. It was the unregulated generation, before that it was the -- I guess, it was the barge line facilities. And you're seeing that step toward clariﬁcation, simpliﬁcation and making sure that we are optimizing the capital and the right places.  And today we have as I said earlier, the transmission in particular -- we will not give our position as being the largest transmission provider in this country by far. We have the bandwidth. We have the ability to move projects forward. And then on the renewable side, we're at the leading front edge of a major transformation is going to beneﬁt our ability to not only help in terms of customer rates because the renewables being brought in, but also to be able to deploy the capital necessary to make that happen. So you're going to see a continual process of moving forward with those kinds of activities. And the fact of the matter is, our renewables are now focused on capacity replacements.  And so that's a natural progression of what occurs within the regulated framework. And for us, it puts us in great shape to make sure that these projects are actually needed, they're actually produced beneﬁts for consumers and we have the backup capacity to provide for the demand periods. We're in a great position for this transformation. That's why we want to take advantage of it. So for those jurisdictions that meet those areas where transmission, the ability to participate in the clean energy transformation, those will be the high priority assets that we look at going forward."
"Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then just lastly on the growth rate ticking up to six to seven on one hand it's consistent with your past comments about being in the top half of the trajectory, but on the other hand, you're basically telling the market you don't see any situations where you see growth at 5%, right, which is great. As we think about sort of your wind and solar opportunity set through '26, which hadn't really changed from prior disclosures. How do we think about these in the context of your updated growth trajectory? Could they be accretive or simply extend the runway? And then are you assuming any sort of win assumptions in that updated growth guide? Thank you.","Yeah. The way it sits right now, we look for sustainability when we make these adjustments associated with the growth rate particularly the long-term growth rate. We would not have made this long-term growth rate if we didn't see a solid progression of the sustainability of the 6% to 7%, and actually the project ﬂow that you're seeing, the -- certainly the reallocation of capital. And actually, this is sort of an aside, but certainly, when we go from contracted renewables to the migration to a full suite of regulated renewables, it's -- we want to keep the talent that we have too, to make that transition and really focus on that eﬀort.  So I would say that the fundamentals are in place for continued optimization, solidiﬁcation of 6% to 7% validation of a midpoint that's higher than our previous midpoint and conﬁrms to investors that we feel really good about the position that we're in. And as we go along we will see what happens. But we always look at -- when we make guidance changes in long-term   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   growth changes, we look at the sustainability of that for years to come because consistency and quality of earnings and dividends are paramount to us."
"Terriﬁc. Congrats, guys today. Thank you very much.",Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet and he's with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Jeremy."
Just want to bring a ﬁner point to the equity question if I could. It seems like the asset sale timing could be kind of in pieces here. And just wondering does this lineup where really kind of completely removes equity from the plan at this point? Or just trying to get a ﬁner point on what equity needs could look like post a successful sale here?,"Yeah. I think it would be great if we could map it exactly to what the equity needs are in the future. But I can say that, that certainly this is a big part of our ability to manage the portfolio, so that we obviate the need for new equity, but you still have ATMs, you still have the convertibles that are coming on during that period of time. But at this point, we sit really good. I don't know if you want to comment on that.     Yeah. No. Jeremy, you're right on. And I -- in an ideal situation, we would like to stick the landing on everyday equity issuance and be able to kind of sidestep that and have a really strong balance sheet in conjunction with that. We'll see how ultimately the timing goes as I mentioned in my opening comments, there will be a bias toward trying to alleviate that pressure that you might otherwise perceive around equity issuance. But as you know, if you look at our ﬁnancing plan, there's not a lot out there, a $100 million of drip in 2023.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And as Nick mentioned, we've got the convertibles that convert this year and next year. So we're in good shape. But to the extent that we can maximize value of asset sales and time those, yeah, that would be deﬁnitely something we'd be interested in doing. But again, the idea is to hit on all of those objectives, 6.5 to -- 6% to 7% earnings growth hit nicely and comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you for 2022 and make sure that we're right alongside with the solid balance sheet metrics of 14% to 15 % for that FFO to debt statistic. So we'll thread the needle."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. And just want to come back to bending the curve if you could on O&M and just updated thoughts there on, I guess how you see that progressing in this kind of inﬂationary environment, any incremental thoughts you could share there?","Yeah, so and obviously, we're taking a good hard look at that. Our Achieving Excellence program has been in place for a couple of three years now and it's really showing the value of our organization completely going through. And actually truth be known, one of the silver linings of COVID if there is a silver lining of COVID, is that made us think about what was truly needed for the company going forward particularly when you made all these adjustments comments to compensate for what we thought would be a really negative approach to the economy during that period. So we're going to take those learnings and continue to focus on bending the O&M curve and of course, that becomes even more of a challenge given labor rates, given certainly, if there is supply chain related activities on the long-term.  But we feel really conﬁdent in our ability to continue to bend that curve or at least hold it ﬂat. But we'll certainly continue to focus on that. And that's a huge part of what we're doing. Because all these pieces sort of ﬁt together where every dollar of O&M we're able to put $7 of capital in place with the reduction. So we have the focus on reducing the O&M as much as possible. And it's advantageous to us because we have a huge pipeline of additional capital opportunities that we could take advantage of for the betterment of customer service and so forth, and it's all -- it all sort of ties together. The load forecast is clearly been positive recently. And it looks like it's going to continue to be positive. That's good for cash ﬂow and good for our ability to invest and then certainly all those things sort of ﬁt together, but we'll continue to focus in on all of those activities going forward."
Got it. That's very helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.,Yeah.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. If I can -- if I could follow up a little bit on the last couple questions here. Just to the extent to which that you're successful in, shall we say fully oﬀsetting equity here where does that put you? Again, I know you're taking the moment now to raise your guidance ranges. How do you think about being within that range to the context that you remove this equity as well? It would seem like this is likely fairly accretive move to divest renewables given where the transaction multiples have been?","Yeah. Obviously, we're going to have to get in that process and understand what the actual beneﬁts are. And of course, you're dealing with PTCs, ITCs, a value of those, the timing of those kinds of activities as well. And so, we're going to have to sort of ﬁll our way through that part of it. But certainly, the stage is set, and there's some -- and we're looking at somewhat of a phased approach, which -- that not only matches the equity needs, but also matches the business valuation itself, and I think that's going to be a clear issue for us to focus on as we go forward. But Julie, anything do you add?     No. I think you're hitting on it. I mean, the other thing that will make sure that we're sensitive to Julien is obviously, customer rates, always sensitive to that. But to Nick's point, this allows us to set the runway. Again, gives us conﬁdence in the boost to the growth rate of 6% to 7% for the obvious reasons. And then the objective is to again, maintain the balance sheet, continue to de- risk and simplify the business portfolio, and make sure that we're hitting comfortably in the guidance range that we give to you -- as we give that to you sequentially. Every year we come out with a new guidance range for the upcoming year and we'll continue to ﬁne-tune that.     The ability that we have to accelerate and de-accelerate is of tremendous value. And certainly from the contracted renewables process that we go through, that's going to be a beneﬁt. Our ability to accelerate and de-accelerate, whether it's transmission, whether it's renewables, those are clear options that we have available to us that we didn't have before. And when you think about the progress that we're going to make and the ability to focus on even continuing to advance the capital --the capital needs.  That's something that's -- all these things are going to have to come together. But I can tell you that the foundation and the clear optimism around that continues to beneﬁt us and it'll be a process and that's why I mentioned the Analyst Day. I think it's going to be important in the Analyst Day for us to not only obviously celebrate the sale of Kentucky, but also to focus in on what the transactions are going to look like, what the structure of these deals are going to look like, the timing and be able to also talk about what capital looks like in the future, based on what we're seeing relative to load and everything else.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"And if I can just one more quick one. I mean, why now is maybe the question, right? I mean, I appreciate the guidance range altogether, but just curious on the timing. Obviously, you all make a sort of an annual update of EI. You talk about on Analyst Day prospectively like, just curious on what gave you the conﬁdence now. I mean, appreciative of the asset sale.","No. Thanks for the question, because at November, there was a lot still outstanding. We had 10 cases going on out there. I know we got a lot of questions about, okay, why is it taking so long in Ohio? Is your relationship -- what's it like in Ohio? And it was like two weeks after that that we got both cases done. And they were clean orders and our relationship is great with the regulators in Ohio and with legislature. So it was -- and then you had all the other cases that were still outstanding that came through, (inaudible) on Rockport. Certainly, there was a PSO base case that was done right at the end of the year. So you had all these things going on. But the other thing too is Kentucky transaction is still ongoing and the process -- and it start -- like I said, it started with unregulated generation and certainly everything we knew beforehand that we need to solidify the consistency of our earnings going forward.  But Kentucky was the ﬁrst of the primary business units that we really took a look at. And now that that process is ongoing. Okay, what's the next step in our evolution? And when you think about those two pinnacles of growth, everything that we're going to be doing supports that ability to move that forward. We know -- and it wasn't lost on us that during November, yeah, when we reduced the transmission investment, there was an unintended message that somehow transmission pipeline was ending or there were challenges associated with projects and that was not the case. I mean we said that then and we continue to fortify that message. I think it was important for us to come out at this earnings call and set the record straight on what the ﬁrmness of the foundation of this company and its ability to move forward in a very, very positive way. And I just -- I wasn't going to let November outstand.     I think there's another statistic [ph] that might be helpful to Julien as well. So when we look back at 2021, the rate relief we had assumed in guidance was something like $230 million, as we got and then closed in on the end of the year. We had already secured something like 112% of that. So we were over what we had anticipated, so that gave us some momentum and - for looking at 2022. So there's an updated 2022 waterfall for guidance in the presentation today that's got the actualization for 2021 and then some reﬁnements for 2022 in conjunction with the growth rate uplift.  But we're assuming about $381 million rate relief and this is before the Indiana settlement that was approved yesterday. We had already secure 55% of that. So we're north of 55%. I need to go back and do the math to boost that number up to accommodate the order that we got for Indiana. But again, validating and giving us conﬁdence that now is the time to do this obviously came in with a strong year in 2021, given us the momentum and assurance around those regulatory recoveries that we had anticipated and a little bit more. So that's -- give you a little bit of statistics to match what Nick just shared with you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Yeah. And as I said at the beginning of the call, this process is not over. I mean, we are continuing the process of really ﬁne tuning the optimization around all of our assets and certainly from a resource perspective, to be able to take the contracted renewables and the talent that's there, and be able to migrate that over to a massive build out associated with regulated renewables is a great opportunity for us and certainly everyone involved with it. Because this process is going to continue. And certainly, we want to register that we will and have been a participant in that process. But the why now question is important.  I mean, the why now question is that we're at the precipice and I sort of restate this. I guess it was third quarter last year, but we're at the precipice of substantial movement toward a clean- energy economy. You can do it with the transformation of renewables. You can do it with -- certainly with other types of technologies that are developing. But it also requires our transmission. And certainly the just the refurbishment of transmission and distribution by the way. We have a huge pipeline relative to distribution too that's been identiﬁed. That's really all of those are opportunities for us to focus in on what's truly important to our customers, but also to our shareholders."
"Thank you, guys, again.","Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.     Good morning, Durgesh."
"Hi, good morning, Nick. Just Julie, quickly to follow up on the economics of the potential renewable sale. Should we be expecting tax leakage there? Or do you have enough in (wells and under tax) [ph] to oﬀset that?","Yeah. Yeah. We would expect a little tax leakage there. But as you know, we're not entirely eﬃcient with our tax credits. So we've got a little bit of wiggle room because we've got some   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   tax credits sitting on the bench. So I wouldn't necessarily look to that being as a stumbling block or a material gating item for us. So we'll be able to manage through that."
"Okay, thanks. And just one -- all the other questions were asked and answered. Just one. Nick, what's the conﬁdence level and getting sort of the Kentucky sale done in Q2? We sort of saw the headlines of you sort of kind of rejoining the petition from FERC on the plan. So maybe just talk to that. What drove that decision of withdrawing that position? And the conﬁdence level of closing the transaction in Q2? Thank you.","Yeah. Sure, thank you. Obviously, the state of Kentucky was concerned about the FERC case and the timing of it and how it would impact their schedule? So certainly we recognize that and we wanted to accommodate the Kentucky commission. So we pulled down the FERC ﬁling and we'll certainly reﬁle FERC ﬁllings after Kentucky and does their review. And of course with the state approvals at that particular time, we may get a quicker response from FERC. So -- and that's -- I think they have 60 days, but it could happen earlier than that. But still that keeps us in the second quarter, to be May to June, the June time frame, but still in the second quarter. So that's not an issue for us as you for us. And I know that there's - certainly, a lot of dialogue will occur. It already has, relative to Mitchell and how it works and then also in terms of what intervenes may think about the transaction. But that's a typical anytime you get into a sale of a transaction that kind of thing will occur and there'll be discussions and we'll get it all resolved.  So we're still very conﬁdent that we're going to get that done. Because actually, the new owner has made commitments of jobs and those types of activities within the state of state of Kentucky. And I think it's really important for anyone looking at this transaction to recognize that you're putting this utility in the hands of a reputable operator. They'll do a good job managing the investments, but also a good job in the communities and they're very focused on that. So really the -- this process should be a forward-looking process, not a past process, past looking process. So I really think that that's going to carry the day."
"Got it. Thank you very much, and congrats on the announcement today.","Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. And your line is open.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning, Andrew."
"Hi, good morning, everyone. Good morning.",Good morning.
"First question. Forgive me I missed it. But the new six to seven growth range. Is that incurred oﬀ the midpoint of the new 2022 guidance? And am I right that 2022 guidance includes contributions from contracted renewables, but not from Kentucky?","That's -- you've got that exactly right on all fronts, right on.     Yeah. It is 2022 the new rebasing."
"Okay. Would there be a rebase assuming the Kentucky renewable business does get sold? In other words would -- if I take 6.5% oﬀ the new 2022 midpoint, would I need to lower that after an asset sale?","I think you should look at the contracted renewables is supporting the 6% to 7% with the base of '22.     So to add a ﬁner point to that as well, to get right to the heart of your question. We do not expect to rebase our earnings when we take action on selling these assets in particular. And as we mentioned, we will take a little bit of an accordion feature to it in the sense that over time, these transactions will occur. So we've got some ﬂexibility there and then with the redeployment of the cash coming in the door back to the regulated utility, so whether it's transmission or a combination of transmission and regulated renewables we feel conﬁdent that we'll be able to maintain the guidance ranges and continue along the trajectory."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay, great. Then that makes sense given you said it was about $0.15 of EPS versus $5 or so for the business overall. And then lastly just to conﬁrm, can you comment on dividends given the change to the EPS growth outlook in the potential asset sales. How should we think about the dividend growth outlook from here?",Yeah. No change there. Dividends will be commensurate with the earnings growth.
Terriﬁc. Thank you very much.,"Okay.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. And your line is open.     Good morning, Nick."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the 14% to 15 % of the total debt on the funding slides. Just curious with the feedback then from the agencies on the potential to sell some of the unregulated stuﬀ and the fact that your business mix is increasing to more regulated earning. Do you expect any change in your minimum thresholds here?","Actually, we are having conversations in. As I mentioned earlier. We keep them apprised of all aspects of our business. So from a credit risk proﬁle perspective. This should be viewed as a favorable step again as a commitment and continued twist toward traditional regulated portfolio of assets. So I can't speak for them as it relates to what those thresholds would be. But 14% to 15% is most deﬁnitely within the wicket as it relates to a solid and strong balance sheet, I would submit to you. Again, Baa2 stable, BBB ﬂat stable, that's where we expect to be with that 14% to 15%. And please do reach out to the credit rating agencies to make sure that they're armed with everything we know so that they can take care of you all."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, then just regarding the sales forecast and your comments regarding economic growth. For this year it seems like, industrial is really driving overall consolidated. Whether normalize growth higher. Can you just kind of speak to what's baked into the long-term forecast here? And if we're -- if we remain in a higher commodity price environment into '23, '24, how could that change things for AEP? Thanks.","We -- any long-term forecast we tend to temper -- we're actually getting the process of a new forecast. But right now it's -- we've asked me about 1% increase. And I think you'll see this in '20 in - - what was it was overall 1.5 or something like that. Yeah, 1.6 %. So we're going into the year assuming 1%. And with the invest -- with the investments being made by these large customers industrials is always a leading edge relative to commercials and residential. So -- and then also, when you look at the numbers, one year over another, it isn't quite apples and apples because of COVID and the impacts there. So you'll see a reduction in the residential.  But if you look at pre-COVID it's more, it's higher because the stay at home environment has continued -- work from home environment has continued, so we get the beneﬁts of a more robust residential at the same time industrial picking up. And in fact, when you look at our service territory in relation to what's going on internationally, we do have strong energy growth and energy related activities in our territories and manufacturing activities. And with on shoring around security, as -- point I was making earlier, we're going to wind up working pretty well from a growth perspective and from a load standpoint.     Just to give you a little more color, if this is helpful. I'm on Page 13 of the slide presentation today and I'm looking at the industrial quadrant in the lower left side of that slide. As you point out, we are looking at a ﬁve to seven -- 5.7% uplift in that particular whether normalized load and that's really driven by previous economic development activities, as Nick pointed out today. Those economic development opportunities really set the foundation for the future. So we're reaping the beneﬁts of stuﬀ that we've done in the past as you look at that forecast and that covers many sectors.  So metals, chemicals, paper, oil and gas, but about 99% of the load expansion in 2022 comes from our T&D segment in Texas and Ohio. Just to give you a little bit more color and then that obviously drives you over to the right side of the slide. Looking at 2020 estimate it -- estimated across the entire board of 1.6% lift is what we're assuming. And then as Nick mentioned, beyond -- to the extent that we can push it to 1% on an ongoing basis that would be fantastic and that would be our hope and expectation."
Great. Thanks. I appreciate all the time and thought.,Thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  Thank you. We'll go to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. And your line is open.
"Hey, good morning, guys.","Good morning, Paul."
"Great presentation. I'm sorry, if I missed this, but is the -- are you still noting [ph] there's probably going to be gains on the sale of renewables? Are those gains can be part of the 6% to 7% growth?","I guess, let me ask -- or answer it this way. So we will have gains on the sales. And typically, when we have gains on sales of assets, there -- capture those in their reconciliation GAAP to operating earnings. So we wouldn't kind of oﬀset those. But ask another way or another question we got earlier and Paul, I don't know if you asked or heard this. But we were asked, would we be in a taxable gain situation? So I'll answer that question too. The answer would be yes. But we do have tax credits sitting on the bench that we'd be able to utilize against that. So what we don't want folks to do is, worry about not being a raw material gating item. We'd be able to manage through that."
"Yeah, I've heard that I guess so, but just to clarify, is that going to be part of operating earnings or adjusted earnings going forward?",Correct.
"Okay, good. And then --","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That's correct. Yeah, they'll get captured in the reconciliation. Yeah. You got it. Not in operating earnings."
"And then just the -- and I apologize if I missed this, but the average length of the contracts that are on these assets with the diﬀerent digitation [ph] and stuﬀ. I'm just wondering where that sort of stands.","Yeah, average PPA length is around 11 years."
"Okay, right now. Okay. And then, just ﬁnally, on the Kentucky Power, you guys talked about the Mitchell plant sale, but the Kentucky PSC as you know, on Tuesday ﬁled a protest, not at FERC, not on the transaction itself, but on the application for the transaction saying, they felt that they need more information. And I was just sort of -- I was wondering if you could provide a little clarity. I mean they have their own proceeding as you guys know, and they have -- and there's obviously this proceeding. I'm talking about the M&A via the transaction proceeding at FERC. And I'm just sort of wondering why they're -- or if you have any insight as to why -- as to this protest that they ﬁled saying, hey, the applications deﬁcient, we're concerned about rates and we want more information and sort of what -- how that might unfold or how we should think about that in the context of the proceeding?","Yeah. Well, certainly yes. There's going to be all kinds of activity around getting the transaction through. And in Kentucky as I said earlier, I mean, Kentucky is thoughtfully going through the areas that it wants to take a look at relative to the transaction. And certainly, that's something that we're going to make sure happens in the process. And as I mentioned earlier on the FERC thing, we'll ﬁle FERC as soon as Kentucky gets through that. But at this point though, there's nothing -- certainly nothing that we can address. I don't know, do you have anything, you want to add to that?     No. Respond."
"Well, I guess what I'm sort of asking is that -- I'm talking about this speciﬁcally, the Tuesday ﬁling, not the Mitchell plant sale. So I mean, in other words, they were saying, hey, they want more information and just seemed to me that being a regulator that's going to be reviewing the actual transaction. It seemed at least me to be somewhat -- I was a little bit confused by the fact that they're saying to FERC, hey, with respect to the transaction proceeding that docket, the EC docket saying, hey, hold oﬀ -- provide us more -- please hold -- please get them to give us more   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   information when I would think that given that you guys ﬁled this months ago that information. They could be asking you within the context of the Kentucky review -- do you follow what I'm saying? I don't want to go into great -- I want to go into too much as a (inaudible) did you follow me, but that's what sort of seemed to me to be a little bit strange about the FERC request from Tuesday or not request, I mean, the protest.","Yeah. So well, you had the interveners that came in and they're really trying to adjudicate issues that were already resolved by the Kentucky commission and so we'll go through that process of discussions with them. As far as Kentucky is concerned obviously, they're looking to try to hold customers harmless during a transaction. And really as we look at this transaction, they're in good shape going forward. So I think obviously, we'll have those discussions as we go along."
