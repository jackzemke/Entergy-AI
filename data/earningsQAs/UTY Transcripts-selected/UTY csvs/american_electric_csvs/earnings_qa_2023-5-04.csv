Question,Answer
"Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Let's see, maybe starting on the transmission business. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your strategic thinking there. What makes those assets non-core? Why that size of assets? And wondering what you're thinking if it does come to a divestiture decision, what you would plan to do with the proceeds? Could that reduce equity needs in the plan from here?","Yeah, thanks so much. Appreciate the question. As we continue to talk about simplifying the business, so I wouldn't necessarily put the transmission strategic review of the JV as a derisking because we are very comfortable with the risk proﬁle of transmission JV or otherwise. So that being said, this is more about simpliﬁcation and really focusing on our ability to deal with customers in our footprint. So nothing wrong with those assets, we love the assets, but we'd really like to take those dollars and channel them toward the traditional core utility business in Transco utility business we have at American Electric Power. And why Transource and Pioneer and Prairie Wind, again, those are outside of our traditional footprint that we have today. ETT is a little diﬀerent, and it is not necessarily under -- or not under current review at this point as we focus on these pieces that are outside of our footprint.  So we'll see how this goes. As far as utilizing any proceeds that we would have from a sale transaction, should that occur, again, this is a strategic review. We haven't made any decisions yet. What you should expect us to do is the same thing we've been talking about, dollars get channeled to traditional investment in the regulated utility operations, clearly have a lot to do on the transmission side. But when you bring dollars in the door, our expectation is to maintain a very healthy balance sheet, we've got a little bit of work to do, Ann talked about that in her opening comments. The metrics should heal by the end of the year. So we feel conﬁdent in that regard, but going out further on the timeline, we would always look to make sure the metrics are good. And then if we can, responsibly reduce equity issuances in future periods. But again, strategic review underway, we'll keep you apprised, and I would expect this would be more of a story as we get to the end of 2023 with a strategic review. And if anything were to occur, it would be in 2024 story for us. So thank you for the question.  Operator  We'll go next to the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go ahead."
"Hi, this is actually Eden Kelly [ph] on for Jeremy. Good morning. So just shifting to the New Mexico and retail distributed resources sales. Could you talk more about the prospective biomarker you're seeing right now? Any insight on the type of buyer you would be interested   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   here? Also just any language on OnSite Partners as well with the G&M segment would be great. Thanks.","Yes, you bet. So let me take a couple of diﬀerent tax of this. So number one, as you know, we've had a strategic review underway for the retail business. So that shouldn't be a surprise. Creeping in the OnSite Partners business is the new addition today. Those comprise about Energy Partners is about, I'd say, $0.04 of -- I'm sorry, I should say a retail business is about $0.04 of the component that we're talking about in terms of 2023 guidance, OnSite Partners is about $0.02.  So let me give you those parameters so you know exactly what we're talking about. MMRD is about $0.01 of the 2023 guidance. So you've got a few pennies there that we're playing with. As far as who are the likely buyers, let me answer it this way. We're already dealing with a multitude of buyers from our unregulated contracted renewables business. So we're very familiar with that space because we have that contract underway with that piece of the business. And MRV, I would think, would ﬁt more closely with that type of activity in terms of the parties that might be interested in that particular asset base.  But then let's move to the retail business. I think you got a little bit more of a narrower or more unique buyer set for that particular piece of the business. And then -- and I won't go into any names, but just given the nature of the business, the ﬁeld narrows just a touch. And then on the distributed part of the business, meaning OnSite Partners, we got hundreds of parties that could be potentially interested in that. The other thing that we're thinking about is when we start working with our ﬁnancial adviser to move forward with the transaction, there could be a situation where you have a combined platform where both the retail and the distributed pieces of the business are put together and sold that way, but we're completely open to separating the two just because it's got diﬀerent buyer basis.  I can't really opine on it yet just because we're just getting started with it, but we will absolutely keep you apprised of what our progress is and what we're experiencing as we move through time here. So early stages but well underway in terms of getting the ﬁnancial adviser kicked oﬀ and the process started.  Operator  We have a follow-up question from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.  One moment, please. Apparently, that line is not in queue. We'll go next to the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead, please."
"Hi, this is James Ward [ph] on for Shar. Thank you for taking our questions. First, as you look towards your June rate case ﬁling in Kentucky, how are you thinking about the key asks in this case? And as a follow-up, could you expand on how you see capital allocation to this jurisdiction developing in the context of your overall investment plans over the forecast period?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","I still appreciate that. And I get it. You guys have a really busy morning. So I know we have diﬀerent names who don't typically cover. So I just -- I'm so appreciative of your time and attention today, a lot of companies reporting. So that being said, on the Kentucky front, stay tuned because what you should expect us to do is be in conversations with the diﬀerent stakeholders, with the commission and staﬀ in particular and in Kentucky to make sure we're scratching all the itches. We want to be successful in the arena. And we are going to absolutely have a very thoughtful approach and sensitivity to reliability. We need to make sure that we're keeping the lights on and keeping them aﬀordable for the state of Kentucky and the area that we serve in particular.  So I have a lot of granularity to share with you today. Other than to assure you that we will be working collaboratively with the partners in that jurisdiction. So extremely important to us, particularly when you look at where the current ROE is. We need to get that up. You need that utility company to be in a healthy situation so we can continue to have a low-cost capital allocated to that particular piece of the business. And then I'll ask Ann to talk a little bit about our capital allocation and how we're going to digest that from Kentucky.     Right. So our capital plan, the $40 billion capital plan going forward is not going to change. We will just be reallocating from other areas within the same segment. So you would expect to see the transmission distribution generation, all those planned numbers for the ﬁve-year time frame will stay the same. We will just allocate within jurisdictions to Kentucky to make sure that they are focused on reliability, as Julie mentioned.  Operator  Our next question will come from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Just I know you gave us a property plant and equipment number on the transmission assets, which are for strategic review. Is there a rate base number that you have handy that you can share with us? If not, I'll just follow up with Darcy.","You know what, Durgesh, thank you so much for your question. I don't have a rate base number in front of me. We can absolutely get that to you, though. So we'll circle back with you. But the $551 million, as you point out, is the net plant position that is attributable to AEP in particular.  Operator  We'll go next to the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Go ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Hi, good morning. Thank you. First, a question on the balance sheet. Just to clarify, if none of these transactions move forward besides contracted renewables, what's your degree of conﬁdence in the targeted credit metrics and FFO guidance and over what time period?",Yes. So what I talked about earlier was based on that scenario. We have not modeled in any additional asset sales transactions besides the contracted renewables. So we would expect an improvement by year-end and getting it within our targeted metrics early next year.  Operator  We'll now go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
"Great. I guess two quick questions. One is on Slide 27, that shows the under-earning gap. I guess when I look at the I guess, ﬁve OPCos that are under-earning anywhere between 90 to greater basis points. What's a reasonable assumption of underearning we could assume when you closed that gap and during what time frame? And then the follow-up is -- and I may have not heard correctly. I think -- I don't know if it's a Turk plant or the Rockport plant, you've bought back or it's maybe not part of lease or maybe I didn't hear that correctly. Does that now move to the G&M segment in reporting? Thank you.","Yes. Thanks so much for the question. I'm going to take your ﬁrst one on the ROEs. I'm going to back up the truck a little bit. You may recall when we provided 2023 earnings guidance. The average ROE across the system for our regulated businesses was going to be around 9.4%. Today, as you know, we're at 8.8%. So here's my expectation. I expect we're going to close that gap as we get toward the end of the year. And as you know, I mentioned several diﬀerent regulatory ﬁlings and successes that we've had in 2023 that are going to help us close that gap. So we feel conﬁdent that gap will close, but I do expect that we'll be a little under that 9.4%.  Importantly, we have not changed our earnings guidance that we still plan to get within the goalpost on the earnings guidance and growth rates. So I'm not worried about that either, but it's going to take us a little longer to close the gap versus the 9.4% that we had in that 2023 guidance. So I'll leave you with that. And as you know, we're not dependent on any single one utility company to get in a direct earning level relative to authorized -- that's the beneﬁt of having a portfolio of utilities. But boy, I surely would love to close that gap and be within 10s and basis points versus the authorized in each of our jurisdictions. That's an objective. It's just going to take us a little while to get there because, as you know, these things have a little bit of a lead time on them.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So stand by and know the guidance is sound. And then on the Rockport unit, that actually it becomes a merchant unit. And I believe that's captured in our vertically integrated utility segment, right? And that would be captured as oﬀ-system sales, okay? So hopefully, that will help you with your modeling needs there, too.     And that's due to the ownership structure. So we didn't want to move it because it's still owned by the vertically integrated utility.  Operator  We have a follow-up question from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Go ahead."
"Hi, James Ward here again. Thank you for this follow-up. Unrelated to the prior question, just wanted to ask, assuming the successful eventual sales of both your retail business, distributed resources and the three non-core transmission JVs you highlighted today, how should we think about the source of funds for future ﬁnancing needs? And speciﬁcally, will asset sales and capital recycling always factor into your ﬁnancing approach? Or is there a point at which you would no longer look to recycle assets? Thank you.","Yes. This is Julie. I'll hand it to Ann here in a minute. Here's how I look at it. Simpliﬁcation and derisking the business should be part of our fabric. So we are going to continually look at where the best use and highest value is for each of the dollars that we put to work. So I think that's our job is to make sure that the portfolio of assets we have is the best we can have in the highest earnings. You go back to the question I just answered around earning your authorized ROE. We have to do better at that, and we'll continue to do better at that as we go down the path here.  So I do think you should keep that in back of the mind. We will continue to keep you updated on and signal to you if we think there's a business that might ﬁt that proﬁle that we would consider recycling it. But the ones that you see us talking about today are the ones that are absolutely those in terms of strategic review on the JV side of the house transmission that we love transmission, but we may be able to put that to better use inside the traditional footprint. And then clearly, on the unregulated side of the house, we want to derisk and simplify it makes complete sense to move forward with those actions that we outlined today.  So Ann, I don't know if you want to talk any more about or add any additional color to that?     Yes, I mean you're absolutely right, Julie. And when we look at the cash ﬂows, which are on Slide 24 that we've only modeled in the contracted renewables sale here. So any additional sales proceeds will also be able to strengthen the balance sheet. And as we mentioned, we   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   could potentially selectively reduce the equity issuances going forward while maintaining the same capital plan.  Operator  Our next question will come from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead."
"Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I'd love to ask you about the Texas utilities and the ROE gap there. I guess in Texas, the regulatory recovery mechanisms are very constructive, right? So you have UTP [ph] and ties and whatnot. So what needs to be, I guess, addressed there to close that gap speciﬁcally? Could you speak to that?","I still appreciate that question. So thanks for being on the call today. We're working on it. So let me start with the backdrop on the story. As you know, we continue to channel a great deal of capital to AEP Texas. We do think that the recovery mechanisms there are very good. We always think there's opportunity for improvement. So I'll talk about that here in a moment. But one of the things that we've gotten comfortable with, with the touch of under-earning relative to authorized in Texas, is the amount of growth that we have in Texas. So on average, we can grow earnings there at 10%, but I got to take a little bit of a haircut because no regulatory recovery is perfect. But we're trying to work on that.  And so for example, if you read on Page 27, there's some commentary under the little earnings bubble there that we talk about (inaudible) ﬁlings to recover signiﬁcant capital investment. Those good things. We love that. We do have some legislation that is in process and working through that relates speciﬁcally to the DCRF and the ability to shorten that time frame. So maybe we can do that twice a year versus annually. So that will help to kind of close that gap a little bit. And then there's also some legislation around cap structures, too, that might be helpful to us. So we're trying to work all the diﬀerent angles, not to mention the other thing that we're thinking about and continue to talk about is, is there a way to continue to use those excellent cost recovery mechanisms that are much more progressive in Texas throughout the period, even when you're in for a base case. So we're trying to use the legislative aspects as well as just trying to be as eﬃcient as possible to close that gap.  But we've been comfortable in the near term, taking the little bit of a hit relative to authorized on the ROE because we can grow earnings there and the demand is there. So that was the rationale. But we love the business. We're just trying to make it better in terms of recovery.  Operator  We'll go now to the line of Julian Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Go ahead."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hey, good morning, team. Thank you, guys, very much. Appreciate the time. Just following up on a couple of the remarks earlier. Just can you elaborate a little bit more on next steps here as you think about Louisiana. Obviously, a little bit of a setback here, but you alluded to potentially putting this back on the or maybe not you all, but perhaps the commission electing to reconsider the matter next month. Can you elaborate on the procedural element there, but also some of the other avenues, there's a ﬂex consideration here that can be pursued to the extent to which there may be diﬀerent outcomes?","Yes. Julien, thank you for being on the call today, and that is absolutely top of mind for us. As you know, and I mentioned in my opening comments, you're able to get to a settlement agreement in the Louisiana staﬀ ﬁled constructive testimony with conditional approval, all that good stuﬀ. So we want to continue to work that angle. And actually, one of the commissioners suggested that the decision could be recalled at the next meeting for reconsideration once some additional information is shared. So we have that top of mind for us.  So here's what you should expect from SWEPCO. You should expect to see us seeking rehearing in which we continue to be optimistic that we can pool this across the goal line. So stay tuned on that. I don't want to get too much in the weeds on it just yet because we're literally in-game with that right now. And then speciﬁcally, we would hope that this is going to move forward, and we'll have all three jurisdictions stepping in line and be able to absorb with positivity, the applications that we have in front of them. But do we have ﬂexibility in terms of ﬂexing up in the other jurisdictions on a discrete basis, we think that there is that opportunity with the diﬀerent projects that we have that are included in that ﬁling.  So again, nothing speciﬁc to share today. But rest assured, we're looking at all the diﬀerent tools and angles in the tool bag there. That we're able to use should we need a diﬀerent route if Louisiana can't get there, but we're optimistic and we're having conversations started.  Operator  We'll go next to the line of Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead."
Thank you. I guess my ﬁrst question is on FFO to debt. In order to hit the sort of the 14% to 15% targeted range. Should we assume that you need to basically collect on the $1.6 billion in fuel deferrals? And can you give us a sense of the timing that you would expect to recover those amounts?,"Yeah, I'll take that, Julie. So we would expect to collect over the extended time frames that we have already agreed upon within our jurisdictions. And with respect to West Virginia, we have that model taking advantage of the securitization in the ﬁrst quarter or the ﬁrst half of next year.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We have a follow-up question from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Go ahead."
"Hi, thank you for giving me more time. If I can ask a follow-up on Kentucky, right, like asked diﬀerently, when you spoke to regulators there, and clearly, you need to bring the ROE up, right? But what kind of a rate increase would that require for Kentucky rate payers? And like do you get the sense of kind of like the ARPU limit of the appetite that the regulators might have for rate increases in this environment.","Yes. So let me answer that this way. I don't have speciﬁc numbers to share with you today because when we actually had the conversation, we hadn't announced earnings yet, okay? So that's new information today, that's public today. And so this will be the go-back conversation that we'll have. And again, the plan is truly to collaborate because I'm conﬁdent that the commission and the commissioners are interested in having a very sound, ﬁnancially sound utility company. And so we'll all be working in that same direction.  Now as far as tools in the tool bag, obviously, we'll try to inﬂuence the top line with economic development and things of that nature. That takes a little longer, as you know, because it's got a little longer lead time on it. But we know we're really successful with that, too. So stay tuned. And then, of course, we'll be very sensitive to cost as well. The other thing that will be top of mind for us is using the new tools and the tool base case revision, okay? So we've got deferred storm costs that are sitting on the balance sheet. We have an opportunity to take care of net plant of legacy coal plants. That's sitting on the balance sheet, too, to be on something like $290 million associated with Big Sandy. So those are things that we'll be able to securitize and then kind of back into what -- how we need to make that math work. And I mentioned that also talks about or at least strikes at the idea of kind of rightsizing the rate base. So we work with the commission and all the various stakeholders in the state of Kentucky that we deal with to make sure that we're getting where we need to be.  But honestly, from my seat and from a utility seat, just 2.9%, it's not healthy. We need to get it in a healthy situation. And that will be top of mind for us because we've got to keep the lights on to and keep it aﬀordable. So stay tuned. We don't have a lot of color to share today because we're literally in game. This is a new data point with 2.9%, okay? But Sophie, thank you for jumping back in line.  Operator  We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead."
Thanks. So the assumption is that you will -- that you're assuming your GAAP securitization in West Virginia as part of getting to that 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Paul, this is Julie. Actually, securitization will be a great thing, and that helps us give us a little more ﬂexibility. More importantly, it's good for the customer. And so when we ﬁled for our new ENEC ﬁling that we made on what was it like February -- I'm sorry, so April 28, I think, was the date that we ﬁled it. What you'll see is that we have two proposed options to recover the fuel balance in our ﬁling. And one is to spread the recovery over three years, and the other is to use securitization for the under-recovered fuel balance. And as part of that, we also looked in as an option, again, with the idea and backdrop and motivation is to protect the customer rates because we can't have them trying to swallow a water mill in here is to essentially securitize plant balances from legacy coal plants, so Amos and Mountaineer [ph] in particular. And I think we have some storm costs in there as well.  And so when I mentioned today, that $1.84 billion number that we would like to securitize, that's all in. And so we're trying to give the commission options so that we can all work collectively to make sure that the citizens and customers of West Virginia are protected, but that we still have a healthy utility and we're able to hit the balance sheet metrics that we need. So it's doable. It's absolutely doable, and we'll just need to move through the process.     And one thing just to add on FFO to debt, when you think about just the quarterly dynamics in Q4 of last year, due to market conditions, we did have a signiﬁcant outﬂow of collateral as well as an increase in deferred fuel. So as we get through that this year, and that quarter rolls oﬀ, that will signiﬁcantly help our FFO-to-debt as well.  Operator  (Operator Instructions) We have a follow-up question from Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Go ahead. Pardon me, that line did not open up. We have Bill Appicelli with UBS. Go ahead."
"Hi, good morning. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But just a question around the timing of the approval for the contracted renewable sale. You made the ﬁling on March 22, I guess what gives you the comfort that you'll get approval in Q2? And I guess what's the -- what do you need to demonstrate in those ﬁlings to get approval both at FERC and the committee on foreign investment?","Yes. So as far as FERC and the other two approvals that we'll need to get, let me answer it this way. When we made the ﬁling initially, we had requested at FERC a 60-day approval process. So we would like to get an order within 60 days. May 22 would be 60 days. And given that this is normal kind of traditional business unregulated, not tied to signiﬁcant customers and multiple stakeholders, we don't anticipate any material low block as it relates to getting not only FERC approval, but the clearance from the committee on foreign investment in the United States and/or approval under any of the applicable competition loss.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So we're comfortable with where we are and expect that we should have that in pretty short order, which gives us conﬁdence to say we think that we'll get this done by the end of the second quarter at the latest. But we'll keep you apprised if anything were to come up. But at this point, we're past commentary periods, and everything seems to be going relatively smoothly. So Anyway, I'll leave it at that and suggest that if anything shifts, we'll be right in front of you immediately.  Operator  We have no further lines in queue at this time.
