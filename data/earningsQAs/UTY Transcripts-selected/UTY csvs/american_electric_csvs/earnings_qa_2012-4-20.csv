Question,Answer
"I've got a couple of questions. First, can you comment on the staﬀ position that was recently ﬁled in your capacity case, which I know is separate from your ESP ﬁling? I know that they made some opinions on what they felt was sort of a fair capacity rate, and while I know that's completely independent from the ESP case, I'm wondering if we can take anything from that as it might -- as the ESP case unfolds?","Well, the capacity rate they came up with was actually pretty reasonable; it's the adjustments that there are some concerns with. And we expect to get their work papers here Friday, and that will be helpful to us in terms of determining how exactly they came up with those numbers, but since that case is -- the hearings are ongoing now I'd be hesitant to speculate on it, but certainly we will review that, and see what the eﬀect will be.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Right. Because it appears that they come to the conclusion that your sort of tier 1 capacity rate seems reasonable but they didn't opine on the level of your tier 2 -- what a tier 2 capacity rate might be. Is that fair or unfair?,"Greg, I think the $145 that they netted to is clearly below what we'd view as acceptable. I think the $255, which is -- and they had something close to that on an adjusted basis before they took some adjustments that were probably overstepping, is probably closer to what we'd consider to be reasonable."
"Okay. Great. Second question, where do you stand in your current pending FERC ﬁling, and what is the expectation that we might or might get a decision on that case?","On the FERC capacity case you mean, Greg?"
"Yes, correct.","Well, that capacity case is in, and we are waiting on the FERC response to it, and we're obviously unable to tell when FERC would actually render an order, but the case certainly is there and ready for them to render an order."
"Okay, thank you, gentlemen.","Yes. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Eggers, Credit Suisse."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hey, good morning, guys. There is so much going on in Ohio in the quarter as far as ESP on and oﬀ, can you just help detail what would've gotten picked up in First Quarter results from kind of the ESP plan and what the reversals were around cost and that sort of stuﬀ that aﬀected the First Quarter results?","Do you have the data?     I do. So, Dan, obviously we detailed what the customer switching is, and that's reﬂective of current capacity prices that are in play. There was some pick up in transmission operations on slide 11, as we picked up some of the -- they are paying us for generation and transmission, and some of that migrates to the transmission line on slide 11. And then, of course, we noted in O&M, a previously recorded regulatory obligation. That has to do with about the $35 million partnership with Ohio Component. So it's really those pieces. It's the customer switching and the partnership with Ohio Component."
"Okay, and Nick, you talked about comfort with the environmental CapEx plan, the updated CapEx plan. With the amount of coal to gas switching you guys are seeing and a lower run rate on the coal plants, are you reevaluating that plan one more time before making any ﬁrm decisions, given the lower economic value presumably --?","Yes, Dan, we continue to look at the options that we have available to us, and obviously, we've committed to capacity in PJM, so it's a matter of how much we have to utilize those units. And obviously, they are being utilized less. As Brian said, the capacity factors are much lower. So that gives us some optionality in terms of how the units are operated during the year, and then in terms of retirements, we are looking at the dates associated with those as well. You have the -- and really it's a question of whether you need the capacity and does it stay online to 2014 or 2015 or even 2016. But if the gas market is lower and capacity becomes available, than we would have to look at those options as well. So we are looking at that on a regular basis, and what those options can be. I was just saying that in the worst case, it appears we are okay from a capital perspective and then, if we do get extensions or if we decide to convert to gas in some fashion with gas burners or whatever, we will have that optionality to do it. So it really is a capacity and energy question."
"Okay and Brian, just one last question on the cost management. Of the 80, the 35 was the reversal, and 45 was better cost management. Is that something we can continue to expect will happen on a quarterly basis for this year? Were there some things that pulled out that we would assume more of a normalization in cost?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","No, absolutely, Dan. I think you have always heard from us that if weather and oﬀ-system sales and regulatory aren't coming in as we had forecast they would for the year, and all three of those things are true for this year, that we would manage our O&M accordingly. So, we are currently in the process of A, having cut some signiﬁcant components of O&M, but we're in the process of evaluating how we've not do that more aggressively. Not just for this year, but really, as Nick has talked about in the past, trying to reposition the cost structure of this Company for the competitive environment that we are moving into.     I think that's one basic tenet of the February 10 discussion we had around capital and O&M discipline, in response to the environment that we are in. There is no question that where we are at in the economy and as we follow along with that, along with the other issues that we have ongoing, we have to be able to be ﬂexible from that spending standpoint. And again, it's in the overall context of that repositioning of the Company to those growth areas, and we are very focused on, during this year working on those activities. So we want to reinforce resources for those growth areas, and certainly at the same time, evaluate the rest of the organization and make sure we're being as responsive as we can to the operating companies, which really goes to the operating company model."
"Got it, thank you, guys.","Thanks, Dan.  Operator  Thank you. And next go to the line of Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc. Please go ahead."
"When you talk about your residential and commercial being down on a weather norm basis, is that being distorted by shopping at all, or is that deliveries versus kind of generation sold?","Paul, that's total connected load, so it's not being distorted at all by customer switching."
"And then, your $0.06 negative on switching, I think you've got $0.21 in the budget that you laid out in February 10. Are we running to plan?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Quarter to date, Paul, we are. But, so much of that depends on what happens with this ESP case, and particularly the capacity case. And if we get a negative outcome on the capacity case and we go to something that looks like RPM, that could signiﬁcantly accelerate shopping. And so the run rate for the year, given the uncertainty that we face after June 1, is something that is certainly in question. And we wouldn't anticipate that you could just extrapolate the year-to- date numbers and come up with a reasonable outcome without knowing with the capacity case gets resolved at."
"And then lastly, when you say you're 80% hedged on your coal buy for 2013, that assumes the same kind of fuel mixes you laid out in the First Quarter?","Yes, that's the same kind of fuel mix, I think 80% hedged. It's give or take, because you obviously looking during the year, at what the actual coal requirements are going to be, so we continually, and we are becoming more ﬂexible in terms of our coal contracting to ensure that we do have the ﬂexibility, if natural gas prices continue to be low, which we expect they will, that we will be able to respond from a contractual standpoint."
Is the building of coal piles more a function of weather or fuel mix?,"I think it's both. It's weather and natural gas prices, because one of the beauties of our systems - - we bought 5,000 megawatts of gas in the last few years or built 5,000 megawatts, and it gives us a lot of ﬂexibility in terms of, if you have low gas prices that are competing on a marginal basis with coal-ﬁred generation, then we can make those adjustments. What we're having to change obviously is this black swan event of natural gas prices is making us think about what the future of coal contracting provisions will be, so that we ensure that they're ﬂexible. Because there was always an assumption that coal was going to be lower than natural gas, well that's not the case, so we need to be ﬂexible on both sides."
"Thank you, very much.  Operator  Thank you. We now will go to the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)",
"Can I ask ﬁrst on the sales numbers in Q1, obviously the weather was particularly abnormal, and then this negative nearly 3% number you have normalized in residential. Is that -- how conﬁdent are you that is kind of a good reﬂection of the real underlying usage or is the weather model just sort of thrown oﬀ by a very unusual winter?","Jonathan, that is hard to tell at this point. If you look at that chart on slide ﬁve you will see there's been some pretty extreme volatility in that residential number Q over Q. Second Quarter of last year was up 4.4% and then it went to moderately negative in the Third Quarter so I think until we see a trend that we can hang our hat on, we really need to watch that data. We don't see anything that is a give up the ghost on the residential customer count or usage for us, but obviously, we are watching that. We will continue to watch that quarter to quarter, we don't like seeing it down 2.8% versus last year, but as you stated, it was an extreme weather year, and making sure that our weather normalization calculations are right when you have such extremes as we're having right now, and to be frank with you, as we had last year, you really need to watch the trend over time."
"So you believe in leaving the full year forecast where it is, until you get a little better sense of the rest of the year?","Absolutely. That's right because even in today's Dispatch, Columbus Dispatch, there was an article on housing, housing sales and housing prices moving up so it's a very sensitive part of the economy right now. And when you look at it, we've had industrials, and as long as we have sustained industrial pickup, you will pick up you will see commercials come back in and residential obviously come back in as well, and I think that's going to be positive or AEP"
"If I could, on another topic, you have talked a lot about Ohio, talked about positioned for the more competitive future. Can you talk a little bit about competitive activity outside of your territory, how active are you able to be given the amount of focus I am sure you have at home right now? And obviously you have talked a little bit about the BlueStar integration but just what are you doing strategy wise in terms of going after margin and where would you describe yourselves on the trajectory of getting where your business planning to be?","Jonathan, I'm pleased with the progress of the integration of BlueStar, and they are also participating in Illinois markets, participating in other markets as well. As I said earlier, though, we want to make sure we're only participating in markets that we understand, and that would be primarily MISO and PJM related markets in Texas. We continue to pursue even getting a   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   name for the company in Texas. You can't name it AEP apparently, so we have to name it something else, but we are starting that business back up. And I think it's important for us to make sure we take advantage of the back oﬃce systems of BlueStar, which was a major, major positive for us in that transaction, and the people of BlueStar, we've been very pleasantly surprised that -- not that there was a surprise, but certainly the people involved have been very good for our business, and have mixed very well with it AEP retail people. So as you said there is a major emphasis right now on movement in the Ohio market, and we are going to make sure that happens, but also, we will continue to progress in these other markets as well. So I'm very happy with the progress there, and remember, its primarily put in place hedging activity for the anticipated generation to be separated in Ohio, so we're very much getting prepared for that."
You have talked about this as a cost savings opportunity but isn't there -- are you not going to have to add a whole load of people and capability and structure?,"No, we got a pretty signiﬁcant number of people with the BlueStar acquisition so it really helped us from a marketing standpoint, but also from the back oﬃce and systems standpoint. And we want to make absolute sure that as we move forward, that our back oﬃce systems are keeping up with the marketing systems up front, so we can be ensure the ﬁnancial integrity of the business. And we certainly believe that there is margins to be made out there and when you look at the DSM activity and the other energy support services that can be provided, those services provided margins as well. So I'm happy with the way that's progressing to really develop a platform for us for the future.  That's one of the silver linings in all of this. I mean, I think Ohio certainly wants to move the competition and we are moving the competition. We support that and we support it because there is an opportunity, a real opportunity here to grow the business in a diﬀerent way, and we just need to make sure there is a transition that makes sense for us to get there, and that's what we fully support."
Thank you.  Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Jim von Riesemann from UBS. Please go ahead.,
"I just have a question on clariﬁcation. Nick, did you say earlier that you are aﬃrming your 4% to 6% earnings growth, or were you aﬃrming your strategy to get to that 4% to 6%?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No we are still aﬃrming our 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth.
How do you get there if you have to withdraw 2012 guidance?,"Well, as far as the guidance is concerned, it really is determined based upon what the Ohio outcome is. So, it depends on what base you're starting from, and I think you could still had earnings growth focused on the regulated businesses, the other regulated businesses, including transmission, distribution, all of the operating companies and also the additional transmission business, and that really conﬁrms the growth rate. So, and then from an Ohio standpoint you really do have to look at the risk involved with the case. It's a not a normal case, it's something that we are very focused on, and that outcome will be determined of what that guidance range ultimately winds up being."
"Okay, thanks. I just needed that clariﬁcation. Thank you.  Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jeﬀeries.",
"Hopefully just a quick question. We spent some time in Columbus this week, and kind of one of the takeaways was we had another ﬁling of an ESP last week. I think there's two other ﬁlings on this capacity proceeding. It seems that most of the intervening parties, if not all, including the Commission, are pretty fatigued dealing with all these ESPs and capacity and everything else. I mean, is this an opportunity for AEP to maybe reach a settlement, maybe the parties, there are some tight budgets there. People don't have the staﬀ. Is this an opportunity for AEP to reach a settlement with intervenors regarding ESP and the capacity ﬁling?","I just think we've been at this for over a year and a half and there's a lot of people with fatigue about this case. And we would very much like to get this thing over with. I think if you had a recognition of the other parties involved that yes, AEP does have a transition, yes AEP does have a unique situation with its pool agreement, and with the commitments made on behalf of the customers in PJM, those are contracts that we need to get out of. And if given that time, there is an opportunity for settlement. But based upon the last scenario we went through with the stipulation, it's pretty apparent, unless there's some dramatic shift in the positions taken by some of these parties, it's going to be very diﬃcult indeed to get a settlement of the parties in this case.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I think this is going to be a case where the Commission is just going to have to balance the interests involved, and make a credible decision. And I think that's key because if they do that, then we get our cases ﬁled at FERC again, we get moving along with all the precursors, to move to a full competitive environment with robust competitors, and that's a positive tone that could be set for the state. So I think it's important for that to happen. I'm just skeptical whether there can be a settlement of all the parties that's delivered to the Commission this time around."
"Great, thank you.  Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.",
"Just building on the last question, you've laid out a potential timetable for resolution in Ohio. But just given what you're seeing today are Julie talk a bit about factors that could impact that timetable, just general comfort with that timetable, given the latest which are seeing in terms of discussion?","I think that certainly we're committed to trying to get the case over with, and I think the Commission has also said publicly that they're focused on getting this case moved along pretty quickly. The procedural schedule is set so that due process can begin with all the parties, but we also know that there is plenty of information that's already been provided throughout the entire case, so I don't think there's anything new anybody's going to turnover. There's no new rocks to uncover here so it could give you the ability to move along more quickly.  I'm actually optimistic that the schedule will stay pretty much intact, because there's been plenty of time given for the parties, based upon the issues that we've already dealt with. I also believe that if you get a reasonable outcome in the capacity case or FERC orders in the capacity case, it could bring the parties closer together, and I just think that there are some major milestone precursors there to the capacity rate, in particular, that could have a beneﬁt in terms of bringing the parties together. That's also an opportunity for a quicker solution."
"Thank you. Just following up on a diﬀerent subject, on coal hedging, you had mentioned that it's fully hedged for 2012. Given what we're looking at in terms of the gas curve being involved, is there some possibility of essentially being overhedged, and how do you think about ﬂexibility if you were to need to reduce shipment deliveries, et cetera? Is it something where you have to deal with penalty payments, or is there quite a bit of ﬂexibility here? Can you just talk a little bit to that?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Stephen, we have very good relationships with the coal suppliers that we have, and we're working through areas of ﬂexibility that could exist. Also, from a contracting standpoint, we typically have a varied mix of coal supplies, long-term, short-term, that could managed. The issue that we have is that you have coal that is speciﬁc to speciﬁc units. And some inventories are low, some are higher, and we're looking at the possibility of moving coals around to the various areas to mitigate the impacts of coal stockpile increases, in the event natural gas prices stay low. So all of those kinds of options are being considered and looked at and actively pursued."
"Great, and just where you look at today, is there a potential that the hedge level is above the expected usage for the year, or do you see it essentially down?","Yes, I think we'll be okay, because it all hinges upon a long hot summer, which is what we usually hope for in this business. But if you have that kind of activity, then we should be ﬁne."
"Thank you, very much.  Operator  Thank you, and next comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.",
"A handful of questions. One, we've talked a lot about the capacity case and the ESP case. Can you talk about the deferred fuel case? It's a big number, $700 million-plus of outstanding deferred fuel balances, I don't remember the exact amount. How are you thinking about both the resolution of that case, whether it's separate from or tied into the capacity in ESP cases, and how you get cash recovery? Meaning, is it securitization, is it over a long period of time? And also, the impact on the customer bill? Because that's, like I said at the beginning, it's a big number.","Yes, of course, we'd like to get it securitized, and I think we have to get through the process to make sure we can do that portion of it. You have the reg assets sitting out there, and then you have the fuel sitting out there, the fuel deferral. The reg assets appears to be a pretty clear path. The fuel issue we have to get through, but Brian, you may have some more details on that.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. Michael, that's just in Ohio. We have a similar situation in APCO West Virginia, where we have nearly $400 million of deferred fuel that we are ﬁling to securitize there. I think we are on a faster track to be able to securitize that close to $400 million, than we are in Ohio. In Ohio, the securitization law requires that the fuel case be ﬁnal and unappealable before you'll be able to securitize, so the amount that we're looking at in Ohio probably won't meet that threshold of ﬁnal orders until 2013, but we believe we could be there as early as this year. In APCO West Virginia with that $400 million."
And what's the total balance left? Deferred fuel plus the capitalized interest on it on the Ohio side?,It's about $500 million.
"Okay. One other question, and a little bit unrelated to the fuel balance items. Distribution case. Is that also still separate from, and how are you kind of thinking about how that also gets resolved? Were you looking at there's going to be some kind of global settlement in all four cases in Ohio coming together?","Yes the distribution case is pretty well done, and the ESP case really is. We still have that DRR and those kinds of activities in there but as far as the distribution case, it's done."
"Okay, thank you.  Operator  Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman, from Bank of America. Please go ahead.",
"Thanks. Just on the call to gas switching data, following up on one of prior questions. Do you see any risk of force darn [ph] of call? Do you think you have enough ﬂexibility by the way you mentioned you don't need to do that?","No, we don't have any risk of force darn.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Okay.,"We didn't get there during the depths of the recession and we don't see the problem being as acute as it was then, and so we just don't believe that's in even in the cards.     Also, keep in mind, all of our contracts are relatively good compared to market and rail rates are obviously good as well. So the coal that's actually running sits pretty well in the marketplace, and as you go up higher in the stack with the designer coals and so forth that's where you run into those kinds of issues, so we're ﬂexible in that regard."
"I'm also just curious, I realized your Western region has, I'm sure, much lower coal to gas switching price points. Given that gas is continuing to come down, is there a possibility that in the West we see these numbers move much more?","You could see some movement, but typically you're constrained on coal in the Western footprint, the delivery cost of coal in our Western footprint is very attractive because it's PRB coal with a good contract, a good rail contract. It will be hard for natural gas to complete on a basis with coal in our Western footprint. And then from a natural gas perspective, you have older -- many gas units or single stage unit with higher heat rates, so you won't see them run as much as you would, like a new combined cycle facility for example."
Okay. And then one last question on Ohio. It seems like at this point that capacity case is going to run in be decided before the ESP? Is that correct?,"Well, we don't know the answer to that. It very well could be, but it could be a part of ESP we don't know if this point."
"Okay. So, the schedule could get moved out so that they are decided more in line?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, and then you got to look at what FERC is doing as well. So, that could play a part in the picture, too."
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Ali Agha, from SunTrust. Please go ahead.",
"Just wanted to clarify that the timeline, I know you talked that about a number of times on this whole Ohio issue. So one thing we do know is that you have temporary relief on the pricing on capacity that is there until June 1?",Right.
"You had asked to expedite the capacity case and ESP case, fair to say that did that not play out, or is that still a possibility? They're still looking at things, July 3 and beyond? From your vantage point, can you just lay out a little bit again the chronology of events, as you see this play out in Ohio?","Yes, I do think you have a gap there between the end of May when the present capacity rate drops oﬀ, and I think, you really have to go through the process of what the Commission intended to begin with, when they put that in place. And our view is that capacity rate was put in to keep the parties neutral, their independency of all these other ESP cases going on. And there have to be, in our opinion, some mechanism put in place, whether we are requesting an extension of the stopgap measure that was put in place, or some other method. So we don't know exactly how that would work out at this point, but certainly as May rolls around, we will see the progress of the case, we'll be making decisions on how we approach that with the Commission."
"And also, to be clear, on your position on the capacity. Last time around, you were okay with the two pricing mechanisms, where one was the PJM RTO, the other was the ﬁxed 255. I think you, if I'm not mistaken, have a little diﬀerent positions, whether the ESP or the capacity case, where now you're talking about a non-PJM pricing related price. Just to be clear what is your ideal position on how that capacity should be priced during this transition?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","I think we have ﬁled the two-step type approach in the case and the 140-something rate was applied to those customers that already said they would switch through the November timeframe. And those customers have already switched based upon the premise, would be included, including aggregation and the 255 was placed there as a discounted rate. It is diﬀerent than the capacity rate that we are after, the capacity case, we are substantiating that 355 actual cost, and we are doing the same thing in PJM. The capacity rate in those cases are discrete component of a larger case in the ESP, so there's a lot of gives and takes within the entire model of the ESP, so that's where we can go to a 255 and 145 type of application on a tiered approach. And it would still make sense in the overall sense with the stabilization charge and those types of things. So, that's really the context in which we presented those diﬀerent capacity rates."
"Okay, got it. And I know this is obviously an ongoing process but any signals or signs that you can share with us to suggest that the Commission's views this time around may be any diﬀerent from what played out last time around?","The only thing I could say is that I think we the dress the hot button points that the Commission had expressed earlier. I can't say today where the Commission is on the ﬁling that we've made. Only they can do that. But when you think about the low load factor issue, we've addressed that, we've opened some portion to auction, an energy auction and then going into a full auction even earlier than what was originally anticipated. And then also from the capacity standpoint, we fortiﬁed the records that show that switching is occurring at that higher tier 255 level, so I think we have done the things that we were asked to do, and it's really, like I said, it's up to the Commission to decide now."
"And last question, just clarifying your previous statement, on the EPS outlook, so if I am clear, what you are saying is once you got clarity on the Commission that the 2012 guidance, you will come up with a new number but oﬀ that, whatever that number is, regardless of what the outcome is, you still believe 2012 through 2015, 4% of 6% EPS growth is doable?",Yes.
Got it. Thank you.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you, Ali. Okay, one more question.  Operator  Thank you. And that will go to the line of Andy Bischof of Morningstar Financial. Please go ahead."
"In regards to BlueStar, you mentioned you had about 100,000 customers. Can you remind me what the base was when the acquisition was announced?","BlueStar had 22,000 customers, as I remember. And then, AEP retail, about 40,000 customers, so they continue to make progress there."
"Okay. And, BlueStar has pretty signiﬁcant capacity in terms of servicing companies, before you have to add on to that back-end capability, correct?","Absolutely. That's why we acquired BlueStar. And really, they have some of the best information systems relative to retail operations that we've seen, and we obviously looked at several.     Andy, they were building that business for a much bigger scale than what they had, and the management team over there, before we ever met them, had a very long view of what they wanted to do with that business, and so they've been very thoughtful in how they put their systems together, how they put their infrastructure together, and it was that planning and thoughtfulness that we wanted in the management team, and the beneﬁt of their systems and long-range planning that we got was the beneﬁt of the acquisition."
