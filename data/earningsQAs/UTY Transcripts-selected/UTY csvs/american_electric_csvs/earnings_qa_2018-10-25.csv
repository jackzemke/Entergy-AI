Question,Answer
"So Nick, I love the Chaka Khan reference. (multiple speakers). Tell me something good.","Yeah, yeah"
"So I guess the -- the wind investment opportunity in your geographies appear to be very good. And I was just curious, at a high level, sort of how should we think about the evolution of the potential for additional wind opportunities that might be smaller than Wind Catcher, but still very large. What kind of steps or what kind of cadence should we think about in terms of incremental wind opportunities?","Yeah, so actually that's probably one of the lessons learned from Wind Catcher being so intensive and the transmission being pretty intensive as well. We're looking at obviously smaller segments -- smaller wind farms, with smaller transmission, multiple areas. We've already started that process. We're also in parallel with that doing really refocusing our integrated resource plans we ﬁled in the various jurisdictions the support that approach. Most of it, you're going to ﬁnd and we will show more about that at EEI. But basically it's showing renewables, but we also have to be mindful of the political situation and in each of our state jurisdictions and the resources that they are looking for. So you're going to see resource plans develop around wind resources, solar resources, perhaps some storage but also some natural gas. So you'll continue to see that kind of development and as I said, it will be smaller capacity segments focused on various jurisdictions, and we've already started that process."
"That's great. That makes sense. And then just switching over to transmission. Just want to make sure I was clear, given the FERC announcement last week, I guess I didn't see any signiﬁcant impact to you all from the FERC activity on transmission, but just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing the nuance or how you all thought about that?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","No, you're not missing anything. The settlement that was done in the East is pretty consistent with the range that that came out of those cases and -- and I really believe even there is some discussion of incentives. Incentives are being dealt with the same fashion. I mean -- the only one we get is the RTO incentive. So I really believe that discussion, while still initial, I still think it will be supportive of transmission investments. So we see no change.  Operator  Praful Mehta, Citigroup"
"So I guess, maybe we start with the transmission side and CapEx on the transmission side, given the support that you probably get with the ROEs and clearly there has been some change on the leadership at FERC side but just wanted to understand what do you see in terms of the opportunity set on the transmission side. You've clearly and I had a huge impact on that opportunity but is there incremental opportunity you see there and how do you see that progressing?","Well certainly transmission. I mean, we're already tracking over $3 billion a year in capital investment in transmission and certainly with transorst (ph) and other opportunities out there, you may see other projects come into play that are incremental but, but obviously won't be very mindful of where we are investing. We have plant retirements that are occurring. They will encourage more transmission investment. We're going to continue to push the organization, the transmission organization to do as much as we possibly can around capital deployment. So there is always opportunities and also it has to be in the context of the distribution sides growing as well. And certainly, we want to make sure that -- that we're doing the right thing there too. But as far as transmission concern, as I said, really no end in sight in terms of our ability to invest in transmission and actually the reasons for transmission investment continue to change all the time. We are seeing further retirements, obviously some of those are ours, but also with I think there is no doubt, even when you think about the climate change aspects, the ESG activity all those types of things that are occurring is going to -- going to continue to push for clean-energy resources and -- and that means transmission as well. We have a lot of resources that are attached and that we enable through transmission and that will continue to grow. So we will have more discussion on that at EEI as well."
"And would love to hear little bit more in terms of how to quantify that that opportunity set as well at EEI, I am sure. So we'll come to that. And then I guess secondly in terms of contracted renewables, just wanted to get a sense for how that is going. We're seeing a number of players continue to invest in renewables. The returns probably continue to get competitive. Where do you see that opportunity set on the unregulated renewable investment side.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. So we look at that a little diﬀerently than -- than others perhaps, because we are accentuated by transmission and because you know largest transmission, by far , that's where our investment -- a lot of our investment goes, but also the regulated operating companies, continuing to grow as well. We can aﬀord to be very selective about these projects. There is a lot of projects out there. Some of them have shorter duration 5 year, 10 years. That's not what we are really interested in. When we look at our tenor of these contracts, we are looking for long-term contracts with credit-worthy counterparties particularly utilities, which we -- which we've done across the country. We're in 32 states now and also with contract, the actual development and construction risk versus ﬁnancial risk. We're mostly in the ﬁnancial risk category at this point in time. And that's pretty meaningful in terms of mitigation of risk. So I would say -- we are fully prepared to go as deep as we want to go in that, but we don't have a requirement to be out there, everywhere trying to soak up every every deal that regardless of what it may mean from a risk proﬁle perspective. So Chuck is -- I think it's $750 million (ph) of the billion that we had allocated before and -- and we'll have more on that at EEI as well.  Operator  Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research     Morning, Steve."
"Hey, good morning. Still getting over the Chaka Khan.",Another person who want me is Backstreet Boys. Not -- I couldn't get there.
"Yeah . Okay. The Ohio tax order yesterday. It seemed to be relatively ﬂexible. Just, I think you'd already resolved, but could you just give any thoughts on your color on that?","It's very much in line with what we had anticipated . So like -- like so many of the other orders we put -- we have some detail on this in the appendix of the -- of the release. It's going very smoothly wherever we've had these occasions and the range of ﬂow backs that we have -- have also been very reasonable. You know, when we talk to you early in the year, we kind of assumed ﬂow backs happening very quickly. But I think just about everywhere we've been, the ranges to like 18 years with most of it being in the 10 year to 15 year range. It's been very -- people are being reasonable and Ohio's order was just another instance of that.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay. And then just in terms of the EEI disclosures, on the CapEx and the ﬁnancing plan that will be out for the kind of 4 year to 5 year period, not just for 2019, right.","The CapEx plan will be out for 5 years and I think the ﬁnancing plan, we're going to go out 3 years."
"Okay. And then just on the dividend, which was great. Just in terms of from here, we should probably assume that now that you're at the midpoint of your payout range, you will kind of grow it in line with earnings growth from here?","Yes, that's correct.  Operator  Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank"
"Nick, I am recovering from learning with -- I am one of the only people on my team who knows what a 45 is.","Yes, I know."
"That's little sad this morning. Could I just -- back just to where Steven was going, you talked about needing to kind of revise IRPs in the states, before you can kind of come with the sort of post Wind Catcher smaller, smaller footprint, smaller transmission type deals . And what's the time frame for that? Is this something you see playing out? Yeah, we'll have some more clarity in the next couple of quarters or is it going to go deeper into 2019 before you really ﬂush that out.",You'll see more clarity soon. I just want to make clear to you that we already have resource plans ﬁled in the jurisdictions that have renewables in them. I think you're going to see more deﬁnition and more focus around what the alternatives are and also being respectful to what   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   the individual states want to see. Those will start coming out as early as December and -- and then they'll continue to ﬂow out during 2019. So you're going to see -- several ﬁrst passes here probably within the ﬁrst quarter of '19 and toward the end of this year.
Can you give us a sense of where you'll start in terms -- is there an order to how these teed up from a regulatory schedule standpoint?,"Yeah. Each state is diﬀerent, but I think the ﬁrst one to come up is Arkansas, and then Louisiana and obviously, they were supportive of Wind Catcher. So there is some real opportunity there to really fashion it to what they're looking for. But each one is diﬀerent from a scheduling perspective. And each one will have -- have diﬀerent views of what resources are applied. And so, we're going to have to make sure that it's met toward that."
Okay. But we're not talking about a sort of IRP do over type thing?,"No, I think, it's more of a reﬁnement. But also there's things we know today that we didn't know even before Wind Catcher and certainly that forecast will change and those types of things. And the way we present things is likely to change as well to where we're being much more of a partner with our commissions and the states in terms of what they're looking for.  Operator  Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch     Good morning, Julien."
"Hey, good morning. Can you hear me?","Yes. I can hear you, ﬁne."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Excellent. Hey, thank you. So I wanted to go back a little bit to some of the updates expected here at EEI, as you've think about CapEx and kind of reconcile that with the cash ﬂows. Obviously, you've had a few updates through the course of the year. Can you give us a little bit of the sense or maybe a little bit of a preview on how you're thinking about cash ﬂows, given some of the updates year-to-date on tax reform and some of the excess refunds. If you think about that. I know you have a little table there and the -- even in the latest deck here.","Yes, Julien. So we showed at last year's EEI for 2020 needing an incremental about $400 million in equity over the dividend reinvestment program. If we were to show another year, I would anticipate showing another need just like that in '21."
"Got it, okay. And that is inclusive of the latest tax reform refunds et cetera that you've been able to secure for this year. Right ?",That's correct.
"Got it. Okay, excellent. Then secondly, turning over to Oklahoma here. Obviously you ﬁled the PSO case and you've talked a little bit about some of the levers you might have over time, as you think about that situation in your ownership or not. Is there potential where you split it apart transmission versus distribution when you think about ownership in the diﬀerent jurisdictions here. I mean, maybe can you talk a little bit to the jurisdictional issues too just, as you think about your desire to be involved in Oklahoma?","Yeah. So, well, ﬁrst of all, I certainly -- certainly I'm looking toward a positive outcome in Oklahoma. I think, there is some confusion that we have the Oklahoma Transco and certainly PSO, they are two separate utilities. But at the same time, I think it would be somewhat diﬃcult to think of them independently, because certainly PSO and the transmission -- in the Transco -- Transco's new transmission but is transmission that's within the PSO customer side of things. And it's not all that way, and I think there's lot of confusion even from the maybe the commission perspective and others, from what I've read from the investment analyst reports.  The Transco at PSO, it is an Oklahoma Transco, but it invest in transmission, based on what SPP requirements are and in terms of what the customer load requirements are for PSO. Only, the cost in the Transco that go to Oklahoma customers are actually ascribed to Oklahoma customers, and there is this view that we can short-change PSO because we get higher ROEs in the Oklahoma Transco -- well -- that is really very, very small. It's -- I mean if you were to take the Oklahoma Transco along with PSO and look at the rate structures associated with that, the impact of the Transco is really only like 28 basis points.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, and I think some people think that we can have 6.5% ROE at PSO and we're getting 11% at -- 10.5% to 11% in Transco that -- okay, that's ﬁne, overall, but it's not. Because the rate base is much bigger from a PSO perspective and the only incremental transmission is in the Transco. And when you account for that, it's not like we are taken earnings and softened them oﬀ to the corporate parent, it's that the investment made in the Transco in earnest of the beneﬁt of AEP shareholders, but also the PSO returns an investment made within PSO, it's also regulated, goes to the AEP shareholders as well, any earnings and returns associated with that.  So this notion that we can average it out and everything is ﬁne, doesn't make sense. And so, I think, we've got to get sort of past that. As far as PSO's future is concerned, we obviously have been -- and we've said time and time again, that we can't have a chronic under recovery for years and years, because, obviously our shareholders are expecting investments to be made in places where we can get positive, very positive returns. And the other state jurisdictions that's possible even in Kentucky is come up considerably. PSO in Oklahoma remains that single situation that we have that needs -- that really needs to be corrected. And we, I think we presented a very positive case to say that, okay, we're going to provide great quality service to our customers and we're committed to that.  But obviously on the other side, we need to be able to invest and investing get a decent recovery for it and that's what performance-based rate making does for you. Also in terms of bringing that investment closer to when -- the recovery closer to when the investments made. That's a natural occurrence. And I think, we've got to get that message across in all of these rate ﬁlings, but it would be hard to separate the two and do something diﬀerent, and I really don't want to go there. At this point, I want to get through this case and then we look at the situation of the tax basis and leakage and everything else, associated with issues of sales and do we actually have a use.  So, and you're going to see more at EEI. I think it is -- one of the slides about sources and uses that sort of gives our thinking in terms of, in terms of what we're looking at. So I'd rather reserve a lot of that discussion for EEI but also as far as PSO is concerned, reserve that discussion to later -- certainly after the rate case.  And keep in mind too, that we have a second corporate headquarters there in Oklahoma. Tulsa has about 618 employees there that are not PSO employees. They are AEP corporate employees. And so that would also have to be managed in the context of whatever the disposition of PSO would be going forward. So there's a lot of things to think about from that perspective, but I really don't want to go there until -- until we fully understand what our role is in Oklahoma. And I think the commission is going to make a deﬁnitive statement on that this time around."
(Multiple Speakers) Excellent.,"I think, we answered than what you probably asked for, but.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Indeed, quick follow-up on the renewable piece, just real quickly. How do you see the approval process and demonstration need for the RFP ﬁling in Ohio? Speciﬁcally, how do you think about this given potential changes in PUCHA and (inaudible) ?","Yeah. So, I would suspect, we are following what the framework has been setup to get these approvals for the -- for the renewables, and certainly a change in administration could have an impact. But I think the path is already set. It really is up to the Commission now. We've gone out for bid. We've done what we need to do and that's at least for 400 megawatts. You are still 500 megawatts to go. And that's probably wind related resources. So we still have an opportunity to continue to progress along that path. And I don't really see -- I don't really see an impact in terms of or a change in the thought process of the Commission itself, but I -- we've got credible projects out there. You know, we presented a ﬁling that did not have us participating in those two projects of PPAs . But given the use of our balance sheet, certainly there is a factor that we applied to it that included provisions from our ﬁnancial perspective to ensure that we remain neutral from a capital structure standpoint. So -- and we made that decision and we'll make that decision on any future PPAs and whether we're actually investing or not investing, I think that goes to -- it goes to the capital discipline that we have of our threshold of returns and risk associated with any capital investment we make. So I think we manage it pretty well from that perspective . So we'll wait and see what the Commission thinks about the two that have been ﬁled.  Operator  Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI     Good morning, Greg."
Thanks. Good morning. You are in my era with Chaka Khan for sure.,"Yes. Unfortunately, we are all in the same era just about."
"Yeah, well they don't make any good music anymore, do they?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No , they don't."
"Miss (ph) the old days. But the question on the dividend that Steve asked. So just want to be clear because I had asked this question to you guys maybe one year or two year ago. You move your balance sheet into a really pristine position. And you've indicated to Steve that sort of this 8% move was not indicative of a desire to consistently grow the dividend nudge ahead of the earnings guidance. So as you think about that, is it, is it won and done for any good reason other than, I mean, could you theoretically -- could grow at 8% and be in a strong balance sheet position or is the cash ﬂow proﬁle as you move out three years, four years , ﬁve years, you know, in a place where you sort of meet at a place where you're -- you really would be penny-wise pound foolish to nudge ahead of the earnings growth.","Yeah, I would. Well, I would say it a little diﬀerently. I mean, obviously, we've been consistent about the message that our dividends grow commensurate with our earnings. And I think, we got. And we really also feel very strongly that a regulated utility should be in a healthy range within that 60% to 70%, and it started to lag a little bit and we really felt like a -- some of it was catch-up but also some of it was conﬁdence. And I think whereas the Board looked at the dividend policy in the future. We're going to continue to to focus on what the earnings proﬁle of the Company looks like going forward and we'll be very transparent about that at the EEI. And it will give you some sense of where the dividend will go as well.     Greg, we had previously announced guidance for 2019 for operating earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share and the move that the Board made earlier this week, puts our dividend payout ratio squarely in the middle of what we previously announced of 60% to 70% and the move that they made puts it exactly at 65%. And I think as Nick said, that's just the Board expressing its conﬁdence in our ability to grow earnings over time."
"So I get that, guys. I guess what I'm asking is a little bit more nuance perhaps , in that, given how strong the balance sheet is and how good you've been in terms of being Stuarts of that balance sheet.",Yeah.
"If you continue to raise it you know a nudge faster than the midpoint of your earnings growth target, you might be at the higher end of the payout ratio target in several years but you'd still be comfortably in your credit metric proﬁle. So is that outside of the realm of possible?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","I think, our -- our policy has been from a Board perspective. And it comes from the Board obviously that that we'll grow commensurate with our earnings. Now, okay. So, and you also have to look at the use of capital. We have plenty of places to put capital. And I think there is probably going to be more deﬁnition around that because Brian has just mentioned that will be showing ﬁve years of capital going forward. That will give you some insight in terms of what the earnings capability of the Company is going forward, and then you can take from that earnings where the dividend policy will be."
"Okay, one last question. And perhaps , you'll veer to -- we get to San Francisco but when we look out ﬁve years from now, is your generation ﬂeet based on your -- your plan is going to be substantially incrementally decarbonized from where it is today?","Yeah, actually I think we get as far as coal-ﬁred generation, we're in the 30 something percent range. We've already gone from 65% to I think it's 51% and it's going to go even further, because we've already announced closures of local (ph) union in Conesville. And as you move forward, you're going to see continued activity in that regard, but also at the same time, our ﬂeet itself is continuing to grow from a clean energy perspective. That's added on to it as well. So, that's really what we are looking at in the future. So as we transform our generation ﬂeet, we're going to be in the range of 36% coal. At least down 36% from a coal perspective, up 2% on natural gas. No change on nuclear, up 29% on solar and hydro, wind and then energy eﬃciency up 5%. So you're seeing a very diﬀerent view of what really is changing from a generation ﬂeet to resources and those resources including transmission and they also include the eﬃciencies within the grid itself that have yet to really been -- you haven't seen that capital picture yet. So it's going to continue to change dramatically."
"That's even without Wind Catcher, that's impressive.","Yes.  Operator  Christopher Turnure, JPMorgan     Good morning, Christopher   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the O&M trajectory year-to-date versus your original plan and any of the drivers that might be underlying that?","Yes, so we are going to be up a little bit as we were out with the weather being what it's coming at. Last year, we signiﬁcantly throttled back O&M in the fourth quarter. This year, given where we've gotten ahead with weather, we've been able to move some things into 2018 from 2019 and so between shifting employee-related expenses, some things we've taken on forestry, we're going to be up versus what we had previously announced at EEI for last year."
Okay. And can you give us a sense as to how much of that diﬀerential versus your original plan was due to pulling forward O&M from '19?,A relatively small portion. Less than $0.10 per share.
"Okay . And then my second question is as you look out over the next ﬁve years and think about your tax appetite and level of just cash taxes in general, kind of, how do you think about that and does that position you well versus your competitors for renewable projects and position you well even within any regulated renewable projects that you'd like to do in terms of the cost that you can oﬀer your customers","Yeah. So we do have tax appetite for both the regulated side of the business and the competitive side of the business and we anticipate utilizing that tax appetite to the point where we anticipate having a cash eﬀective tax rate on a Federal basis of about 5% for the foreseeable future.  Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates     Good morning, Paul."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   How are you, how're you doing?",Just ﬁne.
"Really, just sort of one question here I have left and that is the, -- the ROE case in New England. I was wondering, how you guys were looking at that in the context of the FERC ROE settlement that you guys came up with. And just any thoughts you have about the, I guess it's kind of a proposal, but whatever, there -- what they're proposing in New England, which seems to be a new policy in general and just how you see that in the context of what you guys settled on?","So Paul, when we take that methodology and apply it to our facts, we come up with an ROE that is very, very similar to what we settled at. One of the other beneﬁts that we got from the settlement was the opportunity to increase our equity layer from 50% to 55%. And so even though the ROE is right on top of where we would calculate it given the New England transmission orders, we think we end up even better than that given the increase in the equity layer. And then, of course, on top of that we have as Nick was talking about earlier, the incentive for being in an RTO."
"So when you look at it just to make sure I understand, you see your base ROE -- you think that the new proposed numbers apply to your situation would have come in pretty close to where you are (multiple speakers)","Yes. Very similar.  Operator  Ali Agha, SunTrust     Almost missed you, Ali."
"Yes, good morning. One thing I wanted to clarify, Brian, back on the second quarter call you had laid out your '21 CapEx. And now if I'm hearing you right, at EEI, you will lay out a ﬁve-year look, so presumably that gets us to 2023. One, I wanted to conﬁrm that. And then secondly,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   should we also expect that your transmission earnings outlook which currently is out till 2020 that you'll also extend that out to 2023 as well?",No -- we are going to add a year to that. So let me conﬁrm that we are going to show ﬁve years of CapEx and we'll show an additional year on the transmission outlook.
"I got you. Okay. And then secondly, Nick, you talk about having your sort of blended portfolio ROE somewhere in the 10% range, which is obviously where you're tracking right now. But in actuality, I also wanted to conﬁrm, when you look at what your authorized ROEs are across your jurisdictions and you compare that to the 10.1 (ph) -- the LTM ROE that you're earning. Is there any regulatory lag in the system? And some of it may just be ﬁctional and historical. But just to get a sense of the diﬀerence in authorized and actual earned?","Yeah, there is regulatory lag. But also there's -- and we sort of position our cases where they need to be done. In some cases, I mean, like AEP Texas, it's a lower ROE because we're investing heavily. But it's a -- really a good recovery mechanism in Texas. The same is true with the transmission, and then we have the formula-based rates in various jurisdictions and where Arkansas has formula-based rates now and certainly, we're trying to get that PSO to bring that more concurrent. But there is regulatory lag in there and we're trying to minimize that as much as possible to bring up the eﬀective ROEs. That's a critical component of what we're working with our regulators on.  And as far as looking into the future, you're going to have AEP Ohio, that portion drop-oﬀ. So the legacy parts of AEP Ohio, the RSR and the PER (ph) and all that kind of stuﬀ that's going to drop oﬀ. But at the same time, we expect other jurisdictions to be picking up, so, including PSO, and so that's part of it as well.  So it's -- it's probably more convoluted then -- you can't look at each one of them deterministically because we invest diﬀerently in each company, a diﬀerent times and timing has lot to do with it, and the O&M spend for various activities. So -- but generally speaking, across the Board, we always try to get to that 10%."
"Got you. Last question also wanted to just clarify, at EEI in addition to extending the time period. Did I hear you folks right that given the opportunities that you're seeing whether it's renewables or transmission, et cetera that there is also an opportunity, an expectation that the absolute amounts of investment also likely goes up as well. Just clarifying, if I heard that right?",So we're going to talk about that at EEI.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Okay. But that was not what you had signaled in your comments, currently.","We'll give you the full update at EEI, Ali.  Operator  Thank you.
