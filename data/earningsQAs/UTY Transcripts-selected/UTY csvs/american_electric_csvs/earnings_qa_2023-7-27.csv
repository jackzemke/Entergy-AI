Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Good morning. Just on the credit metrics, obviously, a little bit more slippage this quarter, which you highlighted. I guess, can you talk about the pathway to get to that 14% to 15%, a little bit more detail, I mean, 300 basis points seems like a lot of improvement that's needed in the short time frame, being that it's your early '24 target. I mean, could we see incremental equity in plan? Is the asset sales enough to get you there? And how important is collecting the unrecovered fuel balance in terms of being able to hit that target, which I guess it still stands around $1.4 billion. Thanks.","Yes, sure. I'll take that. As we mentioned, the main impact to our FFO-to-debt is the timing of the collateral payment. So that's about a 240 basis point impact to our FFO-to-debt. And so that should resolve itself by year end and result in a noticeable improvement. We also have about 100 basis points of favorable impact from the proceeds of the contracted renewable sale and the equity unit conversion. So we are conﬁdent that we are going to have measurable improvement by the end of the year and be into the range by next year. In our forecast, we don't have any of the securitization in our cash ﬂows. We do have recovery of deferred fuel, but that is not necessary to be able to get into our current range."
"Got it. Okay, perfect. And then maybe just a more of a strategic question for Julie. Obviously, AEP is never CapEx constrained, right? I guess, how do we sort of think about overall ﬁnancing, especially given the current interest rate environment and kind of where the stock currently trades? Do you have ongoing -- you do have ongoing needs, right? So as we're thinking about parent leverage and equity. Are more non-core asset sales out there or could we actually start to see some more core assets sales to kind of fund the plan and maybe further simplify the story? Thanks.","Yes, no, Shar, I so appreciate the question and you're right. We have a lot of opportunity to put capital to work as it relates to taking care of the customer and delivering reliable, aﬀordable service. But as you point out, we need to make sure that we're hitting all the metrics too. So not only do we need to be real mindful of where customer rates are going when we put money to work, I need to make sure that all my earnings growth targets are going to be hit, because I think you guys would be upset with me if that didn't happen, so we'll make sure that happens. But I also need to make sure that my balance sheet's really strong too.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So let me get to your question around asset sales. We've really been focused on, as you know, the non-core related activities that when people buy AEP shares or invest in our bonds -- they're not necessarily looking to buy something that is not a traditional regulated utility type business. So to that end, that's why you see us kind of going through the paces today where we've talked about the unregulated components of our business. And while we love transmission, even looking at some of these transmission investments of the joint ventures that are oﬀ our footprint.  Because if we can channel all of our eﬀorts and dollars to taking care of our customers that are regulated in our footprint, that's where we want to play. So I wouldn't anticipate signiﬁcant additional activity coming from us for a couple of reasons. I think we're pretty cleaned up once we get some of this non-core stuﬀ taken care of. I think we're in a good place. I think that there may be some opportunities on the edges. But for the most part, we should be in a really good space to be continuing to look at the regulated pieces of our business. But we also, and very candid, Char, we don't need to engage in asset sales to make the balance sheet work.  What we need to do is make sure we're being as eﬃcient as possible. And that's another reason why I want to make sure that every dollar we do put to work is one that, A, makes sense for customers, but also is something that makes sense for our service territories, and speciﬁcally, why I'm calling that out is it's another reason why I'm out talking with folks in our communities.  So whether it's commissioners, customers, et cetera, need to make sure that we're aligned or at least absolutely aware of one another's priorities, and then we can make reﬁnements based on those conversations. So I would never say that we're not at all capital constrained, because I think we naturally are, because we put our own constraints on, because we've got to take care of customer rates and make sure that we're going to have a really strong balance sheet. We're working on that.  As Anne just mentioned, we expect that FFO-to-debt to look a lot better once we get to year end, and going into 2024, I think in the interim here, it's going to be just a little bumpy as we work through a couple of the next few months, so I wouldn't be too concerned about that. I feel comfortable with the numbers I'm seeing, but we'll continue to be very disciplined around which dollars we put to work where, that it's consistent with what our stakeholders need and want, taking care of our customer, and then just being a deﬁcient as we can, so my focus is going to be more at this point on let's close that gap on the ROE, that's the piece that I can try to do my best to control."
"Got it. Terriﬁc. And no it does, and then we do appreciate some of the salient points you brought up in your prepared remarks as far as the outreach to the regulatory folks in various stakeholders. So thank you for that points.",Yes. Thank you for the coverage.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And next we go to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan and please go ahead.
Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.
"I want to kind of follow up on some points that you were just touching on here, because some of the dockets and local media attention have highlighted some regulatory pushback in certain areas of late, and you mentioned reaching out to local commissioners to build relations there. Just wondering over what time frame you expect to kind of me all [ph] them? Is this a change in regulatory strategy where they hear from headquarters more regularly here? Just wondering how you think about this type of outreach going forward.","Well, Jeremy, I love that question. So I'm going to tell you from my perspective, this is coming from a former operating company President, so I keep that hat kind of in my back pocket that I got to throw on from time to time. And so let me start with this. What my hope to do -- what I hope to do or achieve is pave the way or clear the path for our operating companies so that they can do the best they can do, boots on the ground. And so my objective is to get out to make sure that I'm talking with diﬀerent commissioners. And by the way, that's already underway. So I've already been out talking with several folks, and I've got my calendar lined up over the next few months to continue that eﬀort. So I'm not going to get into necessarily exactly who I'm talking to when, but that's well underway. So rest assured that's happening.  But I just -- I want to make sure that they're hearing from me and that they understand that AEP, the parent or the service core is here to provide clearance in service and support for the individual operating companies really that's the only reason the service core exists is to support the operating companies. And they need them to hear that for me and more importantly, I just want to be a really good listener so that I can be really good at my job, so I can take care of our customers, take care of my team, and then ultimately take care of my investors and the other stakeholders that are party to everything that we're doing here.  So I don't want people to think that I'm stepping in the way or thinking that something's not right, because that's not the case at all. I just want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support the teams so that they can be as successful as they possibly can be. Because here's the other point, right? You call out the fact that there are pressure points as it relates to regulatory activities. I think that's going to be what we're dealing with for the next several years. We got a lot of headwinds now, the game's changed. The industry is going through a material transition.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Each of our states is in a diﬀerent place as it relates to their economies. And so I think everybody's doing their jobs, and that means we got to do ours too. We have been doing it, but we have to be really good listeners and learners and adjusters. And I think that goes for all the diﬀerent stakeholders. So the more dialogue we can have, I think the smarter we're going to be. And if nothing else, not we only be able to take care of the customer and make sure we're keeping the lights on in delivering this product that makes life possible, but I think we're going to be doing it in a much more eﬀective way, and we're going to have to pick up the pace too.  So we got to do it in a faster way than we've ever done it in our history. So I think it's exciting. I love getting out and talking with people. You guys know from the street, I love getting out and talking with you too, so that's not going to stop. So I just got to work my calendar, and I'll be out front, and I'm happy to talk about any of the conversations that I've had."
"Got it. That's very helpful. And just one more along these lines, dialing in a little bit more. In Kentucky, our local stakeholder conversations highlight a focus on increased distribution investment as a priority, as opposed to the more recent, I guess, transmission investment, which could help local stakeholder relations there with a focus on distribution. Just wondering, how you see a Kentucky strategy evolving over time here?","Yes, I'll tell you. Let me start with this. Again, having been a former CFO as well, I -- at 1.6% ROE, yes, we've got to work on that. And that to me, when I see that number, that's not a ﬁnancially healthy, sustainably healthy entity. So that's why we're going through the case activities. So we're going to work on that. And that's exactly why we went out and socialize the case well in advance with dozens of meetings with a variety of diﬀerent stakeholders, so again listening and learning so we understand where everybody's kind of shaken out but also understanding what it is that we need to do so that we're successful, not only in taking care of our customers but making sure we're doing everything we can to make sure that the stakeholders understand what our objectives are and are comfortable with it.  So yes, the objective is to, A, get a plan in place that will allow us to improve the ﬁnancial positioning of the company which then enables us to make future investments to take care of the customers. They need the power too, it doesn't matter which state you're sitting in, but the idea is to engage in these activities, hopefully have a really good case. And I don't expect it to be easy, it's not supposed to be easy. If it was easy, everybody would be doing it. So we'll engage in those activities and hopefully get us on a path forward that enables us to continue to invest in a really smart way in the state that everybody can feel good about."
Got it so there's room to pivot towards more distribution over transmission. It sounds like you are working with stakeholders there.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Absolutely. And so those are the conversations that we're having. We do know that transmission has been very important to the commission, and so that is top of mind for us as well, and we've worked that into the structures that we've essentially set forth in our case. But at the end of the day, it's the distribution that also matters, because we got to keep the lights on."
Got it. I'll leave it there thank you very much.,You bet. Thank you.  Operator  And next we'll move to Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.,You bet.
"First oﬀ, Page 12, Slide 12. Miss, maybe I've been following it too long, but I think over the last 10 years, the total debt to total capitalization has gone from 53%, now it seats at 65%. I'm just wondering, does that stabilize or where do you see the sweet spot for total debt to total capitalization?","Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question. So it has inched up, as you can see on the graph. I mean, 60% is our sweet spot, and that's what we're targeting going forward. As you can see, we're above that right now. We do expect that to decrease with the contract of renewable sale proceeds and also the equity unit conversion. So that's a couple of hundred basis points that'll reduce that closer to the 60%, but we still have some work to do."
"Great. And then if I stayed on the balance sheet here, I think you've talked about your plan to be in the target, and I hope this is correct, in 2024. If I could get real granular, when do you think you're going to get into the midpoint of your 14% to 15% range? Is that something you'd talk about?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. I mean, I would say we're going to be -- we say we're going to be in the target in 2024, and I think approaching the midpoint probably by the end of 2024. There are the ﬂuctuations, as I mentioned, in FFO that we're experiencing, and that's just really due to timing of quarter-over- quarter fund ﬂows. And so you will see, especially in 2023, that it will be depressed until the fourth quarter when we really see that switch in the FF -- in the collateral collections in improving our FFO there. So that's what's going to take some time. But we do expect it to increase, like I said, materially by the fourth quarter and then into next year.     And Anthony, just to put a little ﬁner point on it, too, remember our threshold that we're sensitive to is 13% as it relates to our BAA2 rating from Moody's, and so that's why we toggle to the 14% to 15%, because what we want to have is cushion, so 14% deﬁnitely gives us some cushion. So keep that in mind as well. And the other thing I mentioned in my comments too is, as we proceed through the rest of this year, you can expect maybe a little more pressure as we go through the next couple of months with some improvement as we get to the fourth quarter. We just want to manage those expectations.     Yes. The other thing just to highlight is that, we're talking a lot about the timing of collateral payments, about 80% of that volatility that we're seeing relates to our retail business, which, as you know, is for sale. So once we sell that business, we would expect that reduction in volatility going forward."
"And then just lastly, Julie, I appreciate all the commentary you've given on the regulatory strategy, and especially, Kentucky. And I know, Kentucky is a very small piece, but when you look at the equalizer chart, I mean, the ROE is pretty low. What's a reasonable assumption for us to use? Where that ROE could go in -- by 2024? I mean, does that go to an allowed of 9.9%? I'm just curious, how long does it take to recover the regulated returns of the utility?","Yes, Anthony, it's going to take a while. Do not expect a ﬂash cut. And so remember in our case, we requested a 9.9% ROE. Our current authorized is 9.3%. I'm looking at page number 34 in the slide deck right now. It will be a walk. So that's something we're trying to manage our own expectations around as well as for you all as you work to model. So stay tuned and let's let this case proceed and see how things move along, and then we can continue to kind of dial that in and give you more direct guidance. Okay."
Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I really appreciate it.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),You bet. Thanks for being on the call.  Operator  And we can go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Thank you, Julie and team. Good morning. Appreciate it.","Good morning, Julien."
"Maybe to follow up on some of the last few questions here, if I can. Just as you think about some of these headwinds here with respect to securitization heading into '24, obviously, you sound fairly conﬁdent, not just in oﬀsetting the weather year-to-date, but in the '24 items here. Can you talk about some of those tailwinds here or some of the forthcoming oﬀsets? What else gives you the conﬁdence in having that linear trajectory on the 6% to 7% here, if you can speak to that a little bit more? And maybe related to that, can you talk about maybe the timing of some of these items to the extent to which some of those headwinds on securitization bleed into '25 as well? I don't want to be too myopic on the current -- the next year.","Yes. No. I mean, what I'll do is I'll start with kind of addressing the 2023 earnings guidance question. If you look, we were $0.18 below prior year, and we guided to year-over-year for the full year, it's about $0.20 improvement. So that's $0.38 that we need to outperform last year for the second half of the year. When I look at this, I think it's helpful to break it down into components. So weather was $0.29 over 2022, about $0.20 of that impact is versus normal. And that's why we've taken some action to oﬀset those headwinds.  Interest also is about $0.29 unfavorable year-to-date. It's running a bit above expectations, we had guided to $0.20, but that also didn't include interest on Kentucky, because we had expected to sell the business. So that's about $0.10 per year, and that's covered in revenues. So we had anticipated much of our year-over-year increase to be in the ﬁrst half of the year, because of the timing of the Fed action. So while we are a little bit short coming into the back half of the year, we also have the proceeds from the contracted renewable sale and equity unit conversion that will help reduce our debt somewhat, and we've taken other actions to oﬀset the increase in rates, because it has been -- that has been tightening a little bit longer.  When you look at O&M, unfavorable to last year in the ﬁrst half, but we expect this to reverse due to timing of our O&M spending. Our original guidance is planned for a reduction of O&M   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   during the second half of the year. Because last year's spending was a little bit robust on the O&M side in the back half, and so we had already anticipated a reduction, and then we've taken additional actions like those that I've mentioned to be able to make up for the reduction in weather volumes. And then lastly, there's a couple other things that we're pointing to.  One is the favorable trends in commercial load that we expect to continue and we've also seen favorable results in our generation in marketing business that will beneﬁt us this year. So putting that all together, that will give us the conﬁdence in our ability to meet our earnings guidance for this year. In terms of the maintaining the 6% to 7% EPS growth going forward, it's really a story on our capital deployment and we have a very robust capital pipeline that allows us to do just that.     And Julien, on that note, just to kind of put an end -- cap on this, I think the core is solid and so when you look out in the next few years, as Ann mentioned, we got $40 billion to put into work in terms of capital investment over the next ﬁve years. We'll continue to work with our regulators to make sure that we're deploying the dollars where we all agree that they need to go. And then at that point, it's really around making sure that we also execute on I think the regulatory plans that we lay out there.  But as you know, we've got some strategic asset sales that are underway, so we'll deal with, the fact that some of those businesses are falling away rechanneling those dollars to the regulated pieces of the business, that will help us from the math perspective and making sure that we're getting all of those other balance sheet metrics that we need to make sure that we hit, so people aren't worried or concerned and we got a little more ﬂexibility so when we have a weather event or something of that nature we can easily sustain that but the core is solid and at this point it's around being eﬃcient putting the dollars to work where it makes sense and closing the gap on the ROEs."
"Got it. All right. Excellent. And if I could follow up brieﬂy on a couple details, just with respect to PSO, obviously, dynamic situation with the ALJ and settlement. Can you talk a little bit about your expectations here and maybe about what you've been planning in interim rates? Just obviously what happens, how you've been planning what's reﬂected in rates? If you don't mind a little bit of an update there.","Yes, so we implemented interim rates in early June, I think it was as it relates to the settlement that we had to put in place. And at this point, as you mentioned, the ALJ had its report that it is submitted, and then ﬁle -- exceptions were ﬁled, I think, it was yesterday to the ALJ report. So if you haven't taken a look at that, I would encourage you to take a look at that. But eﬀectively, the parties to the settlement agreement were absolutely supportive of the settlement agreement which we would have expected anyway. So we felt good about that, and we're going to let this thing play out over the next couple weeks really, because we're getting pretty close here.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Parties have four days to respond to the exceptions that were ﬁled and that is eﬀectively August 1st. And then we'll have an oral argument of the exception that's scheduled for mid-August and we would expect to get an order in September so stay tuned. The process is working, and like I mentioned, we've got interim rates in eﬀect and we will keep you apprised, but do go take a look at the exceptions I thought that was interesting."
"Duly noted. Thank you. All right, I'll leave it there. Good luck, guys. Speak to you soon.","Excellent. Thanks, Julien.  Operator  Next we'll go to David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."
"Hey, good morning, thanks for the questions.",Good morning.
Wanted to -- let's see. Could you give us some color on what your plans are going forward for Texas in terms of the generation outlook? You've had some challenges there just with the repeat renewables proposal. I'm wondering how you're thinking about that going forward in terms of strategy and generation solutions?,"Yes, absolutely. Yes, so we did ﬁle for rehearing, because we need to make sure that we're doing all we need to do from a traditional regulatory and administrative perspective. And then what you can anticipate AEP doing is essentially running another RFP and running another process, so that we can make sure that we're doing what we need to accommodate the capacity situation in Texas. I do believe that Texas understands there is an adequacy issue that we would otherwise have to deal with. So that's something that we will be proceeding forward with. So stand by, and you'll see what we come to the street with here in the not too distant future."
"Got it. And could there be a self-owned option in there? And to the extent there was, would that be, I guess, incremental to what's currently in the renewable generation outlook for CapEx   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   plan?","Yes, that's a possibility. But what we would do is accommodate any type of investment in the current CapEx forecast."
Okay. Got it. Understood.,Yes.
"And then, you do have a couple other renewable projects out there for approval this quarter in several states. I was just wondering if you could give a sense of your conﬁdence level in those -- grid proposals that you put forth, and what alternatives you might have if there end up being challenges in any of those.","Yes. And actually, I'm trying to ﬂip to the page so we can kind of draw everyone's attention to them right now. I'm looking at Page number 32. So for example, we've got an application open in Virginia, and we made the same ﬁling in West Virginia for Appalachian Power Company. We're talking about 151 megawatts, about a $500 million investment for wind and storage capacity there. At this point, the process is proceeding along as we would expect, so I have nothing new to report. So stand by there.  And trying to think of where else we have open cases. In Indiana, Michigan, it looks like staﬀ has been supportive on the Michigan side through those applications, and an Indiana order is expected in 3Q, so the third quarter of this year. So stay tuned there as well. But so far, constructive and productive, and we're moving forward. Then of course we also have, I guess, I should call out the wind investment. Rock Falls, that's included in the base case at PSO, but that's part of the base case settlement. So as you know, I just mentioned that we're well underway in that proceeding."
"Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks so much.",Thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  And we can go to Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
"Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I have a couple of questions here. First is on the renewables, right? So clearly Texas, maybe has lesser appetite for renewables at this point. And I'm just curious, if you -- how much of the incremental appetite for this do you think is left in Louisiana, and like other states that picked up the slack in this particular instance? Is there risk in the near term, I guess, in your mind that those states would also turn down potential future proposals because of their perception that they had, they're pretty much like full as far as renewable generation goes?","Sophie, I appreciate that question very much, because as you know, that's been top of mind for us as we work through that proceeding. So we obviously got the approval for the 999 megawatts in Louisiana ﬂexed up. So we're moving along in that regard. You may recall that we also had another process that was underway for SWEPCO in particular. I want to say it was 2,400 megawatts that we were seeking interest in as it relates to how we would put that portfolio together.  And so what we've done is we've actually tabled that, and we'll be coming back to everyone to say, look, we want to look at this from an all-source perspective, including PPAs, so stay tuned on that, because there is absolutely a capacity need. It's just going to take a little diﬀerent shape than what we were initially expecting as we were running that RFP process. And remember, you probably heard me saying earlier here today on the call, we need to make sure that we're listening to our regulators. And so this is exactly what we're doing as it relates to the conversation and the experience that we just had in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. And so we are adjusting and moving forward, so there will be more RFPs. Stay tuned for that.  And they will be more all-source oriented, no diﬀerent than what we would be doing in Texas is as you call out. Yes, it looks like not a lot of interest in renewables there right now, so we need to think about what the other alternatives are, but we will work together with our regulators so that we can make sure that we're doing what the state needs, because at the end of the day, this is all about making sure that our customers have reliable, aﬀordable electricity, period.     Yes. And just to reiterate on our capital plan. So far, $5.2 billion of projects have already been approved, and we have another $1.7 billion that Julie just talked about in the regulatory process. That's out of our $8.6 billion, so we are well on our way. And we also have ﬂexibility with our transmission and distribution investments that are still in, to the extent that anything else gets delayed a little bit in the process with these RFPs."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great, great, thank you. And my other question was in the ROEs, maybe I'm referencing Slide 34 here. Am I reading this right, that the 40 bps --depressed by 40 bps on mild weather is sort of average across the board? So if it wasn't for weather, all of these bubbles would be, like, roughly 40 bps higher, or how should we think about this? There's like a lot of numbers here.","Yes, that 40 bps is on average, okay? So let me answer it this way though, because when I'm thinking about what does this mean for the rest of the year, and as I mentioned in my opening comments, we had initially anticipated or expected on a weighted average basis, we'd be about a 9.4% ROE across our operating companies in our 2023 guidance. And so now what we're suggesting is now that we have a little bit of a hole that is associated with weather on that ROE, can't make all that up, I don't think, unless we had some ridiculous weather circumstance in the back half of this year. So we're not going to bet on that, because we're going to bet on normal. And so what I would expect is, we expect to improve from 8.6%. We'll not get to that 9.4%.  So even if you get closer to 9%, I think that's reasonable. And our point that we want to make today is despite the fact that we've had pressure as a result of weather, we're adjusting the sales and we fully well expect to be within our guidance range. And so that's the important key to take away today as it relates to our messaging, then with also the understanding behind the scenes, we just need to fundamentally do our very best to make sure we're earning as close as possible to those authorized ROEs beyond the weather situation."
"Got it. So just to be clear, the 8.6% is the average with the transmission holdco?","Yes, 8.6% --"
Of all distribution --,"That's weighted average, yes."
Got it. Thank you. That's all for me.,"You bet. No, thank you.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  And next, we could go to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.     Hey, Paul."
Hey. How you doing?,How you doing?
"So -- I'm managing. So just most of my questions have been answered. Only, I have a question for you that's a little bit diﬀerent. And that is the Chevron defense. It looks like that the Supreme Court might act on it, and I'm kind of scratching my head, and I'm thinking what you guys might be thinking about what might happen if, in fact, the Chevron doctrine or whatever you want to call it, is substantially changed or repealed or what have you. Have you guys thought about this? Or I'm sure you've thought about it, but any ideas about what you think that might mean for you guys on the ground?","Paul, I don't have a lot of detail to share with you today. I do know that our legal team is looking into this and our strategy team, but for my day-to-day right now at the moment, it's not been top of mind. I'm just taking comfort knowing that the rest of the team is working on it, but hey, if you want to have a conversation, I'm happy to circle back."
"Okay, sure. It wasn't my ﬁrst question, but --",Okay.
The rest were answered. So thanks so much. And I'll follow up with you guys later.,American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   That'd be great. Thank you.
"Okay, great. Thank you.  Operator  And we'll go to Paul Fremont with Ladenburg. Please go ahead.",
"Thank you very much. I guess my ﬁrst question is, if you were to get the securitization proceeds, does that change the equity issuance plans that you lay out on Slide 28?","No, it really doesn't. So if we get the securitization proceeds, what we would do is reinvest that into the other areas within the AEP footprint. So not in APCo, but in the other areas, so that we're making sure that we continue to earn on the investment while getting the beneﬁts to the Appalachian Power customers."
"And then my second question, sort of related, is if you were to get incremental CapEx, what percent should we assume would be equity funded versus, let's say, debt funded?","Yes, I mean, I would assume just kind of the average of what we have in the current plan.     Yes, Paul, we typically get -- if we have an opportunity to invest more, we're going to try to manage directly back to those target ratios that we throw out there. And obviously, be mindful of debt-to-cap as well. So at this point, we're focused entirely on executing on the plan that we already have out in front of you. The issue could be from time to time is how much slides from one year to the next. So you're kind of playing with a toothpaste tube, right? So you're just passing the CapEx back and forth. Because we've got $40 billion that we're putting to work.  And again, at this point, while we always have more opportunities, we need to make sure that this is aﬀordable for our customers as well, so that's going to be another stopping point for us, too, because we're essentially trying to thread the needle, make sure the balance sheet stays strong, make sure those metrics are absolutely in place, but make sure that our customers are able to aﬀord what we're essentially providing. Our regulators deﬁnitely help us with that, but that's also precisely why we had to be really disciplined and not just continuing to spend CapEx that would be fun and nice to spend and actually absolutely make our system stronger and   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   absolutely reliable, but is that what is necessary to keep the lights on and what customers can aﬀord. So it is a constant balancing act for us."
