Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning.","Hey, Julien.     How are you doing? Good."
"Hey, good. Congratulations.",Thank you.
"So, Nick let me go back to where you started the call a little bit, and certainly was impressed by the comment on being disappointed of not being at the high end of that 5% to 7% range. Can you comment a little bit on what gives you that conﬁdence today, just given some of the moving pieces in the end of the year, but also I just wanted to understand what your expectations are for that moderating ROE in Ohio? I know we've been talking about it for a little bit, but basically are you still talking about being at the higher end potentially despite having that moderation and where are the other pluses this year as you think about it?","Yeah. So yeah, we do expect the higher end of that moderation. And also as I look at the year going into it, certainly with the capital plan that we've put out there, the consistency associated with that as well, the opportunities that exist in front of us, we continue to look at those opportunities certainly in the integrated resource plans that are ﬁled with the various states. What we're doing, not only from -- that from a bending O&M curve perspective. I think we have   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   more tailwinds than headwinds. And I -- when we look at the plan that we put forward, it's a solid plan. And as I have reiterated several times, it doesn't include some real opportunities out there for us to even achieve a better result.  So -- and I don't -- and really -- I really think of that as sustainable results not like up one year, down another year that kind of thing. We pride ourselves in that element of consistency and certainly the capital plan demonstrates that but also the opportunities ahead of us, there are more singular opportunities, more singles and doubles, because obviously if we had gotten something like Wind Catcher, for example, with front-end loaded, many of the integrated resource plan activities, but in this case, we're following these plans and they'll be smaller projects, they'll come into play and we'll see the continuing improvement. I think we have a great case for the utility and -- for the AEP utilities to own these assets. And depending upon the outcome of that, certainly I would suspect some positive movement from that perspective.  So I feel good about it. I think I feel good about our culture, of the organization, our culture is around innovation, but it's also deﬁnitely around bending the O&M curve and addressing the issues in front of us. And you look at the -- for example, the weather last year in '17 versus, now it's two years ago, versus '18, very mild weather in '17, earnings still came in where we really we're telling the market they would come in at. '18 it was ahead, still came in where we said it would be and obviously beat the midpoint. So we have some resiliency that's built-in in our organization and the culture of the organization that really drives to those kinds of results. So I'm optimistic."
Excellent. And can you comment or perhaps elaborate rather on some of the developments in Oklahoma. You alluded to several potential positive riders and other new mechanisms (inaudible) in Oklahoma to help improve your earned ROEs. What does that mean with respect to another rate case or do you think largely you could achieve some of this through the current rate case. And I know it's still pending. But I just want to understand at least from a -- more of a process perspective how you're thinking about it here?,"Yeah, I certainly don't want to presuppose the outcome, it'd be great if we got pretty considerable result in this rate case to get us back on the even footing. And certainly Walmart, I guess, was one of the intervenors that had said obviously performance-based rate-making, you know, about that, but certainly looking -- forward looking test years, well that would be a great outcome to be able to look at forward looking test years. And as well some of the other even, I think it was the Attorney General and may have been someone else, but was opened to actually putting in additional generation -- additional distribution related rider activity.  So -- and that was -- still have work to do with the industrials, they were probably the most negative from an intervenor perspective. But I really believe when you look at the discussions and what was centered versus last -- the last case and the previous case, there at least now is recognition of the issues that we have. And there is no doubt that the issues that we're discussing are well known by the commissioners and certainly the intervenors. So I'm hopeful that it can certainly move to a more positive outcome.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   What we're looking for, obviously is progress, and we expect progress. And I think there it has to be a clear message around that, because we've languished since 2013 in Oklahoma. And that just has to change. And matter of fact, with the integrated resource plans, we have ﬁled in those various states, PSO in Oklahoma, obviously is one of those, we need to see a positive outcome of rate case where we make additional investments of that kind in the state and obviously the timing will workout to where we'll be able to make those kinds of decisions.  And then, I think it's pretty well known now that Tulsa, Oklahoma is like a second corporate headquarters to us with over 600 people there that focus on primarily the Western properties, but also some of the Eastern activities as well. Those are not PSO employees, they're AEP employees. So we should put AEP up on top of the building there so that Oklahoma knows that we do have a signiﬁcant presence there.  And I think that's important, and I think it's important to the livelihood of the Tulsa area, but also I think it's important for this Company to be able to have a central location like that, that we're able to operate out of. So there's a lot of things in the context of all this, that's probably becoming more well known and hopefully all drive us to a better outcome."
Excellent. Thank you. Best of luck.,"Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.     Good morning, Jonathan."
"Good morning, guys. Hi.",Good morning.
Good morning. Just trying to get back to your comments on the upper end of the or upper range of the 5% to 7%. Were those speciﬁc to 2019 guidance or were they more a statement   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   about your conﬁdence in executing in that range on over the ﬁve-year plan? I wasn't quite clear when you said it at the outset?,"Yeah, we said 5% to 7% growth rate, long-term growth rate over the future periods. And obviously when you put in renewables, that are not going to be in place until 2022 from a ﬁnancial standpoint, that's part of it. So it's -- I would say it's geared more towards the long- term, but the trajectory should hold true. And there will be things that come in during '19, there will be things that come in during '20 and '21 and in the future years. So I think we have real opportunities in each and every year, but obviously we're positioning this as part of our 5% to 7% growth rate."
Okay. So that upper range that was kind of over the plan eﬀectively?,"Yeah, that's right."
"Yeah. Great, thank you, Nick for that. And then on just the slowdown you saw in sales in the fourth quarter, can you give us a little more of a sense of why you remain conﬁdent keeping the 2019 sales estimate unchanged from EEI and maybe some color on what you're seeing early this year and what you're hearing from your customers?","Yeah, certainly Brian can cover this in more detail, but the way I see it is, we're seeing somewhat of a tempered economy because of the trade issues. And as Brian mentioned, that we have a lot of companies in our territory that are, certainly trade has an impact and once those shackles come oﬀ, we believe the economy will continue on its previous trajectory. And so, it's certainly diﬃcult to tell when that's going to happen. But I think you're hearing some more promising dialog from our national leaders. Let's hope that continues to be the case.  But even then, I guess probably we look at customer accounts. Customer accounts is up considerably. So we're very happy with that and the fundamentals seem to still be in place for the economy continuing to roll along. From the world economy perspective, obviously that would have an impact, but I think that's probably again tariﬀ-driven from many respects.     Julien [ph], a lot of the growth that we anticipate in 2019 is going to be driven by the industrial space. And particularly industrial space in the oil and gas sector, we see a lot of company- proposed and company invest and customer invested in expansions in that area. And they are   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   close at hand, we expect a lot of those to come on in 2019. In the fourth quarter oil and gas was up 5.6%, in the third quarter it was up 7.7% and we expect that expansion to continue in 2019."
"Brian, can you do the math for us though, how much everything that wasn't oil and gas was down in 4Q?","Yeah. In the fourth quarter, it was down 0.6%, non-oil and gas industrial. And in the third quarter, non-oil and gas industrial was up 0.6%."
"Okay. And then obviously -- so obviously your outlook is premised on assumption that growth continues. You talked about the plan having been building resilience, the company. Could you talk maybe a little bit about how resilient you think your plan is to maybe if that view doesn't pan out?","Yeah, I think if you look at and Nick talked about it, the change that we had year-on-year, '17 to '18 in terms of weather and how we were able to adjust O&M in both years, to be able to hit our numbers, I think that demonstrates that resilience, so whether it's weather, whether it's load growth, whether it's tariﬀ impact or whatever, we actively manage our way throughout the year putting the brakes on or the accelerator on as the case may be to get work done that we need to get done. So I think just the weather year-on-year demonstrates that resiliency.     And I think we are seeing sort of a -- if you put a microscope to it, with the industrials impacted by the tariﬀs in particular, the commercials, particularly the supply to the major industrials and those kinds of establishments all have an impact. And I think we'll probably see in somewhat of an immediate impact there. And again, I think as the industrial start to pick back up, the commercials should start to come back as well."
"Thank you, guys.","Yeah.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust. Your line is open.     Hey, Ali."
"Hey, good morning.",Good morning.
"First question, Nick or Brian, just reconﬁrming when you talk about the 5% to 7% growth rate, what's the base, have we changed, have you rolled it forward or can you just remind us the base year for that?",It's the midpoint of 2018 guidance. So it's oﬀ 3.85.
Oﬀ 3.85. I got you.,"Yeah, yeah 3.85."
"I see, okay. And then the renewables that you talked about in Ohio and in other places, the potential, if you do get approvals for those, can you just remind us in aggregate, what kind of incremental CapEx we'd be talking about and roughly over what period?","Yes, so as for the renewables in Ohio that we've been talking about, it's not incremental CapEx, right? So the solar that we're talking about are going to be PPAs. So that's not CapEx. For the competitive renewables, okay, so, I'm not talking about Ohio, but I'm talking about Chuck's business, for the ﬁve-year period, '19 forward, we anticipate spending about $2.2 billion over that ﬁve-year period.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      But the renewables associated with the regulated side of the integrated resource plans of PSO and SWEPCo, that would be additional capital requirements based upon really what the ownership percentage winds up being.     And important to say, Nick, because we get these questions, the earnings associated with that are not reﬂected in our numbers today.     That's right. That's right. And as far as Ohio is concerned, we elected not to participate in the construction of the project. But at the end of the day when we get approval, there is an added component to the plan going forward, that really reinforces our cap structure at AEP Ohio and evaluates the risk associated with long-term PPA events of that sort in the construction. So you'll still see the earnings impact of the Ohio solar as well."
"I see, but just to be clear, the -- from a regulated grade base perspective, there is no incremental CapEx associated with the Ohio renewables? Did I hear that...",No and actually when the bids come in in March we'll have a better understanding of what the CapEx looks like.     That's for the consumer protection plan.     Yeah.
"Okay. And the CapEx numbers that you have in the back of the slide, no changes there since EEI, is that correct?",That's correct.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Yeah. And my last question on Oklahoma, Nick, I mean again, assuming that the outcome is sub-optimal or not as good as you would like it to be, what's your latest thinking there? Does that still give you hope that you can keep pushing and maybe get to the end result or how are you thinking about Oklahoma post this last -- this current rate case?","I think some of the positions taken by the intervenors and others, there is some calls for hope at least there is recognition of the issues. But I'm not going to presuppose the outcome, because I did that two times before and who knows what the outcome will be that -- certainly the issue should be very well known. I would say that just based on the response of the intervenors, it's marginally better than what -- how they responded earlier.  So I guess you can look at that as some positive, but we won't know until we get into discussions with them or -- and go through the -- go through this process, really what matters is what the Oklahoma Commission comes up with in terms of renting in order. And do they recognize the value that PSO provides to the state. And so, that's what we're looking for and if -- and as I have said earlier, we will wait for those results and then we'll make determinations of what the next steps are."
Understood. Thank you.,Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Good morning.,"Good morning, Paul."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Can you just clarify when you say, bend the O&M curve, is that decelerating O&M growth, is that ﬂattening or is it negative growth?","Negative.     Yeah it's negative. We really -- by bending, we wanted to go negative."
"Okay. Can you try and give a percentage kind of, to think about over the next few years?","Yeah. So we haven't said what that would be, Paul. If you look at our $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion that we've been in for about the last eight years, we're looking to break through that and turn that negative. And we have plans to do that. It includes what we've done on lean activities, what we've done on process improvement. It includes automation, box, it includes partnering with third-party suppliers like what we've done with an accounting and tax initiative with Accenture and it's bringing all those things to bear across the Company that we're going to try and break through that $2.8 billion of non -- of spending that's not altered in pass throughs."
"Thank you. And then just to clarify, the 5% to 7% does not include renewables, FPSO or SWEPCo or Chuck's business, is that correct?",It includes the capital in Chuck's business.
Okay.,The $2.2 billion over the plan. It does not include the regulated renewables and does not include Ohio.
Thank you. And then any projects that could be impacted by the situation at FERC?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"No, no, we don't see any projects impacted from that perspective, because FERC obviously continues to advance transmission spending and actually the resource projects themselves, we moved to less transmission involved with those, so I'm assuming you're talking about transmission."
"Yes, sorry.",Yeah. We don't see any impact there.
"And then ﬁnally, the 2.8% reduction in commercial sales, is that just quarterly volatility or was there something more underlying there?","We think it's quarterly volatility, we don't see that continuing as a trend in the 2019, could have been associated with higher consumer interest costs and some demand side management that we see across our system. But we don't see that as continuing into the new year."
Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.,"Good morning, Praful."
Thanks so much. Hi guys.,Good morning.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Good morning. So just ﬁrst want to understand, in Chuck's business, any exposure to PG&E or California utilities that we should be aware of or thinking about?",No.
"Okay, good. That...","Yeah. There is the right answer. Very fortunate in that regard, a lot of our oﬀ takes are with municipals co-ops and end-use customers."
"Okay, great. Yes, so dodged a bullet, which is great. I guess just touching on the review, I guess strategic review that you've talked about in the past and obviously you've touched on Oklahoma already, but just from a strategic perspective, is there any view that we should be thinking about around any of the utilities, if they don't -- if you don't get the outcomes you're looking for. Is that still on the table right now or is that too far out at least not a 2019 event?","So I think and the way we look at it is, every utility that we have, we wanted to grow and prosper. And to the extent that they can grow and prosper and have proper regulatory treatment, it's a great outcome. I think a couple -- three years ago we -- I guess for years we're talking about Kentucky and Kentucky has turned around, we focused on two things.  The regulatory relationship and the compact that we have there, but also our emphasis placed upon the economic development in the State of Kentucky. And that picture has turned around markedly for PSO, PSO is now in the radar screen and probably in the middle of the radar screen, because we deﬁnitely want to be a part of the economic development picture of Oklahoma. And we deﬁnitely want to be able to move forward in a very positive way on investments that beneﬁt the customer experience in that state.  So the way we look at it is, we have a set of assets and if they perform well, ﬁne. If they're chronically underperforming then we have to take steps in some fashion to alleviate that situation for our shareholders and really the focus, because many times when you have an underachiever a lot of eﬀort goes into trying to reconcile the situation and there are some that say, that PSO doesn't have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem. And that is just so far from the truth, it's just incredible, because we run seven utilities and we run those utilities in   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   much the same fashion. And we know what it takes to provide the customer services required and PSO has been at the top of the list in terms of its performance.  And I really believe that if you're a residential customer, if you're an industrial customer, you should really take a hard look at what's happening there in Oklahoma and could very well have an impact on not only the presence in the future, but also the customer experience itself and we don't want that to happen. So as we look at these assets obviously, we'll continue to make steps to further optimize our portfolio based upon what we see."
"Got you, that's super helpful. And then -- and ﬁnally, clearly you guys have been able to manage through diﬀerent load proﬁle years. But it sounds like if you do have the shackles that are continuing to stay, let's say, from tariﬀs and other constraints from a macro perspective and if weather doesn't work in your favor, is there any time that we should be worried about the '19 proﬁle or do you think you have enough tools in the toolkit to manage through any of those potentially macro challenges around the earnings for '19?","Yeah, I think we're ﬁne. We've had, and if you looked over the last two years, three years and maybe even longer than that, we've had perturbations of customer class going up and down and actually residential going down, has more of an impact than commercial or industrial. And so, the mix obviously has an impact, because the margins are diﬀerent based upon each customer class.  But our service territory is very diverse, very -- certainly every part of the economy is represented and our customer mix is really pretty resilient in and of itself. So there's a lot of internal levers that continue to adjust for one another from that perspective. But at the same time, we will adjust when the economy is -- if the economy were to chronically be suﬀering and we saw that on a continual successive quarterly trend, then we would certainly make adjustments that were necessary to ensure that we remain ﬁnancially healthy and we intend on doing that.  But I really believe we're in good shape from that perspective. And we'll watch this next quarter and the quarter after and hopefully we'll see some progress in the Federal government side. I think certainly immigration needs to get solved and the two parties need to start talking to one another again. And maybe that will warm up and then they'll move to greater and better things for the economy, but they've got to get going."
Got you. Thanks so much guys and congratulations.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI. Your line is open.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Good morning, Greg."
"Thanks guys. So just two quick questions. One, just to be clear you said the anchor for the 5% to 7% is 3.85 in '18?",Yes.
"Great. Okay. So I mean, I guess, this is just tautologically correct. But the high-end of the guidance range for '19 which would put you above 7%, you're not -- this is more of a long-term target than an annual, we're going to be tight inside this band [ph] type of guidance. I just to be clear on (multiple speakers)","Yes -- that's right. I think when you look at the midpoint of the 5% to 7%, and then you look at the opportunities available to us in that 5% to 7% bandwidth, it's -- like I said, it's more tailwinds and headwinds."
"And then just one ﬁnal question, because it's just been -- there's been some conversation about this. But you continue to give us a ﬁnancial forecast that even though the absolute level of leverages come up since 2013, the FFO to debt metric continues to be really resilient, just around 18% and you're still conﬁdent that through this forecast period, you can maintain, there'll be no deterioration in your FFO to debt metrics?","No, we haven't said that. We do anticipate that it will decrease over the time period and we expect it to approach to 15% level during the term of the forecast."
"Okay, okay. Well that's a higher number than the other people have prognosticated anyways. So I just wanted to make sure we understood what you thought the trend was. Thank you.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No, we're very interested in the FFO to debt percentage and we intend on maintaining our credit ratings."
Okay. So you think 15% is the -- is sort of where you'll trend down to over this forecast period?,"That area, yes."
"Okay, thank you.","Thanks, Greg.     Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Perfect. And our next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Your line is open."
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.,Good morning.
"I have a -- good morning. I have a bigger picture question. So we are hearing about this precipitous drop in prices for solar power and that more and more C&I customers are signing those contracts or PPAs simply because they see it as a way to heterogate [ph] volatility in forward natural gas prices, but also I mean those PPAs seem to be at prices which are now below observable forward power curves. So two questions. Do you see it as a risk to your Vertically Integrated Utilities, given that you do have commercial generation assets. And number two, is there a way to tap into this growth beyond that $2.2 billion that you're planning to spend on renewables on the commercial side?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","I would say, ﬁrst of all, we don't see a risk if we're doing it. And we are doing it, and I think we are in discussions with many customers about what their speciﬁc resource needs are. We are also looking at various technologies that enable that to happen and some of these are large customers. So we really have an opportunity to engage in that discussion.  But the other part of it too is, you see solar, you see energy storage, those types of applications continue to advance and that -- and with certainly on the transportation sector, you're making up -- whatever you're going to lose, you're going to make it up with channel growth -- sales channel growth, particularly associated with the advent of electric transportation.  So there is real opportunities for us to engage in that, and I think AEP is in a very, very favorable situation of being able to focus on those types of issues as opposed to something that some calamity that's occurred. And we're intent on making sure we maintain our operational excellence, so that we can focus on those particular types of activities.  And certainly that's happening not only on the regulated side, and obviously we're having to work with the regulators to broaden the perspective there. For example, continuity of service is not just a distribution line going to the home, it's distribution with energy storage derived through outages and really drive toward continuity of service as opposed to just basic service.  Certainly what we're doing with smart cities, what we're doing with other applications and engaging customers in a very substantial sense, those were things that we see as the future, and we're not going to be -- get left behind from that perspective. And as a matter of fact, from a technology standpoint, we're at the forefront of these technologies across the gamut. So we have pilots running in every one of our operating companies on various aspects of these technologies and we intend on that channel growth to occur."
