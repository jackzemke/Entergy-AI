Question,Answer
"If I'm just looking at your capital ﬂoor cash through 2019, it's about $5.6 billion a year and a 7.7% CAGR. Based on the current line of sight if you don't consider the wind project, would you expect a material drop oﬀ in core capital needs after 2019?","Hey, Kevin.     No."
"Okay. So then, the $4.5 billion, I think, is 35% wires and 65% for the wind assets?",That's right.
"The wind assets should be turnkey, so it wouldn't really impact EPS until probably 2021. What about the 35%? Would we see traditional rate making, like AFUDC, in 2020 or 2019?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah, that's right. That's right. It'd be traditional rate making on that."
Okay. That's all I have. Thanks guys.,Yes.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Just picking it up, also on the wind, the new investment, any thoughts, preliminary, Nick, on how you might ﬁnance this and how much room you have to put (35:02) leverage in the mix?","Yeah. So, obviously, we want to get to a point of getting Commission approvals, because I think this is a huge project. It's a great project. If you look at it company-by-company, it's not that huge. But when you look at the companies involved, the areas involved, we need to go through with the regulators and make sure they understand and see the beneﬁts; and, some already have, but the beneﬁts that we see in this project. Once we get to that point, then we'll be in a much better position to talk about ﬁnancing and capital required and whether we issue equity.  We've talked in the past about it. When you have a large project that really made sense and that we could focus the investment on that as opposed to the general confers of the corporation, then we believe investors should like that. So if we go down the road, we'll ﬁgure out what the appropriate mix is. And obviously, you know, we continue to look at capital, look at our credit metrics. I want to make sure we – that we remain a very ﬁrm foundation for investment. So Brian, I don't know if you have anything add to it.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I don't. We've always been thoughtful about how we ﬁnance our capital projects. As this progresses and we hear from the regulators, their interest in it, we'll look to put together a ﬁrm plan to make sure that we do it is as wisely as possible, as we do our regular capital program.     There are just not many projects you'll run into – and you know, really, the sense of urgency around getting approvals for this thing is centered on the federal government's basically given a 62%, 63% oﬀ sale and – with the PTCs; and, to take full advantage of the PTCs, that's $2.5 billion alone.  So obviously, we want to get this thing through. And when you get – take all that into account just to apply investment and that kind of capital and reduce customer bills as a result and produce actually a more – certainly, a more resilient system as a result, I think is a great thing. So – but we'll have to ﬁgure it out when we get there."
"Nick, can you give any insight into the calculation of the $7 billion customer beneﬁt, like do you – are you assuming a carbon price? With what sort of level, and just is there anything else to kind of help us kind of get to that number?","Yes. So you know, we've obviously assumed a natural gas price going forward, because, obviously, this is a important hedge against fuel cost. And when you look at – we did (37:59- 38:10) diﬀerentials. Obviously, we looked at carbon, and we looked at the value of the production tax credit. So those three components certainly provided the center of the analysis.  And we've looked at mid-range cases. We've looked at low cases in terms of natural gas pricing and that kind of thing, and it still stands up. I mean, when you look at the – certainly, the immediate beneﬁts and the real beneﬁts of the PTCs along with what could happen with carbon, what could happen with natural gas prices, it just looks like a great project. So..."
"The $7 billion number, the $2.7 billion NPV, is that kind of the mid scenario, or where does that ﬁt within the range of scenarios you looked at?","Yes, that's the mid case scenario, which was still a reasonably low natural gas price comparison."
"Okay. And then, could I just – ﬁnally, on the transmission piece, obviously, you said normal rate making, but what's the – would that also be predominantly spending that would fall kind of in   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   the back half of – very end of your plan into the sort of beyond 2019 period?",Absolutely.     Yes.
Okay. So we should think about this as more how we sustain 5% to 7% rather than incremental to or...,"That's a good question. You know, obviously, our indigenous utility growth is centered on 5% to 7%. I think it should make the 5% to 7% more robust."
Okay. Thank you very much.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.,"Hi, Chris. How are you doing?"
"Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"Just to follow up yet again on the wind project, I don't think you talked about recovery for the actual generation portion of it. If you take ownership at a speciﬁc kind of date when it becomes   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   commercial, I guess you could time it with a general rate case, certainly, but would you also pursue a rider on top of that just to have a measure of a safe cushion there?","Yeah, we will. And then, you know, it's part of the normal rate making process, but we would obviously be ﬁling for whatever CCN approvals and we got – there's an exception to the MBM rule, the Market Based Mechanism, in Louisiana that, I guess, a hearing just yesterday or the day before approved an exception for that. So you're going through the right steps to get to the point where the Commissions become comfortable with the investment, and then we'll go through the normal rate making process for both the generation and the transmission."
"Okay. And then, I think one of your peers had gotten some support from committing to local procurement of equipment with a project in Colorado. Are there any other kind of oﬀerings that you're making to politicians and the Commissions down the road that would help kind of garner support here?","Yes, certainly. I mean, obviously, you don't do a project like this without looking at the socio- economic beneﬁts in the region and for the customers. So – and even Governor Hutchison this morning mentioned it's good for jobs in Arkansas as well, but substantial – certainly, there's substantial procurement in all four of the states involved."
"Okay. And then, switching gears to rate making, the PSO ﬁling that you just made had a pretty big ask and you just got a conclusion of a rate case with new rates eﬀective early this year in that jurisdiction. I (42:22) 9.5% authorized ROE. Could you just remind us of some of the challenges that you faced in getting that rate case across the ﬁnish line, if any?","So with the previous rate case in Oklahoma, obviously, we were disappointed with that outcome; and, it was a somewhat challenging time in many respects. And when you – when we look at the present case, our message has clearly been that this is a very important rate case for Oklahoma, because Oklahoma was doing just ﬁne from a jurisdictional perspective up until a couple of years ago, and then the last rate case was really deﬁcient in terms of its outcome because not only was the timeframe long to get it resolved, but also the outcome is, in eﬀect, chasing expenses that are being made on behalf of customers.  So we've got to get that back on the right track, and that's why this case is so important. Not only will it send a signal that we can invest the way we feel like we should in Oklahoma, and can in Oklahoma, but also have an impact on projects like we just discussed, because you really have to think about investments in jurisdictions that are chronically short.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Oklahoma has not been that, and I think we're viewing sort of a perturbation that we can recover from. And I truly believe that Oklahoma and Stuart Solomon down at PSO, which is our President down at PSO, is working very hard to get that message across to everyone involved that in order to have a successful Oklahoma from an energy standpoint, PSO has to be part of that picture. And certainly, we're focused on making sure we get a good outcome."
Okay. Can you just remind us of the test year in that case and any kind of true-ups throughout the process?,"Yeah. Do you have the test year...? Let's see.     Chris, we can have Bette Jo get you that detail     Yeah."
"Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.",Thanks.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Anthony Crowdell from Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning.","Hey, Anthony."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Just to stay on the wind and follow up on Jonathan's question, so this is wind that would be in rate base and this is wind that you had said is kind of, you used the word, more robust incremental to 5% to 7% utility growth?","Certainly, we still maintain our 5% to 7% earnings growth trajectory and, really, we'll have to see how this project gets resolved in combination with all the other projects that we're doing to see what it does to be ultimate growth rate going forward. So in and of itself, the project is incremental, but obviously, we need to – before we start talking about changes in growth rates, we need to make absolutely sure what project we have, and also how it plays in concert with all the other capital programs we have in place."
Would more generation in a region put even more stress on the unregulated portion of the Turk plant?,"So you have the 88 megawatts of Turk sitting out there, but when we did the analysis, you know, we showed that even though you're taking some 9 million megawatt hours of wind power and energy coming in, you still need the capacity across the board. And in fact, when we looked at the capacity factors of the other generation, you only saw a very small 1% to 3% drop oﬀ in terms of capacity factor on coal. And certainly, even with natural gas, it wasn't that large of a drop oﬀ.  So this is really playing against, you know, the forward view of ﬁtting in a slice of energy to the beneﬁt of consumers, but still using the capacity out there that's available. So it could put more pressure on the unregulated part of Turk, but Turk is a very eﬃcient unit not – I don't think it's going to be – I mean, any diﬀerence is probably going to be negligible at best."
"Okay. And just switching gears, Ohio, you had said that I – I don't know if it's – you used the word settlement discussions are going on or potential for settlement with the extension of the ESP. Do you think there's issues with – you have – in the legislature, you have, is it HB 247, I think to end ESPs or to change the way utilities ﬁle rate case in Ohio? At the same time, at the PUC you're trying to extend the settlement of an ESP. You think that may cause any – may prohibit you from reaching a settlement there?","No, I don't think that legislation is going to go very far."
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from Leslie Rich from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.     Hey, Leslie."
"Hi, how are you?",Fine.
"Just for a little clariﬁcation, I'm sorry if it's sort of already been covered, but you would ﬁle for approval shortly for the wind projects? And then, you would plan to commence construction, if approved, in 2018 at some point?",That's right.
Mid 2018?,"Yeah, and we'd be looking for an outcome on those regulatory cases by April of next year. So we don't have much time to waste on that one. It really is – it's really driven by making sure we can take full advantage of the PTCs. That's the driver. And for the Commissions that take a look at this, you know, it is a fairly unique situation in that, yes, it's great generation resources. Yes, it provides considerable beneﬁts to customers, but the timing of it needs to match up so that we can be successful in terms of putting it in place and taking advantage of those PTCs."
"So you've already safe-harbored the equipment, or I guess the developer has done that?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yes. Yes, we have."
"And I guess, why does the region need 2,000 megawatts of generation? I mean, are you shutting other plants? Are you – you know, is demand growing? You said capacity factors on (49:48) gas plants won't decline that much.","Yeah, Leslie, and really – and this is probably the most important point to be made in the regulatory ﬁlings, and I'm glad you asked that question. This is really – any wind power project is an energy play, not a capacity play. So from an energy perspective, you're going to get 9 million megawatt hours out of it coming into the system, but at the same time you're only going to get, I think, an SBP that's only like 7%. I may be oﬀ by a percent or two, but only 7% counts as capacity.  So you still need the other units to provide capacity, and they ﬁll in from an energy perspective as well. So we just have to keep in mind, this project, the diﬀerence in capacity and energy. We're not shutting any other units down. Those units are absolutely needed.  But what it does do is provide more diversity from a resource perspective, low energy – very low energy pricing coming in to the sector, which means economic growth. And then, when you think about the transmission side of things, yes, it's a 765, 360-some-odd mile generation interconnect, but usually with large transmission you get large economic development. So I see this as just an extremely important project not just from a energy consumption standpoint, but from an economic development standpoint as well."
So the beneﬁts to customers are from lower fuel costs?,"Absolutely. You know, you're basically – it's a hedge and it's an arbitrage against, primarily, fossil fuel generation resources. And so, if you're able to take the energy and continue with the capacity as used and useful, it's another powerful combination just like we used to do coal pricing versus natural gas pricing. Now you have coal pricing, natural gas pricing and, certainly, the intermittent resources provided from a wind power perspective. So just adds another part of the portfolio."
So do you anticipate that when you make these ﬁlings that it would result in rate increases to customers?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"No. No, it won't. Actually, that's the amazing part of it. You're investing a large part of the capital, but keep in mind the government's paying you – the federal government's paying you for a substantial part of this capital. And then, it's being used – from an energy perspective, you look at the overall cost to consumers, the cost of the capital being deployed through rate base, and then the attendant energy reductions through fuel, it's a beneﬁt to customers. And that's where we come up with the $7 billion over the 25-year period. I mean, it's substantial."
Great. Thank you.,"Yes.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.     Morning, Steve."
"Thank you. Good morning, Nick. So just on that same topic, is it – will it be clear in there, kind of in like the ﬁrst year or two, that there's net reductions like in year one to customers from this, so that....?","Oh, yeah. It's not like it's back-end loaded or anything. These – in year one, you're seeing beneﬁts to consumers."
"Okay. And then, I guess more importantly, just for the approval process in the diﬀerent states, can you just talk to a little bit of – I know states have diﬀerent rules and laws on how they approve projects like this. Xcel, I know, has kind of gone through diﬀerent processes...","Yeah, yeah.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"...doing something similar. So could you just – like, is it – did any – can all these approvals be done through just the regulatory process? Do any states need legislative changes or some kind of diﬀerent way of doing regulation?","No. Steve, there's no legislative changes. It's all done through the regulatory process. But just keep in mind, and this goes back to the investment – you know, whether it's in our capital plan or not. States deal with it in diﬀerent fashions. I mean – and if we're talking April, we're going to have to sit down at the end of that April time period and ﬁgure out, okay, what are the risks to our shareholders of moving forward with this particular project given the – not only the regulatory outcomes, but also the other risk components that are involved with this as well. And we believe, certainly from a risk standpoint, from an operational and construction standpoint, if we can't put generators on top of poles and build transmission lines that we always build all the time, you know, we shouldn't be in this business. So it's not like building a central station generation facility.  So you don't have the same level of risk from that perspective, but the risk part of it – part of the evaluation will be as well – be what kind of indications we're getting from the various jurisdictions because, some of them, you may get outright approval, some of you may get CCN approvals or CECPN approvals in Arkansas. And what is that going to mean? What is it going to mean in terms of risk?  So we have another milestone. We continue to spend money on development of this project, because we feel like it's that important. But in the April timeframe, we will be sitting down with our board to talk about, okay, what have we learned? What are the options available to us and what are the risks being taken, and make a decision to continue on."
"Okay. Great. And then, just on going back to the Ohio ESP talk, you said you're having discussions and – I can't remember your comment, but I think it sounded optimistic. So can you just give a little more color on how you feel on the ESP extension?","Yeah. So you know these discussions have been going on for quite a while with multiple parties, and some of the issues are new and challenging issues. You know, when you think about Smart Cities and the technology deployment and everybody thinks they ought to have part of the game, and we think, you know, universal access was important and we should be the primary driver of ensuring that that access is providing to all consumers, including underdeveloped, but also others as well so. So it's challenging issues, and things you have to go back and forth with the diﬀerent parties on. And we've been – I can say we've been fairly successful in conversations with several of the parties. And there's still a few issues that are still outstanding, but we feel like progress is being made.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Okay. Thank you.,"Yes.     Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question will come from Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead.     Hey, Gregg."
"Hey, thank you. So with regard to the Wind Catcher project, would you consider sell-downs as a way to ﬁnance it? Is that something you're exploring?","Gregg, we've already been approached by people who are interested in co-investing with us. Right now, our interest is having this be part of our regulated portfolio and we don't see a need for that at this time."
Okay. Good luck.,"Thank you.     Funny how fast word gets around.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay, well, thank you for joining us on today's call.
