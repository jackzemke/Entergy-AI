Question,Answer
"Good, good. So two questions. One, when I'm looking at the slide, where you talk about gas to coal switching. Can you talk a little bit about the types of coal that you're burning and what the sort of the breakeven cost is between gas and coal of the types of coal you are burning that whether it's cap coal Illinois Basin PRB that's allowed you to switch back?","Hi, Greg, how are you?     Yes. Typically it's that cap coal and when you look at the cost breakpoint on delivered cost basis, when you're in that 325 to 350 range on natural gas, you start to see the switching occur. And based on natural gas prices, they obviously we've seen just -- just basically 108 degrees, you have the direction. That's a good thing.  And then I think the real issue is that, we've been able to change our contracting methodologies, particularly on the coal side and the natural gas side to be ﬂexible enough to adjust our generation either way, and it's worked out positively for us."
"Our breakpoint, then on(inaudible) heard some from other companies, is that because of your delivery cost advantage being you are the mine mouth on the river?","Yeah, that's right. We have distinct advantage from the river operation standpoint, and then also the mine mouth aspects of this well. So well that's a well delivery.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hey, Greg, when you look at slide nine in our presentation and see how our supply stack lines up and you compare those prices to what natural gas prices where. Into our delivered natural gas was only 3.78 this year and look at how much more of our capacity goes in the money, even at that low natural gas price. So it's a very competitive ﬂeet that we have. And I think we've demonstrated that quarter-on-quarter diﬀerence this year to last, even a pretty low natural gas prices.     And we've also been able take the Northern OPCo, because of all of our units were well controlled [ph]."
"Gotcha. Next and last question. Page 18, you go through a line-by-line comparison of what you did in your oﬀ-system sales business. It's clear that you obviously, you sold a lot more power and get more money. Can you take us through why the big deltas in the other areas and what -- those?","Yeah. So, capacity payments were comprised of two items, one is the diﬀerence in the credits price that we're getting in Ohio. So considerably less pricing there. The other was capacity that we were getting from the RPM market. So in the ﬁrst quarter of 2012, the RPM volume that we sold was 1300 megawatts at the RPM price of $110 a megawatt day for about $16 million. And in 2013, the volume was about 640 megawatts that we cleared at a price of about $16 a megawatt day for $1.8 million.  So those items comprise the capacity diﬀerence, the marketing and trading was just lower realized volumes from that and you see that the sharing stayed about the same year-on-year and that resulted in the diﬀerence in total oﬀ-system sales.     Yeah, really the deviations and we've got the capacity payment diﬀerence, that's right, yeah."
"Thank you, gentlemen.  Operator  And our next question is from the line of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning guys.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Hi, Dan, how are you?"
"Good. Just a follow-up on Greg's question. (Technical Diﬃculties) would have been even further, yeah, of the 3800 megawatt of additional economic generation in the ﬁrst quarter. How many more megawatts are now economic as the curve is moved that much higher?",You mean for the balance of the year?
Yeah.,"It's considerable, Dan, it's probably another 3,000 megawatts.     Dan, Keep in mind the part that kicks up on that curve is primarily peaker units that we don't expect to run that anyway. So you're getting much deeper into the base load capability of the system now and this -- and also keep in mind, this is the entire ﬂeet perspective, not just the part that's going to be unregulated in the future.     And you could even do it yourself on this slide, you could draw on the balance of the year prices for either AP hub or AEP GEN hub, whichever you like and feel that crosses the line."
And when you guys --,"Now, go ahead."
"When you guys talk about the coal inventory situation, you have the normalization, are you guys assuming to get the day's cover using a historic burn rate or using some sort of modiﬁed lower   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   burn rate to ﬁgure out the number of days in inventory?","That's a -- it's a full load burn rate. So it's the units that we have at full load burn, those numbers of days. So the historical measure that we've used.     Which we've done pretty well on managing our inventories during this process and that goes with the ﬂexibility issue. We're still at 43, 44 days of inventory. So (inaudible) into the summer peak period in a pretty good fashion."
"Okay. And I guess it's on load, you also give a lot of detail, but against the plan for this year relative to pretty slow start in the ﬁrst quarter even with your normal, little better-than-normal weather. What gives you guys conﬁdence that you're going to make catch-up over the remainder of the year to get to that positive demand growth and you hearing comments from your industrial customers who are out of more clariﬁcation when they're going to back on?","I mean, I think the story that you've see on those slides kind of mail, the residential and commercial are up and we're seeing the diﬃculty in industrial. We may not make the ﬁve-tenths of load growth that we forecasted for the year, but your earlier question highlights an oﬀset to that and that if oﬀ-system sales are up a bit, because prices are up even from when we came around February 15 that puts more of the ﬂeet and the money and that should help oﬀset some of the load challenges that we might have through the balance of the year or so.     We're also yet to look at the mix, you have to look at the mix of the customers too, if you have residential and commercial improving the margins associated with those customers are higher than your industrial customers. So it's not a one to one top of the deal that you're looking at. And that's why till that we need the industrials manufacturing to continue to improve and hopefully that will occur and a lot of (inaudible) sustain in the third quarter of the year, but it's a matter of making sure that's sustainable so that the commercial and residential can continue to drive.  In the past, our residential and commercial have been really struggling themselves and now we're seeing an uptick there and that's what making the diﬀerence. And also I think the weather was better than last year, but the weather was still normal."
When you guys.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),Go ahead Dan.
"I mean, when you guys see weather normalized always complicated, when you have your big deltas from one period to another. When you look at residential, you've given the big move after having not trended well for so long. Are there underlying commentary you're seeing that gives you conﬁdence if that holds rather than just being kind of a ﬂuctuation to what happened in weather for the period?","Yeah, I think customer accounts. I think always -- may be the 25 year olds are probably moving out of house, but we're seeing customer accounts go up, we're seeing construction improved. But as said, that underlying industrial primary metal side, but that's all tied to the world market. So, we're watching that very closely. Brian.     Dan, we get worried about that when you have large weather aﬀects in the period. And relative to normal, we were about $10 million positive than normal weather. So we forecasted normal for the quarter, we had normal weather signiﬁcant compared to the last year, but compared to normal trade on top of that. So we're not concerned that weather is impacting those numbers in any signiﬁcant way."
"Great. Thank you, guys.  Operator  The next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, good morning. I'm not sure how much color you want to give on this, but you mentioned before some of the cost advantages you have with River Operations or delivering coal via barge versus rail. I was wondering, if you could talk about that or just help us for modeling purposes to assume what the cost advantage would be?","Yeah, I think the main aspect of this is that -- the main aspect of this is that we are with the River Operations, we deliver coal to our power plants at cost. And then secondly, we also from a mine mouth perspective, these mines are relatively closer there. So if they are any railroad   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   movements associated with it. They can still have high rates, but they're very short hauls. And an overall, the position that AEP has, because of our buying stream, because of the large amount of tonnage that we purchase from all across the country. That really imputes to practically the $2 per ton advantage. So, when you look at that across the entire ﬂeet is pretty good advantage."
"I know, some competitor talking about the ﬂexibility and like the whole coal supply chain, when gas prices really dropped and the cost of -- not only the minor orders but the rails are very I guess ﬂexible. I mean do you see a change with gas price now about four hours, if maybe them trying to get back to previous levels like rates at previous levels?",You're talking about the rail roads?
"Yeah, or the coal mining (inaudible)","No, we don't see that. We have long term contracts in place for coal supply from the delivery perspective. And there's plenty of coal out there. I mean we -- in '07, we were at 80 million tons of coal a year, we're at around 54 million tons this year. So there is a lot of -- a lot of ability to pick up production. So I think we're in a good shape."
Great. Thanks for the time guys.  Operator  And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,
Good morning.,Hi Steve. How are you doing?
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how your plans for tracking your merchant generation, I guess when it goes merchant. And we've had a power price up list, but generally the historic revenues had on those assets relative to the market, there's a delta between the two. As you think about your growth prospects, how do you think about that delta and what you would assume you could achieve in getting long-term contracts for your higher generation if you're -- and following my question on that delta?","Yeah. We just keep in mind, the only ones that are going to survive of this process after retirements will be that the 9000 megawatts of generation, all fully controlled, all welled in the market. And when we look at it even with the capital piece of it, in the future it's still looking very, very attractive.  So, it's a matter of how comparative your generation is knowing from marginal cost perspective within obviously the amount of capital left in. And I think we're going to wind up in great shape there. As far as the hedging practices associated with it, we -- that's why we're putting our wholesale shop has been in the market for years from a long-term customer perspective.  And those discussions were occurring now in preparation for the separation of generation. So that's moving along, I think obviously our main intent is to make sure that this generation looks as regulated as it can. We anticipate hedging about 30% of it with retail. Once we have the generation in our retail mix where our -- compare the retailer can use that generation. We'll be able to give the longer-term contracts and those types of things as well. So there is -- giving this generation over something that's incredibly important for us, but also will help us in terms of those hedging practice. So, we have great relationships with munis, co-ops, long-term customers on our third-party basis and we'll continue to advance those."
"Okay. So, as we look at that that's very helpful color. If you look at the four curve today, does that pose any headwind to achieving that 46% as you move from the current contracts, you have two market or is that sort of already generally anticipated as you think about your overall growth?","Yeah it's already anticipated with the 46% is generated from the -- remains the regulated fees, even in 2015 and this is unregulated, the 46% comes from that 86% that's still regulated and regulated jurisdiction, so and with transmission as well, so the 46% is looking pretty good.     Stephen, there is no large uptick associated with the newer capacity or energy prices within that 46% estimate."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay, that's very helpful. If I could just shift quickly to the dividend, got a really, really good increase here and as we look out your payout ratio, is happily fairly low. So it looks like you still have more ﬂexibility. Could you just talk a bit generally about as you look forward here. I know you just gave us a good increase but folks are always thinking about more -- the payout ratio looks on the 14 basis is still below that 60% to 70% range. Could you just talk a little bit about it, how do you think that dividend over time?","That dividend increases already old news, isn't it?"
"Sure, it is.","Whether we don't (inaudible). So our Board will continue to evaluate its dividend policy and there is no quarterly basis, when we look at it in and they did -- and it's probably the same answer I gave in February was that they continue to view dividend growth being in line with their earnings growth of the company, and they look -- in that 60% to 70%, so that we can track the regulated companies. We believe that we should be viewed as a regulated company, we still track to a discount to the regulators, which I don't understand that. But secondly, we want to move this company to a point where this is attractive at a premium to the regulated because of we spend a lot of time cleaning the decks here, we're clearing up the story of AEP and a lot of positive things are occurring. So I think we believe obviously, it remains the same, but something that the Board is very, very -- dealing with [ph]."
Great. Thank you very much.  Operator  And our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.,
"Hi, good morning guys.","Hi, Julien."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So, ﬁrst quick question, perhaps a clariﬁcation if you will. On the industrial segment and sales, the decline in the ﬁrst quarter here, you mentioned a bankruptcy, is this a permanent reduction at least from what you can tell, or how do you anticipate this playing out to the back half of the year and subsequent years?","We're anticipating Julien, it'll continue to operate at there, two thirds of capacity through the balance of the year. We think there is -- obviously market conditions in aluminum are not very good. There is some political, well, I think to try and keep that plant operating associated with the jobs that are there. And I think that continue to operate at this two thirds level since last summer and we anticipate that they'll be that through the balance of the year.     Some of this is driven through the primary metals driven by the world market. So we're going to have to see particularly Europe and then China things picking up there. But here in the U.S., the manufacturing capability is there. There are expansions going on and it's -- we have a list of future expansions that are occurring, that have been announced that many of them in our Western footprint or Eastern footprint has a manufacturing capability. We just need the economy to turn around and certainly the U.S., is a big part of making that happen.  I hope that after we get through all the tax issues and the budget issues and certainly the debt issues with Congress that the economy going to start to pick up with some faith that they can't invest. And when that happens and in particular, when the President decides what he's going to be relatively the Keystone Pipeline and all the other energy related infrastructure areas, the ADP service territory is prime, because of shale gas, because of coal, because of all of these resources that are indigenous in our foot print. We are manufacturing -- (Technical Diﬃculties)"
"Great. Secondly here if you don't mind, now that you're further long in (inaudible). What are the key issues that you're identifying and how might you address those?","Well, I think generally from the intervener testimony and others that there is -- they understand that the assets are very favorable, there are questions about whether we should go out for bid, which this is the case in our opinion that this is energy and capacity that the customers are already paying for. It's a transfer at net book. So eﬀectively it's a rate base replacement for a capacity payment that was occurring before.  So, and when you evaluate our valuation, it's less than a new build and a long-term basis and even on a short-term basis today, it's a very advantageous for the customers in Kentucky and APCo territories. So, we have a strong message, the commission certainly is our view and we have discussions with the Governor's and others at their receptive. because they understand these states, they have coal-ﬁred generation, they're located in those states. The supply of the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   coal comes from these states. We just deal late last year that kept some Virginia and Kentucky monitors at work.  Those are important socioeconomic factors to consider when you look at these types of assets. So, the cases move on, we'll see where they go and I think they could have discussions about the transfer process helping those but that to me, I think we're in very -- we have a very strong message."
"And then a quick last question here. You've talked before about your desire to grow transmission. Giving FERC 1000 tweaks on ROFR [ph], is that change the game plan here to that expand the map for you or is this more of a defensive prospective?","I think it's in line with what our strategy has been, we've been for the development of competitive transmission, we've developed our Transource to the focus on achieving that critical mass within our service footprint of reliability type activities. But we are positioned to be with Transource, a strong competitive transmission provider in this country. So we continue with the joint ventures, we continue with the adjacent companies that we do business with, there is a lot of opportunity there. And we're also very careful about what we ask for incentives for. We ask for incentive structures relative to ROE based upon the way we perceive the risk of those projects. And I think the more transmission providers do that and are very solid and factual about what they ask for I think for good respond.  Great. Thank you for the time.     Yeah. And keep in mind the transmission piece of it, the earnings is already projects that are in place with the ROEs approved and the structures approved. So, I'm going to check there too.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Trahan. Please go ahead."
"Yeah. Hi, good morning Nick. Couple of quick questions. Just ﬁrst on the sales issue, it's kind of hard that exactly estimate the diﬀerence in margin between residential, commercial, industrial turn that into an overall number. So, I mean if you just look at the ﬁrst quarter, where the residential commercial oﬀ industrial down a lot. Could you give us a sense of how you are on track versus budget there? On sales, so we can kind of get a sense for the year.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Few slide, which I am looking for. Its 15. There give you some sense for how we were versus last year. If you look at how we're doing, we're behind a bit Steve, and I can get you the detailed numbers later. But as you can see, our $0.80 on top of the $0.80 whatever we lost in terms of that we made up for in weather -- and weather and rate changes. So, we can get to the detail later. But we're right on track for the year."
Okay.,Margins are extremely lean on the industrial side.
Right. Yeah.,"And then -- so you're replacing it with and typically the margins for commercial customers are signiﬁcantly higher than industrials and residential are signiﬁcantly higher than commercial. So, it's a measure of what that is. We'll try to get you some additional information on that."
"Maybe to ask another way. If the trend in Q1 continued for the rest of the year, where residential was better than your thought, but industrial was worse?",Yeah.
Will this be on track for the year then?,"Probably -- that's going go a long way, it go a long way in mitigating the impact of the industrials. And keep in mind whatever is released from an industrial from the energy perspective, we're selling in the market as well. So, I think there are a lot of mitigating issues there.  See, when you combine that with what we're seeing in oﬀ-system sales and how we're on track for the rate changes, we're right on top of where we anticipated being relative to budget.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
So kind of an a gross margin basis when you put all that stuﬀ here on track?,"Great thing about the diversity of AEP, I mean from the regional footprint, but also the customer side, we typically are third commercial, industrial and residential and it's a good thing when that's happening out. What we have to watch for is the industrials were moving up largely recovered from 2007 by the second quarter of last year and then we started to see some movement down on industrial as well.  The commercial and residential, we're tracking down as well but what sustained industrial activity, the commercial industrial started to move up. So what we need to see is the industrial and commercial -- the industrial and manufacturing base continue to improve, so that we can have the sustaining quality of increased residential and commercial sales.  So that sort of cycle global one like the other. And we just -- and you're right in terms of the concerns that if we continue to see deterioration in industrial and manufacturing, it will have a tempering eﬀect on the increases in the other two categories. So we're watching that very closely.  It is promising that customer counts moving up and the economy is starting to prosper in some areas, again."
Okay. One other general question. I think this is the ﬁrst PJM capacity auction it will be and is not NFRR entity? And I'm just curious kind of if you have any thoughts on what to expect and what your inclusion might mean if anything for how much PLM to that long-or short?,"Well, you know, it's -- and it's not the ﬁrst one, I think we've already been involved with one, we can -- we expect this, what to be pretty consistent with the last one, give or take near 10%. But it's -- I continue to be concerned about the way demand side management has an advantage over steel in the ground in terms of the capacity markets in that structure and that needs to change because, if you ever want to continue making long-term investments to ensure the stable supply of energy to our customers, we need to make sure that there is a structure in place that's compatible for all parts of resources.  So that's what I'm concerned about, within PJM, there is no long-term pricing structure for anyone to go out and build and construct and ﬁnance new capacity and we have demand side management that is bidding in just for a few hours during the year they don't have the same level of commitment. That's the issue within PJMs and that's really makes capacity market, it's hard to read.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Great. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.,
"Yeah. Hey, guys.","Hey, Michael."
"First of all congratulations. Because over the last two to three years, Nick, Brian (inaudible) management team have done a very, very good job of transforming AEP. I have one or two questions though just in terms of how you're trying to think strategically about both the non- regulated business and the regulated business. I'll start on the non-reg. And when you look at the portfolio and the size of the retail book, what you don't have is a lot of scale or diversity, meaning you don't have a ton of asset diversity, you have almost no regional diversiﬁcation on the non-regulated side. And your retail business while growing is small relative to the industry.  And I'm just curious, any of the McKinsey [ph] guys running around your building at some point would probably hate to hear me use this reference. But if you had to plot your non-reg -- related business or consulting major cashcow or harvest or I think it was star for the growth businesses, how would you kind of think about that business strategically, long-term and your intend for it?","Well, Michael, I've stated previously that we are regulated company and we're focused on being a regulated company, if we can make this comparative business look towards our regulated with the hedging associated with it, then that certainly help us focus on what we do with that business going forward.  And keep in mind too, that the ﬂeet that's you're talking about is one of the larger unregulated ﬂeets in the country will be 9,000 megawatts, it is centrally located within the area of PJM area, but it also, as you know, two thirds coal, one thirds gas, two thirds with fully controlled units that are well within the mining a third natural gas, which is going to be at -- probably at the market price. So, we see -- I mean we see this business, particularly if you look at it in its breadth, not just the matter of the generation margins and sales. On the retail side, we're focused on hedging that generation, focused on not megawatt hours, but margins and we're focused on the wholesale activity that we've been doing for years to be complimentary.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So the has a total package, but I think even if you look at the generation assets from sales, they are competitive in the market. So, I don't care if I have 50,000 megawatts in a market that I'm competitive or 2000. So it really is a matter of where these units stack up in the marketplace and they stack up well.  And then secondly, how you're complementing that business and what your focus is. If we wind up with a competitive business that looks like something our shareholders are interested in but doesn't provide the volatility that makes us look like a regulated utility. And that's ﬁne. But, we'll have to get there and see where it takes us."
"Okay. On the regulated side, when you look across your service territory and you've done a good job of positioning the transmission side of the business to grow and kind of we all know that transmission has its challenges just in terms of the timeline of growth, but that's a more of a national issue, not company speciﬁc. But when you look at distribution and you look at generation, how do you think about where over the next 5 to 7 years your greatest rate base growth opportunities lie?","Well, I think the grace rate base opportunities are in transmission and distribution, because if you believe that you're being into an area where we have generation. But we're also taking a broader view of what resources are, which includes transmission from an optimization standpoint includes renewables, includes smart grid technology type applications.  I think we're in a pretty good position, because we don't have any real large central station generation activities going on. And we are advancing transmission and distribution. The infrastructure requirements associated with that are tremendous in this industry and it gives us a distinct opportunity to continue to invest to ensure the service reliability of our customers.  So we have -- we have a real opportunity here that not be and I guess, it goes to my earlier conversation to not be all of our focus of our customers working on backing on activities, like a massive amount of environmental spending, a massive amount of a new generation that's very, I'd say the density level is pretty high. So from a capital standpoint, we have the opportunity to put capital where it will make the most beneﬁcial eﬀect for our customers and as well our shareholders. So, we are trying to move as much as we can to transmission and the distribution side infrastructure."
"Got it. Thank you, Nick. Much appreciated.","Yeah. And also I would add to that from a regulated standpoint, we do have a large amount of our service territory that still regulated from a generation perspective. So we'll continue to invest in those facilities as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  And our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead."
Thank you. Good morning.,"Hi, Ali."
"First question on the Ohio customer switching. Is that currently on track with how you budgeted that and what's in the ESP order. And also related to that, I think for the year, your budget had the gross margins for Ohio utilities down but through the ﬁrst quarter you're ﬂat. So should we assume that Ohio is doing better than planned and it is a best out of it?","Yeah, we're largely on track with the agreement, I think 53% of our customer loan switch another 3% in the queue, so it's moving along at a steady pace and we see that continuing. So I'd say that we're largely on pace and moving forward."
"And it includes the overall earnings contribution as well, you think that's still on budget as well?",Yeah. Yeah.
"Okay. A separate question on -- after this SWEPCo Texas rate cases down, can you remind us what would be the next big rate case coming up for you guys?","Well, as a result of the legislation in Indiana, that gives us a distinct opportunity to focus there on achieving better results -- rate related to the regulatory lag. So it gives us an opportunity to do that and I think Virginia has also an opportunity for us as we complete the corporate separation and move forward with that kind of activity. So, I'd say, those are the two jurisdictions and then we continue to look at other areas as well. But I'd say those are probably the two larger ones and keep in mind we are making a very large investment in R&D associated with the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   nuclear long cycle management process, it's $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and that's largely in process of being recovered. So there are some areas of spending that will be -- that we'll be doing. But I'd say that the stage is set."
"Understood. And last question, I recalled the past Brian or Nick you guys have said in the context of the 4% to 6% annual EPS growth that you've been targeting that through this transition period in Ohio, I guess through '12 to '15 period more likely the lower end and the high-end with that more sense, is that still the way to thinking about this?","No, I don't think we said that. We're anticipating the 4% to 6% of the 2013 base. So the full range of the range that we talked about is in place even during the transition period."
Of the '13 base and Brian -- over -- is that a ﬁve year look forward or how should we think about that?,Just until further notice.
