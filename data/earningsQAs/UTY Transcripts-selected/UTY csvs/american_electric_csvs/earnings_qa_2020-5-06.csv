Question,Answer
"Hi, good morning. Hope you all are doing well.","Good morning, Steve."
"Thanks for the update on a lot of topics. I wanted to talk, ﬁrst, just about two of your rate cases, Indiana and Michigan, where I believe the test year is going to be 2020 test year. How do you think about that sort of test year in light of COVID, load adjustments, COVID related expenses, as you think through that rate case and sort of how to approach 2020 given its such an unusual year?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah, so, in, at least Indiana, we have a forward test year views. And I think it's particularly important as we go into these cases for there will be an understanding that we are dealing with the COVID related year, if it is a test year. But where we have forward test years, though, you can, you can account for that going forward in the rate-making.  But certainly, we'd be, we'd be certainly tuned into the process, whether you pro forma in or do other things. I think there's probably at least opportunities for discussion about that, because COVID -- 2020 is going to be an unusual year and to be used for test years, will be particularly challenging. You have to really go to some form of pro forma view that has the level of investments, the level of business activity that you would normally see. So, I would expect our commissions to be reasonable in that approach.     In both those cases, Steve, we had forward looking test years, and we do have orders eﬀective in both of those jurisdictions."
"Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, it makes sense that you sort of trying to work through the adjustments, makes sense. On North Central Wind some great progress there, that's really encouraging. I guess I had, sort of, two related questions on North Central. If you do get those additional approvals that you're waiting for such as in Louisiana, Texas, can you just sort of quickly ﬂex the plan to go to the higher megawatt level. And then I guess relatedly, you've obviously deferred some CapEx, do you have that ﬂexibility to deploy whatever capital you need to kind of make this a bigger project or does your sort of capital position caution against sort of signiﬁcant ramp up in CapEx this year? Just kind of thinking through the growth in North Central.","Yeah. So originally North Central was not in our capital plan. And so when we get approval for that, they will be dealing with a diﬀerent ﬁnancing model associated with that. As far as the megawatt level and the amount of investment, yes, if we get approval for Louisiana for example and Louisiana also approves the up rate which is in the settlement arrangement, then we would have the full $2 billion investment opportunity there. We already know we're going forward with the project, that was the importance of Arkansas approval. So the projects moving forward, the question is what size and then when Louisiana approves that and hopefully with a ﬂex up as well, then that's a full $2 billion or if Texas takes their portion, then all the operating jurisdictions will be taking their particular portions as we go forward.  Now there is additional opportunity for renewables in those areas, the integrated resource plans have the capability for that, but we felt like as we originally said about this project, there were sort of a breakpoint between the opportunities that exist around the wind farm projects and the pricing. And we wanted to make absolutely sure that the pricing was very eﬀective and produced very positive savings for our customers. So we can always go out for bid again to ﬁll, to ﬁll the rest of that from the resource planning perspective.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Steve will be full speed ahead on the CapEx associated with North Central Wind one way or the other. Nick mentioned that it's not in the $33 billion that we had previously identiﬁed, for the ﬁve years 2020 to 2024. And we previously said that we anticipate an equity component of that investment to be between 50% and 66%."
"Yeah, that's super helpful. I'll let others ask questions. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Please go ahead.     Good morning.
"Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, just -- the ﬁrst one on 2020 guidance range here, the [ph]$0.15 EPS, what are you assuming in terms of declining trends for the rest of the year? I guess what I'm asking is, are you assuming some amount of recovery in Q3 or Q4, just curious as to what you're assuming in terms of proﬁling for the rest of the year?",Sure. So we are assuming that the second quarter be the lowest quarter for load and that there'll be a gradual recovery over the balance of 2020 and into the ﬁrst quarter of 2021.
"Got it. Perfect. And then can you comment on just your -- assuming that you are going to hit your lower half of the EPS guidance range for this year, where would that put you in terms of credit metrics that order debt versus your targeted metrics? And then any color that you can provide us with your recent conversations, if you've had with Moody's on some of the changes that you've made to your plan?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So we've really been -- we anticipate year end being FFO to debt in that 13% to 14% range. We've communicated that with S&P and Moody's had dialogs with them as late as yesterday. They understand where we are and what we're doing. I think they were encouraged to see us ﬂex a little bit, our CapEx for the balance of the year in response to anticipated lower cash ﬂows than what we had anticipated. And they're supportive of that, they were -- they viewed what Julie and her team did around the term loan facility as being credit positive. And they are fully aware apprised of what we're doing and you should ask them, but I think the answer would be supportive."
Great. That's all I got. Thank you very much.,"Yeah, thank you.     Thank, Durgesh.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.     Morning, Julian."
"Hey, good morning, team. I hope you all well. Perhaps just to pick up where the last question left oﬀ to return here. On guidance in 2020 lower -- how do you think about the reduction in CapEx? I just want to reconcile that, but it seems that you're not really changing FFO debt expectations as you (inaudible) CapEx altogether. But, why do that relative to the change in (inaudible). Just, can you walk through the thought process there and then also it seems that it doesn't necessarily have too much of an earnings impact given the corporate nature some of the CapEx, so I just want to make sure whether you got that correctly as well?","Sure, Julian. Thanks for the question. So we are anticipating there to be some reduction in cash ﬂow this year associated with two things; one, lower customer demand. And then two, we have eliminated disconnects currently. And so we think that customers will pay us slower than what they have in the past. We're not seeing the impact of that in a signiﬁcant way yet it's too early, but in anticipation of lower cash ﬂows to maintain those FFO to debt metrics, we felt it was imprudent to at least engage the motor on our ability to scale back CapEx. In regards to the no   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   impact on future earnings, we tried to do it in places that have either lower regulatory lag or the increase in earnings isn't as great.  So Nick mentioned that some of that reduction is in the competitive renewable space and some of that reduction is also at corporate capital things like IT and things like that, that are much slower to ﬂow into customer rates during rate cases. Things that we were careful not to cut were things like transmission, where we're spending on customer resilience and reliability. And we have those formula base rates to update and get that CapEx into rates on a fairly eﬃcient basis. So we are really thoughtful about how we cut that small -- shifted that small amount of CapEx and made sure that it wasn't impacting earnings.     Julian, I think you're reading it right, though. I mean, we're being as transparent as we possibly can be through this process using the latest information, in fact, we got the load information -- April load information yesterday. So we're trying to be as transparent as possible, but also taking the right smart appropriate steps to ensure they were able to be agile enough to do what we need to do. So I think you are reading that, right. We obviously will put that capital back in as quickly as possible. And then, as Brian mentioned, we're not only mitigating any impacts to the earnings capability, but also thinking ahead in terms of where we deploy that capital in the future. So, and then we also have North Central coming about. So those things are occurring. We're trying to manage through this year in a very positive fashion and really a defensive posture, and then, set ourselves up for the future years in '21 and beyond.  So we'll continue that approach. And obviously, if we get a hot summer for example, we'll through capital back in, that means, all kinds of things that can adjust. And then from a residential standpoint you heard our residential load for April was 6% and we're saying 3%, so we don't know exactly how this is going to play out, particularly with changing dynamics of business cases themselves changing. I mean, we had a nationwide recently come out and say that their people are going to be working from home. And we have 70000 employees and 12000 are working from home, we may be looking through our Achieving Excellence program, which we have already accelerated to look at how you look -- how you look at people working from home and maybe the whole business case changes from that perspective, and also reduces O&M further. So we are in the process of doing all of that, but we're just trying to be as transparent as possible, if you're reading the tea leaves, right."
"Got it, excellent. And let me just clarify in terms of new (inaudible) you all reaﬃrmed intentions to ﬁle rate cases in various geographies, this sudden shift timing necessarily it sounds like, and more and at the same time I don't want to tie one to the other, does it shift any expectations with respect to after sales disposal, strategic reviews, trying to make sure we're on the same page there, and then it could be even further capital needs?","Yeah, no, it doesn't change. As a matter of fact, we'll continue those cases. I mean, obviously, as I mentioned, Kentucky. We have a stay-out provision. We need to ﬁle a case and we'll do that when that stay-out provision is lifted. And then that would be eﬀective January 1st of '21. And   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   then for Ohio, obviously we're due to ﬁle a case there as well. It's is a pretty, moderate case, but nevertheless as far as we can tell, I mean, everything is going exactly like we had planned. Now UASC some procedural schedules change, but the end result in the end date aren't changing. So that's, that's where we're at today."
"All right, great. Thank you.","Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Michael."
There is a better chap pronouncing my last name than most people do.,I have the same problem.
"Yeah. A few handful of questions. One, I'm going to be a little more speciﬁc on CapEx. So, $500 million cut $200 million is at the non-regulated renewable, $100 million --","Michael, Micheal."
Yeah.,$500 million shifted.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Shifted, my bad.",Yeah. We are simple about that.
"$500 million shifted, $200 is with the non-regulated renewable, $100 is at corporate, what's the other $200 million?","There is another $75 million to $100 million that is in our distribution in our APCo. And then the other $100 million is spread across our organizations, but not in the transmission side of the business."
"Got it. Okay, that's ﬁne. The other question is, is there any scenario where you could delay given a whole that's going on in the world, all the uncertainty about demand, about the impact of disconnects, is there any regulatory scenario where you could actually postpone or push out the AEP Ohio rate case?","No I don't think -- we don't see that happening, because obviously we are required to ﬁle a case and actually it's a pretty, pretty moderate case. So I think that, that there really isn't any reason to delay it at this point.     I think, Michael, I think Nick's answer earlier was there could be a delay in the procedural schedule. We would still expect to get the result of the case when we originally had."
Yeah. Got it. And then ﬁnal question --,"And everybody knows, everybody knows about it, as well. So there won't be a surprise to anybody.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"No, that is good.","It was pretty a negligible impact on customers too, in that case too."
"Now, that makes it kind of sense. And then, last question, we've done a great job in managing down O&M for the last 40 years. And you've taken a lot of O&M out of the company, it saves the customers' money, it's good for shareholders. At what point do you think the long-term rate of change in O&M management starts to ﬂat now, being the curve, the ability to keep taking out more or becoming more eﬃcient, just start to ﬂatten out the pace of change slows?","We've had a lot of conversations of about that, but every every day you're surprised by some new innovation or something that can change the trajectory of O&M expense. So, we spend $4 billion a year I think $2.8 billion is not tracked. And when you look at some of the opportunities that are available, and actually, I think that if there is a lining in the Coronavirus pandemic, it is that we -- we can really reevaluate what it means to get our business done. Because we've been very eﬀective at the people working from home. And actually productivity has not suﬀered as a result, and we still have obviously the ﬁeld employees that are still out there working as well. But you see the innovations that are occurring, I think, I think we have years ahead of us to continue to optimize O&M expense. And when you think it's going to level out something new comes about and I think that's going to be a continual opportunity for us.  And we actually and you probably saw we announced -- we have a new Senior Vice President over our actually the digital experience as our Chief Information & Technology Oﬃcer who is joining the company. We wanted to make sure that we put technology, the customer experience and certainly our charge innovation hub and those kinds of things together to really focus the organization on what the future holds and what it can mean in terms of O&M in the future.  So I think it's -- I think we don't know the answer to that and really you don't want to know, you want to just keep, keep pressing forward and we'll do that."
"Got it. Thank you, Nick. Much appreciate it.","Yeah.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeremy [ph]Tom with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning."
"Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me here.",Yeah.
"I could be wrong, but I think in the past, you might have provided a multiyear view of ﬁnancing needs in the earnings deck. And I think I might have missed that here. So didn't know if there is kind of any changes to how you're thinking about funding CapEx going forward here. And is there any interplay with kind of where Moody's is at right now, if you think about that.","Jeremy, there's really no change in our funding CapEx and I think the big thing we did really at the last call was give some insight into how we were going to fund North Central Wind and the idea that we'd be doing that between 50% and 60% equity. We've always been fairly conservative in our balance sheet management. And we're going to continue that going forward."
Got it. That's it from me. Thanks for taking my question.,"Yeah. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Cowlrick with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning, James."
"Oh, yeah, hi, how are you guys. Thanks for taking my call.",Sure.
"Just a following up on Jeremy's question, just wondering, Brian And Nick, as you guys are getting closer to the North Central Wind approvals, have you sort of sharpened your idea on how you're thinking about ﬁnancing that and especially, have you looked a little bit more maybe some cycling, some current assets as opposed to accessing the capital markets, speciﬁcally.","So, James. We do have a little bit of time for that. Right. The smaller portion of North Central Wind is going to come about $300 million at the end of '20, which would really make the ﬁnancing of that a '21 event. And then we have really until the end of '21 to go forward with that.  So how we come up with the equity portion of that, whether it's capital rotation, or whether it's the equity capital markets, I still think that we have plenty of time to work through. But I think the important assumption was the range of percentage of equity that we used for that project and that's where we talked about being in the 50% to 66% of the project.     Yeah. And really probably the main message is, all the options that were available to us before is still on the table and still being considered. And there hasn't been any, any change from a timing perspective, and our ability to get that done. So I'd say we're still at the same place we were and we are ready to execute. I think it's just a matter of us getting the ducks all on the road and ensure that we're at the right place at the right time."
"Sure, sure. I just wasn't sure if you guys were looking at the potential for augmenting some of the equity with a sort of the recycling of assets and they've became a regulatory proceeding or something like that, that would have to be sort of taken into consideration ahead of time, just because of --?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah. And we said, for really over a year now that with capital rotation, but also sale of assets is on the table is part of that process. We are obligated to do that from a shareholder perspective and we will certainly do that."
Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.,"Yeah.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Sophie."
"Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"Yeah, Couple of questions here from me. So for, could you remind us if North Central Wind was contemplating tax equity ﬁnance into the part of the plan.",It is not.
"It is now. Okay. Okay, so then maybe another one from me, I know this has a pretty decent chunk of your workforce that was on track to retire within the next four to ﬁve, seven years may   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   be, are you contemplating oﬀering them the folks some sort of voluntary early retirement may be in an eﬀort to cut O&M, is that something that we could see on the table?","Well, I usually get that question from employees. We have, as we look at the O&M and the issues that we're dealing with to try to reduce O&M to the $2.7 billion level and beyond, we look at a lot of things, but one thing we have to be very careful about is certainly if you oﬀer things like that, you usually lose people, you don't want to lose. And in this day and age with certainly at our front-line employee ranks, we need to every individual is working. And there's a lot of competition going on for the professionals and in those industries. So that's something we have to be really careful about.  Now obviously it's part of the -- its part of our regular operations that if we evaluate groups and there is eﬃciencies in terms of resources, whether it's vacancies or retirements or even were severance is oﬀered, we'll continually manage our resources (Ends Abruptly)  This transcript may not be 100 percent accurate and may contain misspellings and other inaccuracies.
