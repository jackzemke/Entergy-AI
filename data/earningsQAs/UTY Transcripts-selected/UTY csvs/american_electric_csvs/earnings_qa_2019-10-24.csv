Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning and congratulations, guys. So perhaps, if I can go back to some of the commentary from the last call in brief, certainly some variations across the service territory on your sales trends, would be curious how does this position you relative to your broad plans and thought process against the 5% to 7%? Just want to be exceptionally clear as you think about having posted some good results here in the third quarter, and again reaﬃrming the higher end.","Yeah, there is no change in our thought process. We're still tracking 5% to 7%. We'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper range of that because, obviously, when you look at the components of load here from a ﬁnancial perspective, it's not having much impact on our plans. And by the way, we adjust all the time for weather, for all kinds of things, and we have a big opportunity to do that. And I think there is a real opportunity for us to continue to advance, particularly with the renewables play and everything else what's going on. So even without that, though, I think, we're in great shape. So it hasn't changed anything. I think, probably, last quarter, we probably talked almost too much about the load and the industrial side of things. And really, it was nothing compared to what we experienced back in 2009, and we did pretty   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   well weathering that storm. So -- but in this case, I think you're seeing some resiliency there from a industrial and manufacturing standpoint and you're seeing it start to pick up. And from the -- and as we said, it's also interesting to note it's great to have diversity in load because we've got the oil and gas activity that's going gangbusters with the transportation sector and then also you think of what's going on just the consumer side. And everyone is talking about this being a consumer-driven economy and there's no question that people have more money in their pockets and more people have jobs and you're seeing that reﬂected in the numbers that we see. So, we stand committed to what we've always said before and we fully expect to be in the upper range of that 5% to 7%."
"So, thanks for the clarity there. And then perhaps if I can jump in real quickly, how you are trending on energy supply as you think about it? And you said you might be updating this with respect to EEI. But can you elaborate at least initially on how you're trending on the energy supply side of the business? Obviously there's a number of diﬀerent moving factors within that segment of the business. Renewables increasing, sort of the legacy stuﬀ declining still. How is that trending altogether, if you can give us a little bit of a sense here, especially again relative to that longer-term 5% to 7%?","Yes. It's going to be up versus what we talked about last year at EEI. But the fact of the matter is as we've sold oﬀ some of the competitive generation in the retiring plants, we're replacing some of those earnings with the renewable business that we have. So, it's not declining the way you might expect from the sale of the competitive assets and the retirements, but we ﬁlled in some of that gap with the renewables but we don't expect that to be a huge growing business for us going forward.     And by the way on the contracted renewable, we continue to do very well in that business. Obviously it's measured with the $2.2 billion of capital that we've allocated to it. The organization there is doing a wonderful job of being judicious about that. Obviously the acquisition that we made was very positive, the development opportunities are signiﬁcant there and we have some other opportunities that we continue to work on. So, that pipeline can continue as long as we want it to continue and to what extent we want it to continue. But we're able to make that kind of decision regarding that business because we also have a huge transmission business and a growing distribution business. It's huge already, but there's all kinds of opportunities there. So, really our big issue is continuing to manage around a strong and robust balance sheet and continue to deploy the capital."
Great. I'll leave it there. See you guys soon. Cheers.,"Thanks.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Steve."
"Hey, good morning. I'm -- just a -- ﬁrst a curious question on the growth at FPSO particularly on energy because from an energy standpoint, you would have thought that's been the area where the rig count has come down the most. So, is there a way to kind of make sense of that?","Well, there has been some industrials that -- in place down there and some expansions. And so Oklahoma has a governor down there that is really focused on economic development and I think it's having an impact on the state. We're very happy to see that. There is certainly low rates there and the ability to put these industrials in place. But it's probably a more balanced economy as well.     Steve, even what you're seeing with rig count, a lot of the growth that we've seen has been in mid and downstream and a lot of that speciﬁcally in pipeline transportation uncongesting a lot of the shale region congestion that's happened over the last several years and it's moving the products and commodities out of those regions."
"Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And just I think you kind of answered this, but just the renewables acquisition that you made, can you just give us kind of a ﬂavor of how well that's gone versus pro forma and just how much are you seeing the ability to potentially expand not utility renewables?","Yes. So, we're particularly pleased with the performance of that particular acquisition and really in concert with the other development opportunities that we're focused on. But when you think about the acquisition of not only the projects and really the economics was based on the active projects that were ongoing, the developmental opportunities we've hardly placed any value on because we didn't know they would happen. But in fact those have continued to progress quite nicely. So, it really has been an opportunity for us to continue the expansion of that eﬀort. And then you also have to include Santa Rita in that where we've continued to expand from that perspective. So, I think that business is moving along quite well. We're very disciplined in the way we approach it and I think it's paid oﬀ.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"Okay, great. Thank you.",Yes.  Operator  Our next question is from Christopher Turner with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.     Good morning.
"Good morning, guys. My ﬁrst question is just on forward-looking guidance. I guess, one, it sounds like you would not put out a 2021 range at EEI for EPS. And then, two, related to that, can you remind us of the current drivers underlying your 2020 range?","Yes. So, we're likely just to focus on 2020 at EEI and reaﬃrm our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate. Remember that our guidance for 2020 is $4.25 to $4.45 and we're likely to say that that's what it will be again for 2020. And the key drivers are the things that you would think about for a traditional premium regulated utility. It's rate outcomes, ability to invest in our organic regulated businesses, our ability to continue to invest in contracted renewables, and then of course things like weather and load will impact the earnings outlook as well. So, not to forget of course our ability to constrain as we have over many years O&M spending and we're particularly going to be focused on that in 2020.     You're going to hear more about our achieving excellence program that really is focused on a forward view of where our business needs to go and our employees are all energized around it because we have to redeﬁne our sales going forward. And the outcome of that obviously is to be able to deploy more capital, but also to reduce O&M because you are able to deploy capital and be able to optimize and drive eﬃciencies through automation digitization and all those kinds of things. And so for us it's really a focus on changing that business. And the fact that we're coming out with our guidance for 2020 and then the 5% to 7% growth rate. I think we are comfortable with just doing that because that element consistency is there and we don't expect it to change. I mean you can sort of do your own math. And typically what we've done is when we gone out of the year, we just did the math for you. So, just think of it from that perspective. Now the one thing that could change that is the regulated renewables that are not included in   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   the capital plan. So, you could have a step change and then continue at 5% to 7%. So, that's the kind of thing we're looking at right now.     A positive step change.     Yes, positive step change."
"Okay. That's good to hear. So it sounds like some of them positive things over the past year that have changed underlying 2020 are potentially curtailed a little bit maybe by load or other factors, but net-net you're pretty much compared to the same place?","Oh no, we're not say anything zeal [ph] back in 2020 because, obviously our transmission business continues to do well and other components of our business does well and then the load itself, there is components of that load that's doing really well. And from a ﬁnancial perspective, load will have not that much of an impact on the earnings of the Company. So, we're not saying that at all. I mean 2020 is supposed to be ahead and then '21 we'll obviously see the outcome of the regulated renewable piece of it and go from there."
"Okay, excellent. And then just given one of your peers in Texas and some of the back and forth in their rate case proceeding. Can you give us an update on kind of the latest in the rate case process and dialog and any thoughts to the overall Texas environment changing?","Well, certainly, Texas is Texas. I mean, there is all kinds of opinions and interveners obviously have their opinions. But when it comes down, too, it's AEP Texas is the transmission and distribution utility. And it's very diﬃcult to disallow costs that are spent from a transmission and a distribution perspective. So that's going to be up to the Texas Commission. And certainly, we have a diﬀerent pattern than the other one that you referred to. And, every case is diﬀerent, every company is diﬀerent, the kind of investments are diﬀerent. So we feel good about our position in AEP Texas. That's why we continue to invest the way we do. So obviously, we are looking for a positive outcome as a signal to continue investing."
"Okay. Thanks, Nick.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Yeah.  Operator  Next, we are going to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.     Hi, Greg."
"Hey, how are you? Good morning. Great quarter, congrats.","Yeah, thanks."
"What is the fascination down in Texas with the idea of ring-fencing? I know that it's been proposed in both the -- one of your competitor's pending cases as well as staﬀ position is proposing (inaudible). And I'm just wondering what your perspective on that is, and where do you think they're coming from?","Yeah. It's probably better question for the Commission than for us, but, obviously, during the Oncor proceedings that's where sort of all of this started. And obviously, a company like Oncor, they want to make sure that there were some local type of control. And we are already operating in the state and have been for 100 years. And I think the Commission, obviously, is interested in how much control was placed within Texas around the assets that they feel like that beneﬁt the state of Texas. So I suspect you may see some remnants of that showing up in various cases, but we have been and are operating in Texas for a long time, and that's not going to change.     Greg, the thing that's ironic, particularly, given our situation in Texas is that, we are a net investor in Texas, meaning, we are putting debt and equity capital to work in Texas, rather than taking it out. So for us, I think, they wanted to see us continue doing what we've been doing now for years, which is investing that capital in Texas, rather than taking it out, and that's what we are intend to continue doing.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Texas is one of the fastest growing territories that we have, and we're not going to, I mean, we're not going to fall back on our ability to invest and produce beneﬁts for our customers. And East Texas, obviously, it's -- we have direct contact with the customers in the ERCOT portion, it's the T&D. But, certainly, I think that this line is getting more blurred all the time, and that's probably a future that needs to be discussed in Texas about how to deal with that. But nevertheless, that's gone for the strategy part of it in the future."
"Thank you. And one more, I know, it's early days, but what is the sort of -- has there been any public response from intervener groups with regard to the North Central Wind proposal? And do we see a more sort of accepting initial response than we did in your Wind Catcher proposal or is it too early to say?","I'd say it's too early to say at this point. There's nothing public that has been out there. But I will say that, we purposely ﬁle this to where it had a lot of variability, a lot of optionally to it, and certainly consistent with the ongoing and existing processes of the integrated resource planning of each one of the areas. And I would say just that fact alone, we've had a more -- at least a more positive reception of how to deal with it. And so I would have to say, things are going reasonably well at this point.  And certainly, the parties involved, no one understands it, because after going through Wind Catcher, this one, you can really talk about what the diﬀerences are and the beneﬁcial diﬀerences. If they were concerned about transmission, don't be concerned about it. If you are concerned about a large area, just one area of -- don't be concerned about that either. And if you're concerned about dependency on one area versus another, don't worry about that either. So I think our processes and with the procedural schedules already deﬁned in every jurisdiction, we're rolling along to a summer of getting the approvals and moving ahead."
"Fantastic. Thank you, guys.","Yeah. Thanks, Greg.  Operator  And next from the line of Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning."
"Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if it's possible to get a preview of the CapEx update at EEI, maybe just -- maybe the drivers and I assume that the backlog would increase?","So I really want to say the detail of that for EEI. But if you've looked at the trends for how we've been spending dollars over the last decade or so, the preponderance of it going to regulated properties and the preponderance of that going to the wire-side of the business. So that trend that you've seen in the past is going to continue in the detail that we're going to release at EEI."
"Okay, thank you. Look forward to it.",Thanks.  Operator  Next we move to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Good morning, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.",Yeah. Big game coming up.
"We've got to get a quarterback healthy before we play LSU, (inaudible) Couple of things, one, interest rates, obviously, are way down, especially the long end of the curve. Just curious how you're thinking about what this means for not just pension expenses that ﬂow through the income statement, but also pension contributions.","So that's a great question. We plan every year as we go into the year to pay, to contribute through the pensions about equal to our annual service cost. For the last two years, both '19 and '18, we sort of had a funding holiday, and the decrease in interest rates has pushed down our funding a little bit really into the mid '90s for pensions, and still very well over-funded at the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   OPEBs, but rates can only go down so much more, I think. And so I think we don't have much downside on the pension fund. Again, we'll be watching every year what our funding is going to be. For next year, we plan on putting in about $100 million with annual service cost. And we still expect the expense side of that equation to be about zero to maybe a slight positive credit.     That's a good thing about being well funded on our pension and OPEB. It gives us a lot of ﬂexibility and really no surprises."
"Got it. And then one follow-up. When you think about the dockets, especially, obviously, PSO in the diﬀerent SWEPCo states for the North Central Winds process, how do you think this is diﬀerent than what you went through with Wind Catcher?","I think, Wind Catcher was a unique situation. I mean, we obviously looked at it and thought that it was a great opportunity for all of these jurisdictions. But at the end of the day, there was -- it was a large project in one area with a large generation, interconnect, transmission, whatever you want to call it, and you got to hung up on the risk associated with that, particularly with all the customer savings and trying to ﬁgure that out and making sure that everyone was comfortable with that kind of project. I still stand by it, it was a great project. There is no question about it. But we learned from that.  And I think the more you stick with the regular processes of the commissions have had longstanding, I mean, we've had other renewable projects that we've done the same exact process with that have gone through with no problem, we want to refashion this thing to make sure it was what everybody expected to see. And when you look at these projects, there is three diﬀerent wind farms that are involved with that with the law ﬂexibility on who is in and who is out. And it gives us the ability to not only do that, but also not depend upon additional transmission. So you don't have to focus on that piece of it. And then also for us to be able to look at the project beneﬁts themselves, those beneﬁts are still substantial. So I would say that -- and, of course, the way it worked out in the bidding itself, I can talk about this, but we chose those three projects because they were much better than the others that they were bid from a pricing perspective, but also all three of them happen to be with a party that we have continually done business with on a regular basis. So we're very comfortable with the deliverability of those projects. And we feel conﬁdent that the savings that we've presented in the various commission ﬁlings are secure, and we're very happy about that.  And then also, part we got hung up a little bit on our own natural gas forecast versus standard natural gas forecast out there. So even though we thought our forecast was a good one, we said, okay, we're going to just use a -- those standard forecasts for the evaluations so that everybody knew that it was coming from an independent party and we wouldn't get into the conversation of your forecast is showing more beneﬁts than another standard forecast. So we did it from that perspective as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   I think the other big diﬀerence too, we did have a lot of outreach to the individual staﬀ and so forth at various commission levels with Wind Catcher to try to explain what it was about. Well, it's sort of a natural progression for us to be able to move to the outreach programs that we have because we've already had substantial discussions of the beneﬁts of wind power in general. Now, it's a matter of, okay, this is what the RFP process says, this is what the wind power that's available, the attractiveness of the wind power, and we're going through the regular process to do it. And that communication has been positive, and we've also communicated with other parties in the process too to let them know what's going on. So I would say that all-in-all, it's been a much better and probably a much more pleasant experience than before."
"Got it. Thank you, Nick. One last thing, tax rates, how should we think about what the consolidated tax rate for income statement reporting purposes is going to be in 2019? What are you assuming in guidance?","So for GAAP taxes, we're anticipating about a 2.6% to 3% eﬀective tax rate for the year, obviously driven down by the amortization of the deferred protected and unprotected taxes. But for 2019, there's also an AMT credit carry-forward from prior periods. So that 2.6% to 3% is going to be lower than what we anticipate going forward, where we anticipate a rate after the amortization of the deferred taxes to be about 10% going forward.     Meaning, if I think about 2020 tax rate, in 2021, you're using about 10% for guidance for those years?     We are, but, and let me be clear about that. That's what we're using for guidance. That's what's in our numbers. That's what we ﬁgure to be around that 10%. If we were to have incremental income because we're maxing to the 75% allowed for the deferred taxes, if we were -- I'm sorry, for the production tax credits. If you were to have incremental income and you were trying to model that in, you should use a 24% rate. Does that make sense?"
"I think so, but I can follow-up oﬄine, guys.","So let me just try to be clear. What's in our 4.25 to 4.45 guidance for 2020 assumes an eﬀective tax rate of about 10%. If you were to layer in incremental, you would need to use a 24% rate."
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. Understood. So you'd have to -- it has to be a lot of incremental to move the needle on the weighted average?,"Yes, sir."
"Cool. Thank you, Brian. Much appreciate it guys.","Thanks Michael.  Operator  Next we'll go to Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.     Morning, Angie."
"Good morning. So two questions. First going back to the oil and gas related sales, so you mentioned pipeline investments, but we're actually hearing that drillers are switching pumps from diesel to electric and that could be a meaningful driver of sales growth for electric companies that serve companies in the shale regions. Are you seeing this?","Yeah, that's been going on for a while, actually, the conversion to electric. And then also when you look at the transportation fees, there is a lot of activity around ability to get out of the shale gas ﬁelds and to get gas out of the shale gas ﬁeld. So there's a lot of optimization on the transmission side. Brian?     Yeah, it's a lot of -- rather than just on the pumping side and pipeline transportation, we're seeing a lot of electric compression."
"Okay. And then, to that point, you were showing us that the sensitivity of earnings to changes in industrial sales is actually very low. So O&M, the plan that you get some eﬃciencies on the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   O&M side that you plan to unveil at the EEI, that would be actually a more meaningful earnings driver, is that fair?","Yeah, I think, one of the key areas we look at is, if we need to deploy capital and reduce O&M, because if you think about load in general -- I think this is for many Utilities, but load in general, you can't have the expectation of ever-increasing energy demand. You got to really think about eﬃciency, what it means and what it means to the economy. And also, if you assume that, then the way that you continue to grow from a 5% to 7%, which we've conﬁrmed, is not only to deploy capital but to reduce O&M. So it's a -- and that's why we say bending the O&M curve or doing those kinds of activities is going to be a key component in the future, I would say not for us, but -- not just for us, but for just about every utility."
"Okay. And lastly, so I understand that the rate-based renewables are not currently embedded in either your CapEx plan or funding needs. Assuming that come mid of next year, you get a green light, at least on that portion of this incremental CapEx, you would probably have incremental equity needs to fund this spending. Would you consider some sort of an optimization of your current portfolio as a way to pay for this CapEx?","Yes, we would. And I think, one of the big process as we have going forward will be around optimization of our balance sheet and capital rotation and capital management, and asset management goes with that. Obviously, it'd be a great opportunity to get the wind power resources, and we will be looking at all kinds of methods to be able to fund that investment."
Very good. Thank you.,"Yeah. Thank you.     Hey, John, we have time for one more call.  Operator  And that will be from Ali Agha with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Good morning. First question, Brian or Nick, I just wanted to understand the philosophy behind the annual dividend changes. As you mentioned, last year, you moved it up 8%, and I believe that was to get you to the midpoint of your payout ratio. This year, it's gone up 4.5%, perhaps brings you little below that midpoint. So just thinking the lumpiness there, how should we think about the philosophy behind that?","Yeah, we're trying to keep it right in the middle of the payout range, and that's what we do this year. You put last year and this year together, it's above the midpoint of our long-term growth rate for earnings. And I think the Board is trying to reward investors by keeping it right in the midpoint of that 60% to 70% stated payout ratio.     It's just unfortunate that we have quarters and years around the annual calendar and stuﬀ like that, but a lot times, you're looking at these -- the dividend side of things, and of course, it's going to move generally in that 5% to 7%. And it's no secret that it's tagged around the 6% range. And we are committed to stay in -- ﬁrmly in the middle of that 60% to 70% payout range, but there's a lot of things to consider. We got the same questions when we did it at 8.1% last year. What does that mean? So we're reiterating that it will be in line with our 5% to 7% growth rate, but year-to-year, you see just things that around oﬀ on pennies and that kind of thing. There should not be any interpretation that our Board feels any diﬀerently about the prospects of growth of this company in the future. And so, we debated that quite a bit because we did want to reaﬃrm this 5% to 7% growth rate. So don't read anything into it."
"Got you. And then last question. With regards to the 2020 range 4.25 to 4.45, I mean that was put out a long time back, I think, last EEI, if I recall, and large has happened. You've got some very good rate case outcomes, Oklahoma, etc. So any thought on that? I mean, and especially, how '19 is turning out that maybe you could move that up, or maybe the upper half or the brand is more comfortable as we sit here today? Any thoughts around that?","We're just -- we're going to refresh that at EEI, Ali, but, Nick always says we we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of the range, and I think that's going to be true. For 2019 and 2020 and ...     Ali, some of these things just sort of have to approve themselves out over time. And we went to 5% to 7% after we sold the unregulated generation, we were at 4% to 6% at that point, because we felt like that 5% to 7% was something that we saw going forward for the long term, and it is a long-term growth rate. So we'll have to see, obviously, we're seeing some positive outcomes, and we continue to see that. The question is, okay, how sustainable is that on a long-term basis going forward based on what we see today. And we're comparable with the 5% to 7%, we're getting more comfortable with the upper ranges of 5% to 7%. But -- before you change to 6% to   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   8%, or you've asked about 10%, It's -- you have to be able to credibly see that for the long term, and that's something you have to sort of warm over to over time."
