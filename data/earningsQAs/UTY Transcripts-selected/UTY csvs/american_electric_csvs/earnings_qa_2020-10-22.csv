Question,Answer
"Hey, howdy. Thanks for the time, guys. Perhaps just to kick things oﬀ, you talk about rolling out and reaﬃrming or perhaps preemptively reaﬃrming in the EEI at the slide 7. Can you talk a little bit about what's backstopping that? And speciﬁcally, in the last few months we've seen some pretty substantial changes from some of your peers in Virginia. How can that play into APCo and perhaps also similarly in Indiana, many of your peers are talking about opportunities, you all have perhaps Rockport. Just curious if you can talk about or perhaps foreshadow some of the conversations here on that roll forward, if you don't mind, at the outset?","Good morning, Julien.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Julien, I think a lot of the things that we're going to talk about are renewable opportunities in addition to North Central Wind, how we're transitioning from a carbon-based generating ﬂeet much more to a lot of the renewables that the Virginia Clean Energy Act enables and Legislation in Indiana enables as well. So we're going to provide a lot more detail on that at EEI and take you through what that looks like.     We do have the renewable requirement in Virginia. I mean you mentioned APCo, we've got the requirement there. And also Indiana & Michigan, we continue to do renewables in various areas there. We're also doing renewables. We just did fourth sale in Oklahoma And then we also have renewable applications here in Ohio that are brewing as well. So we'll have plenty to talk about.  And I think we don't spend, and then maybe we should spend more talking about the opportunities we've got available to us from a renewable standpoint. But the way I see it is, is that we are just on the precipice of a massive transformation to renewable resources. And AEP, if you look at the runway, is pretty substantial. So -- and that will continue particularly as we do individual relationships with customers, but also in terms of the regulated side as well through the integrated resource planning process. So we'll certainly talk more about that at November EEI."
"Got it. Thanks for entertaining that. Perhaps, if I can get more detailed here, if you don't mind. I know you all provided a little bit more of a view of '23 here, but in tandem, you gave an updated view on FFO to total debt under Moody's deﬁnition of low to mid teens versus perhaps prior characterizations of mid teens. Is that simply a factor of rolling forward here? Or how are you thinking about this at this point?","Julien, it's -- low to mid teens is completely consistent with our prior our messaging on FFO to debt. And that outlook was incorporated in Moody's when they made their adjustment back in August.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      And remember, that will continue to improve as we -- as some of this accumulated deferred income taxes that has being repaid to the regulatory jurisdictions are occurring much more quickly than we thought. I mean we were originally think in 10 years and it turned out to be ﬁve years. So -- and that's occurring more quickly. So that FFO to debt metric will pick up as that rolls oﬀ."
Got it. Excellent. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,"Hey, good morning."
"Hey. Good morning. Thanks, great. Hey, just digging in a little bit into 2021, and I appreciate you will sort of share more color at EEI. But could you quantify for us what that 2% -- 2.7% sales degradation was year-to-date, part one. And Part two, should we assume some of that $51 million year-to-date O&M savings to be carried forward into the next year?","Yes. So let me start with the 2.7% load degradation. It's what you would expect. It's largely commercial and industrial sales decreases being oﬀset by residential. And so what we've seen is, it takes more than just looking at the raw numbers on residential, commercial and industrial, it's really the mix. You remember we make more margin on residential sales than we do on commercial and industrial. And that mix has come in better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the pandemic. So it's not been as dire as what we thought it might be because of what's happened with the sales mix rather than just the overall decreases. So that's been positive.  Looking forward on O&M, we have for a number of years been tightening our belt and been very, very tight around untracked O&M in that $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion range. And with what we're doing with achieving excellence and everything else we're doing with sustainable and non-sustainable O&M cuts, I'd anticipate us being towards the lower end of that range going forward.      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   When we look at the load forecast, I mean, if you assume 2021 is going to be better, which we believe it is, and you look at that mix, we don't see residential -- I mean, obviously, it will moderate as the economy comes back on the industrial and commercial side, commercial in particular. But still you're going to have a continued long-standing remnant of improved residential support just by virtue of what companies have learned from the work-from-home environment. So I'm a little bit bullish on the load, and at least a ﬁnancial picture associated with the load.  And then, when you look at the O&M, this Achieving Excellence program, I don't -- it has truly been a fundamental change for us, an augmentation of all the lean activities and other things that we did before. And it really is focused on a regular part of our budget process to ensure that we're capturing savings in every step along the way. So feeling pretty good about the continual progress year-on-year of Achieving Excellence."
"That's great, guys. Thanks for that color. Maybe just initial thoughts, and I appreciate the devil is going to be in the details, but initial thoughts on elections, taxes, climate plan and implications for AEP.","So I guess well, ﬁrst of all, the election. Certainly is a noisy election cycle and who knows what's going to happen here, we never know. But we've got a 114 years history of managing between the goal post here. So we'll continue to do that. And our focus is on moving to that clean energy economy. So really the only diﬀerence I see is maybe the pace at which the change will occur if there's a Biden administration versus Trump. But nevertheless it doesn't change that much for us, because we're focused on moving that clean energy economy as quickly as we can to ensure that we are making that transition into the future that we know is going to happen.  Now who knows where technology will go even for fossil fuels. But nevertheless we'll continue that transition to renewables and certainly some natural gas to ensure that we are delivering for our customers in the future. So from a climate perspective, we've got a very -- we have an excellent record. As a matter of fact, that's why we get seen from the ESG Community. They know what we're doing. They know what our message is. We're making continual progress, and we'll continue to make that progress.  And then when you think about, as I said in my original write up, I used the word latent, because it is somewhat of an undeveloped or emerging activity around electriﬁcation of the economy certainly around O&M and what we ﬁnd with digitization and automation. And then of course as we move forward with the transformation, the generation transformation that we see ahead of us. So that's why I'm feeling pretty good about where this company is heading.     Just a quick update on taxes. If we were to have an increase in taxes, we anticipate that our commissions would handle it, really one of two ways and not dissimilar to how they handled tax reform three or four years ago. We anticipate that they would either allow the increase to be   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   deferred until the next rate proceeding or we anticipate that they'd have kind of a one issue order come out where they would allow us to adjust rates just to reﬂect the new expected higher income tax rate. In any event, we wouldn't expect it to be a signiﬁcant driver to earnings or cash for the company going forward."
"Right. Thanks. But could be a modest sales into cash ﬂow,like given sort of a reset in ADIT amongst other things?","I think it'll help FFO to debt.     Yes. Again, we don't anticipate it to be signiﬁcant one way or the other."
"Understood. Thanks, Brian. Thank you, Nick.","Thank you. Yep.  Operator  Our next question is from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.     Good morning, James. Hello?  Operator  James, your line is on mute possibly. Your line is open."
"Hey, thanks, guys. Apologize -- Good morning.",Good morning.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)
"Two real quick questions. Just ﬁrst, I guess Brian, just addressing North-Central wind. I noticed in the slides that Traverse looked like potentially the in-service could be pushed out maybe by a quarter or so. Could you talk a little bit about is that just a supply chain issue related to COVID? Or is there something else that was kind of driving that extended outlook?","Yes. A lot of it has to do more so than actual physical things. It's our ability to get permitting and the like done. And so during the shutdown it was hard to be able to get into the oﬃces, do land acquisitions, title searches, and things like that. And that just pushed us -- potentially pushed it back a bit, James. We're not anticipating anything material there. We still anticipate late this year to early next year, but just wanted to signal that due to some of those unanticipated issues -- largely associated with COVID that that project could have a range of when it would come online.     Hey, James, we feel like it's still going to be the end of December, but obviously, it could fall into that range in the ﬁrst quarter. We're conﬁdent of that particular range. But remember, we're not making any progress payments either. It's sort of a -- we require it when it's done. So from a ﬁnancial perspective, it's ﬁne."
"Okay. Great. Thanks. And I guess just following up on that same issue. Brian, you talked about three sort of potential ways to ﬁnance the ﬁnal acquisition of those. And this has been beaten to death. But as you guys look to give 2021 guidance, obviously an ATM would be something to be kind of spread over the full year, but asset rotation or even block equity would be probably something. And I think as you were saying sort of coordinating it with the ﬁnal close would be something maybe closer to the end of the year. How are you guys, I guess, thinking about that from a modeling perspective as you present 2021?","It kind of matches what Nick was saying is that, the projects don't -- we don't get the projects until commercial completion is done. We then get the project. And given the discrete nature of them we can really time the equity issuance very closely with when the project comes online. And James, the reason we need that ﬂexibility, you look at Sundance, which we're anticipating in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020. That's about a $300 million project. We'll be able to time the equity issuance, if that's what it is, closely with when that project comes online. The next one which we're anticipating at the end of 2021 is about a $400 million project, Maverick. And then the last one is Traverse, which is about $1.3 billion, and we talked about that being late 2021, early 2022.  We believe that whether it's an at-the-market program, a follow-on issuance or asset rotation, we're going to be able to time those very, very closely with when those discrete projects come   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   online. So from a modeling standpoint, the timing that we're talking about really is going to be insigniﬁcant to 2021. And it's just -- I'll start repeating myself, it's insigniﬁcant to 2021.     James, Brian mentioned the options we're looking at. And rest assured, internally we are also beating it to death. So we'll make sure that we're making the right decisions relative to the timing associated with those investments."
"No, no worries. I understand the in-service dates and it gives you guys a lot of ﬂexibility. Last question I guess I just had, and you kind of answered my initial question, was going back to the trailing 12 month FFO, it kind of dipped down. You guys are looking for that to show sort of trend back into kind of where you guys are thinking sort of low to mid-teens I guess. Is that -- are you still targeting that in the sort of '21, '22, '23 time frame? I know you just updated your cash ﬂow forecast for that recently.","Yes, we are. It's that time frame, yes."
"Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for the time.","Thanks, James.  Operator  And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead."
Hey guys...,"Good morning, Michael."
"Morning, Nick. Thank you guys for taking my question. And Nick, sorry about your LSU Tigers, fell from the...   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)",Yes. Alabama's doing good though. I'm sure you're happy with that.
"Yes. Well, let's hope (they keep ﬁghting). Hey, I want to come back to tax a little bit. And who the heck knows what Uncle Sam is going to do in the next year or so regarding corporate tax rates. But if there's a change in administration, if there's a higher corporate tax rate. I think we've seen numbers ﬂoated around of 27% or 28%. I get that it's probably not much of an impact on the earnings power one way or another for AEP. But if you're talking to State Commissioners or staﬀ at the PSCs or PUCs or others, it is a rate increase on customers. And it's a double whammy because the cost of service goes up due to the higher tax rate and that just kind of ﬂows through the rates, but also the ﬂow back of ADFIT kind of slows down or declines. And it just strikes me as a -- if I'm a, say, Utility Commissioner or a public policy maker in given states, you're asking for what could be pretty decent-sized rate increases on customers coming out of an economic downturn? How do you -- how does that get oﬀset? I think about it from a customer standpoint, what's the giveback?","I think there's no doubt that -- and again, I think there was a lot of advantage taken with the tax reductions that occurred. And you're right. There's no doubt that there will be headroom that is reduced because it is certainly going to be an impact to put those back in.  Now the question is how it's put back in or over what time frame and that kind of thing. But also that's why it's so important for us to move forward as quickly as possible and accelerate Achieving Excellence so that we can mitigate that impact as much as possible. But still you're looking at it in the face of a deﬁnite need for rehabilitation and continued capitalization of the grid to ensure that we have reliability and resiliency of supply. Particularly when dealing with hurricanes, wildﬁres, cyber, all those kinds of issues, we have to respond to that.  So there will be rate increases associated with the implementation of new taxes. And I don't -- I think it's unavoidable, but certainly it's incumbent on us to make sure we mitigate that as much as possible with our Achieving Excellence program and other measures. And we'll have discussions with the Commissions just like we had discussions when Tax Reform occurred. And it's unfortunate we didn't do it over a longer period of time like we had suggested, because then it would mitigate even the return of taxes. And if we continue vacillating back and forth like this, that's going to be a continual issue for our industry that our regulators need to recognize. We do have to keep some reserve there to ensure that we're not moving customer rates around as much as could be if it becomes pretty volatile. So your point is well recognized, but we'll do what we can to mitigate the eﬀects and we'll have those conversations.  But I think one thing that's also come into play here, though, is the nature of the importance of the service that we provide, for everyone to be able to watch their Netﬂix or do all the things they need to do at home, work-from-home, all those types of activities will change the nature of how we look at residential supply. And there's no question that that's going to change going forward. And that's why I'm always troubled by Commission saying that AMR versus AMI for   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   example, the investments we want to make in AMI. It's not because AMI is -- you don't just look at the cost of the meters of AMI and the undepreciated balances associated with AMR, you've got to look at what you're leveraging into. And that's the customer's ability to adjust to the -- their own energy picture and be able to drive energy eﬃciency and all those things and give the customer the opportunity to do that as opposed to -- of -- the system just deciding that for them.  So I think there's just a lot of things we need to have discussions about with our regulators to really focus on what that future actually means. And with electriﬁcation of the economy, that's clearly going to be an issue that we need to deal with to make sure our customers are more resilient, more reliable and as economically -- economic as possible, but also give them the opportunity to make adjustments on their total bill as opposed to dealing on a headline on rate increases."
"Got it. Thank you for that, Nick. And then one other question, totally unrelated. I'm thinking about States where you've not really talked about sizable rate base growth in investment. One of those that stands out a little bit is West Virginia. How do you think about going forward the pace of generation transformation in a State like West Virginia?","Yes. I think -- well, we're looking at all of our States now and all our state jurisdictions. And it's really sort of our resource planning on steroids, and even the dog likes it. And I think there's no question that we are in the process of moving forward with that transformation as quickly as possible, making signiﬁcant T&D investments, but all -- and you see that based on the changes in capital. But then when you look at States like West Virginia, we will be -- I think the ﬁrst step is going to be how we run coal-ﬁred capacity for example.  Will we have other forms of energy coming in and have lower capacity factors on coal units? But still they'd be available at those times where you have severe cold weather or really warm weather in the summer. So it's the way we run these facilities during the interim, but then it's also that transition that we make going forward. I think that's true for all of the jurisdictions. And our jurisdictions have been fairly conservative in making that transition. I think that pace can quicken though as a result of the -- even the bipartisan focus on continuing to lower emissions at our plants.  So I think the catalysts are there. And actually, Post-Election, who knows what will happen, but I still see -- you're already seeing some Republican and Democratic Legislation that's being proposed, that tries to answer that question. And if you have that from a national standpoint and the states are moving forward with their own resolutions, then we can be particularly helpful in ensuring that occurs as quickly as possible."
"Got it. Thank you, Nick. Sorry about the dog, my dog (inaudible) and I, both appreciate it. Thanks, guys.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","No, that's ﬁne.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead."
"Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question.","Yes. Sure, thanks. Good morning."
"I'm curious, I want to go back to kind of the load composition and the rate case activity. So as we roll forward and the load dislocation continues to be -- continues to persist where we have this unusual situation where residential maybe is higher but C&I is suppressed, and that's not really a normalized picture. So as you go through your rate cases now and the future rate cases where this period becomes your test here, right, how do you address that? Do you attempt normalize? Or do you just go with what they actually look like? So that's my ﬁrst question, I guess.","Yes. So we have multiple utilities, right? So we have the opportunity to move around capital investment to time it with relative rate case activity to ensure that we are spending on the right things at the right time, not to say that we're trying to load the budgets or anything. What we're saying is, is that when we go through the rate case ﬁlings, it's important to not only have discussions with the commissions about what we're spending on, but what the results of that spending will be.  So if a load is not increasing, obviously it exaggerate -- it certainly challenges the rate impacts because the denominator is not growing. Now if the denominator is growing, obviously that's helpful. But if it isn't, you're still having to make choices about what the priorities are for each regulatory jurisdiction based on discussions with the commissions to help us determine, okay, what -- number one, what are we willing to pay for? Number two, what are those priorities that exist. And some of those are absolute priorities and some of them are things that, yes, we'd like to do, but it may be that we have to work out for longer period of time before bringing that in. So there's all kinds of dialogues that occur relative to what that prioritization should be. And we will continue doing that with our commissions and we have done, whether it's is going whether the economy has going well or whether the economy's been in a downturn.  I think we're moving toward an upturn. So that's going to be helpful.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Sophie, we also have some jurisdictions that have forward-looking test years, so we'll be able to incorporate a forward-looking view. And then we have places like Ohio where residential and small commercial are already decoupled. So there are lots of mitigants to unusual load circumstances that we ﬁnd ourselves in right now.     And some of these things are known and reasonable adjustments too. So you have to look at the 2020 test year and say, hey, we had to make these changes because of COVID. And COVID's going to be sort of a unique circumstance. I mean, we had to react. And actually, the commissions themselves, we had moratoriums on customer cut-oﬀs. So there's adjustments we all have made in that process, and I think we'll make those adjustments coming out of that process as well."
"Great. Thank you. And then, if I may, a quick follow-up on North Central Wind. You mentioned asset rotation I guess as a part of a considerations for equity, part of ﬁnancing there. What might those be? Is this more of like a one-oﬀ situation with certain assets in your portfolio? Or could we be looking at something more strategic here? Thank you.","Well, so when we talk about potential assets, we look at everything, and we look at sources and uses. And obviously, we want the use part of it right no, is how do we ﬁnance North Central Wind, a major project. And the sources can be anything in our portfolio. And that's where portfolio management is going to be a key part of what we do in the future.  So I'm not going to say speciﬁcally what we're looking at or anything like that at this point. But what I will say is that, it's incumbent on us to be looking at everything from a source perspective and then focusing on how we deploy capital in the best way and transfer that into really projects like North Central and be able to fund it in the best way to ensure our shareholder value. So -- and we'll continue to do that. So I think you have to let the -- sort of have to let the year play out."
