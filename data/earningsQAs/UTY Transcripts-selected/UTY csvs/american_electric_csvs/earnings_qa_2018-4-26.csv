Question,Answer
"Good morning, guys. Several questions for you. I'll try to make them brief. First is, congrats on the Wind Catcher settlement in Oklahoma. You have a couple of parties on board, but you have many more that have not oﬃcially signed on. So, can you give us some color around the negotiations there? And what on the margin you have considered to give up in this settlement to give customer protections versus the prior deal? And what it might take to get more parties on board?","Yeah. Greg, obviously, great question. We continue to try to get other parties on board, but as we said from the beginning, it was extremely important to get the industrials on board in Oklahoma. And I think getting them on-board, it certainly sets the predicate for the opportunity for the commissioners themselves to look at this and say, okay, we got the industrial customers and Walmart and the customers have spoken. Now, there are other parties, as you mentioned, and certainly we're trying to get the Oklahoma staﬀ engaged in this process, but -- and certainly   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   the Attorney General -- probably not likely to get the Attorney General on board, but the others -- we'll continue to be open to that, including the Attorney General.  So -- but at this point though, I think it's framed up pretty well because a lot of work's been done in the background. Our people have been working tirelessly with all these parties around the various jurisdictions to try to drive some consistency around what the risks were being taken. And a lot of it's centered on the 10-year look backs, the performance guarantees, certainly the force majeure related provisions as well. And it really -- as we looked at it and as I mentioned early on in our discussion, you have to -- if you're going to do regulated renewables, then certainly we'll have to meet the market on what risks are being taken relative to regulated renewable investments.  So -- and we looked at it, looked at it in a lot of detail, we have a lot of like -- as I mentioned earlier, engineering, construction, we look at that in detail. The operational characteristics of particularly the generation tower and we've come a long way in terms of the evaluation of those risks. We were willing to take it and the industrials were ultimately supportive. So I think it just sets the tone for continued discussions, but as far as I'm concerned, we've put it in a very good place.  And you'll note that those provisions are pretty consistent with the settlements that have been done previously by SPS over in New Mexico and Texas. So -- and we're having discussions with the Texas parties now. So you're starting to see, in my opinion, a correlation around what risk parameters, what the framework of a deal looks like and I see that momentum gaining."
"Good luck with that. I think that's great. Two more questions. One is on, when you look at the equalizer chart in Oklahoma, I know PSO on a trailing 12, only earned 5.2%. And the rate decision you got there wasn't great, but it was better than the skinny deals that Oklahoma traditionally gives. So if we were to extrapolate out 12 months, would you still expect the PSO's ROEs to improve dramatically maybe if not towards your best case aspiration, is that fair?","Well, you know the odd part about it is if Wind Catcher gets approved, ultimately, it is going to help the ROE overall, because PSO has a really small rate base. I mean essentially no generation's been built there for quite a period of time. So you're really dealing with a large company that with a lot of PPAs for generations. So the rate base itself had dwindled to really pretty small. I mean its less than 5% of the earnings of the corporation. And so when you think about where PSO is heading, if PSO -- if Oklahoma really wants to develop infrastructure around these types of assets, energy assets to take advantage of wind power, natural gas, certainly indigenous sources for that territory, we're going to have to see positive signals on those types of investments. And they really do need to ﬁx the issue of recovering transmission costs as well on a timely basis.  So lot of this rate lag type of activity. It takes a -- it took a long time for the last rate case and actually the rate case pretty much turned out to be a -- to be very disappointed -- disappointing. I was really expecting more from the Oklahoma Commission from that perspective, but I think,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   there were a lot of issues that were being dealt with their, that hopefully next time we'll be able to get over. And we will be ﬁling another rate case in Oklahoma, but certainly the Wind Catcher approval is what we have our sights on right now."
"Great. And my last question is on the -- on page nine, when we look at the credit statistics, obviously, on a trailing basis you had 18.2% FFO, but tax reform really haven't kicked in yet, and I know you said the target is the mid-teens. But all things being equal, if we look out 12 months, how much of a degradation in that FFO are we looking at? Is it a couple of hundred basis points?","Brian?     We think it'll be 200 to 300 basis points, Greg."
Okay. Thank you guys.,"Yeah. Sure, thanks.  Operator  Next, we go to the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead."
Yeah. Hi. Good morning.,Good morning.
"So speaking of living on a prayer, I have a few Wind Catcher questions. Sorry I couldn't help. You asked for that one.",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   (Multiple Speaker)
"Thank you for the Rus references, those are great. So just if I recall back last fall, the -- you had talked about wanting decisions by April to make sure that you would have it online to get the full PTCs. Is May-June going to be okay to be able to capture full PTCs, like what is the real deadline?","Yeah. We'll be ﬁne. Really, we have to get to a point of getting these orders in place and then we'll cover it with our Board, obviously, in our July meeting, and then, once they approve, we are oﬀ and running. So if we get it in that June timeframe, we get the orders in the May to June timeframe, we'll be in good shape."
"Okay. And then just you're totally very focused on making sure you're not taking on risk that are not typical of a regulated investment. Could you -- and I know you just did this, but just when you look at the main risk that you're kind of protecting from, could you just clarify what those are?","Yeah. I think certainly the 10-year look-back, because obviously the customers want to see a beneﬁt, and we're convinced there will be a beneﬁt. Now that goes to the operations of the facilities, but the 10-year look back, obviously, measures the beneﬁts that customers see and we've -- that analysis is based upon our existing generation. So we feel pretty good about what that -- how that would work out. And then when you look at the force majeure provisions, those are really focused on -- and you have to look at sort of the force majeure risk compared to the production guarantees, and the production guarantees are such that we really -- and we look to this operation from an engineering standpoint from an -- and we feel like that there is risk mitigation associated with the production guarantees that enable us to take on more risk as it relates to force majeure.  And then, obviously, that goes to the production guarantee, the capacity factor guarantee and we feel very comfortable about that as well, because we've been in that territory for a long time. We know how to build transmission. We know how to run transmission. If a tornado came through, it could take down a couple of structures or whatever, but we're used to doing that, and we know the timeframe of doing that. And then, for the facilities themselves, obviously, there is a multitude of -- it really is pretty good from a diversity of standpoints, not like a central station generation facilities. It's a bunch of small generators sitting up on poles, and that really gives us an opportunity to mitigate risk on an aggregate standpoint from that perspective as well. So when we looked at it, we are convinced that we're able to deliver the production guarantees but also have the ability to adjust, if necessary. So all in all, I would say, the rewards at this point certainly outweigh the risks.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
Okay. Thank you.,"Yeah.  Operator  Next we go to the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Jonathan."
"Good morning, guys. The ﬁrst question, I think Brian mentioned that you have to address the excess deferred tax in the Indiana and some of these settlements. Can you -- how much of the $1 billion does that speak to?","Hold on a second, Greg. About 125 million [ph] ."
"Thanks. And then, I think you've given some guidance in the past as to what timeframe you thought was a reasonable rule of thumb for this or what you'd seen in the 1986 case. Any updated thoughts around that?","Yeah, I think if you assume 10 years, you'll probably be at about the right place."
"Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then just on sales, Brian, I may have missed this. At one point, I think you said you were going to have a little additional commentary on the residential piece and the 1.4% in the ﬁrst quarter, which obviously is bucking the trend. What's your -- did you have some follow-up comment on that, was it, weather normalization kind of tricky this quarter?","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No. I think that's pretty much on track. The places where we're seeing it though, Greg, is in the places where we're just T&D utility. So we are seeing it more in Texas and Ohio, and that's why you're not seeing as much uplift in revenue, is because it's just in the places where we are wires only, it's mostly in the places where we're wires only. So while we are encouraged by this, given where it's coming from and the mix of those sales, we're not getting a huge amount of uplift in regards to net income because of that residential increase."
"Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Thank you.  Operator  Next, we go to the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Julien."
Hey. Good morning.,Good morning.
"So perhaps to turn the attention slightly diﬀerently here. I understand that you received your order in Ohio, and you've got the ESP under control, and out there. But to what ability is there to negotiate and address the tax issue still, or is there a need to at this point? I just wanted to kind of come back to that. It seems like you've largely addressed your issues there, but I just want to kind of come back to that, given there's not an obvious venue to address that directly not withstanding reopening these issues. So I just want to understand.",So it's typically in Ohio      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yeah.
Exactly.,"Yeah. So we have two avenues for addressing that. One is just the absolute change in rate, which I think we can handle in DIR ﬁlings, but then also what the Commission has done is, asked us, as well as we other AEP utility -- the other Ohio utilities to come in and have a dialog with them about that. So they've set up a hearing mechanism, whereby all of the Ohio utilities would go in and have the dialog. And I think we'll be able to put together something that is compelling and doesn't have to be litigious. I think we'll be able to settle that."
"Got it. Excellent. And then turning back to Wind Catcher really quickly, obviously, you're working every state front. To the extent to which, let's say, Texas and those negotiations aren't necessarily as fruitful here on the prescribed timeline that you just talked about, how conﬁdent are you about signing up alternatives like minis and co-ops, just to be able to continue working on the project, notwithstanding clarity in Texas shall we say?","Julien, I really think, we are going to get the result in Texas. So -- and I think it would be problematic and during the pendency of something that's working to, go to sell somewhere else. So we're feeling pretty good about the direction this all is taking and the timing of it."
"Got it. And maybe, actually if you can clarify. I would suspect that the issues here are largely the same as you've just described a moment ago across the various states. Is there anything unique with respect to Texas? Obviously, the industrial community there has historically been fairly outspoken as well.","No, I think as far as Texas is concerned, I mean the industrials in Texas, you have some of the people, we are representing the same people. But I think you've got certainly diﬀerent industrials with diﬀerent thought process. But when you think about the settlement that was done with SPS and how it compares against what -- certainly what we've done relative to the Oklahoma industrials, it's pretty much the same. And you have SPS settled with all the parties in Texas. So I think we have an opportunity. We knew going into this thing that with four states there'd be some commonality and in fact the four states have, in most cases, most favored nations and that kind of things. So they're all watching each other in terms of the result. And we have a result in Oklahoma and in the other jurisdictions that is consistent with what is happening in Texas at this point. And I think we're in good shape.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
All right. Excellent. Best of luck.,"Yeah. Thank you.  Operator  Next, we go to the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead."
Good morning. Can you hear me?,"Good morning, Paul.     Yeah. We can hear you."
Few questions. Is there a statutory deadline in any of the Wind Catcher states when this is has to be done by?,"I don't think there is a statutory deadline, but certainly there is a business deadline, I mean we've been very transparent about the timing necessary and the procedural schedules have been set out consistent with -- we are getting the decisions on time. So I think, it's really more driven by -- I guess one of the previous question sort of brought out, when is our drop-dead date and that kind of thing and -- but I can just tell you that May and June ﬁts."
"And then, some of the concessions you've made are around cost caps, who is bearing that risk, is it you or the contractors?","Yeah. It's both. We have ﬁxed price contracts with the appropriate contingencies and I think that that risk is being shared. And actually that tells you a little bit about the commitment of the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   suppliers that we're working with, I mean these are established suppliers that do a lot of business that we do a lot of business with and I can guarantee a lot of homework has been done on what these operational provisions will look like, what the construction side will look like, what the supply will look like, what risk are being born. And also even if route changes were to occur on the generation type, those have been discussed and (inaudible) as well. So we feel very good about where our suppliers sit at this point."
"We're not building nuclear plants, right?","We're not building nuclear plants. We're -- I wouldn't want to trash nuclear or anything because I'm supportive of nuclear. But this is putting small generators up on poles, and putting transmission structures up, and lines up and we do that all the time. And 765, we do that all the time. And so this is not something that is a ﬁrst --like stamp number one. And the other thing too is that when we look at this entire project, it is deﬁnitely important to AEP because it represents what we're capable of doing. And when you introduce 765 KV in that part of the country, it could be a tremendous beneﬁt in the future, not just from an economic development standpoint, but also in terms of our ability to continue to serve our customers and serve them well."
"Then one last question. If you addressed this, I'll circle back with Bette Jo, but transmission was very strong in the quarter, what was driving that?","So there were some -- there was obviously the FERC 206 settlement, was a contributor to that, but tax reform also contributed to that, in that the rate base goes up higher with the ADIT not going into rates. So those two factors mainly contributed to that increase."
"Is this kind of -- did all of this hit in the ﬁrst quarter or we're going to continue to see those, at least on the tax reform, ﬂow through the year?","We expect an uplift of about $0.04 versus what we had shown here, i.e. over the course of the whole year, $0.04 to $0.05."
Thank you very much.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Yes. Sure. Thank you, Paul.  Operator  Next we go to line of Praful Mehta with Citi. Please go ahead."
"Thanks so much. Hi, guys.",How are you doing?
Good. How are you?,Just ﬁne.
"Thanks so much. So quickly just on the deferred income taxes, on the unprotected one. I think Brian you mentioned 10 years as a possible assumption for refund. We've also heard from other utilities who are paying it back a lot sooner. So just want to understand is that mostly an assumption of a negotiation? Or is that a preference from your end to kind of draw it out over a longer period because there are beneﬁts to kind of going rate base, as you kind of refund it back as well?","Yeah. So you're going to see everything from much quicker than that, to much slower than that across our 11 jurisdictions. And so the data point that I have is what we were able to do in Indiana, where we were able to increase the depreciation on some of our coal units there and have that be the factor by which we ﬂow back the excess and that was a 10-year period. So if you're modeling something across a system, I think 10 years would be a pretty good assumption."
"Got you. And your preference is not to do it sooner as well, just to understand from a preference perspective?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","Our preference really is kind of do it on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis, right. I mean -- and when we talk about taking down reg assets, when we talk about fuel, when we talk about other things that are going to increase rates, it's really going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction as to what the best way for those customers is for them to receive that beneﬁt. And we're going to work with interveners and commissions and try and be as constructive as we possibly can on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis."
"Got you. Fair enough. That's helpful. And then just quickly, just strategically more from a corporate M&A perspective, the conversation has increased a little bit given tax reforms behind. And it also looks like companies who are better positioned like yourselves with stronger credit going into tax reform have a competitive advantage. Do you see that at all, do you see any dialog increasing and how are you looking at strategic M&A at this point?","So let me just address the ﬁnancial aspect of it, and I'll let Nick address the strategic aspect of it. So when we're looking at our balance sheet, you look at our credit metrics and they are very healthy now. We do expect them to go back into the normal range. We are Baa1 rated company, due to the impact of tax reform. So we're very strong right now. We had anticipated being a tax- payor. That's gone away to a large degree with the impact of tax reform, Wind Catcher and other such things. But because of the impacts of tax reform, we do anticipate as we talked about earlier in the call in the question-and-answer period that FFO to debt to come in 200 to 300 basis points over the next year or so. So, we anticipate consuming that cushion that you might see there otherwise and I'll let Nick comment on the strategic component.     Yeah. So we are in the middle of what I would call an M&A transaction without a premium, it's called the Wind Catcher. And so, when we look at the strength of the balance sheet, certainly, we'll be looking at the ﬁnancing needs for Wind Catcher. And that's a 4.5 billion transaction. So that's where our thoughts are at this point."
Got you. Thanks so much guys. I appreciate it.,"Thank you.  Operator  Next is the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning. Nick, to clarify, as you're looking at the four states for approval in Wind Catcher, is it fair to say that just given where we are, that Oklahoma probably is the most challenged of the four? And related to that could you theoretically complete the project if the other three states were to say yes, and Oklahoma was to say no?","Yeah. So on the ﬁrst point. I would agree with the Oklahoma has been the most challenging and really with the ALJ order there, it was -- it made even more of a challenge for the commissioners to really take a look at it from a positive standpoint. And -- but I really believe they will at the end of the day, and -- because they obviously look at much broader issues. And so, with that said, I think as far as Wind Catcher is concerned, we intend on this project being for those four states and certainly the FERC customers, or some FERC customers too, that are involved. And if one were to fall out, we are really -- as I said, I mean I think we're at a good place in terms of the transition of getting this thing across the ﬁnish line. And at this point, we're really aren't entertaining the notion of going forward with the project without one of the jurisdictions. I just -- I really don't see that happening."
"I see. Second question. Brain, I wanted to clarify if I heard you right, you were mentioning that when you are looking at your transmission earnings for 2018, you are now thinking they will come in about $0.04 to $0.05 better than what you had indicated to us back at EEI. Is there anything oﬀsetting that or in the context of the year, should we see that as a positive cushion that may -- if things play out -- cause you to move the right or above your -- mid-point of your range?","That's a good question, Ali. It's really early in the year and a company as big as ours, we're going to have pluses and minuses across the year as things go on. So we wouldn't anticipate any change at this point to what our guidance is. That's just one area that is up versus what we had anticipated. There are others that are down and we'll lay those out to you as we go through the year on a quarterly basis."
"Okay. And last question. Can you also remind us relative to the rate increase that you had assumed in your '18 guidance, how much of that is currently locked in?",American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So we have about 75% of it's currently locked in.
75%. Got it. Thank you.,"Okay.     Thank you, Ali.  Operator  Next we go to the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Paul."
Good morning. How are you?,Just ﬁne.
Just quickly follow-up here on Wind Catcher. Why is that the -- what are the key issues I guess sort of maybe stopping the OCC staﬀ and others from coming on board?,"Your guess is good as mine. I think, obviously, the ALJ looked at it from a procedural base as it seemed like to me, but we're pretty convinced we did fall into the RA provisions under Oklahoma law. But obviously we'll continue with discussions with certainly the Oklahoma staﬀ, and I think I really do believe we'll put provisions in place with the industrials that should beneﬁt that discussion with them. Obviously, to have that kind of company of the customers certainly would help from a policy side and from a staﬀ side to really take a hard look at this. So the verdict is still out on that and we'll continue those discussions."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. And then there is this -- in Oklahoma there is this tax issue on wind. I guess we expect it's intertwined with school funding and there was some -- that sort of passed the House yesterday. And I was just wondering, how does that -- how would that work with respect to the settlement or with respect to the project or does it have any impact, can you just give us sort of a sense about that?","Well, it won't have any impact on the project. And it got pulled out of legislature yesterday. So we don't see that happening."
"I mean I thought it passed the House, it is what I just saw. The provision for the tax credit I thought was removed. We can talk about it later, but what you're saying is you don't see any activity on that whatsoever, is what --",No.
"Okay. If there did -- if something like that did happen though since it's been sort of debated and what have you, and the school funding issue, what would -- in terms of the settlement, how would that -- would that be something that you guys would absorb or would that be something that -- how would that be treated if there was subsequently some sort of impact on wind generation in Oklahoma as a result of something that the state legislature may or may not do in the future?","Yeah. So there is that risk, but not likely. And the state tax credit wasn't assumed in the Wind Catcher economics to begin with. So if something were to occur, it wouldn't have any eﬀect."
"Okay. So I got you. Okay. I think maybe that's what was in there, maybe that's what I'm confused. Okay. Great. And then -- and that's it. I really appreciate. Thanks so much, Nick.","Sure thing, Paul.  Operator  Next we'll go to the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Good morning, Christopher."
"Good morning, guys. I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on the potential for grid modernization spend in Ohio. Previously, I think you've talked about $500 million of incremental potential versus your current plan if you get the green light there, but the Commission has been going through exploring the process generically for the whole state and I am curious to hear your thoughts?","Yeah. So, the 500 million was for the entire system, because you remember we presented that at EEI. If we are able to get -- move forward with grid modernization in those -- in all those jurisdictions, there was an incremental 500 million. Certainly, Ohio -- the order sort of sets up the tone to really have that discussion, because the more we move into technological front and the more we move into optimization eﬃciencies around the grid, we will be able to have those kind of discussions. And I think yesterday's order of the Ohio Commission was the ﬁrst step in that process. And I think it bodes well for Ohio and certainly, we'll use that pattern in the rest of our system as well. So, right now, there is nothing incremental on the 500 million. That was really -- that was a distribution investment rider and those kinds of things. Those issues are already in place. So, we'll obviously continue to have that dialog."
"Okay. And then you mentioned I think towards 2018 year end, the gap between the seed earnings test in Ohio and the actual earned ROE calculation narrowing. Can you quantify potentially the impact on earnings that that alone would have in 2019?","Brian?     Yeah. So we anticipate it ultimately being around 10%, and that's factored into what it is we've guided you to. There's is no incremental change to that."
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.,"Yeah. Thanks.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Sure.  Operator  And next, we go to the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Michael."
"Good morning, Nick. Thank you for taking my questions. Looking at the cash ﬂow side in the appendix, the three-year forecast and this isn't new information, but just curious. You all talk about needing more equity in 2020, but your cash ﬂow actually gets a lot better in 2020. I mean by like $1 billion if you just use cash from ops minus cash from investing activities. Are you being overly conservative when thinking about 2020 or are you -- is the equity really something that might need to come a little bit earlier? It's not a big amount, but like you are pretty cash negative for the next two years and then it gets a lot better, or this all just kind of prepping for Wind Catcher?","What you see on slide 25 really doesn't include Wind Catcher. And what we're looking at is what happens to our FFO to debt over time and trying to time, like you've seen others do, any equity needs with when they're actually needed and not take the dilutive eﬀect of that sooner than we need to. So, we aren't going to let our FFO to debt metric deteriorate, maybe 200 to 300 basis points, get down into that Baa1 range. And we anticipate meeting to bolster that a little bit, but not before the 2020 timeframe."
"Got it. And can I ask -- what's in that -- those -- that slide, what's your assumption in there for the return on the excess ADFIT, the $1 billion? And the only reason I ask that is one of your neighbors in Louisiana and Arkansas is under a much faster -- and I think one of my colleagues asked this earlier, but their timeline for returning the excess ADFIT, is actually a really quick one, like one to three years. I'm just trying to think about what you've assumed or embedded in your guidance on cash ﬂow for that?",It's that -- just assume seven to 10 years.
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. So if it's quicker than that, of the return of the excess ADFIT, that would negatively weigh on cash and might either bring forward the equity need or raise the equity need?",It's a change in cash ﬂows.
"Got it. Okay. Finally, Nick, just kind of, you mentioned about the West Virginia rate case ﬁling. How are you thinking about what structural changes in West Virginia you might ask for? And whether you do it in the case ﬁling or whether you do it in some legislative eﬀort? Just -- it's a state with traditional historical past years, little bit of lag. Just trying to think about how you're thinking big picture there?","Yeah. We haven't supposed any structural changes in West Virginia. And I think probably all that the West Virginia has been through and going through now from an economic standpoint, we really are focused on ensuring that our rate cases are ﬁled, but very eﬃcient. They certainly are focused on making sure that we're doing the right things by what we believe in terms of service quality to our customers in West Virginia. I think we probably ought to stick to that approach in West Virginia for the time being. And so, we haven't presupposed any structural changes."
"And when we think about the seven or eight months, eight or nine months in 2018, ow are you thinking about where else kind of sizable general rate case ﬁlings may occur?","Well, really the only ones will be West Virginia and Oklahoma, everything else has really ﬂushed itself out this quarter. And so we're pretty clean going forward from a regulatory standpoint.     And of course, Mike, we'll have our usual formula base rate ﬁlings in places like Transmission and Ohio and other places."
Got it. Thank you.,"And I would say on your previous question too, we had Virginia -- recently in the quarter, they also dismissed a case that would have been for two wind power projects. And so as Virginia   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   thinks diﬀerently than West Virginia, the more we see that from a supply perspective, that's going to be an important data point for us as we go in for these cases, how to deal with that. And so, that would probably be the extent of the -- your structural question just brought up that issue in my mind of how resources are being seen diﬀerently in the two jurisdictions and VEPCO and we'll have to try to drive some consistency there."
"Got it. Thank you, Nick. Thanks, Brian. Much appreciated guys.","Thank you.     And operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  Very good. It's the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Angie."
"Good morning. So I -- surprising, I had question about Wind Catcher. So we have seen a number of renegotiations of the wind equipment contracts by utilities, by diﬀerent developers and then the OEMs -- with OEMs seemed willing. So now that you have this caps on the cost of the projects and then you have the performance guarantees, couldn't you just go back to GE and say, okay, well, this is the reality we're facing, as such we need to actually get a cut on the equipment cost and also maybe you can provide us with a performance guarantee for the wind turbines?","Yeah. Brian?     So Angie, whether it's Invenergy, GE or Quanta, all of our partners have skin in the game on this and they are being very proactive and how they're helping us manage the risk of things like caps relative to the cost of equipment, relative to the tax impacts they might have, relative to other increases and decreases in their costs. And it's very much of a partnership rather than a traditional supplier relationship. So they are working very proactively with us on all those issues.

"Okay. So basically the true risk is more on the timing of the construction of the transmission line. I mean, if all of the other factors are already, in essence, mitigated, right, the cost of construction of the wind farm, the operating or NCF of the wind farms, it's really the transmission line that is more of a risky part of the project?","It's all the things that you would think in a project. It's cost and schedule. And so, we have some of the cost mitigated through the partnerships that we have with our suppliers. And they're also helping us to mitigate the schedule component of it as well. So it's what you would expect in a project of this size and scope. We need to bring it in at cost, on budget and on schedule, and we have experienced partners were working with us to help us do that.     And we mitigated pieces of the risk too because we're acquiring the plant at commercial operation. So Invenergy is obviously doing their work associated with that. It's been well thought out. Going to your earlier point though, we obviously are paying particular attention to the generation and interconnection or you call it, transmission. That piece of it's insured. From a supplier perspective, we're in good shape. We've had conversations with certainly their executive leadership about the importance of this, of the arrangement we have in place. And I think in terms of routing, that work continues in earnest and alternatives are considered in earnest. So we're -- when you look at the construction side and the risk being taken, we're in really good shape."
"Okay. And the last question is, so you mentioned that now under the new tax regime, you won't be paying taxes for longer -- cash taxes. And so what happens with at the PTCs and accelerated depreciation generated by this project? Maybe you said that, but are you using a tax equity investor or actually considering using one?","So, right now, we don't anticipate needing one, but we are monitoring very closely our tax appetite with our ability to use the PTCs as we take on a project the size of Wind Catcher and trying to make sure those things match up. That's something that's contemplated in the settlements that we're talking about. And to the degree that we're not able to use them on the same time, there will be an ability to defer the tax asset and earn some recover on it."
