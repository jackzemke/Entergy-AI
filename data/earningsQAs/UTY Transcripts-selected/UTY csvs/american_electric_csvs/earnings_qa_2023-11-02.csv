Question,Answer
"Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question here and congrats, Chuck, on the new role. I wanted to actually start there if I can. I know that there was just some language in the 8-K when you made the executive switch around the mandatory retirement age and your interest in retiring before you reach that age. But I just wanted to ask, are your intentions here to stay on for the foreseeable future? Is this more temporary? Just how should we kind of think about your new role in the company? Thank you.","Yes. No, thank you for the question. And look, I am absolutely embracing this opportunity that we have before us. It's very energizing to enter into a role like this. And although the 8-K did indicate that, I'm committed to Julie and AEP to ride this out as long as needed and as long as I'm adding value, right, to the opportunity. So I thank you for the question."
"Appreciate the answer. Thanks a lot. And then appreciate the walk on the FFO. That's helpful. I just wanted to conﬁrm because S&P did move you to negative outlook and I think in your prepared remarks you said, as you get to EEI, you anticipate equity needs being somewhat unchanged. So is it the right understanding that if you are in a CapEx-raised scenario that your equity needs would still be modest and unchanged versus your prior view? And then secondly, understanding that the 11.4% has some reduction in debt from the renewable proceeds, the cash ﬂow from those renewable proceeds, I guess, would be rolling oﬀ into next year. And I just wanted to triple check that even with the asset sale cash ﬂow dilution, you still see yourselves above the 14%? Thank you.","Yes, thanks for both questions. So yes, our equity needs will be consistent, right, with what we have disclosed prior. I mean, clearly, we'll be updating, right, the years in the cash ﬂow forecast, but expect no surprises there. On to your second question, yes, we tried to highlight, right, on the slide, the FFO slide, the major drivers that you can point to and see what is rolling out as outﬂow, but absolutely, right, in our ﬁnancial models, right, it takes into account, right, the absence of that cash ﬂow. So we do expect to be in those ranges."
Thanks a lot. We'll see you at EEI. Appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.,
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Hi, good morning.",Good morning.
"We've seen a bit of a regime change as it relates to interest rates out there given the sharp moves recently. Just wondering, if you could talk a bit more about that and how AEP is able to reaﬃrm the 6% to 7% long-term CAGR there in what could be a higher-for-longer interest rate environment. What impacts do you see on EPS post '23 and kind of how do you think about oﬀsetting those headwinds?","Yes, Jeremy, thank you for the question. I mean, look, we'll be giving you a walk right on 2024 at EEI, but there's no question that we are planning for an interest rate higher-for-longer environment. We've clearly been able to overcome those headwinds this year, but they will persist. So our plan is to, A, sensibly ﬁnance this company, right, continue to make -- committed to mid-grade investment grade credit and our recovery mechanisms on interest rates, some of them are somewhat immediate or very near term, right? Some of them are kind of medium term and then some of them do have some lag associated with them. So the reality is some of this will begin to ﬂow through, remain committed to keeping parent debt in that range, well below 25%. 19% to 21% is ideal. And oﬀsetting those headwinds, right, with continued investment. We're seeing strong load growth and the positive regulatory outcomes and closing the ROE GAAP that Julie just mentioned."
"Got it. That's very helpful there. Thank you for that. Maybe kind of picking up on that last point there. I think on the last call, we discussed a bit or there's some questions regarding outreach to commission and just building regulatory relationships across your jurisdictions there. Just wondering, if you could provide a bit more detail, I guess, on speciﬁc initiatives done so far, where you see that going, how you see that kind of transpiring so far?","Yes, Nick, [ph] thanks for the question. This is Julie. We continue on with that eﬀort in terms of engagement with our various state commissions as well as talking with folks at the FERC level, and it's important to note that we do this in conjunction with our operating company presidents and leadership there. My objective and your senior leadership team's objective is to clear the path for those operating company presidents and those teams, so that they can have very good traction with their respective commissions and their respective economies in the states. So those continue to occur and honestly, it just -- it keeps me educated so that I can make sure that when we build the strategic plan at the aggregate level that it makes sense and that we're taking into consideration our customers' needs and also the economies that are driving all this magic that's happening across our entire footprint.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So it continues steady as she goes in terms of those conversations and we'll continue to stay out and in front of folks and do our best to support our operating companies. So nothing super exciting to report other than the action is absolutely happening and we'll see that embedded in the cases that we're ﬁling."
"Got it. And just to conﬁrm, the plan is still for you to meet each of the commissions when you're able to do so?","Yes. Honestly, I enjoy getting out anyway and talking with everybody. Like I said, I think it makes me better at my job. But yes, I'm making the rounds and I got to be sensitive to what we've got going on in our respective jurisdictions. In some cases, I've got ex parte issues I've got to be sensitive to, but I'm absolutely making the rounds and we'll continue to do that because the business is incredibly dynamic, more so than ever and we need to make sure that we're staying in touch with everything that's going on across the entire organization. So that will continue on."
"Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you. And just the last one, if I could. The waterfall chart through nine month in the presentation today, it looks a bit diﬀerent than, I guess, what we saw in EEI. Just wondering if you could walk us through some of the puts and takes, the drivers to this and across the diﬀerent segments, and what do you see, I guess, in the fourth quarter that maybe narrows the gap or just kind of the diﬀerent trends happening such as in vertically integrated and with renewables as well?","Yes. So I'll start and then I'll hand it oﬀ to Chuck. So what gives us comfort in terms of narrowing that guidance range, when you look at -- I'm looking at Page 16. I'm assuming that's where everybody is right now in terms of that waterfall chart. So what gives us comfort is, Chuck mentioned that we are able to eﬀectively, I guess, take up our load forecast, predominantly driven by the commercial load that we're seeing. So that's going to be incorporated into our thoughts for the remainder of the year. We're trying to manage the interest expense. That's also incredibly important, another data point to throw out there. The question we keep getting is, what percentage of your debt outstanding is ﬂoating rate? It's about 12.5%, if I remember correctly, as of the end of the third quarter. So that's something that we're being real mindful of. We're also thinking about what regulatory cases that we have already in hand.  As a matter of fact, you may recall that when we began the year, we had something like $290 million of new rate relief embedded in our forecast. We are actually well north of that. We're at about $303 million of secured rate relief in hand, so that gives us a little more conﬁdence and comfort to as we proceed through the end of the year. So again, it's really just steady as she goes and plug, and I don't know, Chuck, if you had anything else you wanted to add to that?      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes. Sure, Julie. Look, the other thing is the O&M management. As I mentioned during my comments, if you look at Slide 16, right, you'll see that O&M is a drag through three quarters, right? We expect that to completely reverse itself for year-end and actually have be a net positive on O&M year-over-year, meaning that the fourth quarter will have a substantial diﬀerence in O&M versus last year."
Very helpful. Thank you. I'll leave it there.,All right. Thanks for your questions.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.
Good morning. It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. Thank you for taking our question.,You bet.
"Looking at your new FFO-to-debt path slide, could you give us a sense on what, if anything, could cause any potential slippage like the deferred fuel recovery? And what might dictate you being at the bottom or the top end of that 14% to 15% in 2024? I know you talked previously about being at the midpoint by the end of the year, but since we've got an updated disclosure here, I just wanted to ask that again here.","Yes. No, sure. Thank you. When you look at the charts, several of these are just simply facts, right, that are going to come out. All the outﬂows, right, are known numbers, right, that are rolling out of the 12-month average. So then we're just subject to the normal variances in FFO that would occur. It's a pre-working capital number, and the reality is, right, softer weather, better weather, all those things will inﬂuence it, but I think we'll be solidly in both ranges, right, by the time frames that we talked about."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it. Thank you for that. And one more from us. On load growth, what's driving the large -- I know you mentioned data centers, but if you could just talk a bit more about what's driving the large increase for the guidance this year, and then more speciﬁcally, as we think about the updated capital plan, which you'll be providing, just directionally, should we expect this higher load growth to be a driver of capital growth opportunities? Thank you.","Yes. This is Julie and I'll pass it oﬀ to Chuck here, too, we'll tag team a little. But as Chuck mentioned, the primary driver for our load growth as we go into the end of 2023 is all around that commercial segment. So if you look at Page number 11, you look at that upper right-hand quadrant, you're going to see a serious or material shift in what our updated guidance looks like versus what we originally had for 2023. The vast majority of that load growth is coming from data centers located in Ohio, Texas and also Indiana now. And if you look across the rest of the segments there, so residential, a little soft. We talked a little bit about at the beginning of the call here in our monologue or prepared remarks about the fact that customers are feeling this in the wallet as it relates to inﬂation, et cetera.  We expect that that's going to improve over time. But nevertheless, what's allowing us to get a little more comfort on the residential side is we've added 30,000 customers year-to-date. So that's oﬀset a lot of the otherwise pressure we would have seen in that segment as usage per customer has come oﬀ a little bit. And on the industrial side, it's really driven by interest rates and the expectation or I guess concerns that there could be some softening in the economy. So we've seen certain customer segments within that industrial aspect kind of come oﬀ a little bit, but we expect over time that, that will improve. I don't know, Chuck, is there anything else, did I covered that?     Yes, he mentioned, does it drive your capital forecast? And of course, the new data centers, of course, require capital to hook those customers up. We do have what is known and customers that are coming into our capital forecast going forward. And there are lots of discussions otherwise, right, in our economic development activities. But everything that we know of and is ﬁrm is in our capital forecast."
"Got you. Just one clarifying -- one last clarifying question. So our question is really focused around that 7.3% guidance for '23 for commercial versus the 80 basis points originally. Presumably the infrastructure necessary for those data centers to be receiving the load that they are is in place, especially because we only have a couple of months left in the year. And we obviously saw that you'll be providing '24, '25 guidance to the EEI. So we're just directionally trying to think, is this a trend likely, is this isolated to '23? Or is this something that could continue and could drive, therefore, capital opportunities as you look to serve that increasing commercial data center load? And then that's it for me.","American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   No, I appreciate the question so much. Yes, that trend, we expect that to continue. I mean, you see the ﬂuctuation a little bit in the commercial segment up in the upper right quadrant of that slide I mentioned earlier. We have projects in the queue, so you kind of see those ebb and ﬂow. But you're right. The infrastructure is in place today. The pending or incoming requests for additional capacity from our customers, so that customer touchpoint through our economic development team is incredibly important because that allows us to not only have conﬁdence around what our forecast is, but it also drives what the CapEx program needs to be.  So yes, we think that that's going to continue and we will keep a keen eye on that in particular because the infrastructure has got to be there and we've got to make sure that we're communicating with our customers so that they know exactly what the appropriate and realistic timeline is for them to enter into our service territory so that the infrastructure is there, because it's not something that's done overnight. So appreciate that question so much because it is a ﬁne orchestration that absolutely has to happen."
Thank you very much. Looking forward to seeing you all at EEI in a couple of weeks.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start, as we just think about the moving pieces on cash sources going forward, could you talk a little bit about how the asset sales processes are progressing in terms of interest that you're seeing, bid ask, and then on the timing side, it seems like a little bit of a narrowing of the timeframe for NMRD, but anything else on the timing side that you'd highlight?","Yes, I can start and Chuck can jump here, too, because Chuck has been really close to the optimization that we've been doing. Anyway, yes, so from an NMRD perspective, we're getting close here. So I would anticipate a contract being signed in the not-too-distant future, and then it really is going to be a story around when can you close. So that's going to be driven also by regulatory (inaudible) FERC approval, and depending on who the purchaser is that could drive other issues that we'll need to address so we can give you more precise time on when we can land that jet. So stay tuned. That one is in the hopper and coming along here relatively quickly. And then, I don't know, Chuck, did you want to talk a little bit about retail and distributed?      American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Yes, you did ask, one question I do want to address, right? What's the bid ask? And of course, we're not going to reveal anything like that in a public forum. But we are pleased with the response we received in some of the early results on an -- that are indicative, of course, but the process kind of goes on. Greg Hall and his team, right, are leading that eﬀort. They are in the queue, remaining this year, the typical process of management meetings and moving on to ﬁnal bids either late this year or early next year. So the reality is, right, that's going to take some time to progress, expect to complete that in the ﬁrst half of next year, and the other sales processes are just shortly behind that."
"Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then appreciate the color on the drivers on O&M heading into 4Q and for the full year. I guess, how are you thinking about managing O&M into 2024? Should we expect to see an uptick that kind of oﬀsets some of the eﬃciencies that you've driven this year that have addressed the mild weather and allowed you to continue to execute on the earnings guidance for 2023?","Yes. So it's a good question. I could tell you what the discussions amongst the executive leadership team here are really focused on prioritizing O&M spend and spending both capital and O&M dollars that beneﬁt and provide value to our customers. So we're really targeting the prioritization. We'll be giving guidance on O&M for next year and our waterfall at EEI, but expect us to be conservative, right? We're going to manage O&M to the levels, right, that are needed to run our business, right, but begin to eliminate things that are what we may consider to be discretionary going forward."
Great. Thank you. Appreciate the color.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,
"Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.",You bet.
"I think you -- thanks again for the disclosure around the FFO-to-debt walk into the ﬁrst quarter of 2024. And you've touched on this a little bit, but I was just wondering how you see that   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   metric track after that point from getting into the range, is it stable to rising from there and kind of staying within the target range going forward when you look at the core business outlook?","Yes. We absolutely plan to target and be in that 14% to 15% range. I will tell you that the introduction of large projects on a year-to-year basis, right, may swing that around some. So as you add renewable projects, in particular, if they come at the end of a calendar year, right, you have the ﬁnancing costs related to that, but you don't have the FFO. The rating agencies are very well of that pattern, but absolutely when you pro-forma that, right, 14% to 15 % is where we intend to be."
Okay great. Thanks so much. That's all I had. I appreciate it.,Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning. Welcome back, Chuck. Great to hear from you again.",Yes. Thank you.
"Just hopefully two quick ones. I think Nick touched on it earlier on recent S&P had revised their outlook on the holding company. I'm just curious I guess your discussions with the rating agencies. We appreciate the detail you provided in this slide deck, especially on your credit improvement. But was -- have you been in discussion? How do you unveil that previously to S&P prior to their rating action or their outlook change?","Yes. So Anthony, I've talked to all three rating agencies since coming in and as well as our treasury team obviously talks to them all the time. I don't think the S&P move to negative outlook was a particular surprise, given the downgrade threshold is 16% and our rating is split, right, they're at a higher rating right than Moody's and Fitch currently. So it wasn't a surprise.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   We continue to work with the agencies to explain our business risk because we think as we continue to execute on exiting the unregulated businesses, our business mix should improve and they should begin to reﬂect that, right, in their valuations. So not a surprise, if and when it is downgraded their ratings would be on par with Moody's and Fitch."
"Great. And then just lastly, you laid out the two scenarios regarding West Virginia fuel cost recovery. One is an amortization over two years. The other one is the securitization, which also includes accelerating coal plant closures. Given the impact to the balance sheet and all the other moving pieces, does the company have a preferred path in West Virginia. And then also when do we get a resolution of that from the regulator?","Yes, I appreciate that question, and let me just clarify the question as well right out of the gate here. To the extent that we've included securitization as an option, that does not assume an acceleration of coal plant closures, just to be very clear on that. We have those embedded in rates today going through 2040, so that is the current plan and thinking. So the idea of using securitization was entirely driven by how do we minimize the impact on customer rates period, and so that was that was the spirit of why we even contemplated the utilization of the securitization and that second scenario or option that I mentioned where we not only securitized the fuel, but we have I think a little bit of storm cost in there as well as those plant balances would eﬀectively render customer rates neutral, so no impact, okay, di minimis.  And then the other alternative was just a three-year smoothing of those deferral or those deferred costs and that was to the tune, I want to say it was maybe 12% increase in customer rates associated with that subject check. So as far as what our preference would be, our preference is to get it recovered. Our preference is to be able to work with all the diﬀerent stakeholders, which is precisely why we put out the diﬀerent options and listen to the diﬀerent stakeholders in the case and just with complete appreciation and sensitivity to the customers in West Virginia that the general median household income tends to be a bit lower than most deﬁnitely the national average, but even across AEP's footprint, it's lower. So we need to be incredibly sensitive to those wallets. So as far as preference, our preference simply is to work with the stakeholders and get it done. And as far as when we might be able to get that done, our expectation is that we get that done here in the fourth quarter. So tick-tock, anytime here, okay?"
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.,Thank you.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
"Hey, good morning, everybody.","Hey, good morning."
"A lot of good information already, so I've only got one left if you can clarify here. I want to ask about the three moving pieces between equity, asset sales and CapEx. And I know you're going to talk about this at EEI in a couple of weeks. But my question is that if equity needs are generally going to be consistent, how do we think about how you'll ﬁnance incremental CapEx? You typically roll forward the CapEx plan. It tends to go up most years. It's currently $40 billion. Does that mean that cash proceeds from these asset sales should help to ﬁnance whatever upside there is to the CapEx plan? Or will you have additional equity until the asset sales are announced? How do you think about the balancing act?","Yes. So I'll let my CFO jump in here. But ﬁrst things ﬁrst, we want to have a healthy balance sheet, okay? So dollars come in the door. We're going to make sure that our metrics work. We talked a little bit or a lot about 14% to 15% FFO-to-debt. We also pay attention to our debt-to- cap ratios, but 14% to 15% is our gating item for us and metric. So we will look to that metric to see where we're shaking out. Dollars will be placed accordingly as we bring those in the door associated with sales. As far as equity needs go, as Chuck mentioned, I used, again, the phrase steady as she goes.  On average, we're around $700 million plus or minus any given year. You see that in the cash ﬂow that we have out here on Page number 29. We are going to continue on with a healthy CapEx program. You'll see that extended into 2028 when we talk to you at EEI, but there may be ﬂuctuation, like, sequentially year-to-year, but I wouldn't anticipate any material shift or change. Again, gating item dollars in the door, take care of the balance sheet and then we'll fund the rest of the regulated business that way. I don't know, Chuck, is there anything else you'd add to that?     No, Julie, I think your answer is -- I really can't add anything. I would just say embrace the capital opportunity and sensibly and smartly ﬁnance it."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then if you could just remind us, what are the downgrade thresholds for Moody's and Fitch?",13%.     13% FFO-to-debt.
"Very good. Congrats again, Chuck. And we'll see you in a couple of weeks.",Yes. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Thanks for sneaking me here. Chuck, welcome. Look forward to working with you. Hey, just real quick on the FFO-to-debt metric, I just wanted to clarify the 13% to 14% target for end of this year. Are you assuming that West Virginia fuel recovery gets resolved?","No. As a matter of fact, what is assumed in that forecaster that walk you see today is everything that we already have in hand. So a West Virginia fuel outcome does not disrupt that path at all. That's prospective for us."
"Got it. So -- okay, so any sort of -- any incremental sort of cash ﬂow bump from there would be accretive to what you show on this slide, right, even for 2024?",That could be helpful. Yes.
American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one quick one real quick. What's the balance -- the total deferred fuel cost balance that hasn't been recovered as of the Q3? I know it was like $1.4 billion as of Q2.,Yes. $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter. And that's in the aggregate across the AEP footprint or ﬂeet of utility companies.
"And West Virginia is roughly like $500 million, correct? A little north of that.","West Virginia, yes. West Virginia is, well, to be speciﬁc, $574.8 million, so call it $575 million. We're paying attention to this. That's why I got a little bit of detail here. It's important."
"I appreciate that. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.",Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
"Hey. Thank you, operator. Welcome back, Chuck. Pleasure. So look, just coming back to that O&M piece, obviously, you put some comments in the script here, $100 million. Look, I think that's a solid number. I'm just curious, how do you think about that annualizing here and the ability to annualize some of those factors? I get that some of them are kind of discrete in nature here, certain elections, but again, in an eﬀort to kind of preview a little bit more on that '24 trajectory, I know you've made a couple of allusions to it here. Can you perhaps lean in a bit further in describing how you think about what that could do for next next year on the cost side?","So we're going to lean into that at EEI in about seven or eight days or nine days, whatever it is. But the focus, right, of the management team, as I said earlier, is really on prioritizing the spend   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   and spending dollars where it matters most to our customers. That's the most important thing we can do and our O&M budget will reﬂect that."
"Yes. No, I respect that, hence the interest. Okay, wonderful. Well, I'll leave it there. And do you mind just on the load front, just to clarify this a little bit further here? I mean, obviously, you have an updated load in the near year that is substantively more robust. And you have a backward- dated load growth proﬁle here for '24, '25. How do you think about the timeline for revisions and the extent of those revisions as you see them today. Again, I know that this is probably more of an EEI, 4Q kind of conversation, but I mean, clearly we're seeing these kinds of revisions across the PJM footprint. How do you think about that? And also maybe, how does that tee-up with PJM itself here and potential further transmission-oriented opportunities?","Yes. So as you can see, right, the load growth in particular in commercial is pretty robust. Those numbers will be updated when we come to EEI. And as I said earlier, it's embrace the opportunity. This is a good opportunity for us. I think you have to be smart about it and kind of vet out what is real and what is -- what real load is really going to come on and plan your capital investment proﬁle around that. So lots of activity, lots of discussions, our economic development team is very busy talking and dealing with the opportunity."
"Okay. All right. Well, I'll leave it there. Top of the hour. Good luck, guys. Thank you.",Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
"Hi. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my question. Can you please clarify, you mentioned that you could implement or it's possible to implement interim rates in Kentucky in January. Do you actually intend to do that? Or how does it sort of politically work out for you there?","Yes. Generally, Sophie, we try to take advantage of that. So that would be the plan. And of course, we'll stay in close contact with all the stakeholders to our case and the commission. So other than that, just as we have done in, say, for example, the PSO case here, that is typical for   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   us. If there's an opportunity to implement rates, we go ahead and do that and kind of risk adjust those in terms of our forecast and understanding of when cash is going to come in the door and all those items that are so important as we put the forecast out to you guys and have conﬁdence around that. But short answer is, yes, generally speaking, yes, we would expect to put those in place or implement the rates."
"Got it. Thank you. It's helpful. And then just a broader question, I guess. Is there any interest to approach state regulators and seek mechanisms to reduce weather volatility impact on your earnings? I know you're not decoupled in most of your jurisdictions, so kind of curious if you still like that type of rate mechanisms or would you rather maybe transition over time to a situation where weather does not impact your earnings that much?","Yes. We engage in those conversations, and again, that's more of a stakeholder discussion and see what the temperature and tolerance would be as it relates to not only just our preferences, but the preferences and tolerances of the other parties to the cases. That being said, we did have decoupling in Ohio for a while. That has since fallen by the wayside, but that's something that we have a regular conversation about. So I don't -- I wouldn't say that we have a push or a thrust toward getting a decoupling in place, but it is absolutely a tool in the tool bag."
