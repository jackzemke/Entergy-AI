Question,Answer
"Good morning. Bette Jo, like an institution is leaving, it's very -- I'm happy for you, but at the same time sad that we're going to miss you. Looking forward to seeing you. That's my question. That's it. Just kidding. No, my question is with regard...","Good morning, Greg.     Ask her if she's going to stay longer."
"My question is with regard, just a little bit more thought perhaps on what's going on on the demand side. I mean, clearly on the industrial side, you've been upfront on saying that things are a little bit behind plan and you point to the sort of trade tensions and other factors. At the same time, it looks like the demand from the oil and gas sectors remain strong except we're seeing signs of signiﬁcant weakening and activity there in real-time. So, how do you guys manage around the potential volatility in those areas in the economy if they wind up trending weaker than planned over the next several years?","Greg, we've always of course monitored load and what's going on with that and we've tried to adjust over time our O&M spend in response to how load is impacted either by trade tariﬀs, the   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   dollar, or things like weather. And we saw that impact this quarter as well. We -- you mentioned seeing slowdown in oil and gas. We're kind of seeing the opposite of that. We're seeing uptick in oil and gas right now including expansions through the end of the year. And whereas previously we've seen things really on the upstream side, we're now starting to see things on the mid and downstream side as things -- as the infrastructure comes in to fulﬁll what's been happening in the producing part of that industry. So, we're still seeing uptick in oil and gas and anticipate increases in that throughout the balance of the year. But we are subject as are -- is everyone else to what's happening with the general economy and weather. We've been very successful in responding to that over the last several years and anticipate doing the same going forward.     The interesting thing is, Greg, the oil prices remain at least relatively decent unlike, I guess, natural gas prices continue to be relatively low. But there's a lot of oil ﬁeld activity. But also, like as Brian said, the infrastructure pipeline activity continues because there's a lot of production that can't -- and that's why prices are so low in live territories. They just can't get the transmission capabilities. So, a lot of work continues in that regard. The other part is even our industrial base is pretty diversiﬁed and it's unusual to see several of them line up. Eight out of ten I believe sectors are decreasing. And you can really point to the tariﬀ activity. So if that gets resolved, we should be in much better shape in our territory.  That being said, there is expansion going on. Matter of fact, there was just an announcement in Corpus Christi of a large expansion there. It was announced a couple days ago. So, we continue to see the pipeline of activity. And I think we just need to get past these tariﬀ issues so that people really understand -- the companies understand the rules of the game so they can make investments. And so, we'll get there. But until then, we'll do what we've always done. No matter what's going on with all the fundamentals associated with our business, we pull the levers we need to to make sure externally we provide that consistent quality of earnings going forward. So if the economy is adjusting, we have to adjust."
"Clear. Thank you.  Operator  And our next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Good morning, Julien."
"Good morning. This is Alex calling in for Julien. Congratulations, by the way, Bette Jo.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)",Thank you.
I have two quick questions. And one is ﬁrst on Ohio. I was wondering if you have looked into and could detail the impact of decoupling from the Ohio Bill 6. I know that this is something that First Energy is exploring and I was wondering if this could potentially be a positive for you as well.,"Well, we're already decoupled in Ohio. So, that really isn't an issue for us."
"Okay, great. And then my second question is plans for AMI in SWEPCO, if this could also be another positive for the Company and if so when we might anticipate future announcements about it?","Yeah. I think it will be positive for SWEPCO, and certainly, we want to go about the process as quickly as possible to get AMI metering put in place as a predicate for many of the technologies that we're working with. So, it's important to do that. I think you're probably going to be seeing a focus on that very soon now that the whole installation is done."
Okay. Thank you. And also including like Arkansas and states like that rather than just Texas?,"Well, certainly we'll install AMI metering wherever we can install it. But -- and I think I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we could do that in the other states already. We just haven't gotten to the point of moving that process ahead in those jurisdictions yet, but we're getting there."
Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking my questions.,"We had recently installed some AMR meters in SWEPCO. And so, we're really managing through dealing with the replacement of those at the same time of putting in AMI metering. So,   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   it's one of those areas where timing is going to be really important and certainly the regulatory process will be key in terms of the implementation."
"Okay. Thank you again.  Operator  Next question is Steve Fleishman, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Good morning, Steve."
"Hey. Good morning. Bette Jo, congratulations. Deﬁnitely wish you the best.",Thank you.
"Just maybe -- I don't know if you have this detail, but out of curiosity, when you talk about the strength in oil and gas, is there a big diﬀerence between the AEP east and AEP west businesses? Is it mainly in the west?","Yes. Steve, yes. So, we're seeing it in the west, particularly in Texas and Oklahoma."
Okay. How about the AEP east oil and gas? Is that down or ﬂat or still up?,It's still up. But it's not to the degree that the west part is.
Okay. And then maybe could you just talk about maybe a little more color on the regulatory approval process on North Wind and just kind of timelines and the like?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity),"Yeah. So, I guess the beauty of all this is it's using the standard integrated resource plan processes. And we'll go through the normal hearings, but we're expecting to have an outcome in about a year. The ﬁlings have just been made. And obviously, we'll go through the testimony and all that kind of stuﬀ in the meantime.  We'll try to move it as expeditiously as we can to take advantage of the PTCs. But we expect the procedural schedules to come out soon. But our expectation is, it'll take about a year to get those approvals."
"Okay. And do you just -- you just need to prove that -- you don't need to prove need, you just need to prove this is like lease cost or in the public interest?","Well, yeah. That's right. There is capacity needs and TSO. And then SWEPCo has been -- is looking at it from really a customer beneﬁt perspective."
Got it. Okay. Thank you.,"Yeah. Really nothing unusual about these ﬁlings. And that's probably the good thing. You know, we went after Wind Catcher because it was an unique opportunity. And we certainly wanted to be able to perform [ph] that project. But, it was outside the regulatory process and all that kind of stuﬀ, so and the risk involved of large transmission. So, this is a very diﬀerent proposition within the framework of the existing processes.  So, we feel good about it."
"Okay. Thank you.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Angie Storozynski, Macquarie. Please go ahead.",
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thank you. Bette Jo, congratulations. So, two questions. You mentioned that the Sempra Wind portfolio, both the operating assets and the development pipeline are actually exceeding your expectations. That together with some of the cost cutting, is that enough to keep you in the middle of your guidance range for this year?","Oh, yeah. We feel good about where we stand for the guidance of this year and with the additions there along with our optimization activities. But also, we have gone through several series of rate cases in previous years that continue to beneﬁt us as well.  So, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of issues to look at, a lot of areas where -- every year we have positives and negatives. But all in all, it comes down to where we fully support the guidance that we give. And I don't see an issue there at all."
"Okay. And then secondly so, you have those additional growth drivers. So, the AMI, capex, the potentially rate base renewables in SWEPCo and PSO. How should we think about those? Are those going to elongate the current growth rate for the Company, i.e., there's going to be some reduction of transmission spending or some other capex to basically keep the growth rate unchanged? Or is this incremental to the current growth rate?","Yeah. So, we continue to look at what the future holds and still an obviously long-term growth rate of 5% to 7%. We're still -- we'd be disappointed if it wasn't in the upper end of that because we expect to get approvals for these additional wind projects that we haven't included in our plan. We're watching the economy obviously. And you tell me what the timing is of getting the tariﬀ issues resolved.  But they'll probably get resolved before the election, I would presume. If that's the case, then we should be in a really good shape. And of course, every year that goes by -- we're a large company, and fueling 5% to 7% growth is more and more of a challenge.  But, that's why we look at things like what is going on with our contractor renewables, the value of the Sempra deal, what's going on with the regulated additions, not just regulated additions in the western territories, but in the eastern territories as well, particularly with the legislation.  And keep in mind too, I think it's really important to focus on what Ohio has just done. It's opened up the ability for us to work directly with customers on the AEP Ohio side where they wanted to because there's customers who have said, we want you to do our solar projects, we want you to do the resources for these facilities.  And to this point, we've been unable to say that AEP Ohio could do that. Now we can. And so, I think that's going to fuel a further expansion from a renewables standpoint and from a resource standpoint, microgrids, and so forth.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And watch this House Bill 247 because I think that's really important around what we do on the digitization, automation, the technologies at the distribution side. And I continue to view the distribution wedge, capital wedge of this Company continuing to grow considerably as a result of that.  The other thing too is transmission. Transmission, we have to spend $2.5 billion just to keep the present average age. So, if you think about that, that's a foundation.  And if we ever want to advance the age, which is pretty old at this point, we have to continue to invest in a large degree in transmission to make sure that our system remains reliable and resilient. So, there's so many opportunities.  Well, another one I would point out is a pilot that we're doing in Virginia right now around broadband. We're doing sort of the midstream broadband that the others, AT&T and others are supportive of us doing because we're already putting in ﬁber for resiliency of the grid itself in terms of analytics. There's available capacity. We can bring the urban areas closer -- the rural areas closer to the urban centers as well, allow broadband to exist in these communities that don't have it today.  And that's another opportunity for us to continue to go. And then lensiﬁcation [ph] of the economy. So, I'm bullish about the growth opportunities of this business. The question on our minds is how we manage our balance sheet around the FFO to debt and those kinds of metrics and be able to address all the capital opportunities we have.  And of course, that may mean recycling assets, doing what we need to do to optimize the eﬃciency of the use of that balance sheet. So, there's still a lot of work for us to do. There really is good work."
"Just one follow-up to the balance sheet management. You never mentioned how you're going to ﬁnance this -- those rate-based renewables at SWEPCo and PSO. Is it fair to say that this update is coming only once the approvals are in, i.e., about 12 months from now?","Absolutely, Angie. So, obviously, when we talked about this opportunity, it's not what we laid out in our current ﬁnancing plans. This would be incremental to it. And we would update that as we get approvals. But I think you've seen from us in the past really putting generally equal measures of debt and equity together to ﬁnance our capital plans and really fairly conservative management of our balance sheet. And I think you'll see that continuing going forward."
Great. Thank you.,"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Thanks.  Operator  Our next question is from Ali Agha, SunTrust. Please go ahead."
"Thank you. Good morning. Bette Jo, best wishes to you as well.",Thank you.
"First question, Nick or Brian, just wanted to clarify the growth outlook. I recall back in the past when you've talked about your base plan. And that was before you announced the wind projects and renewable projects that you thought that your base plan could track you to the high end of the 5% to 7% growth rate.  Is that still your expectation? And if so, and if you get these wind approvals, could that theoretically actually take you above the 5% to 7% growth rate?","Well, I've always said and I continue to say, we believe it certainly will make 5% to 7% more robust. And we'd be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end. And we're going to have to get through and determine what happens to the load going forward.  We have the growth opportunities there. But, you know, if you have tempering aspects of load growth, I think it'd be probably good for us right now to stand padded at the 5% to 7% what we said previously that we expect to be and certainly would be disappointed if we weren't in the upper end of that 5% to 7%."
"Okay. And then more near-term again, just to clarify. You've brought down your load expectations for this year from up 1% to now slightly down. Weather obviously has been a drag. Can you just kind of remind us in the very short term what are sort of the immediate oﬀsets to think about that could help you this year? Is it all O&M? Or is there something that's actually gone better than perhaps budgeted to oﬀset that?","Yeah, Ali. It's a couple of things. One is O&M. The other one is, we've had some positive rate outcomes that have outpaced our expectations for the year.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)"
"I see. Okay. And then lastly, just to also clarify, assuming that the entire $2 billion management is approved, would you consider that all incremental? Or is there an opportunity for you to standout some of the base capex and sort of ﬁt it in within the current capex proﬁle?","We've not made a determination on that yet, Ali."
"Got you. Thank you.  Operator  And next question is from the line of Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.",
"Hey, guys. Good morning, guys. I got a longer-term question for you. When you look around across the jurisdictions, where do you have -- where do you lack regulatory mechanisms that you would like to see to get put in place? Which of the jurisdictions where you think your regulatory team has the most wood to chop? And how do you think that process plays out in those few jurisdictions, like what's on your wish list?","Yeah. I have a lot of wishes. But we have about 65 -- I mean, two-thirds to 70% of our rate recovery is through tracker-rider mechanisms. So, we're doing pretty well from that perspective. But there are things obviously I'd like to see, because this utility business right now, we're needing to invest in the resiliency and the reliability of this grid, and really refurbish the grid in a major way.  And that tells me that it'd be great to have more forward-looking type of test years like we do in Indiana. The formula-based rate mechanisms are really good. But there's still some wet lagging. But they're better than waiting on rate cases and stuﬀ.  And I think it's important to have mechanisms in place where there are formula-based rates, where there are forward-test years. Those kinds of things need to be in place to allow us to continue to invest and not impact our balance sheet from an FFO to debt perspective.  And you know, keep in mind, AEP did not go out for additional equity or anything with tax reforms. So, it certainly, it brought our credit metrics in to something that obviously we need to watch, particularly as you're investing capital. And then with load decreasing and revenue   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   having an impact associated with that, that's going to further impact the FFO to debt. So, we're watching that very closely, those metrics to preserve our balance sheet.  And then, that's obviously something we're going to have to continue to work through. So, I don't know if you have anything to add, Brian.     Michael, we don't have any jurisdictions where we have real concerns any longer. There's been a lot of progress that's been made in places like Oklahoma where we still have integrated utilities, and it's not just wires only.  One of the initiatives that we're working on and taking a close look at from the terms of the risk of the customer and ourselves are the depreciation rates associated with our fossil generating stations and making sure that they're in line.  So, that's an initiative that all of our vertically integrated utilities are looking at. We made some headway in that in regards to the Rockport generation depreciation in Indiana where we had an oﬀset associated with the ﬂowback of the deferred income taxes.  We were able to shorten up the depreciation period and not impact customer rates by having that oﬀset from the deferred income tax ﬂowback. So, that's an initiative that we're working across the jurisdictions. But it's kind of a blessing, we don't have any that we would call trouble jurisdictions today.  The jurisdictions are operating well, and our operating companies have strong relationships with the regulators and legislatures. And we're getting good outcomes like Nick described in Ohio. So, there's no sore point that we are overly concerned about but just some broad-based initiatives that we continue to work.     Yeah. A lot of balls on our equalizer chart, it's either because of weather or that we continue to invest heavily in these jurisdictions. But it's clearly important for us. And you're seeing advancement of formula-based rate mechanisms, Arkansas, for example.  We now have some riders -- signiﬁcant riders in TSO in Oklahoma. And of course, the other riders in Indiana, Michigan, and so forth. And those are beneﬁcial. But if I look at two things forward-looking for this industry, with the issues of cyber, physical security, refurbishment of the grid, ensuring that we maintain a reliable system going forward, it's imperative that we're able to invest and recover on a timely basis.  And that tells me, you know, formula-based rates, I'll take it, forward-test years, even better. And we need to work that around the horn across all the jurisdictions."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Got it, guys. Thank you. Very thorough answer. Much appreciated.","Operator, we have time for one more call.  Operator  Okay. And that question is from the line of Praful Mehta of Citi. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Praful."
Hi good morning and congratulations Bette Jo. All the best.,Thank you.
"So, maybe the ﬁrst question on slide 9, where you have the industrial growth, and I know you've touched on this in the past. But just wanted to conﬁrm, year-to-date down 1.5%. But your budget clearly is positive. So, you clearly see already things that are in place that would increase in load between now and year-end. Is that right, just to conﬁrm?","That's correct, Praful. And when we see expansions that are out a year or more than a year, we need to really weight those for probability of them coming in. We feel pretty conﬁdent about things as close in as six months."
"Yeah. Exactly. That's what I would have got. So, thanks for conﬁrming. And secondly, maybe on the credit point that you all made because you have all these opportunities for investment, and you will be conservative by the sounds of it on the ﬁnancing side, just wanted to understand how the cash eﬀective tax rate ﬁts into that because it's helpful, on slide 34, you've indicated around a 5% cash tax rate.  Is that something that you expect will stay around that level? Or does that -- you expect that to change? And would that put any pressure on the metrics over time?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","So, we do expect the cash tax rate to be around that 5.25% going forward. Clearly, the ﬂowback of the deferred taxes is a big use of our cash these days. But remember, we had gone in with this strong balance sheet before tax reform thinking we are going to become a big payor of taxes.  And now that we're not a big payor of taxes, we're a big ﬂow backer of deferred income tax. That's -- I don't think that's a word. But we are now ﬂowing back signiﬁcant amounts of deferred taxes. So, for this year, given the orders that we had, we had anticipated ﬂowing back both protected and unprotected, about $267 million.  We're now going to be ﬂowing back about $330 million in 2019. Going forward, in the next three years, we anticipate that number being a lot closer to about $200 million."
Got you. And that was a choice in terms of ﬂowing back more this year given you have some room on the metrics?,It was a choice by our regulators.
"Got you. All right. Well, thank you so much. Really appreciate the color.","Thanks, Praful.     Thank you for joining us on today's call.
