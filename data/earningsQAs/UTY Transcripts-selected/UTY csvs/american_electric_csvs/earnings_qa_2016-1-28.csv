Question,Answer
"Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Morning, Greg. How are you?"
I'm well.,Good.
"My ﬁrst question goes to your last point. When I look at slide 31 of the handout, one of the hallmarks of the company under your management has been a very, very focus on balance sheet integrity. And what I see here is that from 2016 to 2018, even with the increase in capital spending, because there's such a signiﬁcant increase in cash from operations, your 2016 to 2018 excess capital required is down by $1.1 billion and thus your debt capital market needs are also down by $1.1 billion. Doesn't that basically ﬂow to retained earnings and further potentially strengthen the balance sheet from here?","It does, Greg.     Yeah.     The issue is part of what we talked about here is increasing the CapEx some but as we get the increase in retained earnings, that also increases our ability to access debt capital markets and we'll be reviewing that as we evaluate our plans as we enter into a period where we'll be spending in order to get ready for the Clean Power Plan and other opportunities like that later this decade."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   But it's fair, just eyeballing this, to say that exiting 2018, the balance sheet should be in an even stronger position than it is today, unless you decide to spend further capital over the period?",Yeah. We have not consumed all of the excess cash that the bonus depreciation extension has created for us.
Great. That was my key question. Thanks. I'll let somebody else ask and go to the back if I have more.,"Yeah. It is interesting, Greg, though this time around, Congress, instead of waiting until the end of the year to give you, the existing year, they did the ﬁve years. So it really helped in terms of the cash and capital planning. And you're right, we didn't, we haven't utilized all of the capital available to us. But nevertheless, we'll continue to focus on additional opportunities for us, particularly as it relates to infrastructure spending.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with UBS. Please go ahead."
"Hi. Hello. Just to follow up on Greg's question: Does that mean that you could in theory lever up more on certain subsidiaries, such as Transmission, going forward? Is that one of the possibilities?","Yeah. So debt avoidance is one of the possibilities that we're looking at. Obviously, the closest thing that we've done is spending incremental CapEx. But debt avoidance and/or levering up are opportunities that the incremental cash makes available to us."
"Yeah. I'm just thinking with a stronger balance sheet, you could also lever, increase the leverage on that subsidiary if allowed.","We could, Michael."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And also I was wondering if you could go into a little more detail as to why you think sales forecasts for the shale plays will continue to be in the 0.9% or continue to grow going forward? That you don't see any potential problems, I guess, in the next two years, considering the low prices?","It is interesting because we continue to see more and more opportunities for the electric load to continue to pick up. Additional compressor loads, optimization within the ﬁelds of sales, improved production of the existing wells. That continues. And of course we're also looking very closely at new opportunities that are coming on line that have been identiﬁed, and gauging the progress of them coming in in 2016 as well. So we continue to, and we are in very close touch with our customers out there, particularly ones who have discussed expansion or addition of new facilities, and keeping in touch with them about timing of projects and the additional load associated with that. So we're keeping our ear close to the ground on all of that activity.  Operator  Next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead."
"Hi, guys.",Hello. Hello.
"Hi. My question was ﬁrstly on the EPS and cash ﬂow guidance that you have for 2016, and obviously, the cash ﬂow guidance you have going out as well. What is embedded in that in terms of both the PPA and also the outcome of the strategic review?","Yeah. We don't have anything in there for that forecast at this point, and what we'll do – obviously, we want to get the PPA done and evaluate fully where we're at in terms of not only the incremental, any incremental earnings associated with PPA, but obviously, we have other factors we're looking at in terms of load and other issues to look at. So we'll deal with that when that time comes."
"I've got you. So just to be clear, if there is a PPA, outcome as positive, then that obviously is an incremental upside to the guidance you have right now? Is that fair?   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)","So we have to work through that process and fully understand it ﬁrst. So I don't want to get out on a limb and tell you that would be the case, but obviously, getting the PPA in place would be very good for the company. But we're also looking at, like I said, other things that may – because I think after ﬁrst quarter, we'll probably have a better handle on what load looks like, and then see that, some relative degree of consistency to make a good, really, a good forecast in terms of guidance and that kind of thing.     Praful, I think if we were to get new data sets around a PPA and/or disposition of a business, I think it would be incumbent on us to provide an update to guidance, and we would do that."
"Fair enough. That's very helpful. And then secondly, I've heard there is rumblings around a legal challenge associated with the PPA. Who knows where that goes, but just trying to understand, if that legal challenge comes up, how does that impact strategic review of the non-PPA assets? Because I'm assuming the outcome of that legal challenge would have an impact on the buyer's view about the value of the assets.","Well, okay, so let's just keep in mind, there's really two sets of assets here. One is the ones that are covered under the PPA, and yeah, there are probably rumblings and probably more than rumblings at this point. There's ﬁlings that have been made, apparently. And you have the PPA piece of it that's really about 3,000 megawatts of generation nominally. Then you have the other 6,000 megawatts out there nominally that would be associated with the remaining unregulated. So if there's a case out there, I think anyone that would look at it, if it's on the unregulated part of the generation they're going to – there will be people who are buying unregulated assets and fully understand the risk associated with that.  As far as the PPA is concerned, we'll continue the progress associated with the PPA. Those cases will work themselves through. We feel like we're in very good shape from a legal perspective. There's a lot of dust being kicked up, but that's what happens when you try to do progressive things, particularly things that have the state support itself as opposed to waiting on a federal outcome for a long-term capacity market for example. So I think that any perspective buyer in a transaction on unregulated generation, they'd fully understand what the issues are and the risk involved.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Good morning, guys.",Good morning.
"I have more kind of CapEx and balance sheet questions here to kind of follow-on some of the previous questions as well. First on the incremental CapEx of $2 billion over two years, kind of what's embedded in that? It looks like it's mostly Transmission related but is there any incremental renewables in there that stem from the PPA settlement?  And then also on your ability to ﬁnance that capital, kind of how do you think about the moving parts there, especially in 2017 and 2018 given the fact that you're not assuming any kind of asset sale proceeds, any PPA incremental cash? And I think my understanding of your tax situation was that even though bonus depreciation is certainly adding to your potential in outer years, you probably wouldn't have been a cash taxpayer in 2017 and 2018 anyway. So how does the bonus depreciation kind of help your cash in those years to ﬁnance some of this incremental capital?","Yeah. So let me touch the point on what's covered under the $2 billion that's included. Yeah, you're right. A majority of it is Transmission. And then there's some on the rest of the regulated activity, but there's also a piece in there associated with, as you mentioned, renewable projects, but it's not related to the PPA. It's really – not to the Ohio PPA, it's related to other arrangements, there are other PPA arrangements that we have for long-term PPAs with solar projects, universities and that kind of thing. So it very much supports what we're trying to achieve from a customer side of things. We go out and we participate in arrangements with long-term PPAs with credit-worthy counterparties to ensure that we can put those kinds of facilities in place. And you see the category there I think that's competitive parts where that competitive part is really around our on-site partners opportunities associated with projects that they're doing with – they're supported by long-term PPAs.     So then let me address, Christopher, the last part of your question. We – without the extension of bonus depreciation, we were going to be signiﬁcant taxpayers beginning in 2016 and in 2017 and going forward. So this does signiﬁcantly change our cash position. And as Nick just said in his response, we have not committed dollars yet for the renewables associated with the PPA. If that gets passed that will be an opportunity for incremental investment that's currently not in our CapEx plans. And if there were any proceeds from sale of any assets or businesses that we have, that would be incremental to our balance sheet and cash ﬂow position as well."
"American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Okay. Great. That's very clear. And then just another kind of follow-up on the load side here, you mentioned that you do kind of expect somewhat of a continuance in the E&P and energy- related sectors there in growth or at least stability there. Kind of what else are you thinking in terms of growth by customer class that underlies your 80 basis points of growth overall for next year?","Well, certainly auto manufacturing, travel and leisure, those categories continue to grow. Brian, you may have others.     Healthcare and business services are other areas that we're seeing growth, particularly in places like Ohio and I&M. We mentioned RV sales, and I remember when President Obama was running for oﬃce in 2008, one of the places that he was going as a sign of a downturned economy was Elkhart, Indiana. And if you look at Elkhart, Indiana now it's just absolutely booming with RV sales being up as much as they are. So that's another sector where we're seeing signiﬁcant improvement.  Operator  The next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jeﬀeries. Please go ahead."
Hey. Good morning.,"Good morning, Anthony."
"I appreciate the Star Trek reference and last quarter the Back to the Future. Just a couple questions, ﬁrst easy one on your favorite equalizer slide, Transmission ROE is coming down in 2016. You said there's some lag there. Do you think that returns back in 2017?","I don't have those numbers, but I would expect us, as we continue to accelerate Transmission, I think it'll probably stay pretty steady would be my guess. But we obviously have to look at the investment cycle there and – but obviously Transmission continues to be a near-term investment recovery perspective. And as long as we can accelerate it and bring those earnings in, which we started to do obviously last year, then we can mitigate the impact of the ROE drop. And then you also have a couple of other things that are occurring in there as well. ETT's ROE is also forecasted to decrease from 11.7% down to 10.4%. So that's sort of embedded in there as well.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   And obviously you'll have interim T cost ﬁlings that need to be made. So I fully expect it to stay relatively consistent with that."
"Also staying with the equalizer slide, if I look at Kentucky Power, that's the smallest ball here. I guess it's the smallest contributor for earnings. With the market and people paying exorbitant premiums for some of these smaller utilities, any thought of monetizing that? That doesn't really seem instrumental into the AEP story and it's also lagging your ROEs there.","Yeah, I get that question quite often. Kentucky, on the one hand, it certainly is a regulated jurisdiction so we're still in the process of becoming more fully regulated. And I sort of measure that from that approach. Number one, it's a regulated entity. Number two, it's been one that – it was one of the ﬁrst to do a rider for cyber. It was one of the ﬁrst to allow the transfer of Mitchell. So while it may be small, there's some positive things about that jurisdiction that we obviously have to take a look at. But what you're saying obviously is we see that going on in the market as well but at this point we're focused on being a premium regulated utility and that means we need to deal with the issues that everyone's asking us about, and that is our strategic discussion around the unregulated generation. So that's really where our primary focus is. If we did something with a regulated entity at this point, we'd become more unregulated and that's not the direction that we're going.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead.     Good morning."
"Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions. First, if you have any update around timing of merchant sale, how you're thinking about that? I know you said you expect an Ohio PPA order soon after the briefs are done. And then second on the O&M slide, the $2.8 billion for 2016 ex- riders and trackers, maybe is it a fair assumption to kind of back into what that is from 2015 and assume that continues? Or maybe you could provide some guidance around what that is for riders and trackers? Thank you.","Yeah. So I'll let Brian cover the second one. On the ﬁrst one on the merchant sale piece that you talked about, I think the timing is still, as I said earlier – we need – it's sequential in terms of outcomes but not sequential in terms of the activity that's going on. We're already in a strategic process around the unregulated generation. The question is, what's in and what's out? So we   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   will get through the PPA approach with Ohio. Hopefully they'll make a decision here, and they should be after over two years being a decent decision to make a decision quickly.  And then we know and understand what we're dealing with, with the rest of the ﬂeet. And so that process we would expect would move very quickly and I would expect us to be in a good position to get that done as quickly as possible as well. And that is a focus to make sure we complete that activity in 2016.     Gregg, this is Brian. A little bit over $1 billion in oﬀsets that we're talking about in terms of trackers. And in terms of how we get there from 2015 to 2016 in O&M, it's employee-related expense; it's one-time reductions that we'll be doing. And we've been planning for the reduction in capacity revenues in Ohio now for the last three years. So we've had, as a management team, our focus on the fact that they go away fully in 2016.  So whether it's LEAN initiatives, procurement initiatives, one-timers that we're doing, some of the beneﬁt that we got in 2015 where we're able to move expenses out of 2016 into 2015, we've really been very, very focused on maintaining that O&M discipline for the ﬁrst full year of no capacity revenues in Ohio. And it's all those initiatives together that are allowing us to get to that $2.8 billion level."
Thank you.  Operator  Next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.,"Morning, Paul."
Morning. Just wondering what you're seeing as far as buyer interest out there? Are you still talking to private equity? This would be for the non-PPA assets.,"Well, I have to be really careful with that, obviously. We do have an ongoing process and I would not be surprised if private equity is involved with that, because they're interested in that kind of business. But I probably should stop there because, obviously, that's an ongoing process.  Operator   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   Our next question is from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead."
Good morning. Can you hear me?,Yeah.
"I'm sorry. Okay. I wanted to touch base with you on two things. Just ﬁrst, on the non-PPA merchant plants, I apologize if I'm a little slow on this. What is exactly the decision process on them?","So once we get past the PPA part of the approach, then on the rest of those assets, it really is centered around, number one, valuation. Because these, we feel like are really competitive units and ones that position well in the marketplace. So there's an opportunity to understand what the valuation of that is. And obviously there's ensuring that there are parties involved that are interested in those assets. And so we will go through that process very quickly, and there's, certainly, there's an opportunity there. But we obviously want to understand what the economics look like for that kind of transaction and what it means to our business going forward.  And this is not a sheriﬀ sale, so we're going to be very mindful about what it means to our shareholders in terms of, not only in terms of any potential dilution, if it exists. Or what we do with the proceeds is just as important as the question of what you do with the assets themselves. There's a multitude of diﬀerent things that we have to think about in that process. As you know, we're in a pretty good cash position, capital position, right now. And to go through that process, there could be more cash associated with that. So we have to really think about just as much on the use of proceeds and obviously what it does to shareholders as well. So we'll go through that process and really that's the nature of it. It's a relatively simple process for that set of units."
"Okay. And then with the EPSA, (51:10) NRG what have you, challenge that was made at FERC regarding the waiver. They want the waiver rescinded regarding the aﬃliate PPA. What – do you guys have any comments on that?","Oh, yeah. We feel pretty strongly about our position. And yet obviously they perceive that maybe they didn't think we would even get this close to getting a PPA done. And we have PPAs now. We've got PPAs for solar in Ohio. We have OVEC generation that's under a PPA. We've got   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   – and other regulated jurisdictions, and there's no diﬀerence between those activities and what we're doing here. And really it centers on the notion of whether there's customer choice or not. And in fact FERC has said before that customer choice does exist in Ohio, leaves it up to Ohio to determine the mechanism under which that now proceeds, and there's precedence for that. So we feel pretty strongly about our position. I think as far as FERC is concerned it's asked and answered.  And I think when you look at the case that's been ﬁled, I would presume they perceive of trying to address it there. And when they maybe have diﬃculty addressing Ohio when we haven't had a case for two years where they could have been involved with that. And our settlement is – now keep in mind, we have a settlement with a lot of signiﬁcant parties in this case. So yeah, there's some on the outside looking in and they're going to do what they need to do, but the settlement of the parties exists. It's a good settlement. And certainly it's one that addresses the Ohio issues, and that's what we're about.  Now I don't know, they have their own motivations about what they want to achieve, but we're wanting to achieve consistency from a pricing perspective for consumers, protection for consumers for a sliver of their energy needs, but customers still have the ability to choose in Ohio. They can choose any supplier. So – and that has not changed. So I think we feel good about it.  Operator  Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.     Good morning, Ali."
"Good morning, Nick. Nick, I wanted to clarify a point you'd made earlier. So as you're looking at the sale of the non-PPA merchant assets, you know we're looking at a market where commodity prices are down. The valuation on public equity merchant power stocks are down signiﬁcantly. So how big of a concern is that? And I mean is that a scenario where if the price is not right, you stay back and you keep this? Or strategically, as you've emphasized to us many times, you want this to be a 100% regulated business? Just wanted to understand your thought process in terms of how this plays out.","As we look at this, yeah, you could look at the present energy market, present natural gas prices, and a lot of people get hung up on if prices are high, then the world's changed and there's assumptions about what valuations ought to be. And when the world's low, there's again 180 degrees diﬀerent assumptions about how the world ought to be. These decisions are made on long-term decisions and mainly driven by capacity markets. And for buyers of these assets, they're looking at long-term capacity markets and long-term energy prices, and they're making bets based upon where they think those energy prices are going to go.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   So it's the same discussion that we would have before. But again, these are a great set of assets and for anyone, even on a low energy market, you've got to look at margins. And margins are what's driving the valuations so and incremental capacity markets the same thing. So I think there's just so many – if you look at them on the long term, there's so many issues involved here that it is going to come down to any valuation would be around what someone else perceives the forward curve to be for capacity and for energy, and then our version of it. And we'll see where it goes. But if somebody comes in and tries to lowball us, then we feel pretty good about these assets. They sit really good in the market. But our presumption going in is that we will determine the outcome of what we do with these assets."
"So just to clarify, Nick, on the one hand, is there a strategic decision made at AEP that, look, these assets are going and one way or another we are 100% regulated? Or will the decision be more sensitive to valuation, as you're suggesting?","There is, and going in, we plan on being the next premium regulated utility. That is the strategic driver. Now, valuation, obviously we have to look at and make a determination. Well, is the valuation consideration enough for us to move ahead from that perspective? Because keep in mind, you're looking at things like currency value improvement, PE multiple improvement, multiple expansion, what you do with the proceeds, all those types of things that are also part of the evaluation. Because with River Ops, you know we changed from a volatile earnings stream to one that, by re-investing that cash, we were able to focus on a continual, consistent earnings growth stream and that's how we're looking at this as well. I mean, it's a volatile – you know, it may be great, it may be positive, but it's still volatile, and so we have to look at that and determine the balance of that kind of determination versus what we can do with the proceeds, and ensure shareholder value on a consistent basis going forward. That's the way we look at it. So unless somebody – I mean – I don't think we're going to get any lowballs in this thing. I really don't believe that because it's a great set of assets."
"Understood. Last question, unrelated. Just to be clear on the bonus depreciation, so the CapEx goes up in 2017/2018 obviously has positive earnings implications, but more near-term in 2016, any earnings headwinds from bonus depreciation we should be factoring into our thinking for this year?","No.     Nope. We're one of the utilities that has a ready, willing and able – you remember the Transmission graph, we always have the green and the blue on top, that we were looking for capital. We found capital.   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)      Operator, we have time for one more question.  Operator  And your last question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead."
"Good morning, everyone.",Good morning.     Good morning.
"I'm sorry if this question was asked; I hopped on late. But just on the higher CapEx proﬁle that you released this morning, just want to conﬁrm, is there still levers to increase that budget under the assumption that you sell the ﬁve gigawatts, so can you re-deploy it avoid some sort of dilution? Or you know, were we thinking a little bit more buy-backs now that you've already raised your CapEx?","Shar, yeah. So the plan that we've laid out does not assume anything around proceeds of sale from non-PPA assets. So the plan that you have is a business-as-usual CapEx plan, and if things were to change, I anticipate that Nick and I will come out with revised guidance and use of proceeds."
"Okay, good. So you could re-accelerate further CapEx additions above what you've done today?","All the things that are available for people to do with proceeds are things that would be available to us. We obviously look ﬁrst to reinvest in our organic businesses, and with the incremental cash that we got associated with bonus depreciation, that was our ﬁrst and best use   American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP US Equity)   of those dollars. So there's obviously a spade of other things that are available to us, but you'd anticipate Nick and I would come out and tell you what those things would be at that time."
"Got it. Excellent. And just one last question on the strategic review of the ﬁve gigawatts, obviously there's obviously potential buyers here. Is there some optionality in this transaction where you can layer in the other three gigawatts if you don't get the PPA approved? Is that, is there that – is there sort of that optionality?","Yeah, if the PPA is not approved then all of the assets will be in that strategic evaluation.     Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. And, Tom, that concludes the call.
