Question,Answer
"A quick ﬁrst question here for you. On the -- given all the rate cases upcoming, what were your earned regulatory ROEs across your jurisdictions? And I'm speciﬁcally thinking about 2012 for those jurisdictions where you are ﬁling?","Theo?    In 2012, if you look at what the earned ROEs were, they were -- actually they were within -- a little above the allowed ROEs in the jurisdictions where we are talking about ﬁling, principally Arkansas and Louisiana. So as it relates to 2012 the ROEs in those jurisdictions were fairly close to slightly above the allowed ROEs."
"Great and Louisiana -- sorry, you said Arkansas and Louisiana?",Correct.
And then with respect to Texas if you could just comment where that is and perhaps speciﬁcally in the back half of the year and how that is trending given the PPA?,"I mean obviously, as Leo spoke earlier, we have our challenges in Texas. And as you would expect, given the impacts we talked about realistically in the ﬁling of our rate case, if you remember back a couple quarters ago and the impact of not recovering our capacity cost we have on ROEs, and we talked about ROEs maybe impacting earned ROEs to a level of somewhere close to 6%. And obviously you will see that impact in 2012 in Texas. So obviously it is not as nice a picture as say Arkansas and Louisiana, but, as Leo laid out, we do have options in terms of how we will work to address that and that's our objective and goal in 2013 is to pursue the paths we have available to improve that result."
"Great. And then just turning to the EWC segment for a quick second. Obviously, the New England results came out the other day. Can you indicate whether you       committed Vermont Yankee into that auction and whether it cleared by chance?",Bill.
I tried.,"Julien, this is Bill. We did actually commit VY and it did clear. And you may ask the question, why did we do that as we haven't in the past? But now that that unit has been delisted, it is not considered a reliability must-run unit that takes away a lot of our relicensing risk as it relates to the CPG issues, so that in the event we would encounter any problems, we could replace it with a fungible product."
"Great, thank you very much.    Operator  Dan Eggers, Credit Suisse.",
"Leo, just kind of following up on a comment you made earlier, just looking at the cash generation of the assets and how you evaluate keeping the plants in service. What do you need to see market condition wise maybe to change your opinion on whether these assets stay in service? And is there some sort of time line you guys think about to try and address some of those questions?","Well, as far as the time line goes, Dan, it's -- as you might guess, it is an ongoing time line. We never stop and we never start, it is just always something that we would be doing regardless of what is going on. As far as absolute levels, we are not going to get into the speciﬁcs around plant economics at this price or that price. But suﬃce it to say that it is the kind of thing that we look at on an ongoing basis -- we have always looked at it on an ongoing basis as it relates to every decision we make whether it be continued operation, whether it be hedging or whether it be any kind of portfolio management activity that might be around those assets. So there is no speciﬁc time line other than making sure that we are doing everything with our eyes wide open. But the big time periods are obviously when you have CapEx that goes into it or something like that where you have got to make an assessment of how much money are you going to spend going forward. And so, if there is a time frame around which you make more decisions rather than less it has to do with big changes in cost structure, for example, a big CapEx program or if there was something else that happened. But otherwise it is just an ongoing evaluation."
"Okay, and I guess just the utilities, the weather normalized demand growth was seemingly well above trend for what we saw across the country, although we did see industrial trail oﬀ a bit in the Fourth Quarter. Can you just talk about the mix of the 1.25% growth for 2013 and where you see the most positive signs and the most concerning issues right now?","You really faded out there, Dan. So I'm not sure -- I think you asked a load growth question. So I think Theo can answer that.  Dan, do you mind kind of just repeating the last portion of that? As Leo said, you were fading out."
"Sure, sorry about that, Theo. I was just wondering, with power demand growth you guys had a good 2012 weather normalized relative to the rest of the country. What do you guys see as the trend for 2013? And from a mix perspective just is residential going to continue to be so strong or is commercial catching up? Or how do you guys see that kind of evolving this year?","I think when you -- when we think about 2012, 2012 ended up pretty much in line with what we expected as it relates to growth, not only overall but really even among some of the speciﬁc customer classes particularly residential. As we look to 2013 I think, as we said earlier, we had -- I believe 2012 we ended at about 1.9% weather adjusted. 2013, I believe we mentioned on the last call we were expecting somewhere in the range of 1.3%. So obviously you see that moving down a little bit. And I think we will obviously -- it's moving down because of things you will probably see with other companies primarily in the area of residential energy eﬃciency, programs that have caused changes relative to -- I speak to government programs around lighting and such. So we do see some impacts in residential as it relates to that. We are optimistic that maybe it won't be as impacted as much as we may think at this point in time. In the industrial we tailed oﬀ second half of the year, much as we had expected primarily because of outages. In 2012 we continue to see GDP much above the national average which, as we've spoken of many times, has helped to diﬀerentiate us to some extent as it relates to sales volumes. I think as you go into 2013 if you look at some of the projections around GDP that gap starts to close. So we will probably tend to trend more to what you may see across other utilities in the country. But what I will also say is we still continue to be a place for opportunities as it relates to economic development and potential new industrial customers. We will continue to keep our eyes on that. And obviously as those things materialize and mature you will start to see the impact of those -- hopefully we will see them in our service area. If not our service area, you will see the impacts they may create even if they are in other service areas where they could potentially aﬀect us through some     of the impacts of changes as it relates to commercial and residential even in support of those if those industrial customers are not in our area."
"Okay. Great. Thank you.    Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock.",
"I just wanted to ask you guys about -- there is a decommissioning dispute that was talked about in the press this week with another company -- nothing to do with you guys. I'm just wondering -- I'm not asking you to comment on that, but I just was wondering are you -- have you guys had any interaction with the NRC? Is this something that you have heard about either in your neck of the woods -- I mean with your plants or what have you? Or just any ideas about have there been any disputes about decommissioning calculations or any kind of review that's sort of generically happening at the NRC?","I will let John Herron address that.    We are very familiar with the issue that you are talking about. Again, we don't have all the details. The Oﬃce of Investigation has concluded their investigation on that issue. I will tell you that we are very familiar with the decommissioning rules and regulations and the submittal that we have to provide to the NRC. We have had some discussions with the NRC about one of our sites. We worked that out and resolved that issue. But clearly not a 50.9 issue, which is what the NRC concluded with that utility's decommissioning submittal. We are familiar with it, certainly have done a lot of detailed understanding of what went behind that and clearly we don't have that same issue."
"Okay. Great. Then there was an article just today I think that I saw on how the State of Vermont I guess is perhaps looking at some legislation. It doesn't sound like it is a huge amount of money, but it looks like there is a $40 million potential -- that they are concerned about higher needs for decommissioning expense from a state perspective it sounded like to me from reading the article as opposed to the Federal level. Does the state have any -- I mean, generally speaking my understanding of decommissioning and the requirements associated with that are completely Federal. Is that pretty much the case or is there -- are there some other sort of decommissioning or cleanup costs that states might have if there was in fact decommissioning happening? Do you follow what I am asking?",This is Rod West. The rules relative to decommissioning are Federal jurisdiction in nature. We are not at all and have not been surprised by Vermont's eﬀorts to test the limits of the Federal jurisdiction and to assert whatever state's rights or concerns they would have around the decommissioning issue from a state interest perspective. But it is from our point of view primarily a federal question and those are the rules that we are seeking to abide by.
And there are no examples of -- do you know of any examples where a state actually does have authority over something like that?,I can't comment on it --.
"Okay, I don't mean to (multiple speakers).",I wish I could be more helpful there.
"Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.    Operator  Kit Konolige, BGC Brokerage.",
"To follow up a little bit on the question about the earned ROEs, would it be possible to project in the guidance for 2013 what earned ROEs are embedded in those expectations?","Kit, this is Theo. I mean we just don't get into that discussion."
"Okay, fair enough. And the other area I just wanted to follow on a little bit was on the PPA issue with the Texas Commission, do you have a sense of what the timing might be on that and kind of what boxes need to be checked there, who needs to be satisﬁed about what at this point?","Theo.     Sure. At this point, as Leo mentioned, we've prepared an updated analysis; that analysis is now being reviewed by what we consider kind of an independent third- party, again, as Leo discussed. And we expect that process to go on through the month of February more than likely. And at that point we would hope that the analysis would be complete somewhere within that time line and we would then have an opportunity to see the result -- all of the parties see the result. And if that allowance obviously aligns with what we have done, then we would hope we could move this forward and folks would be comfortable again at whether the PPAs -- whether you exit the system agreement, the PPAs stay in place or not, the economic eﬀect is eﬀectively the same. And we do believe that that is a major concern and we understand that concern. And so we are moving that -- we are optimistic it will allow us to move this issue along. If you had an opportunity to view the open meeting in which this was discussed, there was some discussion around how that would move. It wasn't very -- it wasn't completely clear, but obviously we know our starting point is with the staﬀ of the PUCT and getting the staﬀ comfortable with the body of work that is being done and giving them an opportunity to weigh in on that from their perspective. And obviously the staﬀ's views will be communicated up to the Commission and we will just have to see how it moves at that point. But our expectation is we are doing everything we can, and we believe other parties are as well, to move this along as quickly as possible. We believe all (signatories) to the NUS are obviously interested in getting to MISO as quickly as possible so customers can achieve those beneﬁts. So we are optimistic this will move along on a quick pace."
"Very good, thank you.    Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs.",
"Just real quickly on Texas. At what point -- I guess my question there is there's something about Gulf States Texas that leads to a lower earned ROE than what some of the other utilities, regulated utilities in Texas can really earn. Is there something that is speciﬁc to Gulf States that tends to drive that? And I'm thinking not just in 2012 or 2013, but just over the last ﬁve or 10 years. I'm trying to think about whether it is a structural issue with the market or a structural issue with the Company?","Theo?       Obviously we are operating in a market where we are still a vertically integrated utility and subject to full jurisdiction by the PUCT. So there is no market, wholesale market type of issues. If you go back a few years, I mean over the past three to four years we have had successful rate outcomes in Texas. And we are moving in our view toward a very positive path as it relates to returning to a position to earn our allowed ROE. The last rate case we took a step back and right now our objective is to get back on that path of moving in a positive direction and heading in a positive direction of earning allowed ROE. I can't say that structurally there is anything diﬀerent from us as it relates to operating in a vertically integrated utility market than any other vertically integrated utility. We will just keep working it. And we have had past success and we believe we will have success in the future."
"Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.    Operator  Neel Mitra, Tudor, Pickering & Holt.",
"A question on the weak nuclear economics. How are you looking at unit contingent hedging right now? Are you thinking about using less of those hedges and would you be open to acquiring another CCGT like in New England, like in New York to maybe help back up some of the nuclear plants?","Bill?    A certain part of our portfolio continues to include unit contingent hedges. As Leo mentioned, we have taken more of an approach to protect our downside and leave opportunities for the upside. And right now we think that is probably the best way to approach it. As it relates to adding additional assets, it is pretty similar to anything that we would do. We are always looking at opportunities in the marketplace, but those opportunities have to provide value. And so, I wouldn't exclude that as a speciﬁc opportunity, but we currently have no speciﬁc plans to acquire any speciﬁc assets at this point in time."
"Okay, and then just as a follow-up on the New York capacity markets. Could you update us with your thoughts for the expectation for a lower Hudson Valley capacity zone and maybe the timing of that?","Sure. We are optimistic, cautiously optimistic that we will see that zone go into eﬀect in the summer of 2014. However, there are still a lot of details to be worked out regarding the various rules and procedures that will apply to that pricing zone. So we are actively engaged in that and trying to make sure that when that zone is put in place that the capacity prices associated with that are consistent with the competitive market and not suppressed due to issues such as minimum oﬀer price rules or out- of-market entry, that type of thing. So we are optimistic that is going to happen."
