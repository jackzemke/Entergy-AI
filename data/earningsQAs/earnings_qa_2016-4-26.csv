Question,Answer
"Hi. Could you go back to the Indian Point 2 discussion, and just clarify, is the additional $0.20 of outage-related expenses, is that included in the $4.20 to $4.50 of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings or is that outside of it? And then separately, could you talk a little bit about where you are in that process, have you identiﬁed the number of bolts that need to be replaced, is equipment onsite, when will the replacements begin, et cetera, whatever color you can add.","Okay. Good morning, Rose-Lynn, this is Drew, I'll take the ﬁrst part of the question and I'll turn it over to Bill. So, ﬁrst part of the question was, is the $0.20 of IP2 included in the aﬃrmation of the outlook. In the overall consolidated number, it is included and we do believe there are things that will get us back into the range. For Utility, Parent & Other, of course that's separate from EWC, so we wouldn't include IP2 within that."
Right. Fair enough. Yes. Okay.,It is included in the overall guidance range.
Okay. Thank you.,"Yeah. As it relates to the number of bolts and the timing of the return of the unit, we are still in the process of completing the engineering analysis as to the speciﬁc number of bolts. However, we do have the equipment onsite and are in fact replacing bolts as we speak. That was a little bit of a long-lead-time item, but we are in the process of doing that right now and obviously are working very closely with the NRC so we get concurrence on our analysis and ﬁnal repairs."
Okay. Thank you.,Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your question please
"Yeah. Hey, guys. One follow-up in Indian Point and then over to the regulated side. On Indian Point, on the IP2 issues, is the bulk of that an issue that impacts second quarter of 2016 in terms of that $0.20 or does this drag throughout 2016 and even into 2017?","It's Drew, again. So it's going to be the bulk of it in the second quarter, because most of it, as I said in my remarks, is net revenue and we are not expecting that plant to come on until near the end of June. So that's basically the entire quarter is going to be lost from that revenue perspective.  The outage, the refueling outage expenses are going to move across the new fuel cycle and it's a little shorter than it typically is, it's usually I guess 23 months or so, and now it's going to be probably I guess 20 months. So, it's, I don't know, $0.07 or so with that, most of that, maybe $0.05 will show up in 2017 as amortization. So, maybe a $0.01 this year and maybe a $0.01 in 2018."
"Got it. Thank you. And over on the regulated side, you talked a little bit about smart meters, you've talked a little bit – and it's been awhile since you've done so about natural gas, reserves and rate base. Outside of adding new generation to the ﬂeet, can you talk a little bit about what other items could have the biggest impact over the next three years to ﬁve years to potential rate base growth and just kind of walk us through high level, where you see the greatest opportunities that may not actually be in your current CapEx forecast?","Well, Michael, that's – I guess I was giving you little bit of a teaser of what we wanted to talk a little bit about at Analyst Day. So, if I let Theo go oﬀ on that now, I'll take away that surprise, but the fact of the matter is, we're in the process of evaluating a lot of that right now, certainly getting the meter technology on to the system is the ﬁrst step along with all the back oﬃce systems and meter data management systems and the like to go with that. So in the near term, that's what we're talking about, some of this too will extend out beyond the 2018 timeframe that we're talking about."
"Got it. Thanks, Leo. Much appreciated.","Thank you, Michael.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please."
"Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Good morning, Jonathan."
"Just curious we could talk a little to what it was that drove the quarter so much higher than the $1.10 you were speaking to on, I guess, the Q4 call. Yeah, it sounds like weather continued to be mild; were you not counting on the Arkansas decision perhaps, or just trying to understand what surprised you in that sort of back half for the quarter?","Okay. Thanks, Jonathan. This is Drew. So, there were a couple of things that broke our way in the quarter and some of the things that were determined and some of the things were timing. So, in EWC, there were some mark-to-market elements that came in about $0.04 of that, and then about $0.03 of volume as we actually ran better in the quarter before the planned outages took over.  So, we actually were about $0.07, $0.08 ahead at EWC versus our previous expectation. The balance of it was at Utility, some of it was – or the bulk of the O&M savings that we saw above expectation were in the fossil area. As we came through the outage season, we actually did much better than we have historically. And then the balance of it, as you referenced, there was some conservatism built into the Arkansas rate case.  So, that was justiﬁed. Right at the very end, we did lose $5 million of comp, but that's spread out diﬀerently than we built the conservatism into our case. Some of those Fukushima and ﬂood barrier costs were not part of our expectations for the quarter, but they were able to stay in in that ﬁnal order and then some timing elements were – for the period between February 24 and April 1 went in our favor, but they were in our overall expectations. So that's more of a timing shift between periods. So that's really the bulk of those items. So, hopefully, that helps close the gap for you a little bit."
"That's really helpful. Thank you. And could I, just similar vein, you made a comment about I think, you're hinting that there could be tax items as early as the second quarter, and you made that comment in the context of having maintained guidance. Are you maintaining guidance because of that item or you see that more as an upside?","I think, it's a big piece of how we're able to maintain guidance on the Entergy overall. As you know, on the utilities side, our adjusted Utility, Parent & Other doesn't include taxes or weather. And so, for that part of the business, we're solidly saying we're right at the midpoint. But, when we go back to the overall consolidated business, we had the big one-time outage at IP2, we have the negative weather and then of course the prices at EWC. Those put us down near or below the bottom of our range, but with the expectation that we would get some beneﬁt out of taxes. Possibly like I said as early as next quarter, we think we're going to get back into the range. So it's too early to make that call now."
"Okay. But those are the moving pieces, directionally. Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.",
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Stephen."
"Wanted to get your view on the commercial and residential low growth numbers that we saw for the quarter, they were weather-adjusted, fairly weak. Is this something that's just sort of a quarterly ﬂuctuation or are there drivers that you see there, any color you can provide on that?","Sure, Stephen. This is Theo. I would think when we think about those two particular classes, we continue to see impacts from energy eﬃciency, as we've talked about on previous calls both at federal type programs as well as some of our local energy eﬃciency programs that we see within our jurisdictions. In terms of what we expected, I mean, given some of the economic data that we were utilizing to try and forecast sales, we did see some economic weakening in the ﬁrst quarter and somewhat expected that.  So while I do agree it was fairly low for the ﬁrst quarter, it was a little bit below our expectations, but it wasn't necessarily a big surprise to us. And as we go forward throughout the year, we expect to see that to come back. As we look at gross state products and the regions that we serve, particularly Louisiana and Texas, we see that starting to kind of settle out and begin to trend upward, and we think that will help move those growth rates back to a more typical level. But again, energy eﬃciency will continue to have an impact on our residential and commercial sectors."
"Understood. And can you remind me just as you've thought about guidance for 2016 and where you're headed, what your expectations are for full year low growth for commercial and residential?","I think as we go forward, we continue to monitor the various variables and inputs relative to that, and we'll talk more about that at our Analyst Day. But clearly with what we saw in the ﬁrst quarter, we're going to continue to monitor what we expect for the remainder of the year and make adjustments as necessary. But what I'll also say is given where we are as it relates to sales growth, we did consider that in are reaﬃrming of our guidance. And so we feel like we'll continue to evaluate it, but feel like we will still from a – as it aﬀects us going forward it will not take us outside of our guidance range at this point."
"Understood. Thank you very much.    Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Your question, please.",
"Thank you. Hi, guys.","Hey, Praful."
"On the strategic side, given your transition now to become more of a utility pure play, there clearly are right now M&A opportunities in this space. On the utility side, there are utilities coming out of bankruptcy potentially. How are you seeing strategically where Entergy should be going and areas that you think from an M&A perspective, or strategic direction perspective, you would like to go more broadly?","Thanks, Praful. The main thing to keep in mind is the same three criteria exist today that have always existed. Anything we do we need to be consistent with the internal plan that we have right now, and as you know we have a lot of organic growth that is happening because of the modernization of our infrastructure in both transmission and generation and then some of the things that we've talked about as it relates to new technologies that we can deploy whether it's the solar RFPs et cetera that I talked about or the advanced metering or what's to come next.  So we've got a signiﬁcant organic growth opportunity in working through the investment plan, the ﬁnancing plan and the regulatory structure around that to make it beneﬁcial to our customers, ﬁrst and foremost on our mind. So anything we do would have to be consistent with that objective, or with that strategy. So that's the ﬁrst screen we go through is what would help us in that, whether it's cash ﬂow balance sheet, other growth opportunities, technological synergies et cetera.  Secondly, we would want it to be transactable, something that we know we can have a really good chance of getting done, both through counterparty engagement, price that makes sense to us on whatever side of the table we would sit on, and regulatory execution.  And three, it cannot distract us from doing number one. We don't want to have a couple of years of not doing the organic growth that we have today while we try to do something that's supposed to help us get that done.     So those three criteria continue and to be the way we look at it. As you know, we evaluate this kind of thing on a regular ongoing basis. If anything comes up, we'll obviously let you know. But we still look at it that way; nothing's changed in regard to that."
"Fair enough. Thank you. And secondly, just on EWC, I saw that you brought down your guidance for the EBITDA for EWC in 2018. Is that more commodity curves or is there something else that's driving it? And secondly, as more plants retire, do you expect the O&M per megawatt hour to go up, given there is now less synergy, given you have a smaller ﬂeet and is there any impact of that ﬂowing into the reduced EBITDA guidance for 2018?","Well, I'll take – I guess I'll try to answer and then Bill can cover with any color. So it is primarily energy-driven. Fossil. There is some capacity element that actually is pushing back against that a little bit. Our capacity price expectations are a little higher in 2017 and 2018 in New York, but it's primarily energy-price-driven. I don't think there is any big changes in O&M or fueling outage expenses; a little bit obviously some of that too, but not a whole lot when you're talking about 2018.  And then the second question was ...    Yeah. On the overhead, we've been looking at that very closely. So, we are implementing a plan to decrease the associated overhead consistent with the downsizing of EWC. I couldn't tell you at this point in time exactly where that stands in terms of what may – how that may be split because we run as a ﬂeet. But I can assure that we've been looking at that very closely and setting up a plan where we will reduce those costs over time commensurate with the downsizing of the ﬂeet in the Northeast."
"Got you. Thank you. And just to clarify, Drew, the underlying gas price that's driving 2018 EBITDA, have you put that out or do you know what that is?","I mean, I think, it's consistent with whatever the market is.    Yeah.    So I don't know, a little bit below $3.       A little bit below $3 is correct.    Yeah."
Got you. Thank you very much.,"Yeah. We use mark-to-market on those EBITDA curves problem, as of March 31.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch. Your question, please."
Hi. Good morning.,"Good morning, Brian."
Just a follow-up to your answer to Jon Arnold's question. I think you said that part of the beat for the quarter was based on some conservatism that was built into the numbers from the Entergy Arkansas recent decision. Could you just remind me or say one more time what was that amount and when did that beneﬁt begin in the ﬁrst quarter?,"Okay. So, the eﬀective date of the quarter was February 24. And bills – and I guess bills went into eﬀect on April 1. So we had modeled it so that we would start collecting revenues on April 1, but the accounting ultimately allowed us to accrue it during the ﬁrst quarter. So I think there was a little bit of timing switch there. That was maybe $0.05. And then... I'm sorry?"
"That was $0.05 from the order date till the end of the quarter, is that right?","Yes. Yes. And then the other big piece was the $0.06 of the regulatory asset that we got from Fukushima and ﬂood barrier pieces, and that's kind of a one-time deal. That's the bulk of it."
"Understood. And then going back to that $0.05 for Arkansas, should we assume a similar run-rate of conservatism if we pro rata that out that is embedded in the remaining quarters of 2016?","No, no. I think we were expecting to collect that over the remaining quarters. So I don't think there is going to be any extra sticky – extra opportunity there from the rate case on an annual basis."
"Got you. Got you. And then – I'm sorry, go ahead.","No, I was trying to see if that answered your question. Sounds like it did."
"Yeah. No, it did. And then I guess in your prepared remarks, you made reference to the Louisiana Commission's next meeting I guess on April 28th here, and the thought is to kind of narrow the scope of the dockets. Could you just give a little bit more color on what's your expectations of how they are going to narrow that scope there?","Brian, this is Theo. I think Leo pretty much summed it up in his opening comments. I think it was clear based on what came forward as it relates to the docket of the questions as to exactly what the Commission's intent was. And as he stated, we have a perspective as to what we believe that intend was then, and hopefully that's where we will see it go when they do hopefully bring it up again on the 28th."
Okay. Thank you very much.,"Thank you, Brian.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your question, please."
"Hi, good morning.","Good morning, Julien."
"So just wanted to follow a little bit up on some of the last questions here. As you transition your portfolio back towards a more regulated outlook, can you comment a bit on the opportunity eventually to buy yourself out of some of the existing contracts, for instance, Palisades, if that's been an opportunity you've explored or you had conversations around?","You do have the – the objective we have is, as is stated in our – in my remarks around strategy is to reduce the footprint of EWC and we've done that at RISE, Vermont Yankee and told them with FitzPatrick to follow the plans that aren't supported by the market or that are – no longer ﬁt the portfolio. As far as the operating plans, you just lump I think Indian Point and Palisades in together. Certainly, concurrently today, they are not in the same situation necessarily as the other plants as far as being cash ﬂow positive if they are not operating versus cash ﬂow positive if they are.  Remember, when we made these decisions around those facilities, we looked at three diﬀerent things. One, what's the NPV of the facilities, if negative or positive? Two, what's the near-term cash ﬂow burn rate, positive or negative? And three, how does it change the risk proﬁle of the company. I think we achieved our objectives with all of those, including the RISE sale around that. And we continue to evaluate the other plants in a similar manner, the diﬀerence being obviously the PPA supports the cost structure at Palisades and the market supports cost structure at Indian Point.  As far as any kind of opportunities that we would have around those facilities outside of the decisions we've already made, I can't really comment and wouldn't comment on that just because once we start down that path, our strategy or our policy is to just not comment on those sorts of things. But like I said, we are looking at those in the same way from an NPV, cash ﬂow, and risk standpoint what are our options with those facilities and we will pick the one that we believe creates the best value for our stakeholders. And again, is the NPV positive to run versus whatever alternative we come, that will be a major driver. If cash ﬂow positive or negative, particularly in the near-term for one of those alternatives to run – or to run the plant.  And third, is the – does it change the risk proﬁle? And obviously, our view is that making that footprint smaller does improve the risk proﬁle of the company. And then the last thing we always need to look at is the execution opportunity. Is it something similar to what I've discussed on the question around M&A. There's a lot of things we could do, but we have to make sure anything we do is executable, both with the counterparty, our own point of view and through the regulatory process."
"Great. Thank you. As a follow up to a prior question here, just wanted to be a little explicit. Are you guys expecting to participate and submit a self-build option into the renewable RFP outstanding in Louisiana?","We can't comment on that one way or the other, Julien, at this point."
"Okay. But perhaps generically, would you be open to participating in generation opportunities outside of gas?","Well, we are already – as I mentioned, we are building the 1 megawatt plant with battery storage here in New Orleans. We built the three facilities in Mississippi. We're not building the plant in Arkansas, but we are having it supported by our contract for the power out of that. So we already participate in that – in that arena and we would continue to look at those sorts of things going forward because we think that's a – again, as I said in my prepared remarks, that's a way for us to continue to add resiliency, a way for us to continue to add good service to our customers, high reliability, more beneﬁcial environmental footprint, as well as we get the cost right because we do value the fact that our pricing is lower than the majority of the rest of the companies the United States and we want to stay there."
Great. Thank you.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Paz from Wolfe Research. Your question, please."
"Hey, good morning.","Good morning.    Hey, David."
Just a couple of quick ones. Why did your 2017 EWC EBITDA outlook remain unchanged from $510 million? What were the drivers for that?,"The big driver is, we've seen an uplift in LHV pricing, so approximately a couple dollars of KW month, so that's probably about a $48 million on the positive side. So that's oﬀset some of the commodity – energy price decrease we've seen."
Okay.,That's really the main driver.
"That's a big one. Okay. And then just on AMI and grid month, are those plans already in your – were those already in your rate based outlook that you give us at EEI?","Some of the costs associated with the metering is in there, yes."
"But the bulk if it is outside that, outside your 2016, 2018 plan?",Correct.
"Okay. Great. And then just on the nuclear spending, how should we – how can we think about what ongoing nuke spend will be going forward at the Utility segment, at EWC or just both? How should we think about that?","It's Drew, and I'll just say that's going to be a big topic at the Analyst Day here in a few weeks, and we'll try to give you some framework around that. But we're still getting our hand around our performance improvement plan. And of course, as you know, Chris has just been here for a couple of weeks, so he is getting his hands around it as well. But I think important thing for us is that at the same time we are doing that we're also looking for opportunities to mitigate that in the business.     And some of them you've already seen show up, things like insurance rebates or lower interest cost because the interest rate environment, we have some O&M opportunities that we've found that we've – in the ﬁrst quarter, like the fossil outage management and stuﬀ like that. So there are opportunities that we have identiﬁed to begin to oﬀset that. Obviously, we're not done looking for those. But at this point, we think we can manage those costs within the framework of the expectations that we have for guidance and outlooks right now."
"Okay. All right. And are your full year 2016 impacts for ANO and Pilgrim still the same? So in other words, I think $50 million for ANO and $30 million for Pilgrim?","They are currently the same. We just got the report – the initial report out I guess on ANO, and we're looking, as we have mentioned, for the letter from the NRC. Once we get that, we'll have a better idea if there's any incremental risks associated with ANO. And Pilgrim's inspection, we expect to be some time second half this year, and we'll have better information then. So as of now, those costs are staying pat."
Great. Thank you.,"Thank you.    Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your question, please."
"Hey, guys. Questions answered. Thanks so much.    Operator  Thank you. And our ﬁnal question for today due to time comes from the line of Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates. Your question, please.",
Hi. How are you doing?,"Good morning, Paul.       Good morning, Paul."
"Just everything has pretty much been asked and answered. I'm sorry if I missed this, but you mentioned the generic stuﬀ in Louisiana and what you think might be unfolding there. Do you have any picture at this point on what might be happening in Texas? Was sort of a similar issue. Or is it just too early?",The Encore and the REIT assessments?
"Right. And I guess it's doing a little bit more generically as well, right?","Paul, I mean at this point, we may have to get back with you and follow up. I mean, I'm not sure it's moved forward enough for us to get I think a perspective as to how it may impact us. I mean, we don't see that having a major impact on us at this point. But again, we will follow up with you if in fact that is diﬀerent. But again, it's fairly generic and until we get more speciﬁcity relative to that, we don't necessarily see it having an impact on us."
"Okay. Great. And then just, in terms of FitzPatrick, there's constant discussions about New York coming up with some sort of plan to rescue the nukes and what have you. And I know that you guys have basically been indicating, at least from what I've read, that it's really too far along. But again, you keep on hearing that the Governor is hopeful that he's going to be able to keep it open. Is there sort of a point of no return at all in terms of, have we crossed it already with respect FitzPatrick, or how should we think about that when we keep on hearing that he wants to do something for the nuclear plants?","So the ﬁrst thing I'd say, Paul, is that obviously from an economic standpoint, closure of FitzPatrick is the right thing to do; and we would have loved for there to be a way around that, if economics could have been diﬀerent. For example, we've been promoting a clean energy standard in New York that would include nuclear plants for several years. And the reason obviously that we'd do that is, one, it's the right thing to do from a public policy standpoint, it's certainly the right thing to do from an environmental standpoint, from an energy price standpoint to support the market's reliability, the whole nine yards.     And we've been promoting it for a number of years, because obviously these things must take their course in the regulatory arena, and then in the legislative, regulatory, or the courts, and obviously you can always expect there to be intervention, if anything that comes up and these things just take a long time to develop. And so right now there is no – nothing in place.  We don't know if there was something in place what it would be. We don't know – if we knew how it was structured, what it would provide. We don't know if what it provided would be enough to support the economics of a plant. And we don't know that the timing of it could ever be done before we had to make the decision to go ahead and refuel, which then we're committing to several hundred million dollars of losses. So we're out of time.  It's not that we're against any of those proposals on their face, other than I would say that obviously we believe there's a clean energy standard in New York that includes nuclear it should include all of the nuclear plants. And we commend them for their eﬀorts, because we think that's the right thing to do or we wouldn't have been proposing it for the last couple of years. But I mean, you hit the nail on the head on this point-of-no-return aspect. It's not in place, we don't know what it is, we don't know what it would provide, we don't know what the economics would be for it to run its course.  Again, we get to the point where unfortunately we're likely out of time. So anything that says, we are opposed to a clean energy standard and the like, we're not; we've been for those along. Again, we do think they should incorporate all plants in the state. We would be for it all plants in the country actually to be consistent, but right now there is nothing in place that we could look at that would provide us the opportunity to change our decision."
