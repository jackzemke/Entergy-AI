Question,Answer
"First, going back to the rate case strategy, you have talked a lot about load growth here. You've also alluded to O&M inﬂation. Could you perhaps talk Arkansas, Mississippi, rate case ﬁling expectations over the next couple of years, and the ability to hit the 5% to 7%. What are you thinking right now in terms of going back in, re- hearings, et cetera? If you could delineate that?","Theo?    I will start. Hi, Julien, this is Theo. I'll start with Arkansas. Obviously we've made ﬁling for our petition for rehearing, and we will see how that goes. That will obviously inform us in terms of what we do going forward. In Mississippi we are still evaluating whether we need to ﬁle a rate case, but we do know the 2013 non-taxed UFRP ﬁling is suspended. And if we do ﬁle the case, it will be to prepare Entergy Mississippi for a post-system agreement timing and also to move some of our power management riders that we recover certain costs around capacity, costs around plants today into base rates. We also had a depreciation rate ﬁling that we did or studied. I believe that was done in 2011, that could be Incorporated in a rate case in Mississippi. But I think, also it will allow us the opportunity to explore some alternatives to unknown and measurable changes that could occur during the rate eﬀective period as Leo talked about in his opening comments. As you go forward, obviously, whether we ﬁle additional rate cases, we will be impacted by a couple of things you mentioned: where we see ourselves in terms of sales growth, the various regulatory mechanisms we have in play within some of these jurisdictions that might allow us to change dollars we are recovering without necessarily ﬁling a base rate case. For instance, in Texas where we have rider opportunities. We have rider opportunities in other jurisdictions, as well. Louisiana, and the case I just mentioned, Mississippi. In certain cases you can get recovery through riders, primarily around capacity without ﬁling base rate cases. So, as to where we go past the cases I just discussed, that will have a lot to do with the cost structure, with sales growth, with the investment opportunities that we have overall. And the mechanisms that are in play that will allow us to recover that without necessarily having to make a base rate case ﬁling."
"Great. I suppose, following up on the ITC deal a little bit here, thinking about ability to reinvest in the system, speciﬁcally on transmission. I'd be curious, is there an ability to ramp up spending there? Or is this more about a wait-and-see in terms of what MISO opportunities might be forthcoming? Could you perhaps give us a little bit more context for what that opportunity might be if it exists?","Julien, whatever our transmission is today, we do have, as we said, over the next three years $1.7 billion in our plan for transmission expenditures. As I mentioned in my comments, there are several things out there that could increase that if there are projects that are beneﬁcial to customers that reduce congestion, that improve the liability, that provide access to generation within the MISO footprint, et cetera, where     they hit on NEP, NBP projects that would be out there, part of the Order 1000. So, there are things out there in the system as it stands. The other aspect is, as we start to get more line of sight on this economic development front, certainly if 2,400 megawatts show up or more, that is just what has been announced to date. And there is nothing in the commodity strips that would lead you to believe that that renaissance is over, that that is going to provide a situation where there might be more transmission investment, as well. If you start adding like the Sasol example that Drew gave, that's 200 megawatts in one facility. Those sorts of things are going to have an impact. So, there is the opportunity for that transmission investment to be larger if there are things that we can do that beneﬁt customers or to hook up new customers. It would appear that the market is ripe to have some of that happen, but it's a little early to tell right now."
"Great, thank you.    Operator  Kit Konolige, BGC.",
"A couple of somewhat unrelated questions. On the impacts that have been -- increased the expectations for 2014 EPS to the top end of the range, I think you mentioned pension was $0.09 positive. And then it appeared that a signiﬁcant driver was higher expected prices at the nuclear ﬂeet, the EWC nuclear ﬂeet. Did you quantify that or did I miss that?","Well, I think, Kit, if you look at the slide that shows the EBITDA for EWC, you can see where most of that is. Particularly if you compare to the last update we gave last quarter with the same slide. And so, it's up considerably. Eyeballing it, $150 million to $175 million."
$150 million to $175 million. And this is due to higher prices as a result of higher gas prices and cold weather and generally the 2014 commodity prices being very robust recently?,"Yes, and part of it is what we have seen very recently. There is still a good bit of it that is still to come. This is a mark of current expectations using forward prices as of December 31. And so this includes -- at that point it included the entire year of forward prices. Obviously we experienced some of that in January. Some of that has been realized early this month. But then we have the full-year still ahead of us."
"Right. And then to switch to your discussion of strategic outlook for the nuclear plants at EWC. It sounds as though there's a little bit of a change in tone, whereas previously, for example at EEI, you had said if you own ETR you should expect to own Indian Point. Now it sounds like if you own ETR you should expect to own all the currently-held nuclear plants, with the exception of Vermont Yankee, obviously. What has been the change there? Was that the capacity pricing in New England that really made the diﬀerence) Or am I seeing a change where there really hasn't been one?","No, I think you are seeing a change, Kit. It didn't have anything to do with the near- term pricing. It's really a function of we have been telling you for a while that we are exploring opportunities. And in the exploration of those opportunities, we did not ﬁnd anything that we liked. And we like owning them better. So that is where we are at this point. And we still own Vermont Yankee also. We will continue to open it, and own it even when it's being decommissioned. So there is a change. We still believe that the separation of the risks would make sense. But we also believe in creating value. If we can't do it without the right amount of value then we are going to continue to hold those plants. As you say, our strategy is to preserve optionality in those plants. And we do that through operating and through our hedging strategy, and through the licensing process and obviously to manage the risk as best we can. So, you did pick up on a change."
"Very good, thank you very much.    Operator  Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley.",
"I wanted to follow-up on Julien's question on transmission. Leo, you talked about a couple of categories of potential spend over time. Could you talk a little bit to the process at MISO, and what we should be looking for and thinking about in terms of, for example, as customers start to show up, as MISO continues its planning, how we should expect to start to see some of these plans come forward in terms of further spending on transmission?","Well, the majority of it is what is in our base plan. Then the next layers of it will be what comes about through just normal business. It is just such that our normal business includes some signiﬁcant potential load, as it were. If there are industrial customers as opposed to residential customers, and the industrial customers have side. A lot of that, while it is in MISO and there is a planning process and it becomes part of the plan, it is not in the realm of outcome. I don't think it is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than what we have in general and have traditionally had. We just might have an opportunity bigger than the $1.7 billion. Then as it relates to the process, once we start to move in over the next few years with the multi-value projects, M&P     projects, more for Quarter 1000 things, then we'll have to compete in that arena. And we would expect to do so, and to be successful."
"Okay. Great. And wanted to shift gears over to Indian Point. You had, on slide 28, given an update on the status. I wondered on the coastal zone management paths, if you could speak to next steps we should be looking for? You gave an update on all three elements of the coastal zone process. But wondered if you could give us a sense for what next steps on those diﬀerent paths?","Sure, yes, Stephen, a couple of things, here. First is the consistency ﬁling itself has been extended to the end of 2014. That's simply due to the need for the parties to work together, share more information, further vet issues. That was previously set for March, was moved back to the end of the year. As it relates to our other option on grandfathering, I think you are well aware of the fact we lost the initial decision on that. We are in the process of appealing that decision through the state courts. And we may have further appeals depending on the outcome of that case. That will probably take us through the end of 2014 as well. Then of course, we have the previous review argument, which is held in the background as another option that the NRC has not yet ruled on, and is also being considered by the State of New York. So, we think through all these various processes, that this will go on for a period of time. Eventually we plan to be successful with it, but obviously a lot of uncertainty now with the various cases that are ongoing."
"Great, thank you very much.    Operator  Steven Fleishman, Wolfe Research.",
"A couple questions. On the EWC outlook, it looked like 2015, 2016 was a little lower, if my ruler was correct, than at EEI. Is that just updating this New York capacity assumption?","That is certainly in there, Steven. Yes, I don't know that we are as precise with rulers, but yes, that's baked in there. That is part of it."
"Okay. It is about ﬂattish overall, so it's not that diﬀerent. Okay.","Yes, that is the way I would describe it. We haven't seen the energy markets really move upward in any material fashion since then. A little bit in 2015, but the capacity prices is clearly, we said that's oﬀsetting."
"Okay, because the 2015, 2016 switch a little bit. 2016 looks like it's stepping down a little bit. I assume that is the capacity and then the energy hasn't moved. Okay. And on your utility sales growth and all this new industrial load and potential. I know you've probably answered this, but how can we track what is in your forecast and what is not? And if you do better in terms of getting more load and customers, is that something that deﬁnitely beneﬁts the bottom line? Or is there a lag issue in terms of spending money to serve it? How should we think about when you update this? What is in there, what is not? And is doing better deﬁnitely an upside?","Yes, Steve, this is Theo. I think when you think about what is in it, what is not, primarily, I think we did talk about this at EEI, if I recall. What's in and in the forecast is basically the things that we felt had a clear line of sight on, felt good about at that time. Which primarily are things we have had signed agreements or arrangements in place. Or it's very clear we were going to have such an arrangement. So that is what you have the forecast. As we move forward, you see on Drew's slide, I believe it is on page 12, contracts signed, a lot of that will show up in that particular category. Basically, I believe maybe about a third of that maybe shows up through 2016. So there is still amounts post years 2016, so that I think that is how you think about it. In terms of how it aﬀects the bottom line, obviously as the sales take place, depending on where you are within the process of your various regulatory mechanisms in those jurisdictions, will inform as to the impacts those will have. If there is investment associated with it, as Leo has talked about, the transmission opportunity, obviously that investment would be Incorporated. You would have the sales, you would have the cost. As rates get reset, obviously the sales become a part of your revenue requirements, the costs become a part of your investment. And the investment obviously and the returns on it ﬂow to the bottom line, the sales become a part of that process of resetting rates.  Steve, this is Leo. Just to add to that, if you think about it, for the near term in particular it would primarily be transmission investment to the extent these are large loads. You would anticipate that the sales level would be signiﬁcant enough to make it positive to the bottom line, even though there could be some lag in the recovery of the transmission investment. In the areas we have got FRPs, you're going to have some catch up in the next year. And then in the case of Texas, for example, you have the got the transmission rider, which could help in some respects. But we try to put the regulatory mechanisms in place to mitigate any lag, but at the same point in time, the size of these could make a big diﬀerence in how this turns out, as well."
"Okay, just one other clariﬁcation. If you announce another new customer contract, let's say tomorrow, that could be already in your backlog, it is not necessarily incremental. Not all of these have already been announced.","That is correct, yes. That would move something from the potential pipeline maybe into the contract signed line."
"Okay. Great, thank you.    Operator  Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates.",
"The expectations for the new capacity zone in New York, I was wondering if you could give us more ﬂavor as to what they might be, and the impact of Danskammer, if it is there or not there. Do you guys have any sensitivity about that? Any sense you could tell us about that?","Sure, this is Bill. I think Drew mentioned in his script, that as it relates to Lower Hudson Valley zone, we saw a decrease there from the plan that we had announced last fall. Probably a little over $1 a KW month for LHV. We've seen our point of view for the rest of the state perhaps increased a little bit. So if you think about it in doing your analytics, you might want to think about it right as right now we are at, probably, at $2 a KW month uplift for all of our New York ISO capacity, whereas previously we had indicated a $3 a KW month uplift for the LHV zone itself. Right now, that estimate does not assume that Danskammer is in service for this summer. My understanding of that right now is that that is an issue which will be evaluated in March of this year. And we will know better then as to whether or not that plant will be able to operate and qualify as capacity for that zone."
"Okay, and any sense as to what that would be if it does show up?",I do not have that at this point in time.
"Okay. Great. And ﬁnally with the mark-to-market loss reversal, I thought the explanation was really great. I wasn't clear on the quantitative impact that that had, in terms of the impact for 2014 versus 2013 as a result of it.","Okay, so the mark-to-market loss in 2013 was around $45 million pretax. And then we would see that uplift in 2014. So, it is in that EBITDA number that you are seeing in that chart on the EWC."
"Okay, and so that is not going to probably be there in 2015? So that is probably part of the reason why it goes down as well, right?","That is correct. Actually some of it is at DUI as well, that's for some of the hedges there. So that is one of the reasons why VY looks much larger than expected.    Operator  Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs."
"A couple of questions, little bit unrelated to each other here. And thank you for, obviously, taking my questions on the call. First, residential demand. As I understand it, you get a lot more of your utility margin from the residential and small commercial customers than you do on the industrial side. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in residential demand? It has lagged industrial signiﬁcantly. The major start-ups you are seeing in your service territory would imply a growth in job levels and improvement in unemployment rates. But it doesn't seem to be reﬂected in residential load levels.","Bill?    Sure, Michael. I think what you are seeing, I would believe would be consistent with what you're seeing with other companies across the country. You're starting to see the eﬀects of energy eﬃciency. I think as we started the year of 2013, on a ﬁrst call we talked about our views of the impacts of that. And we would expect to see residential sales growth tempered. As you can see from our results for the year, are actually are slightly down a little bit. That is not inconsistent with our expectations. I will say the degree of which it is down is probably maybe a little more than we had expected, but not much. As it relates to the economic change, I think what you see obviously is a net eﬀect. We do see, still see positive customer growth, if you look at our customer account numbers. What you are starting to see, again, I think is a phenomenon that you see across the industry, which is usage per customer is going down. So, while I think you are seeing some positive economic eﬀects through actual increase in customer accounts, energy eﬃciency, obviously, is having an impact on what you would see incrementally, relative to those increased customer accounts."
"Can you talk a little bit about the utility margin? Meaning how much as a percent of total comes from the three big customer classes? Trying to get my arms around demand levels, customer growth and megawatt levels on industrial customer side, versus what is happening, actually happening, to the Entergy utilities' margins.","Yes, in ballpark numbers, I think what you see residential, maybe is maybe margin around $0.04 or so. Commercial is $0.03 and maybe industrial maybe somewhere around $0.02, generally speaking."
"Got it, okay. Drew, a question for you real quick, on cash versus GAAP taxes, what do you expect to be in that cash taxpayer over the next few years? What is embedded in 2014 guidance?","We haven't -- from a guidance perspective on earnings, we've put in, I think it was about 36%, for an eﬀective tax rate. Given our NOL position, we would expect our cash tax rate to be lower than that, but we haven't put any guidance out for that speciﬁcally."
Materially lower? Like do you expect to be a cash taxpayer? Or are you likely in non- cash taxpaying status for a few years?,"I wouldn't say we are in non-cash taxpaying status because we actually make deposits and those types of things, as we go forward. So we will be paying some taxes, but it will be materially lower, I would expect, to the eﬀective tax rate. At least for 2014."
"Got it, and how big is the NOL at the end of the year?","That will be out on the K. Right now I think it was at, as of last year, it was still around a little over a $12 (million). Most of that was tied up in the de-commissioning election as cost of goods sold. About 75% of it was there."
"Got it. Okay, thanks guys. Much appreciate it.       Operator  Brian Chin, Merrill Lynch.",
Could you remind us again where the dividend policy is at with the clean slate here?,"As Drew mentioned, right now plan we have supports the dividend policy. The Board will continue to look at where we stand at the dividend, as we have always been. The dividend comes from the utility, and anything that comes out of the merchant business is distributed diﬀerently. So that strategy or that outlook hasn't changed. As we look at the dividend, we would be looking at that as the utility grows, as we look at the overall risk proﬁle of the Company, we look at the reinvestment needs that we may have based on how quickly the utility grows and what happens with the need for capital there. If it were to be above, for example, the three-year plan that we have now, if the load growth shows up the way we would like it to, which would be higher than the 2% to 2.25% range, then certainly that may increase the need for capital within the utility and will impact not only earnings growth, but would give us the opportunity to pay a higher dividend, but also the re-investments we need in the near-term to make it. All of that is going to go into the mix, pretty much like it always has. But the bottom line of the -- the utility pays the dividend and the merchant business cash ﬂow is distributed diﬀerently, is still the order of the day."
