             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

Unless the context otherwise indicates,  all references to "PSEG," "we," "us" or
"our"  herein  means  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated  and  its
consolidated  subsidiaries.  PSEG is an exempt public  utility  holding  company
which  has four  principal  direct  wholly-owned  subsidiaries:  Public  Service
Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G),  PSEG Power LLC (Power),  PSEG Energy Holdings
Inc. (Energy Holdings) and PSEG Services Corporation (Services).

Basis of Presentation

The financial  statements  included  herein have been  prepared  pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion  of  management,  the  disclosures  herein  are  adequate  to  make  the
information  presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements
and  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  (Notes)  should  be read in
conjunction  with the Notes contained in our 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and
our Amended  Quarterly  Report on Form  10-Q/A for the  quarter  ended March 31,
2002.  These Notes update and  supplement  matters  discussed in our 2001 Annual
Report on Form 10-K and our  Amended  Quarterly  Report on Form  10-Q/A  for the
quarter ended March 31, 2002.

The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all adjustments which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the results for the
interim  periods  presented.  All such  adjustments  are of a  normal  recurring
nature. The year-end  consolidated  balance sheets were derived from the audited
consolidated  financial  statements  included in our 2001 Annual  Report on Form
10-K. Certain  reclassifications  of prior period data have been made to conform
with the current presentation.

Note 2. Accounting Matters

     Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142)

SFAS 142 became effective  January 1, 2002. Under this standard we were required
to  complete  an  impairment  analysis  of  goodwill  during 2002 and record any
required impairment  retroactive to the first quarter.  Under SFAS 142, goodwill
is  considered  a  nonamortizable  asset and is subject to an annual  review for
impairment and an interim review when certain events or changes in circumstances
occur.  The effect of no longer  amortizing  goodwill on an annual basis was not
material to our financial  position and results of operations upon adoption.  We
have completed this impairment  analysis and have recorded  after-tax charges of
$120  million,  retroactive  to the first  quarter as  required  under SFAS 142,
related to the impairment of goodwill at PSEG Global Inc.'s (Global) investments
in  Argentina,   Brazil  and  India  as  well  as  investments  of  PSEG  Energy
Technologies Inc. (Energy Technologies).
<PAGE>
See  Goodwill  Impairment  Analysis  in Note 3. Asset  Impairments  for  further
details.  In future  periods,  any  goodwill  impairments  will be recorded as a
component of income from continuing operations.

SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS
144)

On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS 144. On adoption,  the impact of SFAS 144 did
not have an effect on our  financial  position or results of  operations.  Under
SFAS 144,  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of are  measured  at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell,  whether reported in continued
operations  or in  discontinued  operations.  Also under SFAS 144,  discontinued
operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts
for operating  losses that have not yet occurred.  Under SFAS 144,  discontinued
operations  will be measured at fair value,  less costs to sell.  Also, as under
SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed  of" (SFAS  121),  a  long-lived  asset must be tested for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that its
carrying  amount may be impaired.  For additional  information see Note 3. Asset
Impairments and Note 4. Discontinued Operations.

Emerging  Issues Task Force  (EITF) Issue No. 02-3,  "Accounting  for  Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities"

In June 2002,  the EITF  addressed  certain  issues  related  to energy  trading
activities, including (a) gross versus net presentation in the income statement,
(b) whether the initial  fair value of an energy  trading  contract can be other
than  the  price  at  which  it was  exchanged  and  (c)  additional  disclosure
requirements for energy trading activities.  The EITF reached a consensus on the
first  issue and  determined  that  mark-to-market  gains  and  losses on energy
trading  contracts should be shown net in the income  statement.  This change is
applicable to financial  statements  for periods  ending after July 15, 2002 and
requires that prior periods be restated for comparability. The EITF also reached
a consensus on the third issue regarding disclosures which will be effective for
the first  year-end  after July 15, 2002.  The EITF did not reach a consensus on
the second issue and will address it through a working group.

Pursuant to EITF Issue No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent" (EITF 99-19),  we have been recording our trading  revenues and
trading  related costs on a gross basis for physical  energy and capacity  sales
and purchases.  In accordance with EITF 02-3,  beginning in the third quarter of
2002, we will report energy  trading  revenues and energy trading costs on a net
basis and will reclassify  prior periods to conform with this net  presentation.
The effect of this standard will be to reduce both trading  revenues and trading
costs by approximately  $715 million and $1,058 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001, respectively,  and approximately $2,256 million
and $2,647  million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000,
respectively.  This  change in  presentation  will  have no  effect  on  trading
margins, net income or any component of cash flows.

SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS 143)

In July 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 143.
Under SFAS 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
is  required  to be  recorded  in the  period  in  which it is  created  with an
offsetting  amount to an asset.  Upon  settlement  of the  liability,  an entity
either settles the  obligation for its recorded  amount or incurs a gain or loss
upon settlement. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. This standard will have an impact on our nuclear decommissioning liability
and other items. We are still  evaluating the potential  impact of adopting SFAS
143,  which  may  be  material  to  our  financial  position  and  statement  of
operations.

Note 3. Asset Impairments

     As of December 31, 2001, Energy Holdings' aggregate  investment exposure in
Argentina  was  $632  million,  including  certain  loss  contingencies.   These
investments included a 90% owned distribution company,  Empresa Distribuidora de
Electricidad  de Entre Rios S.A.  (EDEERSA);  and  minority  interests  in three
distribution  companies,  Empresa  Distribuidora  de Energia Norte S.A.  (EDEN),
Empresa  Distribuidora  de Energia Sur S.A. (EDES) and Empresa  Distribuidora La
Plata S.A.  (EDELAP) and two generating  companies,  Central Termica San Nicolas
(CTSN) and Parana which are under contract for sale to certain  subsidiaries  of
The AES Corporation (AES). The combination of the year-to-date operating losses,
goodwill  impairment  at EDEERSA,  write-down  of $506 million for all Argentine
assets, and certain loss contingencies  resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings
of $632 million ($410 million after-tax) for the six months ended June 30, 2002.
In connection with or write-down of our Argentine assets, we recorded a deferred
tax asset of approximately $220 million. We believe that we will have sufficient
future  capital  gains to realize this  deferred tax asset.  For a discussion of
certain  contingencies  related  to  our  Argentine  investments,  see  Note  6.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     The tables below provide our share of pre-tax and after-tax  impacts of the
various impairment charges,  results of operations and accruals of contingencies
recorded  with respect to our  investments  in Argentina for the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2002 and June 30, 2001.

EDEERSA

     Given the  year-to-date  and projected  operating losses at EDEERSA and the
continued economic uncertainty in Argentina, we determined that it was necessary
to test these assets for impairment. As a result of this analysis, we determined
that these  assets are  completely  impaired  under SFAS 144. We recorded  total
charges and losses of $213 million,  pre-tax, related to this investment for the
six months  ended June 30, 2002.  These  pre-tax  charges  consisted of goodwill
impairment charges of $56 million, six month operating losses of $59 million, of
which $45  million  was  recorded  in the first  quarter,  and  writing  off the
remaining  $94 million  net asset  balance  pursuant to our SFAS 144  impairment
analysis and loss  contingencies  and other items of  approximately $4 million.
The total  after-tax  charges and losses  related to this  investment  were $139
million, for the six months ended June 30, 2002.

In  addition,  we have  developed  an exit  strategy  to  dispose  of our equity
interest in EDEERSA.  This exit is expected to be complete by June 30, 2003, and
we intend to operate EDEERSA while carrying out our exit plans.  However, due to
uncertainties  related to the timing and method of disposal of our investment in
EDEERSA,  the impairment charges and results of EDEERSA's operations will not be
reported as a  discontinued  operation  until  EDEERSA has been disposed of or a
sale is  probable.  During the second  quarter,  EDEERSA  defaulted on its debt,
which is nonrecourse to Global, Energy Holdings and us.

As of  January 1,  2002,  goodwill  related  to our  investment  in EDEERSA  was
approximately  $56  million  and  was  included  in  our  previously   disclosed
investment  exposure.  As part of the  adoption of SFAS 142, we have  determined
that this goodwill was impaired and all of the goodwill has been written-down as
a cumulative  effect of a change in  accounting  principle as of January 1, 2002
and is reflected in our Consolidated  Statement of Operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2002.  See below,  Goodwill  Impairment  Analysis,  for a further
discussion of our goodwill analysis.

Stock Purchase Agreement

On August 24, 2001,  Global entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement with AES to
sell its minority interests in EDEN, EDES,  EDELAP,  CTSN and Parana, to certain
subsidiaries  of AES.  On  February  6, 2002,  AES  notified  Global that it was
terminating  the Stock Purchase  Agreement.  In the Notice of  Termination,  AES
alleged that a Political  Risk Event,  within the meaning of the Stock  Purchase
Agreement,  had  occurred,  by virtue of certain  decrees of the  Government  of
Argentina,  thereby  giving  AES the  right  to  terminate  the  Stock  Purchase
Agreement.  Global disagreed that a Political Risk Event as defined in the Stock
Purchase  Agreement,  which is limited to expropriation of assets,  had occurred
and has so  notified  AES.  Global's  position  is that the risk of a change  to
currency  policy and the related  events in Argentina were  acknowledged  by the
parties  and  reflected  in  the  purchase  price.  Global  maintains  that  the
"Political  Risk Event"  contemplated  as a basis for  termination  was narrowly
defined and limited to  expropriation.  There has been no expropriation to date.
In April 2002,  Global filed a lawsuit in New York State  Supreme  Court for New
York  County  against  AES to  enforce  its  rights  under  the  Stock  Purchase
Agreement, which it is pursuing.

A motion is pending  before the court  seeking an  expedited  trial of  Global's
claim for specific  performance.  We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this
matter.

     Since AES is disputing its  obligation  to close and we cannot  predict the
outcome of the  litigation,  we determined it was necessary to test these assets
for  impairment.  As a result of this  analysis,  it was  determined  that these
assets are fully  impaired  and we recorded a  write-down  in the amount of $412
million (pre-tax) and $268 million  (after-tax)and  loss contingencies and other
items of approximately $7 million  (pre-tax) and $3 million  (after-tax) for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2002.  In  connection  with the terms of the
Stock Purchase  Agreement,  Global has accrued interest and other receivables of
$17 million through  February 6, 2002,  which are direct  obligations of AES and
represent the total remaining exposure  associated with these investments on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Goodwill Impairment Analysis

We have  finalized  our  evaluation  of the effect of  adopting  SFAS 142 on the
recorded  amount of goodwill.  The total amount of goodwill  impairments is $120
million,  net of tax of $66 million, and is comprised of $36 million (after-tax)
at EDEERSA,  $34 million  (after-tax) at Rio Grande  Energia (RGE),  $32 million
(after-tax) at Energy  Technologies  and $18 million  (after-tax) at Tanir Bavi.
All of the goodwill on these  companies,  other than RGE, is fully impaired.  As
noted above,  this has been recorded as of January 1, 2002 as a component of the
cumulative  effect of a change  in  accounting  principle  and is  reflected  in
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The
$53 million of goodwill at Energy  Technologies  and the $27 million of goodwill
at  Tanir  Bavi as of  December  31,  2001 has been  reclassified  into  Current
Assets-Discontinued  Operations on our Consolidated  Balance Sheets. For further
detail regarding the goodwill impairments at Energy Technologies and Tanir Bavi,

Energy Technologies' Investments

Energy Technologies is comprised of 11 heating, ventilating and air conditioning
(HVAC) operating  companies and an asset management group which includes various
Demand Side Management (DSM) investments. DSM investments in long-term contracts
represent expenditures made by Energy Technologies to share DSM customers' costs
associated with the installation of energy efficient equipment. DSM revenues are
earned  principally  from  monthly  payments  received  from  utilities,   which
represent  shared  electricity  savings  from  the  installation  of the  energy
efficient equipment.

During the second  quarter of 2002, we completed our  impairment  testing of all
recorded  goodwill in  accordance  with guidance set forth in SFAS 142 including
the goodwill  associated with the 11 HVAC operating companies acquired by Energy
Technologies.  Such analysis  indicated  that the entire $53 million of goodwill
associated with the HVAC companies was impaired, which resulted in a $32 million
(after-tax)  charge. In accordance with SFAS 142, this charge was recorded as of
January  1, 2002 as a  cumulative  effect of a change in  accounting  principle,
reflected in our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2002.

In June 2002,  we  adopted a plan to sell our  interests  in the HVAC  operating
companies.  The sale of the HVAC operating companies is expected to be completed
by December 31,  2002.  We have  retained the services of an  investment-banking
firm which is marketing the HVAC operating  companies to interested  parties and
has completed an analysis of the fair market value of the  operating  companies.
The fair value was lower than our carrying value of these  companies,  resulting
in an impairment  loss  recognized for the quarter and six months ended June 30,
2002 (as noted below). Additionally, we have initiated a process for the sale of
Energy Technologies' asset management group, which we expect to sell by June 30,
2003. Based on our assessments, we believe the fair market value of these assets
approximates  their  carrying  value as of June  30,  2002.  The HVAC  operating
companies and the asset management group meet the criteria for classification as
components  of   discontinued   operations  and  all  prior  periods  have  been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

In addition to the goodwill  impairment,  we have  further  reduced the carrying
value of the investments in the 11 HVAC operating  companies to their fair value
less costs to sell,  and  incurred a loss on  disposal  for the  quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2002 of $20 million (after-tax).  Our remaining investment
position  in  Energy  Technologies  is  approximately  $135  million,  of  which
approximately $35 million relates to deferred tax assets, for which no valuation
allowance is deemed necessary.  Excluding the deferred tax assets, approximately
70% of our remaining  investment  balance relates to the asset  management group
and 30% relates to the HVAC companies.  Although we believe that we will be able
to sell the HVAC and asset management businesses, we can give no assurances that
we will be able to realize their total  carrying  values.

Operating  results of Energy  Technologies,  less certain  allocated  costs from
Energy Holdings,  have been  reclassified  into  discontinued  operations in our
Consolidated   Statements  of  Operations.   The  operating   results  of  these
discontinued  operations  for the  quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2002,
yielded additional losses of $5 million (after-tax) and $8 million  (after-tax),
respectively, and are disclosed below:

Tanir Bavi

Global  owns a 74%  interest in Tanir Bavi Power  Company  Private  Ltd.  (Tanir
Bavi), which owns and operates a 220 MW barge mounted, combined-cycle generating
facility in India. The plant commenced  combined-cycle  commercial  operation in
2001.  Power from the plant is being sold under a  seven-year  fixed price Power
Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Karnataka Power  Transmission  Company Limited
(KPTCL),  a state  affiliated  entity,  formerly known as Karnataka  Electricity
Board.

During the second  quarter of 2002, we completed our  impairment  testing of all
recorded  goodwill in accordance with guidelines set forth in SFAS 142 including
the goodwill  associated with Global's  acquisition of Tanir Bavi. Such analysis
indicated  that the entire $27 million of goodwill  recorded in connection  with
our  investment  in Tanir  Bavi was  impaired  and  resulted  in an $18  million
(after-tax)  charge. In accordance with SFAS 142, this charge was recorded as of
January  1,  2002  as a  component  of the  cumulative  effect  of a  change  in
accounting principle,  reflected in our results of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2002. For additional  information see Note 2. Accounting  Matters
and Note 3. Asset Impairments.

Tanir  Bavi has been in  dispute  with  KPTCL  regarding  the  terms of  payment
specified  in the PPA  relating  to the fixed  portion of the  tariff,  which is
approximately  US  $0.04  per  kilowatt-hour.  The  amount  of  the  dispute  is
approximately half of this fixed amount. During the first quarter of 2002, KPTCL
referred the dispute to the  government of Karnataka,  which  directed  KPTCL to
accept Tanir Bavi's  position.  Prior to KPTCL's  acceptance of such  direction,
however,  the  Karnataka  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (KERC)  exercised
jurisdiction  over the matter  and  requested  that  KPTCL not  comply  with the
requests of the  government of Karnataka  until KERC had reviewed the matter.  A
hearing was held in May 2002, at which KERC determined that the disputed amounts
could not be paid until the parties complied with the dispute resolution process
called for in the PPA. The dispute  resolution  process and certain  other legal
remedies could take an extended  period of time before a result is known.  While
pursuing legal recourse,  it is likely we would need to make  additional  equity
contributions in the plants to maintain liquidity.  We believe the delays in the
process have greatly  diminished our  expectations of a satisfactory  resolution
and in June 2002, we adopted a plan to exit Tanir Bavi.

Global  and its  partner  in this  venture,  GMR Vasavi  Group,  a local  Indian
company, are in negotiations for the sale of Global's majority interest in Tanir
Bavi to the GMR Vasavi Group. The final  negotiations and completion of sale are
expected  to  occur  in the  third  quarter  of 2002.  Should  this  sale not be
consummated,  we will seek another buyer for this facility. In such an event, we
can give no  assurances  that we will be able to realize our  adjusted  carrying
value.   Tanir Bavi meets the  criteria  for  classification  as a component  of
discontinued  operations and all prior periods have been reclassified to conform
to the current year's presentation.  We have reduced the carrying value of Tanir
Bavi to its fair value less costs to sell and  incurred a loss on  disposal  for
the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002 of $14 million  (after-tax).  The
operating  results of Tanir Bavi for the quarter  and six months  ended June 30,
2002  yielded  income of $2  million  (after-tax)  and $5  million  (after-tax),
respectively.  The  respective  income from  discontinued  operations  partially
offsets the loss on disposal.

Operating results of this discontinued operation are summarized in the following
table:

Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

PSE&G  prepares its financial  statements in accordance  with the  provisions of
SFAS 71,  "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation"  (SFAS 71)
which differs in certain  respects from the application of GAAP by non-regulated
businesses.  In general,  SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for  rate-regulated
enterprises  should reflect the economic  effects of regulation.  As a result, a
regulated  utility is required to defer the  recognition  of costs (a regulatory
asset) or the  recognition  of  obligations  (a  regulatory  liability) if it is
probable that,  through the rate-making  process,  there will be a corresponding
increase or decrease in future rates.  Accordingly,  PSE&G has deferred  certain
costs,  which will be amortized  over various  future  periods.  These costs are
deferred based on rate orders issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
(BPU) or the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  and our  recovery
experience with prior rate cases. As of June 30, 2002,  approximately 87% of our
regulatory assets were deferred based on written rate orders.  Regulatory assets
recorded on a basis other than by an issued  rate order have less  certainty  of
recovery  since they can be disallowed in the future by regulatory  authorities.
However,  we have experienced no material  disallowances in the past. We believe
that all of our regulatory assets are probable of recovery.

At June 30, 2002 and  December  31,  2001,  respectively,  we had  deferred  the
following regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

</TABLE>
All  regulatory  assets and  liabilities  are excluded from our rate base unless
otherwise noted in the descriptions below.

     Stranded  Costs To Be  Recovered:  This  reflects the deferred  costs to be
recovered by the securitization  transition charge,  which was authorized by the
BPU's Final Order and Finance Order in PSE&G's deregulation  proceedings.  These
orders are a matter of public record and are  available at the BPU.  These costs
primarily relate to the write-down of our fixed assets in 1999 that was required
under SFAS 121.  PSE&G  Transition  Funding LLC, a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
PSE&G,  issued  transition  bonds to recover these costs net of deferred  taxes.
Accordingly,  this  regulatory  asset is  offset  by  securitization  debt and a
deferred tax liability.  Funds collected through the  securitization  transition
charge will be used to make the future  interest and  principal  payments on the
transition  bonds. This amount will be recovered over the life of the transition
bonds, which is expected to conclude in December 2015.
<PAGE>
SFAS 109 Income Taxes:  This amount  represents  the portion of deferred  income
taxes that will be  recovered  through  future  rates,  based  upon  established
regulatory practices,  which permit the recovery of current taxes.  Accordingly,
this  regulatory  asset is offset by a deferred tax liability and is expected to
be recovered  without  interest over the period the underlying  book-tax  timing
differences reverse and become current taxes.

OPEB Costs: Includes costs associated with adoption of SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Benefits  Other Than Pensions"  (SFAS 106) which were deferred in
accordance  with EITF Issue 92-12,  "Accounting for OPEB Costs by Rate Regulated
Enterprises"  (EITF 92-12).  Prior to the adoption of SFAS 106,  post-retirement
benefits  costs were  recognized  on a cash basis.  SFAS 106 required that these
costs be accrued as the benefits  were earned.  Accordingly,  a liability  and a
regulatory   asset  were  recorded  for  the  total   benefits   earned  at  the
implementation  date.  Beginning  January  1,  1998,  we began to  recover  this
regulatory asset over 15 years without interest.

SBC:  The SBC  includes  costs  related  to our  electric  and gas  distribution
business as follows:  1) social  programs  which include the  universal  service
fund; 2) nuclear plant  decommissioning;  3) DSM programs;  4) manufactured  gas
plant   remediation   expenditures;   5)  consumer   education;   6)  Under  and
overrecovered electric bad debt expenses;  and 7) MTC overrecovery.  These costs
are recovered/refunded  with interest. The SBC clause will be revised at the end
of the transition period on August 1, 2003.

Manufactured  Gas  Plant   Remediation   Costs:   Represents   estimated  future
environmental  investigation  and  remediation  expenditures  (net of  insurance
recoveries),  which are  probable of recovery in future  rates  through the SBC.
This  amount will be  transferred  to the SBC  regulatory  asset when the actual
expenditures  are made.  Interest  is not  recoverable  on these costs until the
actual  expenditures  are made. This regulatory  asset is offset by a noncurrent
liability on the balance sheet.

Unamortized  Loss on Reacquired Debt and Debt Expense:  Represents bond issuance
costs, premiums,  discounts and losses on reacquired long-term debt. These costs
are amortized with interest,  over the remaining life of the reacquired  debt or
over the life of the new debt, if refinanced.

Underrecovered/Overrecovered  Gas  Costs:  Represents  gas costs in excess of or
below the amount  included  in rates and  probable  of  recovery  in the future.
Generally,  underrecovered gas costs do not accrue interest while  overrecovered
gas costs do accrue  interest.  The LGAC rate is normally  adjusted on an annual
basis. A portion of the current underrecovery, $117 million at June 30, 2002, is
being  recovered  over  an  extended  period  through  September  2004.  We  are
recovering  interest during this extended period.  The remaining  portion of the
current  underrecovery,  $78 million, is expected to be recovered  subsequent to
our next gas rate proceeding, the time of which is not currently known.

Unrealized Losses on Gas Contracts:  This represents the recoverable  portion of
unrealized  losses  associated  with contracts used in PSE&G's gas  distribution
business.  This  asset is  offset by the net  energy  contracts  payable  on the
balance  sheet.  Subsequent  to the gas contract  transfer to Power in May 2002,
PSE&G no longer enters into these contracts.

Other Regulatory Assets:  Includes  Decontamination  and  Decommissioning  Costs
which are offset by a noncurrent liability on the balance sheet and are expected
to be collected without interest until December 2007; Plant and Regulatory Study
Costs are expected to be recovered  without interest until December 2021; Repair
Allowance Tax Deficiencies and Interest;  Oil and Gas Property  Write-Down which
is expected to be recovered without interest until December 2002;  restructuring
costs that will be recovered with or without interest,  which will be determined
at our upcoming  electric  rate case,  from August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2007
and recovery of costs  related to Transition  Funding's  interest rate swap that
will be  recovered  without  interest  over  the  life of  Transition  Funding's
transition bonds,  which is expected to conclude in December 2015. This asset is
offset by a derivative liability on the balance sheet.
<PAGE>
Excess  Depreciation  Reserve:  As required by a BPU rate order,  we reduced our
depreciation  reserve for our electric  distribution  assets by $569 million and
recorded such amount as a regulatory  liability to be amortized  over the period
from January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.

NTC:  This clause was  established  to account for above market costs related to
non-utility  generation  (NUG)  contracts.  NUG  contract  costs are  charged to
expense and proceeds  from the sale of the energy and capacity  purchased  under
these NUG  contracts are also credited to expense.  The  difference  between the
collection of NTC revenue and the related expense is deferred. Costs or benefits
associated with the restructuring of these contracts are deferred as well. These
amounts are expected to be returned to customers with interest. The NTC balance,
including  the  anticipated   deferral  of  the  difference  between  the  Basic
Generation  Service (BGS) payments to suppliers and collections  from customers,
are expected to be addressed  together with the electric  distribution base rate
case and collectively incorporated into rates on August 1, 2003.

Other  Regulatory  Liabilities:  This  includes  the  following:  1) Interest on
amounts collected from customers that are used to fund incentives for choosing a
third  party gas  supplier;  2)  Interest on amounts  collected  from  customers
resulting  from the Energy Tax Reform Act and are  currently  being used to fund
customer  education  discounts  approved by the BPU; 3) Amounts  collected  from
customers  in  order  for  Transition  Funding  to  obtain a AAA  rating  on its
transition bonds; and 4) Amounts that will be returned to Firm Gas customers.

Note 6. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Guaranteed Obligations

Power

Power has guaranteed certain energy trading contracts of PSEG Energy Resources &
Trade LLC (ER&T),  its subsidiary.  Power has entered into  guarantees  having a
maximum  liability  of $876  million  and $506  million as of June 30,  2002 and
December  31, 2001,  respectively.  The amount of Power's  exposure  under these
guarantees  was $169 million and $153 million,  as of June 30, 2002 and December
31, 2001, respectively.

As of June 30,  2002,  Power had  issued  letters  of  credit  in the  amount of
approximately $89 million. These letters of credit are in support of its trading
business and various contractual obligations.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings and/or Global have  guaranteed  certain  obligations of Global's
affiliates,   including  the   successful   completion,   performance  or  other
obligations  related  to  certain  of the  projects  in an  aggregate  amount of
approximately  $190 million as of June 30, 2002. The guarantees consist of a $61
million equity commitment for ELCHO in Poland, $56 million of various guarantees
for Dhofar  Power  Company  in Oman,  a $25  million  guarantee  for  Chilquinta
Energia,  S.A.  (Chilquinta)  in Chile and Peru,  and various  other  guarantees
comprising the remaining $48 million.  A substantial  portion of such guarantees
is cancelled  upon  successful  completion,  performance  and/or  refinancing of
construction debt with non-recourse project debt.
<PAGE>
In the normal  course of  business,  Energy  Technologies  secures  construction
obligations with performance bonds issued by insurance  companies.  In the event
that Energy Technologies'  tangible equity falls below $100 million, we would be
required to provide  additional  support  for the  performance  bonds.  Tangible
equity is defined as net  equity  less  goodwill.  As of June 30,  2002,  Energy
Technologies'  tangible  equity  was $106  million.  Energy  Holdings  is in the
process  of  negotiating  alternate  support  arrangements  with  bond  issuers,
including an  indemnification  agreement,  which is likely to be executed in the
near future. As of June 30, 2002,  Energy  Technologies had $206 million of such
bonds  outstanding,  of which $71  million  was at risk in ongoing  construction
projects. Energy Holdings expects to reduce this amount over time as part of its
exit from this  business.  The  performance  bonds are not  included in the $190
million of guaranteed obligations,  discussed above. No assurances can be given
that Energy Holdings will be successful in extinguishing these obligations.

Default on  non-recourse  project  financing does not cross default to any other
credit  agreements of Energy Holdings.  In cases where Energy Holdings or Global
have guaranteed obligations, default under the project finance agreements may be
accelerated if the project is in default. In June 2002, the Administration Agent
for the EDELAP  project  loan  notified  Global that the loan was in default and
Global  paid $2 million in sponsor  guarantees  that were due.  This  amount was
included in the $632 million of Argentine  investment exposure that was impaired
(see Note 3. Asset Impairments).

Environmental

Hazardous Waste

The New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of remedial  investigations and
remediations,  where necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface water
bodies.  PSE&G,  Power and predecessor  companies own or owned and/or operate or
operated certain facilities  situated on surface water bodies,  certain of which
are currently the subject of remedial activities.  The financial impact of these
regulations on these projects is not currently  estimable.  We do not anticipate
that the compliance with these  regulations  will have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows.

PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

PSE&G is currently working with the NJDEP under a program (Remediation  Program)
to assess, investigate and, if necessary,  remediate environmental conditions at
PSE&G's former  manufactured  gas plant (MGP) sites. To date, 38 sites have been
identified.  The  Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and revised by
PSE&G based on regulatory requirements,  experience with the Remediation Program
and available remediation  technologies.  The long-term costs of the Remediation
Program cannot be reasonably estimated, but experience to date indicates that at
least $20  million  per year could be  incurred  over a period of about 30 years
since  inception  of the  program  in 1988 and that the  overall  cost  could be
material. The costs for this remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

At June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, our estimated  liability for remediation
costs through 2004  aggregated $87 million.  Expenditures  beyond 2004 cannot be
reasonably estimated.
<PAGE>
Passaic River Site

The United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA) has determined that a
six mile  stretch of the  Passaic  River in the area of Newark,  New Jersey is a
"facility"  within  the  meaning of that term  under the  Federal  Comprehensive
Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and  Liability  Act of 1980 and that, to
date, at least thirteen  corporations,  including us, may be potentially  liable
for performing  required  remedial  actions to address  potential  environmental
pollution in the Passaic River  "facility." In a separate matter, we and certain
of our predecessors  conducted  industrial  operations at properties on that six
mile stretch of the Passaic River. The operations include one operating electric
generating  station,  one former generating  station,  and four former MGPs. Our
costs to clean up former MGPs are recoverable  from utility  customers under the
SBC.  We  have  contracted  to sell  the  site of the  former  generating  site,
contingent  upon approval by state  regulatory  agencies,  to a third party that
would  release and  indemnify us for claims  arising out of the site.  We cannot
predict what action, if any, the EPA or any third party may take against us with
respect to this matter, or in such event, what costs we may incur to address any
such claims. However, such costs may be material.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR)

In a response  to a request  dated March 31, 2000 by the EPA and the NJDEP under
Section 114 of the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA)  requiring  information to assess
whether  projects  completed  since 1978 at the Hudson and Mercer  coal  burning
units were  implemented  in  accordance  with  applicable  NSR  regulations,  we
provided  certain data. In January 2002, we reached an agreement  with the state
and the federal government to resolve  allegations of noncompliance with federal
and state NSR regulations.  Under that agreement,  we agreed to install advanced
air pollution  controls over 12 years that are expected to significantly  reduce
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx),  sulfur dioxide (SO2) particulate matter and
mercury  from the Hudson  and  Mercer  units.  The  agreement  includes a carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions  reduction goal for PSEG Fossil's New Jersey units. This
single  year CO2  reduction  goal will be  achieved  mainly  through  repowering
projects. The estimated cost of the program is $355 million and such costs, when
incurred,  will be capitalized as plant additions.  We also agreed to pay a $1.4
million civil penalty, $6 million on supplemental  environmental projects and up
to $1.5 million if reductions in CO2 levels are not achieved.

The EPA had also asserted that PSD requirements are applicable to Bergen 2, such
that we were required to have obtained a permit before  beginning actual on-site
construction. We disputed that PSD/NSR requirements were applicable to Bergen 2.
As a result of the agreement resolving the NSR allegations concerning Hudson and
Mercer,  the NJDEP issued an air permit for Bergen 2. Bergen 2 began  operations
in June 2002.

Power

New Generation and Development

Power is developing the Bethlehem Energy Center, a 763 MW  combined-cycle  power
plant that will  replace the 380 MW Albany (NY) Steam  Station.  Total costs for
this project will be  approximately  $465 million with  expenditures  to date of
approximately  $79  million.  Construction  began in June 2002 with the expected
completion in 2004, at which time the existing station will be retired.

Power has completed  construction of a 546 MW natural gas-fired,  combined cycle
electric   generation  plant  at  Bergen  Generation   Station,  at  a  cost  of
approximately $342 million.  The plant began commercial  operation in June 2002.
Power is also constructing a 1,218 MW combined cycle generation plant in Linden,
New  Jersey.   Costs  are  estimated  to  be  approximately  $700  million  with
expenditures to date of  approximately  $432 million.  Completion is expected in
2003 at which time 451 MW of existing generating capacity will be retired.
<PAGE>
Power is also constructing  through  indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  two
natural gas-fired combined cycle electric  generation plants in Waterford,  Ohio
(821 MW) and Lawrenceburg, Indiana (1,096 MW) at an aggregate total cost of $1.2
billion. Total expenditures to date on these projects have been approximately $1
billion.   The  required  estimated  equity  investment  in  these  projects  is
approximately $400 million,  with the remainder being financed with non-recourse
debt.  As of June 30,  2002,  approximately  $212  million  of  equity  has been
invested in these projects. In connection with these projects,  ER&T has entered
into a five-year tolling agreement pursuant to which it is obligated to purchase
the output of these facilities at stated prices.  Based on current prices,  this
contract is currently above market.  The agreement  expires if current financing
is repaid within five years.  Additional  equity  investments may be required if
the proceeds  received from ER&T under this tolling agreement are not sufficient
to cover the required payments under the bank financing.  Due to existing market
conditions,  the  Waterford  project  did not begin  commercial  operation  as a
single-cycle facility in June 2002 as originally  scheduled.  Both the Waterford
and Lawrenceburg  combined-cycle  facilities are currently  scheduled to achieve
commercial operation in 2003.

     Power has entered into an agreement  to purchase  Wisvest-Connecticut  LLC,
which holds two electric generating  stations in Connecticut,  at a cost of $220
million.  The agreement also calls for purchase  price  adjustments of up to $20
million  for  various  expenditures  made  prior to  closing  as well as closing
adjustments for fuel and inventory.  The coal-, oil- and gas-fired plants have a
total  capacity  of 1,019 MW. The  transaction  is  subject  to various  Federal
approvals.  The transfer of the two stations triggered the Connecticut  Transfer
Act, which requires the commencement of any necessary remedial activities within
three years of the transfer of the  property.  While the cost to comply with the
Transfer Act to clean up former petroleum coke operations at the two stations is
still  unknown,  estimated  costs are between $10  million and $20  million.  No
assurances  can  be  given  as  to  the  ultimate  remediation  costs  at  these
facilities;  however,  they could be  material.  Power  expects to close on this
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002.

     Power also has contracts with outside parties to provide upgraded  turbines
for the Salem Units 1 and 2 and  upgraded  turbines  and a power uprate for Hope
Creek  to  increase  our  generating  capacity.  The  projects  are  subject  to
regulatory  approvals  and are  currently  scheduled to be completed by 2004 for
Salem  Unit 1 and Hope  Creek  and  2006 for  Salem  Unit 2.  Power's  aggregate
estimated costs for these projects are $210 million.

Power has commitments to purchase gas turbines  and/or other  services,  to meet
its current  plans to develop  additional  generating  capacity.  The  aggregate
amount due under these commitments is approximately $480 million,  approximately
$370 million of which is included in estimated costs for the projects  discussed
above. The approximate $110 million remaining relates to obligations to purchase
hardware and services that have not been designated to any specific projects. If
Power does not contract to satisfy its  commitment  relating to the $110 million
in  obligations  by July 2003,  it would be subject  to  penalties  of up to $22
million.

Energy Holdings

Argentine Economic Crisis

Global has certain  contingent  obligations  that are likely to occur if certain
projects  in  Argentina  continue  to  default  on their  debt  and  performance
obligations.  The estimated  amount to cover this exposure is $7 million and has
been recorded as a component of general and administrative  operating  expenses.
For  EDELAP,  Global has a standby  equity  agreement  to  contribute  equity in
support of unpaid  interest and US tax  liabilities to its borrower  subsidiary.
Global's  obligation  and  reimbursement  of payments  made on its behalf  could
amount to $2 million related to this project loan. Global's Chilean distribution
company,  SAESA, has guaranteed performance  obligations of its subsidiary which
operates  in  Argentina  in the amount of  approximately  $4  million.  Finally,
Global's  contingency  includes $1 million of likely costs related to defense of
anticipated legal actions which may be taken against PSEG companies or directors
and officers of its Argentine operations.
<PAGE>
Under  certain  circumstances,  Global  could be  obligated  to settle its share
(approximately  $26  million)  of a  project  loan for  EDELAP  should it or the
majority  owner of the  project,  take  certain  actions  including  forcing  or
permitting  certain  loan  parties  to  declare  bankruptcy.  In  addition,  the
guarantee  can be triggered by  transferring  the shares of certain loan parties
without  lender  consent.  Breach  of this  transfer  covenant  can be  cured by
delivering  certain pledge agreements  relating to the ownership of loan parties
to the lenders.  Global could also be liable for any incremental  direct damages
arising from the breach of these covenants.  Given the likely cure of any breach
by the project sponsors,  such a contingent  obligation has a low probability of
being  triggered,  and therefore no provision has been made in the  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

SAESA has guaranteed its share of a $35 million debt  obligation for a 50% owned
affiliate in Argentina, Edersa. This obligation was recorded on our Consolidated
Balance  Sheets as it was  considered  in the  valuation of SAESA at the date of
purchase in August 2001. SAESA needs a waiver from lenders in existing financing
agreements to invest the funds to repay the obligation.  We believe such waivers
are likely to be secured.  In the event SAESA is not able to obtain the required
waiver and could not raise the necessary funds, Global may be required to make a
$35 million equity  contribution  to SAESA to repay the  obligation.  Since this
obligation  has  been  previously  recorded,  there  will  be no  impact  to our

As of June 30,  2002,  Energy  Holdings  had $50  million,  or 1%, of its assets
invested in the Turboven generation facilities,  located in Venezuela. Recently,
Venezuela has been subject to a loss of capital as the  country's  debt has been
subject to a credit  rating  downgrade.  In February  2002,  the  government  of
Venezuela abandoned its crawling currency peg and allowed the Venezuelan Bolivar
to float freely with the US Dollar. The Bolivar devalued approximately 45% since
year-end 2001 from 758 Bolivars to 1 US Dollar to 1,386  Bolivars to 1 US Dollar
as of June 30, 2002. The Turboven power purchase contracts are indexed to the US
Dollar as are the fuel supply costs.  This implies  that,  with respect to power
purchase  contracts,  a  devaluation  will not  impact  the  level of US  Dollar
revenues  realized.  Our near term income statement  exposure relates to our net
monetary position in Bolivars.  Since Turboven is a US Dollar functional entity,
any  receivables  and  payables  that are not  indexed to the US Dollar  must be
re-measured to the US Dollar.  The impact of the re-measurement is recorded as a
loss  or  gain  to  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.   The  recent
devaluation  of the  Bolivar  did not  have a  material  adverse  impact  on our
financial position, results of operations or net cash flows.

In May 2001, GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy),  a 50/50 joint venture  between Global
and Harbinger GWF LLC,  entered into a ten year power purchase  agreement  (PPA)
with the California  Department of Water  Resources  (CDWR) to provide 340 MW of
electric capacity to California from three new natural gas-fired peaking plants,
the Hanford, Henrietta and Tracy Peaking Plants. Total project cost is estimated
at approximately $335 million. The Hanford Peaking Plant, a 95 MW facility,  was
completed and began operation in August 2001. The Henrietta  Peaking Plant, also
a 95 MW facility,  was completed and began operation in June 2002, and the Tracy
Peaking  Plant, a 160 MW facility,  received the permits  necessary to allow the
start of  construction  on July 17,  2002  following  significant  delays in the
permitting process.  This late receipt of the Tracy Peaking Plant's permits does
not  allow  sufficient  time to  complete  construction  before  the  commercial
operations  date  deadline of October  31,  2002 under the PPA. On February  28,
2002, GWF Energy  asserted a force majeure claim under the provisions of the PPA
for an appropriate extension of the deadline.
<PAGE>
On April 24,  2002,  GWF Energy  received  notice  from the CDWR  rejecting  GWF
Energy's force majeure claim. GWF Energy is in substantive negotiations with the
CDWR over this matter.  We and Global are evaluating the  appropriate  course of
action to protect GWF  Energy's  rights under the CDWR PPA.  Global's  permanent
equity investment in these plants, including  contingencies,  is not expected to
exceed $100 million after  completion of project  financing,  which is currently
expected  to occur in late  2002 or in 2003.  In the  event  financing  does not
occur,  our investment in this facility could increase to the full amount of the
project  costs,  noted above.  For a  description  of turbine  loans and working
capital loans from Global to GWF Energy pending completion of project financing,
see Note 13. Related-Party Transactions.

On February 25, 2002, the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California
(CPUC) and the State of California  Electricity Oversight Board filed complaints
with FERC under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act against  certain sellers of
electricity  which,  pursuant to long-term FERC  authorized  contracts,  provide
power to the CDWR. GWF Energy is a named  respondent in these  proceedings.  The
complaints allege that,  collectively,  the specified  long-term wholesale power
contracts  are priced at unjust and  unreasonable  levels  and  request  FERC to
abrogate the contracts to enable the State of  California to obtain  replacement
contracts as necessary or in the alternative, to reform the contracts to provide
for just and reasonable  pricing,  reduce the length of the contracts and strike
from the  contracts  the specific  non-price  conditions  found to be unjust and
unreasonable.  On April 25,  2002,  FERC  consolidated  the  matters and set the
contracts of GWF Energy and certain  other  respondents,  including the ten year
PPA, for hearing.  FERC  determined  that the GWF contract,  among  others,  was
entitled to presumption of validity, requiring the CPUC to prove it was "against
the public  interest."  FERC also strongly  encouraged  the parties to negotiate
settlements  and  directed a  settlement  judge to be  appointed to oversee such
negotiations.  GWF  Energy  has  entered  into,  and  continues  to  engage  in,
substantive negotiations with representatives of the State of California,  under
oversight of the FERC  settlement  judge,  in an attempt to resolve  differences
between the parties.  We cannot predict the outcome of this matter or its impact
on our financial position, results of operations and net cash flows.

In January 2002, Global completed  negotiations to buy a 35% interest in the 590
MW  (electric)  and 618 MW  (thermal)  coal-fired  Skawina CHP Plant  (Skawina),
located  in Poland  and in June 2002  completed  negotiations  to  increase  its
ownership interest to approximately 50%. The transaction includes the obligation
to  purchase  additional  shares  in 2003  that will  bring  Global's  aggregate
interest in Skawina to approximately 75%. Skawina supplies  electricity to three
local distribution companies and heat mainly to the city of Krakow, under annual
one-year  contracts.  The  sale  is  part  of  the  Polish  Government's  energy
privatization  program.  Global has  expended  $31  million  during 2002 for its
approximate 50% ownership  interest and the total equity  investment is expected
to be approximately $44 million.

Global owns a 60% interest in Carthage  Power Company  (CPC), a 471 MW gas-fired
combined-cycle  electric generation facility located in Rades,  Tunisia. CPC has
entered  into a  20-year  power  purchase  contract  for the sale of 100% of the
output to Societe  Tunisienne de l' Electricite et du Gaz, (STEG).  The contract
called for the plant to be  operational  by November 24, 2001,  however,  due to
delays in construction,  this deadline was not met. STEG is declaring that it is
entitled  to  liquidated  damages  at the rate of  $67,000  dollars  a day since
November 24, 2001 in accordance  with the terms of the power purchase  contract.
CPC  is  contesting  STEGs  claim  and  the  two  parties  are  currently  under
negotiation to settle this dispute.  The facility was built by Alstom  Centrales
Energetiques SA, (Alstom) an independent  contractor,  who was also obligated to
complete  construction  by November  24,  2001.  CPC  believes it is entitled to
reimbursement  from Alstom for damages owed to STEG resulting from  construction
delays, however, no assurances can be given.

We and our equity method investees are involved in various legal actions arising
in the normal course of business. We do not expect that there will be a material
adverse  effect on our financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash
flows as a result of these proceedings, although no assurances can be given.

Note 7. Financial Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management

Our  operations  are exposed to market risks from  changes in commodity  prices,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  interest rates and equity prices that could
affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure
to these market risks through our regular  operating  and  financing  activities
and,  when deemed  appropriate,  hedge these risks through the use of derivative
financial  instruments.  We use the term  hedge to mean a strategy  designed  to
manage  risks of  volatility  in prices or rate  movements  on  certain  assets,
liabilities or  anticipated  transactions  by creating a  relationship  in which
gains or losses on derivative  instruments  are expected to  counterbalance  the
losses or gains on the assets,  liabilities or anticipated  transactions exposed
to such market risks.  We use derivative  instruments as risk  management  tools
consistent with our business plans and prudent business practices and for energy
trading purposes.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values were determined using the market  quotations or values
of instruments  with similar terms,  credit  ratings,  remaining  maturities and
redemptions at June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.

Energy Trading Contracts

We maintain a strategy of entering into trading  positions to optimize the value
of our portfolio of generation assets and supply  obligations.  We do not engage
in the practice of  simultaneous  trading for the purpose of increasing  trading
volume or  revenue.  We engage in physical  and  financial  transactions  in the
electricity wholesale markets and execute an overall risk management strategy to
mitigate the effects of adverse  movements in the fuel and electricity  markets.
We actively trade energy and  energy-related  products,  including  electricity,
natural gas, electric  capacity,  fixed transmission  rights,  coal and emission
allowances,  in the spot,  forward and futures  markets,  primarily  in PJM, and
electricity  in the Super Region,  which extends from Maine to the Carolinas and
the Atlantic Coast to Indiana and natural gas in the producing region as well as
the Super Region. These contracts also involve financial  transactions including
swaps, options and futures.

Our energy  trading  contracts are recorded  under EITF 98-10,  "Accounting  for
Contracts  Involved in Energy  Trading  and Risk  Management  Activities"  (EITF
98-10). This requires energy trading contracts to be  marked-to-market  with the
resulting realized and unrealized gains and losses included in current earnings.

Our energy  trading  segment for the quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2002
recorded  net  margins  of $18  million  and $48  million,  respectively,  which
includes margins generated by gas contracts as shown below:

We routinely  enter into exchange  traded futures and options  transactions  for
electricity and natural gas as part of our energy trading operations. Generally,
exchange-traded  futures contracts require deposit of margin cash, the amount of
which is subject  to change  based on market  movement  and in  accordance  with
exchange  rules.  The  amount of the  margin  deposits  as of June 30,  2002 was
approximately $3 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Commodity Contracts

The  availability  and price of energy  commodities  are subject to fluctuations
from  factors  such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in supply and
demand,  state and federal regulatory policies and other events. To reduce price
risk  caused  by  market  fluctuations,  we  enter  into  derivative  contracts,
including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties,  to
hedge our  anticipated  demand.  These  contracts,  in  conjunction  with  owned
electric generation capacity,  are designed to cover estimated electric customer
commitments.

The BPU  approved  an  auction  to  identify  energy  suppliers  for  the  Basic
Generation  Service (BGS) of New Jersey's regulated  distribution  utilities for
the  one-year  period  beginning  on August 1, 2002.  Power did not  participate
directly  in the  auction  but  agreed to supply  power to several of the direct
bidders,  securing contracts for more than 75% of its generation capacity in the
PJM market.  On February  15, 2002,  the BPU  approved the BGS auction  results.
Subsequently,  a portion of the contracts  with those bidders was  reassigned to
Power.  Therefore,  for a limited  portion of the New Jersey retail load,  Power
will be a direct suppplier.

In order to hedge a portion of our forecasted  energy  purchases to meet our BGS
requirements,  Power entered into forward purchase contracts,  futures,  options
and swaps.  Power has also  forecasted  the energy  delivery from its generating
stations  based on the forward price curve  movement of energy and, as a result,
entered into swaps,  options and futures  transactions to hedge the price of gas
to meet  its gas  purchases  requirements  for  generation.  These  transactions
qualify for hedge accounting  treatment under SFAS 133. As of June 30, 2002, the
fair value of these hedges was $(8.6) million with  offsetting  charges to Other
Comprehensive Income (OCI) of $5.1 million (after-tax). These hedges will mature
in 2003.
<PAGE>
Also, prior to May 2002, PSE&G had entered into gas forwards,  futures,  options
and  swaps to hedge its  forecasted  requirements  for  natural  gas,  which was
required  under an agreement  with the BPU in 2001.  PSE&G  accounted  for these
transactions in accordance with SFAS 71. Accordingly,  these commodity contracts
were recognized at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet  and the  offset  to the  change  in fair  value of these  derivatives  is
recorded as a regulatory  asset or liability.  All settlements  were included in
inventory and passed on to customers as part of the average cost of gas.

Effective  with the gas contract  transfer on May 1, 2002,  Power assumed all of
these  derivatives  entered into by PSE&G.  Power  accounts for the  derivatives
pertaining to  residential  customers in a similar manner as PSE&G did. Gains or
losses  from  these  transactions  will be  recovered  from  PSE&G's  customers.
Derivatives  relating to commercial and  industrial  customers will be accounted
for in accordance  with SFAS 133,  where  appropriate.  Gains or losses on these
derivatives will be deferred and reported as a component of OCI. The accumulated
OCI  will be  reclassified  to  earnings  in the  period  in  which  the  hedged
transaction affects earnings.

As of June 30, 2002, Power had approximately 303 MMBTU of gas forwards, futures,
options  and  swaps  to  hedge  forecasted  requirements  with a fair  value  of
approximately  $(10) million.  As of December 31, 2001, PSE&G had  approximately
330  MMBTU of gas  forwards,  futures,  options  and  swaps to hedge  forecasted
requirements with a fair value of approximately $(137) million. The maximum term
of these contracts is approximately one year.

Generation

We also enter into certain other contracts for our generation business which are
derivatives  but do not  qualify  for hedge  accounting  under  SFAS 133 nor are
classified as energy trading contracts under EITF 98-10. Most of these contracts
are option contracts on gas purchases for generation  requirements.  The changes
in fair market value of these  derivative  contracts  are recorded in the income
statement at the end of each reporting period in our generation segment.

For our generation  business for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002,
we recorded gains and losses on certain derivative contracts of $(6) million and
$26 million, respectively, as shown below:

Interest Rates

We are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of
business.  Our policy is to manage  interest  rate risk through the use of fixed
rate debt,  floating  rate debt,  interest  rate swaps,  interest  rate caps and
interest rate lock agreements. As of June 30, 2002, a hypothetical 10% change in
market  interest rates would result in a  consolidated  change of $17 million in
annual interest costs related to short-term and floating rate debt consisting of
$4 million,  $6 million,  $3 million  and $4 million at PSEG,  PSE&G,  Power and
Energy Holdings, respectively.

We  construct  a  hypothetical  swap to  mirror  all the  critical  terms of the
underlying debt and utilize  regression  analysis to assess the effectiveness of
the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing  basis.  The  assessment  will be
done periodically to ensure the swaps continue to be effective.  PSEG determines
the fair value of interest rate swaps through counterparty valuations,  internal
valuations  and the  Bloomberg  swap  valuation  function.  There  have  been no
material  changes in the  techniques or models used in the valuation of interest
rate swaps during the periods presented. There is minimal impact of counterparty
credit risk the fair value of the hedges  since our  policies  require  that our
counterparties have investment grade credit ratings.

We have  entered into  interest  rate swaps to lock in fixed  interest  rates on
certain of our construction  loans to hedge forecasted future interest payments.
We  have  elected  to  use  the  Hypothetical   Derivative   Method  to  measure
ineffectiveness of the hedges as described under Derivative Implementation Group
(DIG)  Issue No. G7.  Ineffectiveness  may occur if the actual  draw down of the
debt and the  notional  amount of the swap  during  the  construction  phase are
different. The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings at the
end of the reporting period.  The impact of ineffectiveness on net income should
be minimal  because the interest rate swaps and the underlying  debt are indexed
to the same  benchmark  interest  rate.  Therefore,  interest rate  fluctuations
should be offset.

We expect to  reclass  approximately  $19  million  of losses on open  positions
related  to  interest  rate swaps from OCI to  earnings  during the next  twelve

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss account, as indicated in the table above.

Equity Securities

PSEG Resources Inc. (Resources),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Energy Holdings,
has investments in equity securities and limited partnerships. Resources carries
its  partnership  investments  in certain  capital and  leveraged  buyout  funds
investing in securities at fair value where market quotations and an established
liquid  market  of  underlying   securities  in  the  portfolio  are  available.
Consequently,  the carrying value of these investments is affected by changes in
the fair  value of the  underlying  securities.  Fair  value  is  determined  by
adjusting the market value of the securities for liquidity and market volatility
factors, where appropriate.  For investments where there is not a liquid market,
Resources relies on the valuation by the investment fund manager to determine if
the fund has  experienced  an other than  temporary  impairment for which a loss
would need to be recorded.  During the quarter  ended June 30,  2002,  Resources
recognized  such a loss of  approximately  $26 million  pre-tax.  As of June 30,
2002,  Resources had investments in leveraged buyout funds of approximately  $90
million,  of which $21 million was comprised of public securities with available
market  prices and $69  million  were  private  investments.  Comparably,  as of
December 31,  2001,  Resources  had  investments  in  leveraged  buyout funds of
approximately  $130  million,  of which  $35  million  was  comprised  of public
securities   with   available   market  prices  and  $95  million  were  private
investments.

Foreign Currencies

We conduct our  business on a  multinational  basis in a wide variety of foreign
currencies.  Our objective for foreign  currency  risk  management  policy is to
preserve  the  economic  value of cash  flows in  currencies  other  than the US
Dollar. Our policy is to hedge significant probable future cash flows identified
as  subject  to  significant  foreign  currency  variability.  In  addition,  we
typically  hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign  currency  risk  resulting
from identified  anticipated cash flows,  providing the flexibility to deal with
the variability of longer-term  forecasts as well as changing market conditions,
in which the cost of  hedging  may be  excessive  relative  to the level of risk
involved.  Our foreign currency hedging  activities to date include hedges of US
Dollar  debt  arrangements  in  operating  companies  that  conduct  business in
currencies other than the US Dollar and purchase of options to limit downside on
earnings translation.

As  of  June  30,  2002,  Global  and  Resources  had  international  assets  of
approximately  $2.870  billion  and $1.425  billion,  respectively.  For further
analysis of our  international  assets,  see Note 9.  Financial  Information  by
Business Segments.

Resources'  international  investments are primarily  leveraged leases of assets
located in Austria,  Australia,  Belgium,  China, Germany, the Netherlands,  New
Zealand  and the United  Kingdom  with  associated  revenues  denominated  in US
Dollars and therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

Global's international  investments are primarily in projects that presently, or
are expected to,  generate or distribute  electricity in Brazil,  Chile,  China,
India, Italy, Oman, Peru, Poland,  Taiwan,  Tunisia and Venezuela.  Investing in
foreign countries  involves certain additional risks.  Economic  conditions that
result in higher  comparative rates of inflation in foreign countries are likely
to result in  declining  values in such  countries'  currencies.  As  currencies
fluctuate  against the US Dollar,  there is a  corresponding  change in Global's
investment  value in terms of the US  Dollar.  Such  change is  reflected  as an
increase or decrease in the  investment  value and Other  Comprehensive  Loss or
OCI, a separate  component of  Stockholder's  Equity.  As of June 30, 2002,  net
foreign  currency  devaluations  have reduced the  reported  amount of our total
Stockholder's Equity by $276 million, of which $184 million and $84 million were
caused  by  the  devaluation  of  the  Brazilian  Real  and  the  Chilean  Peso,
respectively.  For the net foreign currency devaluations for the quarter and six
months ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, see Note 10. Comprehensive Income.

In May 2002, Energy Holdings purchased foreign currency call options in order to
hedge its average 2002 earnings  denominated in Brazilian  Reais and in Peruvian
Nuevo Sols for the remainder of 2002.  As of June 30, 2002,  there were six call
options  outstanding  on the Brazilian  Real, one expiring in each month through
December 2002. The aggregate notional value of these contracts was approximately
$17 million as of June 30, 2002.  The fair value of those options as of June 30,
2002 was $1 million. In addition, there were six call options outstanding on the
Peruvian  Nuevo Sol,  one  expiring in each month  through  December  2002.  The
aggregate  notional value of these contracts was approximately $48 million as of
June  30,  2002.  The  fair  value of  those  options  as of June  30,  2002 was
negligible. These options are not considered hedges for accounting purposes and,
as a result, changes in their fair value are recorded directly to earnings.

The fair value of foreign currency derivatives, designated and effective as cash
flow hedges, are initially recorded in OCI. Reclassification of unrealized gains
or losses on cash flow hedges of  variable-rate  debt  instruments from OCI into
earnings occurs as payments are made on the derivative instruments and generally
offsets the change in the value of the hedged item. We estimate reclassifying $1
million of  foreign  exchange  gains from  foreign  currency  cash flow  hedges,
including our pro-rata share from our equity method  investees,  from OCI to our
Consolidated  Statements of Operations over the next 12 months.  For the quarter
and six  months  ended  June 30,  2002,  losses  of less  than $1  million  were
transferred from OCI to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Statements and Notes.

Overview of the Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2002

Net losses for the quarter  ended June 30,  2002 were $264  million or $1.28 per
share of common stock,  based on 207 million  average  shares  outstanding.  Net
losses for the six months  ended  June 30,  2002 were $204  million or $0.99 per
share of common stock,  based on 207 million average shares  outstanding.  These
results  include  after-tax  charges of $380 million or $1.84 per share and $531
million or $2.57 per share for the quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2002,
respectively,  related to the asset  impairment of  investments in Argentina and
losses from  operations of those  impaired  assets,  discontinued  operations of
Energy  Technologies and a generating  facility in India and goodwill impairment
charges.  For the six months ended June 30, 2002,  as a result of adopting  SFAS
142 on January 1, 2002,  an after-tax  impairment  loss of $120 million or $0.58

For the quarter and six months ended June 30,  2002,  excluding  these  charges,
earnings  were $116  million  or $0.56 per share and $327  million  or $1.58 per
share.  Comparable  earnings  for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001
were  $151  million  or $0.72 per share  and $408  million  or $1.96 per  share,
respectively. The decrease in earnings for the quarter and six months ended June
30,  2002,  excluding  these  charges,  as compared to the same  periods in 2001
resulted  primarily  from  unexpected  losses  in  Resources'  leveraged  buyout
portfolio,   lower  energy  trading  margins  at  Power,  higher  Operation  and
Maintenance  and  other  expenses  at Power and lower  margins  at PSE&G.  These
decreases were partially offset by higher BGS margins at Power and gains related
to  Global's  withdrawal  from its  interest  in the  Eagle  Point  Cogeneration
Partnership (Eagle Point).

Future Outlook

As a result of the lower than expected results in the second quarter of 2002, in
conjunction  with the  effects of the warm  weather on PSE&G's  gas sales in the
first quarter of 2002, we have revised our previous full year earnings-per-share
projection  of  $3.90  to $4.10  downward  by 5% to a range  of $3.70 to  $3.90,
excluding the charges  described above. For 2002, Power is expected to earn $460
million to $500 million,  PSE&G is expected to earn $175 million to $185 million
and Energy Holdings is expected to earn $145 million to $155 million,  excluding
the previously discussed charges.

Power is expected to be the primary  factor in achieving our goals for the year.
Power's  successful  participation  as an  indirect  supplier  of  energy to New
Jersey's  utilities,  including  PSE&G, in New Jersey's recent basic  generation
service  (BGS)  auction is expected to have a meaningful  effect on our earnings
for the remainder of the year and should help to partially offset the lack of an
earnings contribution from Argentina.  Power surpassed its objective of securing
contracts on more than 75% of its capacity with  suppliers that won the right to
serve New Jersey's  utilities for a one-year period beginning August 1, 2002. At
the same time, PSE&G was able to secure all of its power supply for the one-year
period at competitive prices.
<PAGE>
While Global realized substantial growth in 2001,  significant  challenges which
began  developing  during the fourth  quarter of 2001 have  continued into 2002.
These challenges  include the Argentine  economic,  political and social crisis,
the soft power market in Texas and California,  recent developments in India and
the worldwide economic downturn.  As a result, Global has refocused its strategy
from one of  accelerated  growth to one that places  emphasis on increasing  the
efficiency and returns of its existing assets.

     Over the long term,  we continue to target a 7% earnings  per share  growth
rate. For 2003, we expect  earnings per share to increase to a range of $4.00 to
$4.20,  driven by the assumptions  that: Power will continue to benefit from its
performance  as a  wholesale  BGS  provider  with the new one year BGS  contract
beginning  August 1, 2002 and next  year's  contract  beginning  August 1, 2003;
PSE&G will have a successful  outcome to its recently  filed  electric rate case
seeking a $250 million  increase in electric  rates  beginning in August
2003,  and benefit  from more normal  weather;  Global,  with its major risks in
Argentina and India behind it,  significant  cost-cutting  measures in place and
limited spending planned over the next 18 to 24 months,  expects improvements in
earnings through its focus on increasing the return on its existing assets;  and
Resources,  with  recent  and  planned  investments  and  less  exposure  to its
investment in the KKR leveraged buyout funds, expects to continue to be a steady
contributor to earnings and cash flows.

Factors Affecting Future Outlook

As a result of more than 70% of our earnings coming from unregulated businesses,
the  continued  changes  in  political,  legislative,  regulatory  and  economic
conditions  in the many  countries in which we do business,  the inherent  price
volatility of the commodities in our businesses,  and many other factors,  it is
much more difficult to accurately forecast our future earnings.  Some of the key
sensitivities and risks of our businesses are discussed below.

Power's success as a wholesale BGS provider will depend, in part, on its ability
to meet its  obligations  under  its full  requirements  contracts  with the BGS
suppliers in a profitable manner.  Power expects to accomplish this by producing
energy from its own generation and/or energy purchases in the market. Power also
enters  into  trading  positions  related  to its  generation  assets and supply
obligations.  To the extent it does not hedge its  obligations,  whether long or
short, Power will be subject to the risk of price fluctuations that could affect
its future results,  such as increases in the price of energy  purchased to meet
its supply obligations,  the cost of fuel to generate  electricity,  the cost of
congestion  credits that Power needs to transmit  electricity and other factors.
In addition, Power is subject to the risk of subpar operating performance of its
fossil and nuclear  generating units. To the extent there are unexpected outages
at  Power's   generating   facilities,   changes  in  environmental  or  nuclear
regulations  or other factors  which impact the  production of such units or the
ability to generate and transmit electricity in a cost-effective  manner, it may
cost us more to produce  electricity  or we may be required  to purchase  higher
cost energy to replace the energy we anticipated  producing.  These risks can be
exacerbated by, among other things, changes in demand in electricity usage, such
as those due to extreme weather and economic conditions.

Power's future revenue  stream is also  uncertain.  Due to the timing of the New
Jersey BGS auction process,  the majority of Power's revenues for August 1, 2003
and  thereafter  cannot be accurately  predicted.  Also,  certain of Power's new
projects,  such as our investments in the Lawrenceburg and Waterford projects in
the Midwest and the plants we are  acquiring  from Wisvest in  Connecticut,  are
also  subject to the risk of changes  in future  energy  prices as Power has not
entered  into  forward  sale  contracts  for  the  majority  of  their  expected
generation capacity.  Also, since the majority of our generation  facilities are
concentrated in the Northeast region, changes in future energy supply and demand
and  energy-related  prices in this region could materially  affect our results.
Also, changes in the rules and regulation of these markets by FERC, particularly
changes in the ability to maintain  market  based  rates,  could have an adverse
impact on our  results.  As a result of these  variables  and  risks,  we cannot
predict the impact of these potential  future changes on our forecasted  results
of operations,  financial position, or net cash flows, however such impact could
be material.
<PAGE>
In addition, our earnings projections assume that we will continue to use energy
trading to optimize the value of our portfolio of  generating  assets and supply
obligations.  This will depend, in part, on our, as well as our counterparties',
ability to maintain sufficient  creditworthiness and to display a willingness to
participate  in energy  trading  activities at  anticipated  volumes.  Potential
changes in the mechanisms of conducting trading activity,  such as the continued
availability of energy trading exchanges,  could positively or negatively affect
trading  volumes and liquidity in these energy trading  markets  compared to the
assumptions  of these  factors  embedded in our business  plans.  Recently,  the
energy  trading  markets have  experienced  a noticeable  slowdown in the second
quarter  that has  affected  our second  quarter  results and our 2002  earnings
projections.  However,  to date,  the failure of certain  internet-based  energy
trading  exchanges  has not had a  significant  impact  on  liquidity  in energy
trading markets where we conduct our business.  As a result of these  variables,
we cannot predict the impact of these potential future changes on our forecasted
results of  operations,  financial  position,  or net cash flows,  however  such
impact could be material.

PSE&G's  success  will be  dependent,  in  part,  on its  ability  to  obtain  a
reasonable outcome, which cannot be assured, to its recently filed electric rate
case as well as its ability to continue to recover the regulatory  assets it has
deferred  and  the  investments  it  plans  to  make  in its  electric  and  gas
transmission and distribution  systems.  As of June 30, 2002, as required by the
Final Order, PSE&G has had rate reductions  totaling 9% since August 1, 1999 and
will have an additional 4.9% rate reduction effective August 1, 2002, which will
be in effect until July 31, 2003. This additional rate reduction reduces the MTC
rate and will therefore reduce Power's revenues once effective.

Energy Holdings' success will be dependent,  in part, on its ability to mitigate
risks  presented by its  international  strategy.  The  economic  and  political
conditions in certain countries where Global has investments  present risks that
may be different than those found in the United States including:  renegotiation
or  nullification  of  existing  contracts,   changes  in  law  or  tax  policy,
interruption  of business,  risks of  nationalization,  expropriation,  war, and
other factors.  Operations in foreign  countries  also present risks  associated
with  currency  exchange  and  convertibility,  inflation  and  repatriation  of
earnings. In some countries in which Global has interests, economic and monetary
conditions and other factors could affect  Global's  ability to convert its cash
distributions to US Dollars or other freely convertible  currencies,  or to move
funds offshore from such  countries.  Furthermore,  the central bank of any such
country  may have  the  authority  to  suspend,  restrict  or  otherwise  impose
conditions  on foreign  exchange  transactions  or to approve  distributions  to
foreign  investors.  Although Global generally seeks to structure power purchase
contracts  and other  project  revenue  agreements to provide for payments to be
made in, or indexed to, United States Dollars or a currency  freely  convertible
into US Dollars, its ability to do so in all cases may be limited.

The international  risks discussed above can potentially be magnified due to the
volatility of foreign  currencies.  The foreign  exchange rates of the Brazilian
Real,  Chilean  Peso and  Peruvian  Sol have  recently  weakened  due to various
political  and  economic  factors.  This  could  result in  comparatively  lower
contributions  from our  distribution  investments in US Dollar terms.  While we
still expect Latin  America to contribute  significantly  to our earnings in the
future,  the political and economic risks associated with this region could have
a material adverse impact on our remaining investments in the region.

Certain of Global's  projects  are also  subject to the risk of changing  future
energy  prices,  including  its  investment  in two 1,000 MW facilities in Texas
which have performed below  expectations  due to lower energy prices than we had
anticipated,  primarily  resulting  from the  over-supply of energy in the Texas
power market.  Global  expects this trend to continue  until the 2004-2005  time
frame when market  prices are  expected  to  increase,  as older less  efficient
plants in the Texas power  market are  expected to be retired and the demand for
electricity  is expected to increase and has included these  assumptions  within
its business  plans.  However,  no assurances can be given as to the accuracy of
these  estimates and changes in these  estimates could have a material impact on
its forecasted results of operations, financial position, or net cash flows.
<PAGE>
Energy  Holdings,  through  Resources,  also  faces  risks  with  regard  to the
creditworthiness of its  counterparties,  as well as the risk of a change in the
current tax treatment of its investments in leveraged leases.  The manifestation
of either of these risks could cause a materially adverse effect on its strategy
and its forecasted results of operations, financial position, or net cash flows.
See Item 3.  Qualitative  and  Quantitative  Disclosures  about  Market Risk for
further discussion.

In  addition,  we have  exposure  to the equity  and debt  markets  through  our
substantial  use of  short-term  financing,  the effect of lower assumed rate of
returns and lower fund balances on our pension and other postretirement  benefit
plan (OPEB) expenses,  the potential impact to Resources'  investment in the KKR
leveraged  buyout funds, and other equity and debt investments held by us. Also,
increases  in the cost of  capital,  which  could  result from market and lender
concerns  regarding  us,  our  industry,  the United  States  and  international
economic  conditions and other  factors,  could make it more difficult for us to
enter  into  profitable  investments.  We  are  also  subject  to  credit  risk,
particularly  within our  unregulated  businesses.  See Item 3.  Qualitative and
Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion.

Results of Operations

Operating Revenues

Electric


Electric revenues decreased $7 million or 1% for the quarter ended June 30, 2002
from the comparable period in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease
in our PSE&G  segment  revenues  of $45  million  primarily  due to  recovery of
approximately $19 million of lost sales associated with DSM programs through the
societal benefits charge (SBC). In addition,  lower  distribution  sales volumes
reduced  revenues by  approximately  $6 million due primarily to our  industrial
customers and there was an  approximate  $12 million  decrease in  miscellaneous
electric   revenues   primarily   relating  to  replacement   capacity   charges
(approximately $8 million) and fiber optics  (approximately  $2 million).  There
were also decreases in our Generation  segment revenues of $23 million primarily
related to a $9 million  decrease in revenues from ancillary  services and an $8
million  decrease in Market  Transition  Charge (MTC) revenues  relating to a 2%
electric  rate  reduction  that went  into  effect  in  August  2001.  Partially
offsetting  these decreases was the inclusion of $61 million of revenues related
to various  majority-owned  acquisitions  and plants going into operation at our
Global segment in the second quarter of 2001.

Electric revenues  increased $39 million or 2% for the six months ended June 30,
2002 from the  comparable  period in 2001. The increase was primarily due to the
inclusion  of  $132  million  of  revenues  related  to  various  majority-owned
acquisitions and plants going into operation at our Global segment in the second
quarter of 2001.  Offsetting  this increase were  decreases at our PSE&G segment
and  Generation   segment  of   approximately   $54  million  and  $39  million,
respectively. The decrease in our PSE&G segment revenue primarily related to $19
million lost revenue recovery  discussed above, lower distribution sales volumes
which  reduced  revenues  by  approximately  $25 million  due  primarily  to our
industrial  customers and an approximate $14 million  decrease in  miscellaneous
electric   revenues   primarily   relating  to  replacement   capacity   charges
(approximately  $9 million) and fiber  optics  (approximately  $2 million).  The
decrease in our Generation  segment  revenue was primarily due to the effects of
two 2% rate  reductions  that occurred in February  2001 and August 2001,  which
reduced revenues by approximately  $36 million for the six months ended June 30,
2002 as compared to the same  period in the prior  year.  These rate  reductions
reduce the MTC revenues that PSE&G remits to Power as part of its BGS contract.


Gas

Gas  revenues  decreased  $42  million  or 12% and $309  million  or 22% for the
quarter and for the six months ended June 30, 2002 from the  comparable  periods
in 2001,  respectively,  primarily due to the effects decreased  commodity rates
(approximately  $55  million  and $270  million  for the quarter and six months,
respectively)  offset by increased gas base rates (approximately $10 million and
$36 million for the quarter and six  months,  respectively).  In  addition,  the
effects of warmer  weather in the first quarter of 2002, as compared to the same
period in 2001,  decreased  revenues  for the six months  ended June 30, 2002 by
approximately $80 million.

<PAGE>
Trading

Trading  revenues  decreased  by $227 million or 40% and $389 million or 34% for
the quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2002 from the  comparable  periods in
2001,  respectively,  due to lower  energy  trading  volumes,  lower  prices  as
compared to 2001, and sales on emission credits recorded in the first quarter of
2001. The majority of our trading gains have been  realized,  which has provided
increased  liquidity and cash flow.  See Note 7. Financial  Instruments,  Energy
Trading and Risk Management for further discussion.

Other

Other revenues increased $11 million or 13% and decreased $22 million or 10% for
the quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2002 from the  comparable  periods in
2001.  The  increase  for the quarter  was due to a $36 million  increase in our
Global segment,  excluding the electric revenues discussed above, primarily from
$39 million of gains from its  withdrawal  from Eagle Point.  This  increase was
partially offset by a decrease of $26 million in revenues at Resources primarily
relating to a net change of $32 million in the carrying value of publicly traded
and  non-publicly  traded  securities  in a  leveraged  buyout  fund  which  was
partially offset by higher leveraged lease income from continued  investments in
such transactions.

     The decrease for the six months was primarily due to a $16 million decrease
in revenues at our Global  segment and a $6 million  decrease in revenues at our
Resources  segment.  The decrease at Global primarily relates to a net reduction
of $22 million in revenues  associated with certain partnership  interests.  The
decrease at  Resources  related to a net change of $23  million in the  carrying
value of publicly traded and private  securities in a certain  leveraged  buyout
fund which was partially  offset by $17 million of higher leveraged lease income
from continued investments in such transactions.

Operating Expenses

Electric Energy Costs

Electric  Energy Costs  increased $13 million or 5% and $8 million or 2% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2002 from the  comparable  2001  periods,
respectively,  primarily due to additional  electric energy costs of $28 million
and  $58  million  for  the  quarter  and  six  months   ended  June  30,  2002,
respectively,  related to various  majority-owned  acquisitions and plants going
into operation at our Global segment in the second quarter of 2001. In addition,
outages at Hudson,  Salem and Hope Creek  generating  stations  precipitated the
purchases of electricity on the open market to meet our generation needs.  These
increases were partially offset by the lower cost of fuel,  particularly natural
gas and the continued  strong  performance  of our low-cost  nuclear  generating
plants.

Gas Costs

Gas Costs  decreased  $60 million or 25% and $320 million or 31% for the quarter
and  six  months  ended  June  30,  2002  from  the  comparable   2001  periods,
respectively,  primarily  due to lower demand as a result of the warmer  weather
and decreased  commodity rates  (approximately  $55 million and $270 million for
the quarter and six months, respectively) that became effective in January 2002.
In addition,  lower demand due to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2002 as
compared  to the same  period  in 2001,  decreased  costs by  approximately  $40
million for the six months ended June 30, 2002.

Trading Costs

Trading  Costs  decreased  $200  million or 37% and $343  million or 32% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2002 from the  comparable  2001  periods,
respectively,   primarily  due  to  lower  trading  volumes  (see  corresponding
decreases  in  trading  revenues).  See Note 7.  Financial  Instruments,  Energy
Trading and Risk Management for further discussion.
<PAGE>
Operations and Maintenance

Operations and Maintenance  expense  increased $10 million or 2% and $24 million
or 3% for the  quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2002 from the  comparable
2001 periods.  The increase for the quarter and the six months was primarily due
to additional  expenditures related to plants going into operation at our Global
segment.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation  and  Amortization  expense  increased  $16  million or 13% and $44
million  or 19% for the  quarter  and six months  ended  June 30,  2002 from the
comparable  2001  periods.  The  increase  was  primarily  due to an increase in
depreciable  assets  and a full  periods'  recognition  of  amortization  of the
regulatory asset recorded for PSE&G's stranded costs which commenced in February
2001,  combined  with  an  increase  in gas  depreciation  expense  recorded  in
accordance with PSE&G's increased gas base rates.

Interest Expense

     Interest  Expense  increased  $19 million or 11% and $49 million or 14% for
the  quarter  and six  months  ended  June  30,  2002,  respectively,  from  the
comparable  2001  periods  primarily  due to  increased  long-term  debt used to
finance several investments made in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  following  discussion  of  our  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is on a
consolidated  basis,  noting  the uses and  contributions  of our  three  direct
operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

Financing Methodology

Our capital requirements and those of our subsidiaries are met through liquidity
provided by internally generated cash flow and external financings.  PSEG, Power
and  Energy  Holdings  from  time to time  make  equity  contributions  to their
respective direct and indirect subsidiaries to provide for part of their capital
and cash requirements, generally relating to long-term investments. At times, we
utilize  inter-company  dividends  and  inter-company  loans to satisfy  various
subsidiary  needs and efficiently  manage our and our  subsidiaries'  short-term
cash needs. Any excess funds are invested in accordance with guidelines  adopted
by our Board of Directors.

External  funding to meet our needs and the needs of PSE&G,  the majority of the
requirements  of Power and a substantial  portion of the  requirements of Energy
Holdings, is comprised of corporate finance  transactions.  The debt incurred is
the direct  obligation  of those  respective  entities.  Some of the proceeds of
these  debt  transactions  are used by the  respective  obligor  to make  equity
investments in its subsidiaries.

Depending on the particular  company,  external  financing may consist of public
and private capital market debt and equity  transactions,  bank revolving credit
and term loan facilities,  commercial paper and/or project  financings.  Some of
these transactions involve special purpose entities (SPEs), formed in accordance
with  applicable  tax,  accounting  and legal  requirements  in order to achieve
specified  beneficial  financial  advantages,   such  as  favorable  tax,  legal
liability or accounting treatment. All special purpose entities are consolidated
in our Consolidated  Financial Statements,  except for certain subsidiaries that
are  less  than  majority  owned by us and  therefore  are not  permitted  to be
consolidated in our financial  statements  under generally  accepted  accounting
principles.
<PAGE>
The  availability  and  cost of  external  capital  could  be  affected  by each
subsidiary's  performance  as well as by the  performance  of  their  respective
subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  This could  include the degree of  structural or
regulatory  separation between us and our subsidiaries and between PSE&G and its
non-utility  affiliates  and  the  potential  impact  of  affiliate  ratings  on
consolidated and unconsolidated  credit quality.  Additionally,  compliance with
applicable  financial  covenants will depend upon future financial  position and
levels of earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.

Financing  for  Global's  projects  and  investments  is  generally  provided by
non-recourse project financing  transactions.  These consist of loans from banks
and other  lenders  that are  typically  secured by project and special  purpose
subsidiary  assets and/or cash flows.  Two of Power's  projects  currently under
construction have similar financing.  Non-recourse transactions generally impose
no material  obligation on the parent-level  investor to repay any debt incurred
by the project borrower. However, in some cases, certain obligations relating to
the investment being financed,  including  additional  equity  commitments,  are
guaranteed by Global,  Energy Holdings,  and/or Power. Further, the consequences
of permitting a project-level default include loss of any invested equity by the
parent.

Over the  next  several  years,  we and our  subsidiaries  will be  required  to
refinance  maturing debt, and expect to incur additional debt and provide equity
to fund  investment  activity.  Any  inability  to  obtain  required  additional
external  capital  or  to  extend  or  replace  maturing  debt  and/or  existing
agreements at current levels and reasonable  interest rates may adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Debt Covenants,  Cross Default Provisions,  Material Adverse Clause Changes, and
Ratings Triggers

Our credit  agreements and those of our  subsidiaries and the debt indentures of
Power and Energy Holdings contain cross-default provisions under which a default
by us or by specified subsidiaries involving specified levels of indebtedness in
other  agreements  would result in a default and the potential  acceleration  of
payment under such indentures and credit agreements. For example, a default with
respect to specified  indebtedness in an aggregate amount of $50 million for us,
$50 million for Power,  $50 million for PSE&G or $5 million for Energy Holdings,
including relevant equity contribution obligations in subsidiaries' non-recourse
transactions, would cause a cross-default in our or certain of our subsidiaries'
credit agreements or indentures.

If such a default were to occur,  lenders,  or the debt holders under any of our
or our  subsidiaries'  indentures,  after giving effect to any applicable  grace
and/or cure  periods,  could  determine  that debt  payment  obligations  may be
accelerated as a result of a cross-default. A declaration of cross-default could
severely limit our liquidity and restrict our ability to meet our debt,  capital
and, in extreme cases,  operational cash requirements.  Any inability to satisfy
required  covenants and/or borrowing  conditions would have a similar impact. In
the event of any likely  default or failure to satisfy  covenants or conditions,
we,  or  the  relevant  subsidiary,  would  seek  to  renegotiate  terms  of the
agreements  with the lenders.  No  assurances  can be given as to whether  these
efforts would be  successful.  This would have a material  adverse effect on our
financial condition,  results of operations and net cash flows, and those of our
subsidiaries.

In  addition,  our credit  agreements  and those of our  subsidiaries  generally
contain  provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the
event of a material  adverse change in the  borrower's  and, as may be relevant,
our, Energy Holdings',  Power's or PSE&G's business or financial  condition.  In
the  event  that we or the  lenders  in any of our or our  subsidiaries'  credit
agreements determine that a material adverse change has occurred, loan funds may
not be advanced.

Some of these  credit  agreements  also contain  maximum debt to equity  ratios,
minimum  cash flow  tests and other  restrictive  covenants  and  conditions  to
borrowing.  Compliance with applicable  financial covenants will depend upon our
future  financial  position and the level of earnings and cash flow, as to which
no assurances can be given.
<PAGE>
Our debt indentures and credit  agreements and those of our  subsidiaries do not
contain any material "ratings  triggers" that would cause an acceleration of the
required  interest and principal  payments in the event of a ratings  downgrade.
However, in the event of a downgrade,  we and/or our subsidiaries may be subject
to increased  interest costs on certain bank debt.  Also, in connection with its
energy trading business, Power must meet certain credit quality standards as are
required by  counterparties.  If Power loses its investment grade credit rating,
ER&T would have to provide  credit  support  (letters of credit or cash),  which
would  significantly  impact the energy trading  business.  These same contracts
provide  reciprocal  benefits  to Power.  Providing  this credit  support  would
increase  our costs of doing  business  and limit our  ability  to  successfully
conduct our energy  trading  operations.  In addition,  our  counterparties  may
require us to meet margin or other security  requirements which may include cash
payments.  Global and Energy Holdings may have to provide collateral for certain
of their  equity  commitments  if Energy  Holdings'  ratings  should  fall below
investment grade.  Similarly,  Power may also have to provide credit support for
certain of its equity commitments if Power loses its investment grade rating.

Credit Ratings

The current ratings of securities of PSEG and its  subsidiaries  are shown below
and  reflect  the  respective  views  of  the  rating  agencies,  from  whom  an
explanation of the  significance  of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no
assurance  that these ratings will continue for any given period of time or that

</TABLE>
As of June 30, 2002, our  consolidated  total  short-term  debt  outstanding was
$1.693 billion, including $744 million of commercial paper at PSEG, $279 million
of non-recourse short-term financing at Global and $349 million and $321 million
outstanding  under  credit  facilities  and  through the  uncommitted  bilateral
agreement at PSEG and Energy  Holdings,  respectively.  In  addition,  we have a
total of $1.415 billion of long-term debt due within one year, comprised of $973
million at PSE&G,  including $127 million related to Transition Funding and $442
million at Energy Holdings.

In the  ordinary  course of business,  we and our  subsidiaries  have  financial
commitments for debt  maturities and general  corporate  purposes.  On April 16,
2002,  we filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form S-3 for the issuance of
$1.5 billion of various debt and equity securities.  The registration  statement
was declared  effective by the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) on July
3, 2002. It is our intention to issue  securities  from this shelf  registration
before year-end. Due to our short-term liquidity needs and the timing of certain
preferred  equity,  equity-linked  and  long-term  debt  issuances  that  we are
contemplating,  we currently  have a  significant  reliance on  short-term  debt
financing, including the commercial paper markets, to meet our financing needs.

PSEG

In 2002,  we began  issuing  new  shares  under our  Dividend  Reinvestment  and
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (DRASPP),  rather than  purchasing them on the open
market.

<PAGE>
Dividend  payments on Common Stock for the quarter and six months ended June 30,
2002 were $0.54 and $1.08 per share and totaled  approximately  $111 million and
$223 million,  respectively.  Our dividend rate has remained constant since 1992
in order to retain additional  capital for reinvestment and to reduce the payout
ratio as earnings  grow.  Although we  presently  believe we will have  adequate
earnings and cash flow in the future from our  subsidiaries  to maintain  common
stock  dividends  at the  current  level,  earnings  and cash flows  required to
support the  dividend  will become more  volatile as our  business  continues to
change  from one  that  was  principally  regulated  to one that is  principally
competitive.  Future  dividends  declared will necessarily be dependent upon our
future  earnings,  cash  flows,  financial  requirements,  alternate  investment
opportunities  and other  factors.  We may consider  raising the dividend if our
payout ratio declined to 50% and could be sustained at that level.

We have issued Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures in connection with
the  issuance  of tax  deductible  preferred  securities.  If  payments on these
Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures are deferred,  in accordance with
their  terms,  we may not pay any  dividends  on its  common  stock  until  such
payments become current. Currently, there has been no deferral or default.

Financial covenants contained in our credit facilities include the ratio of debt
(excluding non-recourse project financings and securitization debt and including
commercial paper and loans,  certain letters of credit and similar  instruments)
to total capitalization. At the end of any quarterly financial period such ratio
shall  not be more  than  0.70 to 1. As of June 30,  2002,  the ratio of debt to
capitalization  was 0.682 to 1. This ratio can be  maintained  at this level for
the  remainder of the year,  absent any  preferred or common  equity  issuances.
However,  we currently plan to issue  equity-linked  securities before year-end,
which will lower this ratio.  Also, as part of our financial  planning forecast,
we perform  stress  tests on our  financial  covenants.  These  tests  include a
consideration  of the impacts of potential asset  impairments,  foreign currency
fluctuations and other items. Our current forecasts do not indicate that we will
exceed  the  required  ratio  of  debt to  total  capitalization  in our  credit
facilities,  even  if we do not  issue  any  preferred  stock  or  equity-linked
securities. However, no assurances can be given and, if an event of default were
to occur, it could  materially  impact our results of operations,  cash flow and
financial position.

On May 21, 2002, $275 million of Floating Rate Notes matured.

PSE&G

Under its  Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue  new First and  Refunding  Mortgage  Bonds
against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings
to fixed charges  calculated  in  accordance  with its Mortgage is at least 2:1,
and/or  against  retired  Mortgage  Bonds.  At June 30, 2002,  PSE&G's  Mortgage
coverage  ratio was 3:1. As of June 30, 2002,  the  Mortgage  would permit up to
approximately $1 billion aggregate  principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be
issued against  previous  additions and  improvements  and $204 million  against
retired mortgage bonds. PSE&G will need to obtain BPU authorization to issue any
financing  necessary for its capital  program,  including  refunding of maturing
debt and  opportunistic  refinancing.  PSE&G has  authorization  from the BPU to
issue $1 billion of long-term  debt through  December 31, 2003 for the refunding
of maturing debt and opportunistic refinancing of debt.

In December 2001, PSE&G filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the
issuance of $1 billion of debt and tax deferred preferred securities,  which was
declared effective by the SEC in February 2002.

Since 1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash payments to us in the form of dividends
on outstanding shares of PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G paid common stock dividends
of $150  million and $112  million to us for the six months  ended June 30, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

PSE&G has issued Deferrable Interest Subordinated  Debentures in connection with
the  issuance  of tax  deductible  preferred  securities.  If  payments on those
Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures are deferred,  in accordance with
their terms,  PSE&G may not pay any  dividends on its common or preferred  stock
until such default is cured. Currently, there has been no deferral or default.
<PAGE>
Power

Power's  short-term  financing  needs  will be met  using our  commercial  paper
program or lines of credit discussed above.

In June 2002,  Power  issued $600 million of 6.95%  Senior  Unsecured  Notes due
2012.  The proceeds  were used to repay  short-term  funding from us,  including
amounts related to the Gas Contract Transfer from PSE&G in May 2002.

Energy Holdings

As of June 30, 2002,  Energy Holdings had two separate senior  revolving  credit
facilities  with a  syndicate  of banks as  discussed  in the table  above.  The
five-year  facility permits up to $250 million of letters of credit to be issued
of which $12 million are outstanding as of June 30, 2002.

Financial covenants contained in these facilities include the ratio of cash flow
available for debt service (CFADS) to fixed charges. At the end of any quarterly
financial period such ratio shall not be less than 1.50x for the 12-month period
then ending.  As a condition of borrowing,  the pro-forma CFADS to fixed charges
ratio shall not be less than 1.75x as of the quarterly  financial  period ending
immediately  following  the first  anniversary  of each  borrowing  or letter of
credit  issuance.  CFADS includes,  but is not limited to, operating cash before
interest and taxes,  pre-tax cash  distributions from all asset liquidations and
equity  capital  contributions  from us to the extent not used to fund investing
activity.  In  addition,  the ratio of  consolidated  recourse  indebtedness  to
recourse capitalization,  as at the end of any quarterly financial period, shall
not be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. This ratio is calculated by dividing the total
recourse  indebtedness of Energy Holdings by the total recourse  capitalization.
This ratio  excludes the debt of PSEG  Capital,  which is supported by us. As of
June 30, 2002,  the latest 12 months CFADS  coverage ratio was 4.8 and the ratio
of recourse indebtedness to recourse capitalization was 0.50 to 1.0.

PSEG Capital has a $650 million  Medium-Term Note program which provides for the
private  placement  of Medium-Term  Notes.  This  Medium-Term Note  program is
supported by a minimum net worth maintenance  agreement between PSEG Capital and
us which  provides,  among other  things,  that we (1) maintain  its  ownership,
directly or indirectly,  of all  outstanding  common stock of PSEG Capital,  (2)
cause  PSEG  Capital to have at all times a  positive  tangible  net worth of at
least $100,000 and (3) make  sufficient  contributions  of liquid assets to PSEG
Capital in order to permit it to pay its debt obligations. We will eliminate our
support of PSEG Capital debt by the second  quarter of 2003,  as required by the
Focused Audit.  At June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,  total debt  outstanding
under  the  Medium-Term  Note  program  was  $382  million  and  $480  million,
respectively.

In June 2002, $98 million of PSEG Capital Corp. Medium-Term Notes matured. These
Medium-Term  Notes were refunded with proceeds from a private  placement of $135
million which  reopened the 8.625% Series of Energy  Holdings Notes due February
2008.

In July 2002,  an  additional  $100 million of PSEG Capital MTNs with an average
borrowing  rate of 6.95%  matured.  These MTNs were  refunded with proceeds from
borrowings  under Energy Holdings bank facilities with current interest costs of
approximately 2.7%.

Remaining  maturities  under  the PSEG  Capital  Corp  program  are $30  million
maturing in October  2002 and $252  million  maturing in May 2003.  These issues
will be refunded with  proceeds of  borrowings at Energy  Holdings and cash from
operations.

Capital Requirements

Power's capital needs will be dictated by its strategy to continue to develop as
a profitable,  growth-oriented  supplier in the wholesale power market.  PSE&G's
construction  expenditures  are primarily to maintain the safety and reliability
of its electric and gas  transmission and  distribution  facilities.  We plan to
continue the growth of Resources. Global has refocused its strategy, from one of
accelerated  growth to one that places emphasis on increasing the efficiency and
returns of its existing assets.
<PAGE>
Our subsidiaries have substantial commitments as part of their growth strategies
and  ongoing  construction  programs.  We  expect  that  the  majority  of  each
subsidiaries'  capital  requirements  over the next  five  years  will come from
internally  generated funds,  with the balance to be provided by the issuance of
debt at the  subsidiary  or  project  level and  equity  contributions  from us.
Projected construction and investment  expenditures for our subsidiaries for the
next five years are as follows:

</TABLE>
Approximately 90% of the forecasted  expenditures related to Energy Holdings are
discretionary.  The majority of Energy Holdings forecasted capital  expenditures
relate to Resources, pursuant to the shift in Global's strategy to limit capital
expenditures  over the next 18 to 24 months to current  contractual  commitments
and shift their focus to increasing  the  efficiency and returns of its existing
assets.

For the six months  ended June 30,  2002,  we made net plant  additions  of $888
million.  The majority of these additions,  $496 million,  primarily  related to
Power for developing the Lawrenceburg,  Indiana,  Waterford, Ohio and Bethlehem,
NY (Albany) sites and adding  capacity to the Bergen and Linden  stations in New
Jersey.  In addition,  PSE&G had net plant  additions of $196 million related to
improvements in its transmission and distribution  system, gas system and common
facilities.  Also,  Energy  Holdings'  subsidiaries  made  investments  totaling
approximately $359 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002, respectively.
These investments include an approximate 50% interest of a coal-fired generation
facility,  currently under construction in Poland, and additional investments in
existing  generation  and  distribution  facilities  and  projects by Global and
investment  in  capital  leases  by  Resources.   Partially   offsetting   these
investments  was an $88 million loan repayment from TIE. For a discussion of the
loans to TIE, see Note 12. Related Party  Transactions.  The $874 million of net
plant additions and $359 million of investments  were included in our forecasted
expenditures for the year.

Accounting Matters and Note 6. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Other Accounting Matters

Our most critical  accounting  policies  include the  application of SFAS No. 71
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71) for PSE&G,
our regulated transmission and distribution business; Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF)  98-10,  "Accounting  for Contracts  Involved in Energy  Trading and Risk
Management Activities" (EITF 98-10) and EITF 99-19,  "Reporting Revenue Gross as
a  Principal  versus  Net as an Agent"  (EITF  99-19),  for our  Energy  Trading
business;  SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities",  as  amended  (SFAS  133),  to  account  for  our  various  hedging
transactions;  SFAS  52,  "Foreign  Currency  Translation"  and its  impacts  on
Global's  foreign  investments;  and SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 and  their  potential
impacts on our various investments.

<PAGE>
Accounting for the Effects of Regulation
- ----------------------------------------

PSE&G  prepares its financial  statements in accordance  with the  provisions of
SFAS No. 71, which differs in certain  respects from the  application of GAAP by
non-regulated  businesses.  In general,  SFAS 71 recognizes  that accounting for
rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As
a result,  a regulated  utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a
regulatory asset) or the recognition of obligations (a regulatory  liability) if
it  is  probable  that,  through  the  rate-making  process,  there  will  be  a
corresponding  increase  or  decrease in future  rates.  Accordingly,  PSE&G has
deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods.  To
the extent that  collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer
probable  as a result  of  changes  in  regulation  and/or  PSE&G's  competitive
position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to
income.

As a result of New Jersey deregulation  legislation and regulatory orders issued
by the BPU,  certain  regulatory  assets and liabilities  were recorded.  Two of
these items will have a significant effect on our annual earnings.  They include
the estimated amount of MTC revenues to be collected in excess of the authorized
amount  of  $540  million  and  the  amount  of  excess  electric   distribution
depreciation reserves.

     The MTC was  authorized by the BPU as an  opportunity to recover up to $540
million (net of tax) of our unsecuritized generation-related stranded costs on a
net  present  value  basis.  As a result of the  appellate  reviews of the Final
Order, PSE&G's securitization transaction was delayed until the first quarter of
2001,  causing a delay in the  implementation of the  Securitization  Transition
Charge  (STC)  which  would have  reduced  the MTC.  As a result,  MTC was being
recovered at a faster rate than intended under the Final Order and a significant
overrecovery  was probable.  In order to properly  recognize the recovery of the
allowed unsecuritized  stranded costs over the transition period, PSE&G recorded
a regulatory liability and Power recorded a charge to net income of $88 million,
pre-tax,  or $52  million,  after  tax,  in the  third  quarter  of 2000 for the
cumulative   amount  of   estimated   collections   in  excess  of  the  allowed
unsecuritized  stranded  costs from August 1, 1999 through  September  30, 2000.
PSE&G then began  deferring a portion of these  revenues each month to recognize
the estimated collections in excess of the allowed unsecuritized stranded costs.
As of June 30, 2002,  this  deferred  amount was $185 million and is  aggregated
with the  Societal  Benefits  Clause.  After  deferrals,  pre-tax  MTC  revenues
recognized  were $220 million in 1999, $239 million in 2000, and $196 million in
2001.

The  amortization  of the Excess  Depreciation  Reserve  is another  significant
regulatory  liability  affecting  our  earnings.  As required by the BPU,  PSE&G
reduced its depreciation  reserve for its electric  distribution  assets by $569
million and recorded such amount as a regulatory  liability to be amortized over
the period from  January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.  Through June 30, 2002,  $324
million had been amortized and recorded as a reduction of  depreciation  expense
pursuant to the Final Order, of which $74 million relates to 2002. The remaining
$245 million will be amortized through July 31, 2003.

See Note 5. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities of Notes for further discussion of
these and other regulatory issues.

Accounting, Valuation and Presentation of Our Energy Trading Business
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounting - We account for our energy trading  business in accordance  with the
provisions of EITF 98-10, which requires that energy trading contracts be marked
to market with gains and losses included in current earnings.

Valuation - Since the  majority of our energy  trading  contracts  have terms of
less than two years,  valuations for these contracts are readily obtainable from
the  market  exchanges,  such as PJM,  and  over  the  counter  quotations.  The
valuations  also  include a credit  reserve  and a liquidity  reserve,  which is
determined using financial quotation systems,  monthly bid-ask prices and spread
percentages.  We have consistently  applied this valuation  methodology for each
reporting  period  presented.  The fair  values  of these  contracts  and a more
detailed   discussion  of  credit  risk  are  reflected  in  Note  7.  Financial
Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management.

<PAGE>
Presentation  - EITF 99-19  provided  guidance on the issue of whether a company
should  report  revenue  based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the
net amount retained. The guidance states that whether a company should recognize
revenue  based  on  the  gross  amount  billed  or  the  net  retained  requires
significant  judgment,  which depends on the relevant  facts and  circumstances.
Based on the analysis  and  interpretation  of EITF 99-19,  we report all of the
energy trading  revenues and energy  trading-related  costs on a gross basis for
physical  bilateral  energy and capacity sales and  purchases.  We report swaps,
futures,  option premiums,  firm transmission  rights,  transmission  congestion
credits,  and purchases and sales of emission  allowances on a net basis. One of
the  primary  drivers  of our  determination  that  these  contracts  should  be
presented on a gross basis was that we retain  counterparty  risk.  Beginning in
the third quarter of 2002, we will report all energy trading revenues and energy
trading costs on a net basis under EITF 02-3.  For additional  information,  see
Note 2. Accounting Matters.

SFAS 133 - Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

SFAS  133  established   accounting  and  reporting   standards  for  derivative
instruments,   including  certain  derivative   instruments  embedded  in  other
contracts,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires an entity to recognize the
fair  value of  derivative  instruments  held as  assets or  liabilities  on the
balance sheet. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective  portion of the change
in the fair value of a derivative  instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is
reported in OCI, net of tax, or as a Regulatory  Asset  (Liability).  Amounts in
accumulated  OCI are  ultimately  recognized in earnings when the related hedged
forecasted  transaction  occurs. The change in the fair value of the ineffective
portion of the derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded
in earnings.  Derivative instruments that have not been designated as hedges are
adjusted to fair value through earnings. We have entered into several derivative
instruments,  including  hedges  of  anticipated  electric  and  gas  purchases,
interest rate swaps and foreign  currency  hedges which have been  designated as
cash flow hedges.

The fair value of the  derivative  instruments  is  determined  by  reference to
quoted market prices, listed contracts,  published quotations or quotations from
counterparties.  In the absence thereof, we utilize mathematical models based on
current  and  historical  data.  The fair  value of most of our  derivatives  is
determined based upon quoted market prices. Therefore, the effect on earnings of
valuations from our models is minimal.

     Prior to May 2002,  PSE&G had entered into gas forwards,  futures,  options
and  swaps to hedge its  forecasted  requirements  for  natural  gas,  which was
required  under  an  agreement  with  the BPU in  2001.  Effective  with the gas
contract  transfer  on May 1,  2002,  we also  acquired  all of the  derivatives
entered into by PSE&G. We account for these derivative instruments pertaining to
residential  customers  in a similar  manner as PSE&G did.  Gains or losses from
these derivatives will be recovered from PSE&G's customers. Derivatives relating
to commercial and industrial  customers will be accounted for in accordance with
SFAS  133,  where  appropriate.  Gains or losses  on these  derivatives  will be
deferred  and  reported  as a  component  of OCI.  The  accumulated  OCI will be
reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged  transaction  affects
earnings.

7.  Financial  Instruments, Energy  Trading  and Risk  Management  -  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities of Notes.

SFAS 52 - Foreign Currency Translation
- --------------------------------------

Our  financial  statements  are prepared  using the $US Dollar as the  reporting
currency.  In accordance with SFAS 52 "Foreign  Currency  Translation",  foreign
operations  whose  functional  currency  is  deemed  to be the  local  (foreign)
currency,  asset and  liability  accounts  are  translated  into $US  Dollars at
current  exchange  rates and revenues and  expenses  are  translated  at average
exchange rates prevailing  during the period.  Translation gains and losses (net
of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining net income but are
reported  in other  comprehensive  income.  Gains  and  losses  on  transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the
results of operations as incurred.

The  determination  of an entity's  functional  currency  requires  management's
judgment.  It is  based  on an  assessment  of the  primary  currency  in  which
transactions  in the local  environment  are  conducted,  and  whether the local
currency can be relied upon as a stable  currency in which to conduct  business.
As economic  and  business  conditions  change,  we are required to reassess the
economic  environment and determine the  appropriate  functional  currency.  The
impact of  foreign  currency  accounting  has had and could  continue  to have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation and net
cash flows.

<PAGE>
Accounting for the Effects of Goodwill
- --------------------------------------

Our 2002 earnings have been materially  impacted by the application of SFAS 142.
This new  standard,  effective  January 1, 2002,  requires the  existence of any
goodwill  impairment  be  disclosed  in the second  quarter and  recorded by the
fourth quarter of 2002,  applied  retroactively to the first quarter.  The basic
difference  between previous  accounting  guidance and this new standard is that
the new  standard  allows  for  certain  valuation  methodologies  to  test  for
impairment, including a discounted cash flow method, compared to an undiscounted
cash flow method which was utilized  under the previous  standard.  The new test
must be completed  using data as of January 1, 2002. Any amounts  impaired using
data as of that date will be recorded as a  "Cumulative  Effect of an Accounting
Change".  Any amounts  impaired  under the new test using data after the initial
adoption date will be recorded in Operating  Expenses.  The discounted cash flow
tests  require broad  assumptions  and  significant  judgment to be exercised by
management.  This includes  projections  of future  commodity  prices,  customer
rates, customer demand,  operating costs, rate relief from regulators,  customer
growth  and  many  other  items.  While we  believe  that  our  assumptions  are
reasonable, actual results will likely differ from our projections.

We have  finalized  our  evaluation  of the effect of  adopting  SFAS 142 on the
recorded  amount of our  goodwill.  For further  detail  regarding  the goodwill
impairments  noted  above,  see Note 2.  Accounting  Matters  and Note 3.  Asset
Impairments.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

On  January 1, 2002 we adopted  SFAS No.  144,  "Accounting  for  Impairment  or
Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" (SFAS 144).  The impact of adopting SFAS 144 did
not have an effect on our financial position and statement of operations.  Under
SFAS 144,  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of are  measured  at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell,  whether reported in continued
operations or in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations will no longer
be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that
have not yet  occurred.  SFAS 144 also  broadens the  reporting of  discontinued
operations.  A long-lived asset must be tested for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances  indicate that its carrying amount may be impaired. For
further detail on charges taken in the second quarter of 2002, see Note 3. Asset
Impairments and Note 4. Discontinued Operations.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive  instruments and positions
is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency  exchange
rates, commodity prices, equity security prices, and interest rates as discussed
in the notes to the financial  statements.  Our policy is to use  derivatives to
manage risk consistent with our business plans and prudent practices.  We have a
Risk  Management  Committee  comprised of executive  officers  which utilizes an
independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies
and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Contracts

The  availability  and price of energy  commodities  are subject to fluctuations
from  factors  such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in supply and
demand,  state and federal regulatory policies and other events. To reduce price
risk  caused  by  market  fluctuations,  we  enter  into  derivative  contracts,
including forwards, futures, swaps and options with approved counterparties,  to
hedge our  anticipated  demand.  These  contracts,  in  conjunction  with  owned
electric generation capacity,  are designed to cover estimated electric customer
commitments.

We use a  value-at-risk  (VAR) model to assess the market risk of our  commodity
business.  This model includes  fixed price sales  commitments  (BGS  contract),
owned generation,  native load  requirements,  physical  contracts and financial
derivative  instruments.  VAR  represents  the  potential  gains or  losses  for
instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time
period and  confidence  level.  We  estimate  VAR using a model with  historical
volatilities and correlations.

Our Board of Directors  has  established  a VAR Threshold of $75 million and the
Risk Management Committee (RMC) has established an internal VAR threshold of $50
million and a trip limit of $40 million for Power. If the $50 million  threshold
was  reached,  the RMC would be  notified  and the  portfolio  would be  closely
monitored to reduce risk and potential adverse movements.

The measured VAR using a variance/co-variance  model with a 95% confidence level
and assuming a one-week time horizon as of June 30, 2002 was  approximately  $25
million,  compared  to the  December  31,  2001 level of $18  million  which was
calculated using various controls and  conservative  assumptions,  such as a 50%
success rate in the BGS Auction.

Credit Risk

Counterparties  expose us to credit  losses in the event of  non-performance  or
non-payment.  We have a  credit  management  process  which  is used to  assess,
monitor and mitigate counterparty  exposure for us and our subsidiaries.  In the
event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty,  there may be a
material  adverse  impact  on our and  our  subsidiaries'  financial  condition,
results of  operations  or net cash  flows.  As of June 30, 2002 over 97% of the
credit  exposure (mark to market plus net  receivables and payables) for Power's
trading business was with investment grade counterparties.  As of June 30, 2002,
Power's trading business had over 80 active counterparties.
<PAGE>
Credit  risk  relates  to the risk of loss  that we would  incur as a result  of
non-performance  by  counterparties  pursuant to the terms of their  contractual
obligations.  We have established credit policies that we believe  significantly
minimize  credit  risk.  These  policies  include  an  evaluation  of  potential
counterparties'  financial  condition  (including  credit  rating),   collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements,
which may allow for the netting of positive  and negative  exposures  associated
with a single counterparty.

As a result of the BGS  auction,  Power has  contracted  to  provide  generating
capacity to the direct  suppliers of New Jersey  electric  utilities,  including
PSE&G,  commencing  August 1, 2002.  These  bilateral  contracts  are subject to
credit risk. This credit risk relates to the ability of  counterparties  to meet
their payment obligations for the power delivered under each BGS contract.  This
risk is substantially  higher than the risk associated with potential nonpayment
by PSE&G  under  the BGS  contract  expiring  July  31,  2002  since  PSE&G is a
rate-regulated  entity.  Any failure to collect these payments under the new BGS
contracts could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows,
and financial position.

     Resources  also has credit risk  related to its  investments  in  leveraged
leases, which totaled  approximately $1.6 billion, net of deferred taxes of $1.3
billion,  as of June 30, 2002. These investments are significantly  concentrated
in the energy related  industry and have some exposure to the airline  industry.
Although over 86% of its investments are with investment  grade  counterparties,
recent  events in the industry have  pressured the credit  ratings of several of
the members of the industry,  including  certain of our  counterparties in these
leveraged  lease  investments.   The  largest  non-investment  grade  leases  in
Resources'  portfolio  are with Dynegy Inc.,  whose  credit  rating was recently
downgraded  to below  investment  grade.  As of June 30,  2002,  the leases with
Dynegy had a gross investment balance of approximately $161 million.  In many of
these  investments,  Resources has protected its equity  investment by providing
for the direct right to assume the debt obligation.  Debt assumption would be at
Resources' sole discretion, and normally only would occur if an appraisal of the
leased  property  yielded a value that  exceeds  the  present  value of the debt
outstanding.  Should Resources ever directly assume a debt obligation,  the fair
value of the underlying  asset and the associated  debt would be recorded on the
balance sheet instead of the net equity  investment in the lease.  In the events
described above, the lease would  essentially  change from being classified as a
capital lease to a conventional  operating lease. As of June 30, 2002, Resources
determined  that the  collectibility  of the minimum  lease  payments  under its
leveraged  lease  investments  is still  reasonably  predictable  and  therefore
continues to account for these investments as leveraged leases.

Foreign Operations

As of June 30, 2002, Global and Resources had  approximately  $2.870 billion and
$1.425 billion,  respectively,  of  international  assets.  As of June 30, 2002,
foreign  assets  represented  17% of our  consolidated  assets and the  revenues
related to those foreign assets contributed 6% to consolidated  revenues for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2002. For  discussion of foreign  currency
risk and asset impairments related to our investments in Argentina,  see Note 3.

Certain  information  reported  under PSEG's 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K and
Amended  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 is
updated  below.  References  are to the related  pages on the Form 10-K and Form
10-Q/A as printed and distributed.

<PAGE>
Affiliate Standards

Form  10-K,  page 15. On  February  8, 2002 and March 27,  2002,  the BPU issued
orders  adopting the Competitive  Service Audit reports on the state's  electric
and gas  utilities.  The audit  report  generally  concluded  that  PSE&G was in
compliance   with  the  BPU's   affiliate   standards,   and  the  BPU   ordered
implementation  of 24 of the auditor's  recommendations,  to which PSE&G did not
specifically  object.  On July 1,  2002,  PSE&G  filed its  Affiliate  Standards
compliance plan in accord with the BPU's regulations. Also in July 2002, the BPU
commenced  its next regular  audit of the state's  electric  and gas  utilities'
competitive activities.  The audit is expected to continue through the Spring of
2003.

Gas Contract Transfer

Form 10-K, page 16. On August 11, 2000, PSE&G filed a gas merchant restructuring
plan with the BPU. The BPU approved an amended stipulation, which authorized the
transfer of PSE&G's gas supply  business,  including  its  interstate  capacity,
storage  and gas supply  contracts  to ER&T  which  will,  under a  requirements
contract,  provide  gas  supply to PSE&G to serve its Basic Gas  Supply  Service
(BGSS)  customers.  On April 17, 2002, the BPU issued the final order  approving
the transfer of PSE&G's gas supply business,  including its interstate capacity,
storage and gas supply contracts to ER&T. ER&T entered into a BGSS contract with
PSE&G as required  under the above BPU order.  The transfer took place on May 1,
2002 at the book value of  approximately  $183 million.  The initial term of the
contract  ends on March 31, 2004 and PSE&G has the option to extend the term for
an  additional  three years.  Under this  agreement,  ER&T will provide the full
requirements  needed  by PSE&G to render  service  under  its BGSS  tariff  rate
schedules.

     On May 1,  2002,  the New  Jersey  Ratepayer  Advocate  filed a motion  for
reconsideration  of the BPU's  approval of the transfer.  PSE&G has opposed this
motion. This matter is currently pending before the BPU.

The gas  contract  transfer  is expected to reduce  volatility  in PSE&G's  cash
flows;  however,  ER&T will bear the increased  commodity  risk. Gas residential
commodity costs are currently  recovered through PSE&G's adjustment clauses that
are  periodically  trued-up to actual  costs and reset.  Effective  with the gas
contract  transfer,  PSE&G  pays  ER&T for gas  provided  to  PSE&G  for its gas
distribution customers.  Industrial and commercial BGSS customers will be priced
under PSE&G's Market Priced Gas Service (MPGS).  Residential BGSS customers will
remain  under  current  pricing  until April 1, 2004,  after  which,  subject to
further BPU approval  those  residential  gas customers  would also move to MPGS
service.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

Form  10-K,  page 26.  Under  the NWPA,  the DOE was  required  to begin  taking
possession of all spent nuclear fuel generated by our nuclear units for disposal
by no later than 1998. DOE construction of a permanent disposal facility has not
begun and DOE has  announced  that it does not expect a facility to be available
earlier than 2010.

In February  2002,  President Bush announced that Yucca Mountain in Nevada would
be the permanent  disposal facility for nuclear wastes. On July 9, 2002 Congress
affirmed the President's decision.  The DOE must still license and construct the
facility. No assurances can be given regarding the final outcome of this matter.
<PAGE>
Con Edison Complaint

     March 31,  2002 Form 10-Q,  Page 44. On  November  15,  2001,  Consolidated
Edison,  Inc. (Con Edison)  filed a complaint  against PSE&G at FERC pursuant to
Section  206  of the  Federal  Power  Act  asserting  that  PSE&G  had  breached
agreements  covering 1,000 MW of transmission by curtailing  service and failing
to  maintain   sufficient   system  capacity  to  satisfy  all  of  its  service
obligations.  PSE&G denied the  allegations  set forth in the  complaint.  While
finding that Con Edison's presentation of evidence failed to demonstrate several
of the  allegations  in April  2002,  FERC  found  sufficient  reason to set the
complaint for hearing. An initial decision issued by an administrative law judge
in April  2002  upheld  PSE&G's  claim that the  contracts  do not  require  the
provision  of "firm"  transmission  service to Con Edison but also  accepted Con
Edison's  contentions  that PSE&G was obligated to provide service to Con Edison
utilizing  all  the  facilities   comprising  its  electrical  system  including
generation   facilities  and  that  PSE&G  was   financially   responsible   for
above-market  generation  costs needed to  effectuate  the desired  power flows.
Under FERC  procedures,  an  administrative  law judge  initial  decision is not
binding unless and until its findings have been approved by FERC.  PSE&G filed a
brief  taking  exception  to the adverse  findings of the April 25, 2002. A FERC
decision  concerning the findings of the April 25, 2002 was expected on July 31,
2002.  Settlement  discussions between the companies with respect to this matter
have been on-going and, on July 17, 2002,  representatives  of the companies met
for settlement discussions mediated by a FERC administrative law judge. Based on
progress made at these discussions, Con Edison sought to extend the date for the
issuance of the FERC decision addressing the April 25, 2002 initial decision and
to extend the date for the  commencement  of a hearing with respect to issues in
the case not addressed by the April 25, 2002 initial  decision.  At present,  in
the event the dispute is not settled, the FERC decision is expected on September
11, 2002 and the hearing  before the  administrative  law judge will commence in
October   2002.   The   findings  in  the  April  25,  2002   initial   decision
notwithstanding, PSE&G believes it has complied with the terms of the Agreements
and will  vigorously  defend its  position.  The nature and cost of any  remedy,
which is expected to be prospective only, cannot be predicted.  Further, even in
the event  settlement is reached with Con Edison,  PSE&G could still be required
to bear substantial levels of additional costs.

Electric Base Rate Case

New Matter.  On May 24, 2002, PSE&G filed an electric rate case with the BPU. In
this  filing,  PSE&G  requested  an annual $250  million  rate  increase for our
electric distribution business. The proposed rate increase includes $187 million
of increased  revenues relating to a $1.7 billion increase in PSE&G's rate base,
which is  primarily  due to the  investment  that PSE&G has made in its electric
distribution  facilities since the last rate case in 1992; $18 million in higher
depreciation  rates and $45 million to recover various other  expenses,  such as
wages, fringe benefits,  and the need to enhance the security and reliability of
the electric  distribution  system.  The requested increase proposes a return on
equity of 11.75% for our electric distribution business.

Assuming  current cost levels and a normal  business  environment,  the proposed
rate increase would significantly  impact our earnings and operating cash flows.
The  non-depreciation  portion of the rate increase  ($232 million) would have a
positive effect our earnings and operating cash flows. The depreciation  portion
of the rate increase ($18 million) would have no impact on our earnings,  as the
increased operating cash flows would be offset by higher depreciation charges.

In accordance with BPU'S Final Order,  which  implemented  parts of New Jersey's
Electric  Discount and  Competition  Act, PSE&G was required to reduce  electric
rates in four steps totaling 13.9% during the four year transition  period.  The
last step, a 4.9%  decrease,  will take effect August 1, 2002. If approved,  the
proposed  rate  increase  would be  effective  August  1,  2003,  the end of the
transition  period.  While the proposed rate increase  would  increase  electric
distribution  rates by 12.8% from the July 31,  2003 level,  rates would  remain
2.6% lower than the levels in April 1999,  when the BPU issued its Final  Order.
We cannot predict the outcome of these rate proceedings at the current time.

NUG Contract Amendments

New  Matter.  On June 5,  2002,  PSE&G  amended  its NUG  contract  with El Paso
Merchant  Energy.  Under federal law, PSE&G and other utilities were required to
enter into long-term NUG contracts with cogeneration facilities. PSE&G sells the
electricity  it  purchases  under  these  contracts  to Power at the  Locational
Marginal Price (LMP) in the Pennyslvania-New  Jersey-Maryland  Power Pool (PJM).
Any  difference  between  the  amounts it pays under the NUG  Contracts  and the
amount it recovers through the Non-Utility  Generation  Transition  Charge (NTC)
and sales at LMP are  deferred as a  regulatory  asset or  liability.  Under the
amended  contract,  PSE&G  received  $102 million in return for allowing El Paso
Merchant Energy to provide electric energy and capacity from the open market, in
addition to their existing  plant.  This amount will be passed back to customers
through the NTC and was recorded as a regulatory liability.

Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund

Form 10-K,  page 27. In accordance  with the EPAct,  domestic  entities that own
nuclear  generating  stations  are  required to pay into a  decontamination  and
decommissioning   fund,  based  on  their  past  purchases  of  U.S.  government
enrichment services.  Along with other nuclear generator owners, PSEG filed suit
in the U.S. Court of Claims and in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York to recover these costs.  In July 2002,  PSEG withdrew from this lawsuit
without  prejudice,  due to an  unfavorable  decision  against  another  nuclear
generator owner in the lawsuit.

FERC Order related to PJM Restructuring

New Matter:  Atlantic  City Electric  Co., et al. v. Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission.  On July 12, 2002, the United States Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit,
issued an opinion in favor of PSE&G and the other utility petitioners, reversing
an order of the FERC relating to the  restructuring  of PJM into an  Independent
System  Operator.  The Court  agreed with  PSE&G's  position and ruled that FERC
lacks authority to require the utility owners to give up their statutory  rights
under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  Hence,  FERC was wrong to require a
modification to the PJM ISO Agreement  eliminating  their rights to file changes
to rate design.  The court further noted that FERC lacks authority under Section
203 of the Federal Power Act to require the utility owners to obtain approval of
their withdrawal from the PJM ISO. Hence, FERC had no right under Section 203 to
eliminate the withdrawal rights to which the utilities had agreed.  Further,  as
to PSE&G's situation, FERC could not accomplish a generic existing precedent, it
was first necessary to make a particularized  finding with respect to the public
interest,  which was not done here.  This decision could be subject to an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court by the respondents, including the FERC.

(A)  The term  "earnings"  shall be defined  as pretax  income  from  continuing
     operations.   Add  to  pretax  income  the  amount  of  fixed  charges  and
     distributed  income from equity  investees and losses from equity investees
     adjusted to exclude (a) the amount of any interest  capitalized  during the
     period  (b)  the  actual  amount  of  any  preferred   securities  dividend
     requirements of majority-owned subsidiaries,  (c) preferred stock dividends
     which were  included in such fixed  charges  amount but not deducted in the
     determination of pretax income, and (d) income from equity investees.

(B)  Fixed Charges represent (a) interest, whether expensed or capitalized,  (b)
     amortization  of debt  discount,  premium and  expense,  (c) an estimate of
     interest  implicit  in  rentals,  and  (d)  preferred  securities  dividend
     requirements of subsidiaries  and preferred stock  dividends,  increased to
     reflect the pre-tax  earnings  requirement  for Public  Service  Enterprise
     Group Incorporated.

(C)  The ratio of  Earnings to Fixed  Charges for the six months  ended June 30,
     2002 was 0.70,  as noted  above,  which  represents  a  deficiency  of $142
     million.
