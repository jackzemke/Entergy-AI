                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation/Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

     The consolidated  financial  statements  included herein have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission
(SEC).  Certain information and note disclosures  normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  However,
in the  opinion  of  management,  the  disclosures  are  adequate  to  make  the
information  presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements
and  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  (Notes)  should  be read in
conjunction with the  Registrant's  Notes contained in the 1998 Annual Report on
Form 10-K,  the Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31,
1999 and June 30, 1999 and the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed March 18, 1999,
April 26, 1999, July 21, 1999, September 15, 1999 and October 14, 1999.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were
derived from the audited consolidated  financial statements included in the 1998
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications of prior period data have
been made to conform with the current presentation.

     The presentation of revenues on the  Consolidated  Statements of Income has
changed,  effective  August 1, 1999,  due to the  deregulation  of the  electric
generation business by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities' (BPU) in Public
Service Electric and Gas Company's  (PSE&G) rate unbundling,  stranded costs and
restructuring  proceedings.  Effective with that date, electric rates charged to
ratepayers  have been unbundled and the generation,  transmission,  distribution
and other  components  of the total  rate have  become  separate  charges.  As a
result,  the  presentation  of revenues  has also  changed.  PSE&G's  generation
business  earns  revenues by  providing  the energy and capacity to meet PSE&G's
basic generation service (BGS) obligation. Generation revenues are also produced
by a variety  of  wholesale  energy  and  capacity  sales  and  other  ancillary
services. PSE&G's transmission and distribution businesses remain rate regulated
and will  continue to earn revenues  based on PSE&G's  tariffs under which PSE&G
provides transmission and distribution services for its residential,  commercial
and industrial  customers in New Jersey.  The rates charged for transmission and
distribution are regulated by the Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)
and the BPU,  respectively.  Transmission  and  distribution  revenues  are also
generated  from a variety of other  activities  such as sundry sales,  wholesale
transmission services and other miscellaneous services. Revenues earned prior to
August 1, 1999  continue to be  presented  as Bundled  Electric  revenues on the
Consolidated  Statements  of Income  as they  were  earned  based  upon  bundled
electric rates prior to the  deregulation of PSE&G's  generation  business.  For
more information on deregulation and PSE&G's rate unbundling, stranded costs and
restructuring  proceedings,  including the BPU's Final Decision and Order (Final
Order), see Note 2. Regulatory Issues.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Effective April 1, 1999, PSE&G discontinued the application of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of  Regulation"  (SFAS 71),  for the  electric  generation  portion of its
business.   PSE&G  calculated  an  extraordinary   charge  consistent  with  the
requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 97-4,  "Deregulation
of the  Pricing  of  Electricity  - Issues  Related to the  Application  of FASB
Statements   No.  71  and  No.  101"  (EITF  97-4)  and  SFAS  101,   "Regulated
Enterprises--Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of FASB Statement
No. 71" (SFAS  101).  The  portion  of the  extraordinary  charge  related to an
impairment of  long-lived  assets was  calculated  in accordance  with SFAS 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121). The  discontinuation  of the  application of SFAS 71

<PAGE>
had a material impact on Public Service Enterprise Group  Incorporated's  (PSEG)
and  PSE&G's  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.   For  further
discussion,  see Note 2. Regulatory Issues and Note 3. Extraordinary  Charge and
Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation.  PSE&G's transmission and distribution
businesses,  which continue to be regulated,  continue to meet the  requirements
for the application of SFAS 71.

     In concert with the  discontinuation  of SFAS 71, PSE&G revised a number of
accounting policies related to its  generation-related  capital assets.  Under a
revised  capitalization  policy, PSE&G will only capitalize costs which increase
the capacity or extend the life of an existing asset, represent a newly acquired
or constructed  asset or represent the  replacement of a retired asset.  Under a
revised depreciation policy, PSE&G will calculate  depreciation  consistent with
revised asset lives  determined  by PSE&G policy rather than using  depreciation
rates prescribed by the BPU in rate proceedings.  Finally, under a revised asset
retirement  policy,  the portion of future retirements which have not been fully
depreciated will impact earnings.

     In the past, fuel revenue and expense flowed through the Electric Levelized
Energy  Adjustment  Clause  (LEAC)  mechanism and variances in fuel revenues and
expenses  were  subject  to  deferral  accounting  and had no  direct  effect on
earnings.  Due to the  discontinuation  of the LEAC mechanism on August 1, 1999,
earnings  volatility  will increase since the  unregulated  electric  generation
portion of PSEG's business ceased to follow deferral accounting. PSE&G now bears
the full risks and  rewards of changes  in nuclear  and fossil  generating  fuel
costs  and  replacement  power  costs.  For  further  discussion,  see  Note  4.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.

     Effective  January 1, 1999, PSEG and PSE&G adopted EITF 98-10,  "Accounting
for Contracts  Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management  Activities" (EITF
98-10).  EITF 98-10 requires that energy  trading  contracts be marked to market
with gains and losses  included  in earnings  and  separately  disclosed  in the
financial statements or footnotes.  Previously,  the gains and losses associated
with these contracts were recorded upon  settlement.  The adoption of EITF 98-10
did not have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations
or net cash flows of PSEG or PSE&G.

     Effective  January 1, 1999,  PSEG and PSE&G  adopted  Statement of Position
(SOP) 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained
for Internal Use" (SOP 98-1),  which provides criteria for capitalizing  certain
internal-use  software  costs.  The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a material
impact on the  financial  condition,  results of operations or net cash flows of
PSEG or PSE&G.

     Effective  January 1, 1999, PSEG and PSE&G adopted SOP 98-5,  "Reporting on
the Costs of Start-Up Activities" (SOP 98-5). SOP 98-5 requires the expensing of
the  costs  of  start-up  activities  as  incurred.   Additionally,   previously
capitalized  start-up  costs must be  written  off as a  Cumulative  Effect of a
Change in Accounting Principle. The adoption of SOP 98-5 did not have a material
impact on the  financial  condition,  results of operations or net cash flows of
PSEG or PSE&G.

New Jersey Energy Master Plan Proceedings and Related Orders

     Following  the  passage  of the New  Jersey  Electric  Discount  and Energy
Competition Act (Energy  Competition Act), the BPU rendered its summary decision
relating  to  PSE&G's  rate   unbundling,   stranded  costs  and   restructuring
proceedings  (Summary  Order) on April 21,  1999.  On August 24,  1999,  the BPU
issued a Final Order in these  matters  which  provided  the  reasoning  for the
action taken by the BPU and affirmed,  in all material  respects,  the decisions
and actions  previously  approved in the BPU's Summary Order, with the exception
of PSE&G's  treatment of investment tax credits (ITC) of $235 million related to
PSE&G's generation assets (see Investment Tax Credits).

<PAGE>
     In October and  November  1999,  two Notices of Appeal of each of the Final
Order and of the BPU's order approving PSE&G's petition relating to the proposed
securitization transaction for an irrevocable Bondable Stranded Costs Rate Order
(Finance Order) (see Securitization  Filing and Finance Order) were filed in the
Appellate  Division  of the New  Jersey  Superior  Court on  behalf  of  several
ratepayers.  The Court  granted  requests to  accelerate  two of the appeals and
ordered that the matters be consolidated. The Court further established November
3, 1999 as the deadline for the filing of any additional appeals of these Orders
and  directed the BPU to certify the record of both  proceedings  by November 5,
1999. No additional Notices of Appeal were filed and the record was certified to
the Court on such date. In addition, the Court established an expedited briefing
schedule with appellants' briefs due December 10, 1999,  respondents' briefs due
January 5, 2000 and reply  briefs due  January  14,  2000.  The Court fixed oral
argument on the  consolidated  matters  for March 8, 2000.  While PSEG and PSE&G
believe that the appeals are without  merit,  no assurances can be given at this
time as to the timing or outcome of these proceedings. Accordingly, neither PSEG
nor PSE&G are able to predict whether such appeals will have a material  adverse
effect on their financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

     The Energy Competition Act, the BPU's Summary Order and Final Order and the
related BPU proceedings  are  hereinafter  referred to as the Energy Master Plan
Proceedings.  The  result of these  proceedings  is that all New  Jersey  retail
electric  customers  have had the  ability  to select  their  electric  supplier
beginning  August 1, 1999 (see  Retail  Choice)  and all New  Jersey  retail gas
customers  may select their gas  supplier  commencing  December  31, 1999,  thus
opening the New Jersey  energy  markets to  competition.  For  discussion of the
extraordinary  charge to earnings  recorded as a result of the  deregulation  of
PSE&G's  generation  business,  see  Note  3.  Extraordinary  Charge  and  Other
Accounting Impacts of Deregulation.

     The Final Order provides for the following;  however, the existence of such
appeals noted above may impact the implementation provided in the Final Order:

     Transition Period

     o   A four-year  transition period beginning August 1, 1999 and ending July
         31,  2003.  During this  transition  period,  rates for those  services
         provided by PSE&G will be capped for all electric customers.

     Rate Reductions

     o   Customers will receive  through July 2003 the following rate reductions
         from those rates in effect on July 31, 1999  according  to the schedule
         below:

                        Effective Date      Amount of Rate Reduction
                        --------------      ------------------------
                        August 1, 1999:     5%
         At the time of securitization:     increasing to 7% (minimum)
                        August 1, 2001:     increasing to 9% (minimum)
                        August 1, 2002:     increasing  to 13.9%  average  (10%
                                            off rates in effect in April 1997)

         The BPU,  in  finding  that  the  second  and  third  incremental  rate
         reductions assume achievement of 2% overall savings from securitization
         (in  addition  to  the  1%  assumed  in  the  initial  5%   reduction),
         conditioned    these   additional    interim   rate   reductions   upon
         implementation of  securitization.  The BPU further determined that the
         final  aggregate  rate  reduction  in 2002 of 13.9% is  required by the
         Energy  Competition Act and is not contingent on the  implementation of
         securitization.

         On August 18, 1999, the BPU approved PSE&G's  compliance  tariff filing
         reflecting  the 5%  decrease  in rates.  On August 1,  1999,  PSE&G had
         implemented this rate reduction,  previously  approved on a provisional
         basis.

<PAGE>
     Shopping Credits

     o   Shopping credits  (credits which a customer  electing a new supplier of
         electricity  will  receive  from  PSE&G)  will be  established  for the
         transition  period  and  will  include  the cost of  energy,  capacity,
         transmission, ancillary services, losses, taxes and a retail adder. The
         average overall credits will be as follows:

                  1999:    4.95 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh)
                  2000:    5.03 cents per kWh
                  2001:    5.06 cents per kWh
                  2002:    5.10 cents per kWh
                  2003:    5.10 cents per kWh

     Stranded Costs

     o   The BPU  concluded  that PSE&G  should be provided the  opportunity  to
         recover  up to  $2.94  billion  (net of tax) of its  generation-related
         stranded  costs,  through  securitization  of $2.4  billion  (discussed
         below) and an opportunity to recover up to $540 million (net of tax) of
         its unsecuritized  generation-related stranded costs on a present value
         basis.  The $540  million  is  subject to  recovery  by various  means,
         including an explicit  market  transition  charge  (MTC).  The stranded
         costs  recovery is subject to a  reconciliation  of the  collection  of
         unsecuritized generation-related stranded costs.

     o   PSE&G was directed to use the  overrecovered  balance in the LEAC as of
         July  31,  1999  as  a  mitigation  tool  for  stranded  cost  recovery
         associated with  non-utility  generation  (NUG)  contracts.  PSE&G will
         apply the overrecovery as a credit to the starting  deferred balance of
         the non-utility  generation  market  transition  charge (NTC) to offset
         future above market costs and/or contract buyouts otherwise recoverable
         from ratepayers.

     Securitization

     o   The BPU concluded that it would issue an irrevocable  Bondable Stranded
         Costs  Rate  Order,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  the  Energy
         Competition  Act, to authorize  PSE&G to issue up to $2.525  billion of
         transition  bonds,  with a scheduled  amortization  upon issuance of 15
         years,  representing $2.4 billion of generation-related  stranded costs
         (net of tax) and an estimated  $125  million of  transaction  costs.  A
         transition  bond charge will be collected  from all existing and future
         electric customers via a single per kWh "wires charge" to be subject to
         adjustment at least annually.  For further details,  see Securitization
         Filing and Finance Order.

     o   The BPU  determined  that the taxes  related to  securitization,  which
         reflect the grossed up revenue  requirements  associated  with the $2.4
         billion  in  generation-related  stranded  costs  (net  of  tax)  being
         securitized,  are recoverable  stranded costs.  The BPU determined that
         such taxes should not be collected  through the transition bond charge;
         rather,  such taxes will be collected  via a separate MTC. The duration
         of  this  separate  MTC  is to be  identical  to  the  duration  of the
         transition bond charge.

     o   The BPU clarified the language  concerning  the use of the net proceeds
         of  securitization  to indicate that the  refinancing  or retirement of
         debt  and/or   equity   shall  be  done  in  a  manner  that  will  not
         substantially alter PSE&G's overall capital structure.

     Sale of Generation-Related Assets

     o   As  directed  by the  Final  Order,  PSE&G  will  sell  its  generation
         property,  plant and equipment to a separate unregulated  subsidiary of
         PSEG  for   $2.443   billion   plus   the  net  book   value  of  other
         generation-related  assets and  liabilities  transferred at the time of
         purchase, such as fuel and materials and supplies,  currently estimated
         to be between $200 million and $400  million.  PSE&G and PSEG Power LLC
         (Power), the separate  unregulated  subsidiary of PSEG, will record the
         difference between the net book value of the generation property, plant
         and  equipment  and the $2.443  billion of sale proceeds as an increase
         and decrease to contributed capital,  respectively,  on their financial
         statements.

     o   Such separate company will become an exempt  wholesale  generator (EWG)
         under  the  Public  Utility  Holding  Company  Act  (PUHCA).  Any gains
         resulting  from any sale of the  generation-related  assets  to a third
         party which occurs before August 1, 2004 must be shared equally between
         ratepayers   and   shareholders.    For   further    discussion,    see
         Generation-Related Asset Sale to Power.

     Basic Generation Service

     o    PSE&G is  obligated  to  provide  BGS to  customers  who do not choose
          another  electric  supplier.  PSE&G will contract with Power,  through
          Power's  wholly  owned  subsidiary  PSEG Energy  Resources & Trade LLC
          (ER&T),  to provide the energy and  capacity  required to meet PSE&G's
          BGS and Off-Tariff  Rate Agreements  (OTRA)  obligations for the first
          three  years of retail  choice (see  Generation-Related  Asset Sale to
          Power).  PSEG,  PSE&G and Power are  prohibited  from  promoting  such
          service as a competitive  alternative to other  electricity  suppliers
          and marketers.  BGS will be competitively  bid for the fourth year and
          thereafter.  Any  payments  resulting  from BGS  being bid out will be
          applied to the deferred societal benefit costs balance for purposes of
          establishing the societal benefit clause (SBC) rate in the fifth year.

     Societal Benefit Clause and Non-utility Generation Market Transition Clause

     o    Societal  benefit  costs  and  stranded   costs  associated   with NUG
          contracts will be collected  through  separate  charges.  Both charges
          will remain constant  throughout the four-year  transition  period and
          PSE&G  will  use  deferral  accounting,   including  interest  on  any
          over/underrecoveries.  The charges will be reset annually  thereafter.
          The  charge for the  stranded  NTC will be  initially  set at the 1999
          level of $183 million annually.  Any NUG contract buyouts will also be
          charged to the NTC and will be subject to deferral accounting. The SBC
          will include  costs related to: 1) social  programs  which include the
          universal  service fund; 2) nuclear plant  decommissioning;  3) demand
          side  management  (DSM)  programs (see Other  Regulatory  Issues);  4)
          manufactured gas plant remediation; and 5) consumer education.

     Electric Distribution Depreciation

     o   PSE&G was  directed  by the BPU to  record a  regulatory  liability  by
         reducing its depreciation reserve for its electric  distribution assets
         by $569 million.  This regulatory  liability will be amortized over the
         period from January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003 (see Note 3. Extraordinary
         Charge and Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation).

<PAGE>
     Investment Tax Credits

     o    The BPU  directed   PSE&G  to  seek  a private  letter ruling from the
          Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the ITC can be credited
          to customers  without  violating  the tax  normalization  rules of the
          Internal  Revenue Code. If the IRS's private letter ruling  determines
          that  the ITC  could  be  passed  on to  customers  of  PSE&G  without
          violating the IRS's  normalization  rules,  then the BPU in the fourth
          year of the  transition  period will  consider any action which it may
          deem   appropriate   regarding  the  treatment  of  the  ITC,   giving
          consideration  to the  issues  resolved  in the Final  Order and other
          relevant considerations. PSE&G accounted for the ITC as a reduction to
          the extraordinary charge recorded in the second quarter of 1999. PSE&G
          cannot  predict  the  outcome  of  the  ruling  from  the  IRS  or any
          subsequent  potential  actions which may be taken by the BPU. However,
          an adverse  resolution  to this matter would  result in an  additional
          extraordinary  charge  to income  up to the  amount of the ITC,  which
          would  likely  have a material  adverse  impact on PSEG's and  PSE&G's
          financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

     Securitization Filing and Finance Order

     On September 17, 1999, the BPU issued its Finance Order to authorize, among
other things,  the  imposition  of a  non-bypassable  transition  bond charge on
PSE&G's customers;  the sale of PSE&G's property right in such charge created by
the Energy Competition Act to a bankruptcy-remote financing entity; the issuance
and sale of  $2.525  billion  of  transition  bonds by such  entity  in  payment
therefor,  including an estimated  $125 million of  transaction  costs;  and the
application by PSE&G of the transition bond proceeds to retire  outstanding debt
and/or  equity.  The order was  consistent  with the  provisions  of the  Energy
Competition Act and the Final Order.

     PSE&G  Transition  Funding LLC, a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of PSE&G,  was
created to issue such transition  bonds.  Two appeals have been filed which have
challenged the Finance Order and will  delay the sale of the  transition  bonds.
Although  PSEG and PSE&G believe the appeals are without  merit,  PSEG and PSE&G
are unable to predict the outcome of such appeals. However, assuming a favorable
outcome,  PSEG and PSE&G  expect  such sale of  transition  bonds and receipt of
proceeds therefrom will occur in the first half of 2000.

     Generation-Related Asset Sale to Power

     In anticipation of the Final Order directing the sale of generation-related
assets,  PSEG organized Power and its subsidiaries in June 1999.  Power, and its
subsidiaries,  PSEG Fossil LLC  (Fossil) and PSEG  Nuclear LLC  (Nuclear),  will
acquire and manage PSE&G's electric generation-related assets. The appeal, which
has been filed  challenging  the approval  granted by the BPU in the Final Order
for this sale,  will   delay  this sale.  Although  PSEG and PSE&G  believe  the
appeals are without  merit,  PSEG and PSE&G are unable to predict the outcome of
such appeals.  However, assuming a favorable outcome, PSEG and PSE&G expect such
sale will occur in the first half of 2000.

     Certain  regulatory  approvals  are  required  prior  to  the  sale  of the
generation-related  assets  to Power  and its  subsidiaries.  Power has made the
necessary  filings and is awaiting  final  approval from the Nuclear  Regulatory
Commission  (NRC)  (to  transfer  PSE&G's  nuclear  licenses),  the  New  Jersey
Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP) and the  Pennsylvania  Public
Utility Commission  (PAPUC).  Additionally,  in October 1999, Nuclear and Fossil
filed with the FERC for EWG status.  In September  1999,  FERC approved  PSE&G's
proposed  sale of its  generating  units  to  Power  and its  subsidiaries. FERC
conditionally accepted a number of other agreements. Additionally, FERC directed
Power to make  amendments  clarifying  the  proposed  rate formula by which ER&T
would  compensate  Fossil and Nuclear for their actual costs and to  redesignate
the proposed market-based rate tariff from PSE&G to ER&T.

<PAGE>
     Metering, Billing and Account Services

     In  accordance  with the Energy  Competition  Act, the BPU has mandated the
creation of a Customer  Account  Services  working  group  comprised of electric
and/or gas utilities,  including PSE&G, alternative energy service providers and
other interested parties.  The focus of the working group and the BPU will be to
outline a timeline and the extent to which  competition  will be  introduced  to
various  functions,  including  metering,  billing and customer service,  and to
create  regulatory  guidelines for making these services  competitive.  Meetings
began in  November  1999  with  expectations  that a formal  proceeding  will be
scheduled sometime after January 2000.

     Generic Issues

     In 1999,  the BPU issued a series of interim  orders that  decided  generic
issues  related to the  deregulation  of the electric and gas  industries in New
Jersey.  These  orders  addressed  environmental  disclosure  standards,  energy
aggregation program standards,  anti-slamming standards,  retail choice consumer
protection standards and licensing and registration  standards applicable to all
energy  service  providers.  It is also  anticipated  that the BPU will issue an
order addressing  affiliate  relationships and transactions,  which could impact
the pricing of affiliate transactions.

     Retail Choice

     Retail choice of electric energy suppliers started on August 1, 1999. Those
retail  customers who choose a third party  supplier (TPS) are expected to begin
to receive  electric  energy from such TPS  commencing in the fourth  quarter of
1999.  As  previously  noted,  the  appeals  of the Final  Order may delay  this
implementation.

     Gas Unbundling

     The Energy Competition Act requires that all residential customers have the
ability to choose a competitive  gas supplier by December 31, 1999. As a result,
on March 17, 1999,  the BPU issued its Order  requiring each natural gas utility
to submit a rate unbundling filing.

     On April 30, 1999,  PSE&G submitted its required gas unbundling  compliance
filing  with the BPU.  The  discovery  process  has been  completed,  intervenor
testimony has been filed and hearings  before the BPU commenced on September 27,
1999.  The BPU is expected  to render a decision  by the end of  December  1999.
PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

     The Energy Competition Act also mandated similar rules for the gas industry
as those for the electric industry  addressing  affiliate relations and consumer
protection,  among others.  The standards  adopted by the BPU for generic issues
also apply to the competitive gas industry (see Generic Issues).

Other Regulatory Issues

     Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Formerly DSM)

     The BPU adopted rules in 1991 to encourage  utilities to offer  DSM-related
load management and conservation  services.  These rules were re-adopted in 1996
and were designed to treat DSM on equal  regulatory  footing with supply side or
energy  production   investments.   The  Energy  Competition  Act  requires  the
continuation of these energy efficiency programs and the initiation of renewable
energy  programs,  the costs of which  are to be  recovered  through a  societal
benefits  charge on all electric and gas customers'  bills. On June 9, 1999, the
BPU initiated a proceeding  causing a comprehensive  resource analysis of energy
programs  to be  undertaken  including  the  reevaluation  of DSM  programs  and
incorporation  of  new  renewable  programs.  Key  to  this  proceeding  is  the
determination  of the  appropriate  level of funding for energy  efficiency  and
renewable energy programs on a statewide basis.  Hearings have been scheduled by
the BPU with a target  established  that would permit it to render decisions for
each of the utilities in lieu of settlements, if necessary, by February 9, 2000.
PSE&G filed its proposed plan with the BPU on August 23, 1999.

<PAGE>
     Non-utility Generation Buydown

     Under Federal and State regulations,  utilities were required to enter into
long-term power purchase  agreements with NUGs at prices which have subsequently
proven to be above market.  PSE&G is seeking to  restructure  certain of its BPU
approved  contracts  with NUGs,  which were  estimated to be $1.6 billion  above
assumed future market prices.  In July 1999, PSE&G and American Ref-Fuel Company
announced an agreement to amend a NUG contract originally signed in 1985 for the
Essex County Resource Recovery Facility,  a waste incinerator located in Newark,
New Jersey.  Under the terms of the agreement,  PSE&G  ratepayers will receive a
cost  reduction  of up to $100  million  over  the  remaining  20  years  of the
contract. In September 1999, the agreement was approved by the BPU and the costs
to restructure this contract will be recovered through the NTC.

Note 3.  Extraordinary Charge and Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation

     As previously  disclosed,  as a result of the BPU's issuance of the Summary
Order in April 1999 and in accordance with EITF 97-4, PSE&G determined that SFAS
71 was no longer applicable to the electric  generation portion of its business.
Accordingly,  in the second quarter,  PSE&G recorded an extraordinary  charge to
earnings  of  $790  million  (net of  tax).  PSE&G  accounted  for  this  charge
consistent  with the  requirements  of SFAS 101.  In the third  quarter of 1999,
PSE&G revised the estimates inherent in the extraordinary charge and recorded an
additional $14 million  extraordinary  charge. For discussion of the Final Order
and PSE&G's treatment of ITC, see Note 2. Regulatory Issues.

     The extraordinary  charge recorded in the second and third quarters of 1999
consisted  primarily of the write-down of PSE&G's nuclear and fossil  generating
stations in accordance  with SFAS 121.  PSE&G  performed a discounted  cash flow
analysis on a unit-by-unit basis to determine the amount of the impairment. As a
result  of this  impairment  analysis,  the net  book  value  of the  generating
stations was reduced by  approximately  $5.0 billion  (pre-tax) or approximately
$3.09  billion (net of tax).  This amount was offset by the creation of a $4.057
billion (pre-tax), or $2.4 billion (net of tax), regulatory asset related to the
future receipt of securitization  proceeds, as provided for in the Summary Order
and affirmed in the Final Order.

     In addition to the impairment of PSE&G's electric generating stations,  the
extraordinary charge consisted of various accounting  adjustments to reflect the
absence of cost of service regulation in the electric  generation portion of the
business in the future.  The  adjustments  primarily  related to  materials  and
supplies,  general  plant  items and  liabilities  for certain  contractual  and
environmental obligations.

     Other  accounting  impacts  of the  discontinuation  of  SFAS  71  included
reclassifying the Accrued Nuclear  Decommissioning  Reserve and the Accrued Cost
of Removal  for  generation-related  assets  from  Accumulated  Depreciation  to
Long-Term   Liabilities.   PSE&G  also   reclassified   a  $569  million  excess
depreciation  reserve  related  to PSE&G's  electric  distribution  assets  from
Accumulated  Depreciation  to  a  Regulatory  Liability.  Such  amount  will  be
amortized in  accordance  with the terms of the Final Order over the period from
January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.

Note 4. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

     Regulatory  assets and  liabilities  are  recorded in  accordance  with the
provisions  of SFAS 71. In  general,  SFAS 71  recognizes  that  accounting  for
rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the relationship of costs and revenues
as  determined  by  regulators.  As a  result,  a  regulated  utility  may defer
recognition of costs (a regulatory asset) or recognize obligations (a regulatory
liability) if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be
a  corresponding  increase  or  decrease  in  revenues.  Accordingly,  PSE&G has
deferred certain costs,  which are being amortized over various periods.  To the
extent  that  collection  of such costs or payment of  liabilities  is no longer
probable  as a result  of  changes  in  regulation  and/or  PSE&G's  competitive
position,  the  associated  regulatory  asset or  liability  has been charged or
credited to income.
<PAGE>
     Starting  in  the  second  quarter  of  1999,   PSE&G  no  longer  met  the
requirements for the application of SFAS 71 to the electric  generation  portion
of its business.  In accordance with SFAS 101 and EITF 97-4,  regulatory  assets
and  liabilities  related to the  generation  portion of PSE&G's  business  were
written  off,  except to the extent the Summary and Final  Orders  provided  for
future  recovery  through  regulated  operations.   Additionally,   certain  new
regulatory assets and regulatory  liabilities were recorded,  in compliance with
the  Summary  and  Final  Orders.  For  discussion  of the  Energy  Master  Plan
Proceedings,  see Note 2. Regulatory Issues and Note 3. Extraordinary Charge and
Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation.

     At September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1998,  respectively,  PSEG and PSE&G
had deferred the following regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets:

</TABLE>

     Regulatory Asset - Stranded Costs: PSE&G has recorded this regulatory asset
to reflect the future  revenues  which will be collected via the  securitization
transition charge which was authorized by the BPU's Finance Order.

     SFAS 109 Income Taxes:  This amount represents the regulatory asset related
to the recognition of deferred income taxes arising from the  implementation  of
SFAS 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). Due to the  discontinuation
of SFAS 71 for the electric generation portion of PSE&G's business, the deferred
taxes   related  to  these   assets  have  been  reduced  and  included  in  the
determination of the Extraordinary Item.

     Regulatory Asset - SBC: See Note 2. Regulatory  Issues for a description of
the SBC. Before creation of the SBC, the electric DSM and manufactured gas plant
remediation costs were included in DSM and Environmental Costs, respectively, as
listed above.

     Regulatory Liability - Excess Depreciation Reserve: As required by the BPU,
PSE&G reduced its depreciation  reserve for its electric  distribution assets by
$569 million and recorded such amount as a regulatory  liability to be amortized
over the period from  January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.  In 2000 and 2001,  $125
million will be  amortized  each year.  In 2002 and 2003,  $135 million and $184
million will be amortized, respectively.


<PAGE>
     Regulatory Liability - NTC: See Note 2. Regulatory Issues for a description
of the NTC.

     Regulatory Liability - Overrecovered  Electric Energy Costs: As provided by
the BPU in the  Final  Order,  PSE&G  continued  to follow  deferral  accounting
treatment  for the LEAC through July 31, 1999.  At July 31, 1999,  Overrecovered
Electric  Energy  Costs  were $59  million.  Pursuant  to the Final  Order,  the
overrecovered  balance  as of July 31,  1999  was  applied  as a  credit  to the
starting deferred balance of the NTC.

 Note 5.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Pending Asset Purchases

         PSEG has entered  into  contracts  to  purchase a number of  combustion
turbines to expand capacity at a number of generating  sites.  PSEG's commitment
under these  contracts  is  approximately  $392  million to be expended  through
December 2001.  Through October 31, 1999,  payments of approximately $70 million
were made under these contracts.

     On October 6, 1999,  Power announced an agreement with Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation  (Niagara  Mohawk),  a New York State  utility,  to purchase its 400
megawatt  oil and  gas-fired  electric  generating  station in Albany,  New York
(Albany Steam Station) for $47.5 million.  Payment of Power's  obligation  under
such agreement has been guaranteed by PSEG. Niagara Mohawk could also receive up
to an additional  $11.5 million if Power chooses to pursue  redevelopment of the
Albany  Steam  Station.  Under a  transition  power  contract  in place  through
September 2003,  Niagara Mohawk will purchase  electricity  from Power at prices
consistent with those established in Niagara Mohawk's regulatory  agreement with
the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC). The purchase of the Albany Steam
Station will provide  Power entry into the New York Power Pool.  The purchase is
subject to approval  by the NYPSC and Federal  agencies  including  FERC.  Power
expects to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2000.

     On September 30, 1999,  Power  announced that it has signed an agreement to
acquire all of  Conectiv's  interests in the Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station
(Salem) and the Hope Creek Nuclear  Generating  Station (Hope Creek) and half of
Conectiv's interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (Peach Bottom), for
an aggregate  purchase price of $15.4 million plus the net book value of nuclear
fuel at closing.  Payment of Power's  obligation  under such  agreement has been
guaranteed by PSEG.  Conectiv is the parent of Atlantic  City  Electric  Company
(ACE) and Delmarva Power & Light Company (DP&L).  Power will purchase Conectiv's
14.82% interest (328 megawatts) in Salem,  Conectiv's 5% interest (52 megawatts)
in Hope Creek and half of Conectiv's  15.02%  interest (164  megawatts) in Peach
Bottom.  Once completed,  PSEG would own a 57.41% interest (1,270  megawatts) in
Salem, a 100% interest (1,031 megawatts) in Hope Creek and a 50% interest (1,094
megawatts)  in Peach  Bottom.  The  addition  of the  nuclear  assets to Power's
portfolio is in line with its growth-oriented generation and trading strategy in
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic  region. The purchases are subject to approval by the
BPU,  the Delaware  Public  Service  Commission,  the  Maryland  Public  Service
Commission,  the PAPUC and Federal  agencies  including the NRC and FERC.  Power
expects to complete the purchases by mid-2000.

Nuclear Operating Performance Standard (OPS)

    PECO Energy Company (PECO Energy), DP&L and PSE&G, three of the co-owners of
Salem and Peach  Bottom,  have  agreed to an OPS through  December  31, 2011 for
Salem and through December 31, 2007 for Peach Bottom. Under the OPS, the station
operator is required to make  payments to the  non-operating  owners  (excluding
ACE) commencing in January 2001 if the three-year historical average net maximum
dependable  capacity  factor for that  station,  calculated as of December 31 of
each year  commencing  with December 31, 2000,  falls below 40%. At December 31,
1998,  the  capacity  factors  were  67%  and  81%  for  Salem  1 and  Salem  2,
respectively.  Any such payment is limited to a maximum of $25 million per year.
The parties have further agreed to forego  litigation in the future,  except for
limited cases in which the operator would be responsible  for damages of no more
than $5 million per year.
<PAGE>
    As noted  above,  Power has  announced  that it has signed an  agreement  to
acquire  all of  Conectiv's  interests  in  Salem  and  Hope  Creek  and half of
Conectiv's interest in Peach Bottom. Once the purchases are completed, DP&L will
no longer have an interest in the OPS agreement.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

     Many of PSEG's and PSE&G's systems,  which include  information  technology
applications, plant control and telecommunications  infrastructure systems, must
be modified due to computer  program  limitations  in  recognizing  dates beyond
1999.  Management  estimates the total cost related to Year 2000  readiness will
approximate  $76 million,  to be incurred  through 2001, of which $8 million was
incurred in 1997, $27 million was incurred in 1998 and approximately $35 million
is expected to be incurred in 1999.  During the nine months ended  September 30,
1999, $20 million was incurred.  A portion of these costs is not  incremental to
PSEG  or  PSE&G,   but   rather,   represents   a   redeployment   of   existing
personnel/resources.

     If PSEG,  PSE&G,  their  domestic  and  international  subsidiaries,  their
project  affiliates,  other members of the PJM  Interconnection,  LLC (PJM), PJM
trading  partners  supplying  power  through PJM,  PSEG's or PSE&G's key vendors
and/or  customers  or the  capital  markets  are  unable  to meet the Year  2000
deadline,  such  inability  could have a material  adverse  impact on PSEG's and
PSE&G's  operations,  financial  condition,  results of  operations  or net cash
flows.

Site Restorations and Other Environmental Costs

    It is  difficult to estimate the future  financial  impact of  environmental
laws,  including  potential  liabilities.  PSEG and PSE&G  accrue  environmental
liabilities  when it is probable  that a  liability  has been  incurred  and the
amount of the liability is reasonably  estimable.  Estimated  losses  related to
site  environmental  remediation are based primarily on internal and third party
environmental  studies,  the number and participation level of other Potentially
Responsible  Parties (PRP),  the extent of the  contamination  and the nature of
required remediation.

    Certain  environmental  costs are currently  recoverable through the RAC and
are expected to be recoverable in accordance  with the Final Order,  through the
SBC.  Other  environmental  costs may be  recoverable  through  future  recovery
mechanisms,  including  the SBC;  however,  no assurances  can be given.  To the
extent these costs are material and not recoverable,  they could have a material
adverse impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial condition,  results of operations
or net cash flows.

Hazardous Waste

    Certain Federal and state laws authorize the U.S.  Environmental  Protection
Agency  (EPA) and the NJDEP,  among other  agencies,  to issue  orders and bring
enforcement  actions  to compel  responsible  parties  to  investigate  and take
remedial  actions  at any site  that is  determined  to  present  an  actual  or
potential  threat to human  health or the  environment  because  of an actual or
threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Because of the nature of
PSEG's and PSE&G's  business,  including  the  production  of  electricity,  the
distribution of gas and, formerly,  the manufacture of gas, various  by-products
and  substances  are or were  produced  or handled  which  contain  constituents
classified as hazardous. PSE&G generally provides for the disposal or processing
of such substances  through licensed  independent  contractors.  However,  these
statutory provisions impose joint and several  responsibility  without regard to
fault on all  responsible  parties,  including  the  generators of the hazardous
substances, for certain investigative and remediation costs at sites where these
substances  were disposed of or processed.  PSE&G has been notified with respect
to a  number  of such  sites  and the  investigation  and  remediation  of these
potentially  hazardous sites is receiving attention from the government agencies
involved.  Generally,  actions directed at funding such site  investigations and
remediation include all suspected or known responsible parties. Based on current
information,  except as  discussed  below with respect to its  manufactured  gas
plant remediation program  (Remediation  Program),  PSEG and PSE&G do not expect
their expenditures for any such site,  individually or all such current sites in
the  aggregate,  except as noted below (see  Passaic  River  Site),  will have a
material effect on financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.
<PAGE>
    The NJDEP regulations  concerning site investigation and remediation require
an  ecological   evaluation  of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in
connection with a remedial  investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is
presently   working  with  the  utility  industry  to  develop   procedures  for
implementing these regulations. These regulations may substantially increase the
costs of remedial investigations and remediations, where necessary, particularly
at sites situate on surface water bodies. PSE&G and predecessor  companies owned
and/or operated certain facilities  situate on surface water bodies,  certain of
which are currently the subject of remedial activities.  The financial impact of
these regulations on these projects is not currently  estimable.  PSE&G does not
anticipate  that the  compliance  with  these  regulations  will have a material
adverse  effect on its  financial  position,  results of  operations or net cash
flows.

PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

    In 1988,  NJDEP  notified  PSE&G that it had  identified the need for PSE&G,
pursuant  to  a  formal  arrangement,  to  systematically  investigate  and,  if
necessary,   resolve   environmental   concerns   existing  at  PSE&G's   former
manufactured gas plant sites. To date, NJDEP and PSE&G have identified 38 former
manufactured  gas plant  sites.  PSE&G is  currently  working with NJDEP under a
program  to assess,  investigate  and,  if  necessary,  remediate  environmental
conditions at these sites. The Remediation Program is periodically  reviewed and
revised  by  PSE&G  based  on  regulatory  requirements,   experience  with  the
Remediation  Program and  available  remediation  technologies.  The cost of the
Remediation  Program  cannot be  reasonably  estimated,  but  experience to date
indicates  that costs of  approximately  $20  million per year could be incurred
over a period of about 30 years and that the overall cost could be material. The
Energy Competition Act provides for the continuation of RAC programs.  The Final
Order provides for the recovery of costs for this remediation effort through the
SBC.

Air Pollution Control

     In June 1998,  NJDEP  adopted  regulations  implementing  a  memorandum  of
understanding  among  11  Northeastern  states  and the  District  of  Columbia,
establishing a regional plan for reducing  nitrogen  oxide (NOx)  emissions from
utilities  and large  industrial  boilers.  The extent of  investment in control
technologies,  operational changes and purchases of emission allowances required
to comply  with  these  regulations  will be  directly  related to the number of
emission allowances PSE&G receives.  PSE&G received a preliminary  allocation of
emission allowances in March 1999, which were sufficient for the Summer of 1999.
The final allocation will be determined in accordance with the NJDEP regulations
in November  1999,  which is subsequent to the May 1 through  September 30, 1999
period governed by the  regulations.  It is currently  anticipated  that the NOx
allowances  will be sold to  Power  at the  time of the  sale of the  generating
assets.

Passaic River Site

     The EPA has  determined  that a six mile  stretch of the  Passaic  River in
Newark,  New Jersey is a  "facility"  within the  meaning of that term under the
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of
1980  (CERCLA) and that,  to date,  at least  thirteen  corporations,  including
PSE&G,  may be potentially  liable for performing  required  remedial actions to
address potential  environmental  pollution at the facility. The EPA anticipates
identifying  other PRPs.  One PRP entered into a consent  decree with the EPA in
1994 obligating it to conduct a remedial  investigation  and  feasibility  study
(RI/FS) of  available  and  applicable  corrective  actions for the site.  It is
anticipated that a report of the RI/FS will be issued in 2001.

     PSE&G and certain of its  predecessors  operated  industrial  facilities at
properties  within the six mile stretch of the Passaic  River  designated as the
facility.  In  April  1996,  the  EPA  directed  PSE&G  to  provide  information
concerning  the nature and  quantity of raw  materials,  by-products  and wastes
which may have been generated,  treated,  stored or disposed at certain of these
facilities.  The  facilities  are PSE&G's  former  Harrison  Gas Plant and Essex
Generating  Station.  PSE&G  submitted  responses  to the EPA requests for these
sites in August 1996. In July 1997,  the EPA named PSE&G as a PRP for this site.
PSE&G cannot  predict  what action,  if any, the EPA or any third party may take
against  PSE&G with respect to this matter,  or in such event,  what costs PSE&G
may incur to address any such claims. However, such costs may be material.
<PAGE>
Subsurface Contamination

     PSE&G's  sale of  generation-related  assets to PSEG Power may  trigger the
requirements  of the New  Jersey  Industrial  Site  Recovery  Act  (ISRA).  ISRA
requires  that before any transfer of an industrial  establishment  can be made,
the interested parties shall remediate or cause to be remediated  potential site
environmental  concerns in accordance  with NJDEP  requirements.  Certain of the
generation-related assets being sold are industrial establishments as defined by
ISRA. In October 1999,  PSE&G filed a request with the NJDEP for a determination
that the sale involves a transfer to an affiliate and, as such, is not a covered
transaction  under  ISRA.  In the second  quarter of 1999,  PSEG  recorded a $53
million liability related to these obligations (see Note 3. Extraordinary Charge
and Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation).

Note 6.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     PSEG's  operations  give rise to exposure to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and securities
prices. PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments for the purpose
of managing market risk consistent with its business plans and prudent  business
practices.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The  estimated  fair value was  determined  using the market  quotations or
values of instruments with similar terms, credit ratings,  remaining  maturities
and redemptions at September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1998, respectively.  Note
that certain  future events in connection  with  securitization  and the sale by
PSE&G of  generation-related  assets to Power will  trigger  certain  redemption
features of certain PSE&G mortgage bonds.

       and $150  million for Energy  Holdings  and PSEG,  respectively,  for the
       period ended December 31, 1998.

       Global  has $67  million of project  debt that is  non-recourse  to PSEG,
       Global and Energy Holdings  associated with investments in Argentina that
       was refinanced in June 1999 for a term of one year. An interest rate swap
       was entered into which  effectively  converts  50% of the  floating  rate
       obligation into a fixed rate obligation.  The interest rate  differential
       to be received or paid under the  agreement is recorded  over the life of
       the agreement as an adjustment  to interest  expense.  The pricing on the
       loan is indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

Commodity-Related Instruments--PSE&G

     At September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1998, PSE&G held or issued commodity
and  financial  instruments  that  reduce  exposure to price  fluctuations  from
factors such as weather,  environmental policies,  changes in demand, changes in
supply,   state  and  Federal  regulatory  policies  and  other  events.   These
instruments, in conjunction with owned electric generating capacity and physical
gas supply contracts,  are designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer
commitments. PSE&G uses futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage and hedge
price risk related to these market exposures.

     At  September  30,  1999,   PSE&G  had  outstanding   commodity   financial
instruments  with a notional  contract  quantity of 10.4 million  megawatt-hours
(MWH) of electricity  and 47.5 million MMBTU (million  British thermal units) of
natural gas. At December 31, 1998,  PSE&G had  outstanding  commodity  financial
instruments with a notional  contract quantity of 1.6 million MWH of electricity
and 65.2 million MMBTU of natural gas.  Notional  amounts are indicative only of
the volume of activity and are not a measure of market risk.

     As  discussed  in Note 1.  Basis  of  Presentation/Summary  of  Significant
Accounting Policies,  PSE&G implemented EITF 98-10 effective January 1, 1999. As
a result,  PSE&G's energy trading  contracts were marked to market and gains and
losses from such contracts were included in earnings. Previously, such gains and
losses were recorded upon settlement of the contracts. PSE&G recorded $3 million
of gains in the quarters ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998.  PSE&G recorded $20
million and $21 million of gains in the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

Commodity-Related Instruments--Energy Holdings

     PSEG Energy  Technologies Inc.'s (Energy  Technologies)  policy is to enter
into natural gas and electricity futures contracts and forward purchases to lock
in prices related to future fixed sales commitments.  Whenever possible,  Energy
Technologies  attempts  to be  100%  covered  on  its  electric  and  gas  sales
positions.  During the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999 and 1998,  Energy
Technologies  entered into futures  contracts to buy natural gas and electricity
related to fixed-price sales commitments. Energy Technologies had 97% and 90% of
its fixed  price  natural gas sales  commitments  hedged and 100% and 63% of its
fixed price electric  commodity sales  commitments  hedged at September 30, 1999
and December 31, 1998,  respectively.  As of September 30, 1999 and December 31,
1998, Energy  Technologies had a net unrealized gain of approximately $3 million
and net unrealized loss of $5 million, respectively, related to its electric and
gas hedges.

Equity Securities--Energy Holdings

     PSEG Resources Inc.  (Resources) directly and indirectly has investments in
equity  securities.  Resources  carries its investments in equity  securities at
their  approximate  fair  value.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value  of  these
investments  is  affected  by  changes  in the  fair  value  of  the  underlying
securities.  Fair value is  determined  by  adjusting  the  market  value of the
securities for liquidity and market volatility factors,  where appropriate.  The
aggregate fair values of such  investments  which had available market prices at
September  30, 1999 and December  31, 1998 were $118  million and $204  million,
respectively.  The  decrease  in fair  value  was  primarily  due to the sale of
certain of such  investments  during 1999.  The  potential  change in fair value
resulting  from a  hypothetical  10%  change  in quoted  market  prices of these
investments  amounted  to $11 million at  September  30, 1999 and $17 million at
December 31, 1998.
<PAGE>
Foreign Currencies--Energy Holdings

     In accordance with their growth strategies,  Global and Resources have made
approximately  $1.4 billion and $1.0  billion,  respectively,  of  international
investments.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets  located  in the  Netherlands  and the  United  Kingdom  with  associated
revenues  denominated  in U.S.  dollars and,  therefore,  not subject to foreign
currency risk.

     Global's international  investments are primarily in projects that generate
or distribute  electricity in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile, China, India, Peru and
Venezuela.  Investing in foreign  countries  involves  certain  risks.  Economic
conditions  that  result in higher  comparative  rates of  inflation  in foreign
countries  likely result in declining values in such countries'  currencies.  As
currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, there is a corresponding change in
Global's  investment value in terms of the U.S. dollar. Such change is reflected
as an increase or decrease in  comprehensive  income,  a separate  component  of
stockholders'  equity.  Net  foreign  currency  devaluations  have  reduced  the
reported  amount of PSEG's  total  stockholders'  equity by $160  million,  $147
million of which was caused by the  devaluation  of the Brazilian  Real, for the
nine months ended September 30, 1999.

     In January  1999,  Brazil  abandoned its managed  devaluation  strategy and
allowed  its  currency,  the Real,  to float  against  other  currencies.  As of
September  30, 1999,  the Real had devalued  approximately  37% against the U.S.
dollar  since  December  31,  1998,  affecting  the  carrying  value of Global's
investment in a Brazilian distribution company. For additional information,  see
Note 8. Financial Information by Business Segments.

     Higher  comparative rates of inflation in foreign economies also means that
borrowing costs in local currency will be higher than in the United States. When
warranted,  Global has financed  certain  foreign  investments  with U.S. dollar
denominated  debt. While less costly to service in terms of U.S.  dollars,  such
debt is exposed to currency risk because a devaluation  would cause repayment to
be more  expensive in local  currency  terms since more units of local  currency
would be required to repay the debt.  Dollar  denominated  debt was  incurred by
Global in Argentina,  Chile and Peru to finance the  acquisition of interests in
rate  regulated  distribution  entities.  These  entities may be able to recover
higher  costs  incurred as a result of a  devaluation  specifically  through the
terms of the concession agreement or as a pass through of higher inflation costs
in rates over time, although no assurances can be given that this will occur. In
evaluating  its investment  decisions,  Global  considers the social,  economic,
political and currency  risks  associated  with each potential  project,  and if
warranted,  assumes a certain  level of  currency  devaluation  when  making its
investment  decisions.  In  Argentina,  the currency is pegged 1:1 with the U.S.
dollar and a  legislative  act is required to de-couple  the  currency  from the
dollar.

     Global had consolidated  project debt totaling $106 million as of September
30, 1999 associated with Global's investment in a Brazilian distribution company
that  is  non-recourse  to  Global,  Energy  Holdings  and  PSEG.  The  debt  is
denominated  in the  Brazilian  Real and is indexed  to a basket of  currencies,
approximately  50% of which is the U.S.  dollar.  Global is  subject  to foreign
currency  exchange rate risk as a result of exchange rate movements  between the
indexed foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate changes ultimately
impact  the debt  level  outstanding  in the  reporting  currency  and result in
foreign  currency gains or losses.  Gains or losses resulting from such exchange
rate  movements  are  included in other  income for the period and amounted to a
loss of $3 million and a gain of $1 million in the quarters ended  September 30,
1999 and 1998,  respectively, and gains of $2 million and $4 million in the nine
months ended September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     Although Global  generally seeks to structure power purchase  contracts and
other  project  revenue  agreements  to provide  for  payments to be made in, or
indexed to, U.S. dollars or a currency freely convertible into U.S. dollars, its
ability to do so in all cases may be limited.  As Energy  Holdings  continues to
invest  internationally,  the financial  statements of PSEG will be increasingly
affected by changes in the global economy.  PSEG cannot predict foreign currency
exchange  rate  movements  and,  therefore,  cannot  predict  the impact of such
movements  on PSEG's  financial  condition,  results of  operations  or net cash
flows.
<PAGE>
Interest Rates

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings  are  subject to the risk of  fluctuating
interest  rates in the  normal  course of  business.  Their  policy is to manage
interest  rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt,  floating  rate debt and
interest  rate swaps.  As of September  30, 1999, a  hypothetical  10% change in
market  interest rates would result in a $4 million,  $10 million and $3 million
change in annual  interest costs related to short-term and floating rate debt at
PSEG (parent company), PSE&G and Energy Holdings, respectively.

Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds

     Contributions made to the Nuclear  Decommissioning Trust Funds are invested
in debt and equity  securities.  The carrying values of these funds  approximate
their fair market values.

(A)    Excludes the impact of the  extraordinary  charge  recorded in the second
       and third quarters of 1999. The associated income tax benefits  resulting
       from the extraordinary charge had an effective income tax rate of 30.04%.
       The effective rate is below the statutory rate of 40.85% primarily due to
       some of the income tax benefits  being flowed  through to  ratepayers  in
       prior  periods under  regulated  accounting  methods.  This was partially
       offset by the  investment  tax credit  being  credited  to the benefit of
       PSEG's   stockholders   pursuant  to  the  Summary  Order.   For  further
       discussion, see Note 2. Regulatory Issues.

Note 8.  Financial Information by Business Segments

Basis of Organization

     The reportable segments disclosed herein were determined based on a variety
of factors  including  the  regulatory  environment  of each of PSEG's  lines of
business  and the types of products  and services  offered.  Effective  with the
unbundling  of  PSE&G's  rates on  August 1,  1999 and the  deregulation  of the
electric generation portion of PSE&G's business,  the basis of segment reporting
has changed  beginning with the third quarter of 1999. The generation and energy
trading  portions of PSE&G's  business  are now  separate  reportable  segments,
whereas  they  previously  had been  part of the  Electric  segment.  Note  that
estimates have been used to separate  historical,  pre- August 1, 1999, electric
segment data into the Generation,  Energy  Resources and Trade, and Transmission
and Distribution segments of PSE&G's business.
<PAGE>
     Generation

     The generation  segment of PSE&G's  business earns revenue through the sale
of its energy and capacity.  This segment consists of the power plants that will
be sold to Fossil and Nuclear.

     Energy Resources and Trade

     The Energy  Resources and Trade segment of PSE&G's  business earns revenues
through a variety of  wholesale  energy and capacity  sales and other  ancillary
services.

     Transmission and Distribution (T&D)

     This segment  represents  regulated utility services provided by PSE&G. The
electric  transmission  and  electric  and gas  distribution  segment of PSE&G's
business  generates  revenue from its tariffs  under which it provides  electric
transmission  and  electric  and  gas  distribution   services  to  residential,
commercial  and  industrial  customers  in New  Jersey.  The rates  charged  for
electric transmission are regulated by FERC while the rates charged for electric
and gas distribution are regulated by the BPU.  Revenues are also generated from
a variety  of other  activities  such as sundry  sales,  wholesale  transmission
services and other miscellaneous services.

     Resources

     Resources earns revenues from its passive  investments in leveraged leases,
limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds and marketable securities.

     Global

     Global earns  revenues from its  investment in and operation of projects in
the   generation   and   distribution   of   energy,   both   domestically   and
internationally.

     Other

     PSEG's other  activities  generate  revenues from Energy  Technologies  and
Enterprise Group  Development  Corporation  (EGDC).  Energy  Technologies  earns
revenues from energy sales and a variety of energy related services  provided to
industrial and commercial  customers to reduce costs and improve  related energy
efficiencies.  EGDC,  which has been  conducting a controlled exit from the real
estate business since 1993, earns revenues from its  nonresidential  real estate
property management  business.  Other activities also include amounts applicable
to PSEG, the parent  corporation,  and Energy Holdings,  excluding Resources and
Global.

Note 9.  Accounting Matters

     In June  1999,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  137,  "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities--Deferral  of the  Effective  Date of FASB
Statement  No.  133"  (SFAS  137) to  defer  the  effective  date  of SFAS  133,
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities"  (SFAS 133) for
one year.  Consequently,  SFAS 133 will now be effective for all fiscal quarters
beginning  after January 1, 2001. The FASB also decided to defer by one year the
transition date regarding embedded derivatives in SFAS 133.

(A)    Excludes the impact of the  extraordinary  charge  recorded in the second
       and third quarters of 1999. The associated income tax benefits  resulting
       from the extraordinary charge had an effective income tax rate of 30.04%.
       The effective rate is below the statutory rate of 40.85% primarily due to
       some of the income tax benefits  being flowed  through to  ratepayers  in
       prior  periods under  regulated  accounting  methods.  This was partially
       offset by the  investment  tax credit  being  credited  to the benefit of
       PSEG's   stockholders   pursuant  to  the  Summary  Order.   For  further
       discussion, see Note 2. Regulatory Issues.

reported in the Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated  (PSEG) 1998 Annual
Report on Form 10-K,  the Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended

affecting the consolidated  financial condition and the results of operations of
PSEG and its subsidiaries.  This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial
Statements  (Statements) and related Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements
(Notes)  of PSEG and  should be read in  conjunction  with such  Statements  and
Notes.

Overview and Future Outlook

     The electric and gas utility industries in the United States and around the
world continue to experience  significant change.  Deregulation,  restructuring,
privatization and  consolidation are creating  opportunities and risks for PSEG,
Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG Power LLC (Power) and PSEG
Energy Holdings Inc. (Energy Holdings).  At the same time, competitive pressures
are increasing.

     Following the passage of the New Jersey  Electric  Discount and Competition
Act (Energy  Competition  Act), the New Jersey Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)
rendered  its summary  decision  relating to PSE&G's rate  unbundling,  stranded
costs and restructuring  proceedings  (Summary Order) and subsequently  issued a
Final Decision and Order (Final Order) in these matters.  The Energy Competition
Act, the BPU's Summary Order and Final Order and the related BPU proceedings are
hereinafter  referred to as the Energy Master Plan  Proceedings  (Energy  Master
Plan Proceedings). These proceedings provide that all New Jersey retail electric
customers may select their electric  supplier  commencing August 1, 1999 and all
New  Jersey  retail  gas  customers  may select  their gas  supplier  commencing
December 31, 1999, thus opening the New Jersey energy markets to competition.

     In October and  November  1999,  two Notices of Appeal of each of the Final
Order and of the BPU's order approving PSE&G's petition relating to the proposed
securitization transaction for an irrevocable Bondable Stranded Costs Rate Order
(Finance Order) were filed in the Appellate  Division of the New Jersey Superior
Court on behalf of several  ratepayers.  While PSEG and PSE&G  believe  that the
appeals are without  merit,  no  assurances  can be given at this time as to the
timing or outcome of these proceedings.  Accordingly, neither PSEG nor PSE&G are
able to predict  whether  such appeals  will have a material  adverse  effect on
their financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

     After analysis of the Summary Order,  PSE&G concluded that it no longer met
the  requirements  of  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) 71,
"Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation"  (SFAS 71), for the
electric generation portion of its business.  As a result,  PSE&G recorded a net
extraordinary  charge to  earnings  of $790  million,  net of tax, in the second
quarter of 1999.  In the third  quarter of 1999,  PSE&G  revised  the  estimates
inherent in the  extraordinary  charge and  recorded an  additional  $14 million
extraordinary  charge.  This  extraordinary  charge  reflects the  impairment of
PSE&G's  electric   generation-related   assets  and  related  fuel,  equipment,
materials and supplies,  calculated in accordance with SFAS 121, "Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of"
(SFAS 121). The extraordinary charge also included recording certain liabilities
stemming from the deregulation of PSE&G's electric generation business.

     For further discussion of the Energy Master Plan Proceedings  including the
appeals, the related  extraordinary  charge to earnings and securitization,  see
Note 2. Regulatory Issues and Note 3. Extraordinary  Charge and Other Accounting
Impacts of Deregulation of Notes and Liquidity and Capital Resources.


<PAGE>
     As  set  forth  in  the  Final   Order,   PSE&G  will  sell  its   electric
generation-related  assets  and  all  associated  rights  and  liabilities  to a
separate  corporate entity to be owned by PSEG. The Final Order specifies a sale
price of $2.443 billion plus the book value of PSE&G's other  generation-related
assets,  including  materials,  supplies  and fuel,  currently  estimated  to be
between $200 million and $400 million.  To effectuate  the sale,  PSEG organized
Power, a Delaware limited  liability company (LLC), as a wholly owned subsidiary
in June 1999.  Power,  and its  subsidiaries,  PSEG Fossil LLC (Fossil) and PSEG
Nuclear   LLC   (Nuclear),    will   acquire   and   manage   PSE&G's   electric
generation-related assets. Power's subsidiaries, Fossil, Nuclear and PSEG Energy
Resources  & Trade LLC  (ER&T),  are also  Delaware  LLCs.  Assuming a favorable
outcome of the appeals,  PSEG and PSE&G expect that the sale of such assets will
occur in the first half of 2000. Prior to the execution of such sale, Power must
obtain  approval  from the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  (NRC) (to  transfer
PSE&G's licenses), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)
and the Pennsylvania  Public Utility Commission  (PAPUC). In September 1999, the
Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC) approved PSE&G's proposed sale of
its generating units to Power and its subsidiaries.

     The Final Order  requires PSE&G to provide basic  generation  service (BGS)
for all  customers  who do not  elect a  different  service  provider.  Once the
generation-related  asset sale to Power is complete,  pursuant to a  contractual
relationship,  Power,  through  ER&T,  will  provide  PSE&G  with the energy and
capacity  required  to  meet  its  BGS  and  off-tariff  rate  agreement  (OTRA)
obligations.  ER&T will provide such energy and capacity  under the BGS contract
rate for the first three years of the  transition  period,  beginning  August 1,
1999. BGS will be competitively bid for the fourth year and thereafter. Once the
generation-related  asset sale to Power is  complete,  pursuant  to  contractual
relationships,  ER&T will obtain the energy and  capacity to supply  PSE&G's BGS
and OTRA requirements from its affiliates,  Nuclear and Fossil,  supplemented as
necessary with energy purchased in the competitive wholesale electricity market.
Power's  earnings and its contribution to PSEG's earnings will be exposed to the
risks of the competitive  wholesale  electricity market to the extent that Power
has  to  purchase  energy  and/or  capacity  or  generate  energy  to  meet  its
obligations  to supply power to PSE&G at market  prices or costs,  respectively,
which   approach   or  exceed   the  BGS  or  OTRA   contract   rates  (see  PJM
Interconnection,  LLC and Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About
Market  Risk).  ER&T's  policy  will be to use  derivatives  to manage this risk
consistent  with its  business  plans and  prudent  practices.  Power  will also
participate in the competitive wholesale electricity market for other items such
as energy, capacity and ancillary services.

     The Energy Master Plan Proceedings have  dramatically  reshaped the utility
industry in New Jersey and have directly affected how PSEG will conduct business
and  therefore,  its financial  prospects in the future.  PSEG is realigning its
organizational structure to address the competitive environment brought about by
the  deregulation of the electric  generation  industry in New Jersey.  PSEG had
been engaged in the  competitive  energy  business for a number of years through
certain of its unregulated  subsidiaries and, in 1998,  generated  approximately
10% of its earnings  from these  subsidiaries.  However,  due to the  regulatory
changes  outlined  above,  competitive  businesses will constitute a much larger
portion of PSEG's  activities  going  forward.  It is expected  that by July 31,
2003, the end of the transition period under the Energy Master Plan Proceedings,
PSEG's  unregulated  subsidiaries  (comprised of Energy Holdings and Power) will
contribute  between 60% and 70% of PSEG's earnings.  Additionally,  PSEG will be
more dependent on cash flows generated from its  unregulated  operations for its
capital needs.  As the  unregulated  portion of the business  continues to grow,
potential  financial risks and rewards will be greater,  financial  requirements
will change and the volatility of earnings and cash flows will increase.

         Going forward,  PSEG will continue to pursue its strategies to grow its
family of energy-related  businesses. As previously reported, more emphasis will
be placed on finding  opportunities  for  expansion  outside of its  traditional
utility services and markets.  Power's business strategy is to size its fleet of
generation  assets to take advantage of market  opportunities,  while seeking to
increase its value and manage commodity price risk through its wholesale trading
activity.   PSE&G's  transmission  and  distribution  objective,  both  gas  and
electric, is to provide cost-effective, high quality, reliable service. PSEG has
positioned  Energy Holdings as a major part of its planned growth  strategy.  In
order to  achieve  this  strategy,  PSEG  Global  Inc.  (Global)  will  focus on
generation and distribution  investments within targeted  high-growth regions of
the worldwide  energy market.  PSEG Resources Inc.  (Resources) will utilize its
market access,  industry knowledge and transaction  structuring  capabilities to
<PAGE>
expand  its  energy-related   financial   investment   portfolio.   PSEG  Energy
Technologies  Inc.  (Energy  Technologies)  will  continue  to provide  heating,
ventilating and air  conditioning  (HVAC)  contracting and other  energy-related
services to industrial and commercial  customers in the  Northeastern and Middle
Atlantic  United  States.  However,  Energy  Holdings  will  assess  the  growth
prospects and opportunities for Energy Technologies'  business before committing
additional  capital.  Energy  Technologies plans to grow existing operations and
utilize the  recently  acquired  companies  to deliver  expanded  energy-related
services  and  products,  including  gas and  electricity,  to existing  and new
customers.  In addition to internal growth, PSEG expects to pursue opportunities
for expansion through business combinations.

         To the extent  that the  discussion  that  follows  reports on business
conducted  under full monopoly  regulation of the utility  business,  it must be
understood  that  such  business  has  evolved  due to the  deregulation  of the
electric  generation  business.  Past  results are not an  indication  of future
business prospects or financial results.

</TABLE>

     Basic and diluted  earnings per share of PSEG common stock  (Common  Stock)
were $0.95 for the quarter ended September 30, 1999, representing an increase of
$0.17 per share from the comparable 1998 period.  Basic and diluted earnings per
share of Common Stock were $(0.97) for the nine months ended September 30, 1999,
representing a decrease of $3.10 per share from the comparable 1998 period.

     In the second quarter of 1999,  PSE&G recorded an  extraordinary  charge to
earnings of $790 million,  net of tax, as a result of the BPU's Summary Order in
the Energy Master Plan Proceedings.  In the third quarter of 1999, PSE&G revised
the estimates  inherent in the  extraordinary  charge and recorded an additional
$14 million extraordinary charge. For further discussion, see Note 2. Regulatory
Issues  and  Note 3.  Extraordinary  Charge  and  Other  Accounting  Impacts  of
Deregulation of Notes.  Excluding that extraordinary  charge,  basic and diluted
earnings  per share of Common Stock were $1.01 for the quarter  ended  September
30, 1999,  representing  an increase of $0.23 per share over the comparable 1998
period and $2.68 for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  representing an
increase of $0.55 per share over the comparable 1998 period.
<PAGE>
     Excluding the extraordinary  charge,  PSE&G's  contribution to earnings per
share of Common Stock for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 was flat with the
comparable 1998 period.  Although PSE&G's contribution to earnings per share was
flat,  PSE&G's  net income was down by $12  million or $0.05 per share of Common
Stock as compared to the same period in 1998. The decrease in net income for the
quarter  ended  September  30,  1999  was  offset  by the  impact  of the  stock
repurchase  program with fewer shares  outstanding  in 1999 as compared to 1998.
The decrease in net income was due to decreased  electric revenues due to the 5%
rate reduction, beginning August 1, 1999, associated with the Energy Master Plan
Proceedings,  and higher  operating and  maintenance  expenses  attributable  to
several  factors,  including  restoration  work required in the wake of Tropical
Storm  Floyd  and  the  flooding   and  damage  it  caused,   a  change  in  the
capitalization  policy for PSE&G's electric  generation business and the effects
of depreciation policy changes stemming from the discontinuation of SFAS 71 (see
Note 1. Basis of  Presentation/Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies of
Notes).  This decrease was partially  offset by an improvement in electric sales
volumes  due  to  hot  summer  weather  in  1999  and  lower  generation-related
depreciation  expenses  due to the  lower net book  value of  generation-related
assets as a result of the SFAS 121 write-down.

     Excluding the extraordinary  charge,  PSE&G's  contribution to earnings per
share of Common Stock for the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999  increased
$0.33 from the  comparable  1998 period,  including  $0.12 as a result of PSEG's
stock repurchase  program.  The increase for the nine months ended September 30,
1999 was primarily due to increased sales of gas and electricity  resulting from
favorable  weather  conditions in 1999 augmented by positive economic factors in
New Jersey and profits realized from wholesale energy  activities.  In addition,
generation-related   depreciation  expenses  were  lower  as  a  result  of  the
impairment write-down, partially offset by a change in the capitalization policy
for PSE&G's electric  generation business and the effects of depreciation policy
changes stemming from the  discontinuation  of SFAS 71. The increase in earnings
was also partially  offset by the 5% rate reduction  discussed  above and higher
operating and maintenance expenses, including higher transmission,  distribution
and  wholesale  energy  costs,  than those  incurred  in the nine  months  ended
September 30, 1998.

     Energy Holdings' contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for the
quarter and nine months  ended  September  30,  1999  increased  $0.23 and $0.22
including $0.01 as a result of PSEG's stock  repurchase  program,  respectively,
from  the  comparable  1998  periods,   primarily  due  to  the  better  overall
performance of Resources, Global and Energy Technologies.  The improvements were
attributable largely to Resources which benefited from an upturn in the equities
markets as compared to the same period in 1998.  In addition,  Energy  Holdings'
results  reflect  Global's gain from the sale of its interest in a co-generation
facility  in  Newark,  New  Jersey,  partially  offset by  write-downs  of other
investments in Global's portfolio.

     As a result of PSEG's  stock  repurchase  program  which began in September
1998,  earnings  per share of Common Stock for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 1999 increased $0.05 and $0.13, respectively,  from the comparable
1998 periods.  As of September 30, 1999,  approximately  13.2 million shares had
been repurchased at a cost of approximately $516 million under this program.

PSE&G -- Revenues

     The presentation of revenues on the  Consolidated  Statements of Income has
changed effective August 1, 1999, due to the change in regulation as required by
the Final Order.  PSE&G's generation business has been deregulated and, starting
August 1, 1999, earns revenues by providing the energy and capacity necessary to
meet  PSE&G's  BGS and OTRA  obligations  as well as by a variety  of  wholesale
energy and capacity sales and other ancillary services. PSE&G's transmission and
distribution  businesses  remain  regulated  and will  continue to earn revenues
based on its  tariffs  under  which it provides  transmission  and  distribution
services for its residential, commercial and industrial customers in New Jersey.
The rates charged for  transmission  and  distribution are regulated by FERC and
the BPU,  respectively.  Revenues  are also  generated  from a variety  of other
activities  such as sundry  sales,  wholesale  transmission  services  and other
miscellaneous   services.  For  more  information  on  the  Energy  Master  Plan
Proceedings, see Note 1. Basis of Presentation/Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Note 2. Regulatory Issues of Notes. Because historical  information
is not  available  for the Electric  Generation  and Electric  Transmission  and
Distribution  Revenues,  variances in Electric Revenues will be discussed in the
aggregate.   For  estimates  of  historical  Electric  Generation  and  Electric
Transmission and  Distribution  Revenues,  see Note 8. Financial  Information by
Business Segments of Notes.
<PAGE>
     Certain of the below listed year to year variances did not impact  earnings
as there was an offsetting  variance in expense.  To the extent fuel revenue and
expense flowed through the Electric  Levelized Energy  Adjustment  Clause (LEAC)
through July 31, 1999, the Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC),  the Societal
Benefits Clause (SBC) or the non-utility  generation  market  transition  charge
(NTC) mechanisms, variances in certain revenues and expenses offset and thus had
no direct effect on earnings.  These include base fuel revenues through July 31,
1999,  demand side management  (DSM) revenue and Remediation  Adjustment  Charge
(RAC) revenue.  On August 1, 1999, the LEAC mechanism was eliminated as a result
of the Energy  Master  Plan  Proceedings.  This is likely to  increase  earnings
volatility  since  PSE&G now bears the full  risks and  rewards  of  changes  in

Energy Master Plan Proceedings.

     Electric

     Revenues increased $32 million or 3% and $136 million or 4% for the quarter
and nine months ended  September 30, 1999 from the  comparable  periods in 1998,
respectively, primarily due to favorable weather conditions in 1999 augmented by
positive economic factors in New Jersey. These factors increased both generation
and transmission and distribution revenues;  however, the increase in generation
revenues was partially  offset by the 5% rate reduction,  discussed  below.  The
increase in the nine  months  ended  September  30, 1999 was also due to profits
realized from wholesale  energy  activities  being higher than in the comparable
1998 period.  Also,  higher DSM revenues in the nine months ended  September 30,
1999 than in the comparable  1998 period  contributed to increased  distribution
revenues.

     On August 18,  1999,  the BPU approved  PSE&G's  compliance  tariff  filing
reflecting the 5% decrease in rates.  On August 1, 1999,  PSE&G had  implemented
this rate reduction  previously  approved on a provisional  basis. In 1999, this
rate reduction is expected to decrease  generation revenues by approximately $80
million.  For the  schedule of future rate  reductions  mandated by the BPU, see
Note  2.  Regulatory  Issues  of  Notes.  Additionally,  the  probable  loss  of
generation  customers  through the opening of  competition  could reduce  future
revenues. However, this could create the opportunity for the generation business
to sell available energy and capacity into the wholesale  market.  The degree to
which  generation  revenues  will be impacted will depend on the amount by which
prices to wholesale customers vary from prices under the BGS contract.  Further,
although  the  probable  loss  of  retail   customers   will  not  impact  total
transmission  revenues,  the  mix  of  revenues  from  retail  versus  wholesale
customers, including third party suppliers, will change.

     Gas

     Revenues  increased  $17  million  or 9% and  $110  million  or 10% for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999 from the comparable  periods in
1998, respectively.  The increases were primarily due to increased revenues from
gas  service  contracts  and higher  sales to large  commercial  and  industrial
customers  than in the  comparable  periods  in  1998.  Additionally,  favorable
weather in the first and second  quarters of 1999  contributed to the increases.
The potential loss of residential customers due to the opening of competition in
2000 could reduce future revenues.

PSE&G -- Expenses

     Electric Energy Costs

     Electric  Energy Costs  increased  $36 million or 13% and $36 million or 5%
for the quarter and nine months  ended  September  30, 1999 from the  comparable
1998 periods,  respectively.  The increases were primarily due to an increase in
electric  sales volumes due to hot summer  weather in 1999.  Beginning in August
1999, higher prices for power purchases also contributed to the increase.
<PAGE>
     Due to the  elimination  of the LEAC on August 1,  1999,  these  historical
trends are not to be considered an indication of future  Electric  Energy Costs.
Given the elimination of the LEAC, the lifting of the requirements that electric
energy  offered  for sale in the PJM  Interconnection,  LLC (PJM) not exceed the
variable cost of producing such energy and that such transactions are now capped
at $1,000 per megawatt-hour (MWH) (see Competitive Environment),  the absence of
a PJM price cap in situations  involving  emergency  purchases and the potential
for plant outages;  price  movements  could have a material impact on PSEG's and
PSE&G's  financial  condition,  results of operations  or net cash flows.  For a
discussion of market risks, see Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures
About  Market  Risk.  Additionally,  it is expected  that the  probable  loss of
customers through the opening of competition could reduce future expenses.

     Gas Costs

     Gas Costs  increased $14 million or 11% for the quarter ended September 30,
1999 from the comparable 1998 period due to higher sales to large commercial and
industrial  customers than in the comparable 1998 period. Gas Costs for the nine
months ended  September  30, 1999  increased  $43 million or 6% primarily due to
increased  sales of gas  resulting  from colder  weather in the first and second
quarters  of  1999.  It is  expected  that  the  potential  loss of  residential
customers  due to the  opening  of  competition  in  2000  could  reduce  future
expenses.

     Operation and Maintenance

     Operation  and  Maintenance  expense  increased $58 million or 18% and $150
million or 15% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999 from the
comparable 1998 periods,  respectively. The increase was primarily due to higher
transmission  and  distribution  costs,  including  higher  material and outside
services in 1999,  attributable to several factors,  including  restoration work
required in the wake of Tropical Storm Floyd and higher  information  technology
costs,  including  costs  related  to Year  2000  readiness.  The  change in the
capitalization  policy for PSE&G's  electric  generation  business caused higher
Operation and Maintenance expense as did higher costs related to wholesale power
activities.  Also  contributing  to the increase were higher fringe benefits and
higher costs associated with the preparation for deregulation.  Additionally, in
the nine  months  ended  September  30,  1999,  there  were  higher  Other  Post
Retirement  Benefits (OPEB) costs incurred and higher DSM recovery of previously
deferred expenses.

     With an increasingly  competitive energy market as an outcome of the Energy
Master Plan Proceedings and energy industry  restructuring,  the composition and
level of Operation and  Maintenance  expense is likely to change.  Additionally,
the change in capitalization policy will likely yield a material increase in the
Operation  and  Maintenance  expenses  associated  with the electric  generation
business (see Note 1. Basis of  Presentation/Summary  of Significant  Accounting
Policies of Notes).  This increase in Operation and  Maintenance  expense is not
expected to exceed $85 million per year and will be offset by lower depreciation
expense in the  future due to the lower  level of  expenditures  capitalized  to
electric generation assets.

     Depreciation and Amortization

     Depreciation and Amortization  expense decreased $40 million or 25% and $73
million or 15% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1999 from the
comparable 1998 periods,  respectively. The decreases were due to lower net book
value  balances of PSE&G's  generation-related  assets  which were reduced as of
April 1, 1999 as a result of the impairment  calculated and recorded pursuant to
SFAS 121. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation rates for
generation-related  assets used in the second and third  quarters of 1999 due to
the change in  depreciation  policy for  generation-related  assets (see Note 1.
Basis of  Presentation/Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes). The
decreases  were  partially  offset by higher  depreciation  expense  related  to
capital additions to the transmission and distribution business.

     Despite the higher  depreciation rates for  generation-related  assets, the
net decrease in generation-related depreciation expense will continue due to the
reduced asset balances. Such reductions are currently anticipated to approximate
$230 million per year.  Additionally,  beginning in 2000, electric  distribution
asset-related  depreciation  will be further reduced due to the  amortization of
the excess  electric  distribution  depreciation  reserve  over the period  from
January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003. See Note 4. Regulatory  Assets and Liabilities
of Notes for a discussion of the amortization schedule.  Once the securitization
transaction  is complete,  the regulatory  asset  recorded for PSE&G's  stranded
costs will be amortized  with such  amortization  expense  partially  offsetting
these decreases.
<PAGE>

     Income Taxes

     Income Taxes  decreased $7 million or 4% and  increased  $38 million or 11%
for the quarter and nine months  ended  September  30, 1999 from the  comparable
1998 periods,  respectively. The increase in the nine months ended September 30,
1999 is primarily due to higher pre-tax operating income.

</TABLE>

     Energy Holdings' earnings (losses) for the quarter ended September 30, 1999
and 1998 were $18  million and $(35)  million,  respectively.  Energy  Holdings'
earnings for the nine months ended  September 30, 1999 and 1998 were $63 million
and $15 million,  respectively.  The increases in Energy Holdings' earnings were
primarily due to the better overall performance of Resources,  Global and Energy
Technologies.  The  improvements  were  attributable  largely to Resources which
benefited from an upturn in the equities  markets as compared to the same period
in 1998. In addition,  Energy  Holdings'  results reflect Global's gain from the
sale of its interest in a Newark, New Jersey co-generation  facility,  partially
offset by write-downs on other investments in Global's portfolio.

     Additionally,  higher earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 1999
were  primarily  due to  investment  gains in  Resources'  financial  investment
portfolio  and income from new capital  leases.  Improved  revenue at Global was
partially offset by higher expenses associated with project development.  Energy
Technologies'  losses  narrowed due to higher  revenues from recent  acquisition
activities partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Energy Holdings -- Revenues

     Revenues  increased  $118  million to $148 million from $30 million for the
quarter  ended  September  30, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998.  The
increase was  primarily  due to a $60 million  increase in revenues at Resources
primarily due to improved  market  conditions  benefiting  Resources'  financial
investments and a $49 million increase in revenues at Energy Technologies due to
the addition of revenues from acquisitions in 1999.

     Revenues  increased  $131 million to $416 million from $285 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998. The
increase was due to an increase of $44 million at Resources due to higher income
from financial investments and higher income from new capital lease investments,
a $71 million increase in revenues at Energy Technologies due to the addition of
revenues  from  acquisitions  in 1999 and a $17 million  increase in revenues at
Global  primarily due to improvement in revenues from the electric  distribution
companies in Brazil and  Argentina as well as the addition of revenues  from the
energy distribution  companies in Chile and Peru acquired in June 1999. Global's
revenue includes its share of the net income from joint ventures  recorded under
the equity method of accounting.
<PAGE>
     Global  is a 50%  partner  in  six  generating  facilities  in  California.
Beginning in 2000,  revenue from these  facilities  will be reduced due to lower
energy prices to be paid by the purchaser under the energy contracts  associated
with the plants.  Energy  prices under such  contracts  will be reduced from the
current fixed rates to short-run  avoided cost (SRAC) energy prices  approved by
the California Public Utilities  Commission  (CPUC). The CPUC is considering the
issue of transitioning  SRAC energy payments under contracts of this type to the
clearing price of the California Power Exchange (PX).  Although the CPUC has not
yet initiated a proceeding,  Global  anticipates  that eventually  energy prices
under these  contracts will be based upon the PX clearing  price.  Two-thirds of
the primary  California  facilities  in which Global has an interest will change
from fixed energy pricing by December 31, 2000,  with the remainder  changing in
2001. Both the SRAC and the PX energy prices are currently  substantially  lower
than the fixed energy prices charged in these  contracts.  Based on current SRAC
and PX energy  prices,  Global's share of annual income before income taxes from
these  facilities is projected to decrease by  approximately  $30 million to $35
million  when all such  contracts  reflect  the  lower  energy  pricing.  Actual
revenues over the remaining  contract terms, which begin to expire in 2011, will
depend on a number of factors,  including  the actual energy prices in effect in
the applicable future periods. Global's projects in operation,  construction and
development  are  expected  to  offset  this  revenue  shortfall;   however,  no
assurances of that result can be given.

Energy Holdings -- Expenses

     Operation and Maintenance

     Operation and Maintenance expense increased $52 million to $91 million from
$39  million for the quarter  ended  September  30, 1999 as compared to the same
period in 1998.  Operation and Maintenance expense increased $69 million to $190
million  from $121  million  for the nine  months  ended  September  30, 1999 as
compared to the same period in 1998.  The  increases  were  primarily due to the
addition of expenses from the entities acquired by Energy  Technologies and to a
lesser degree, by higher development expenses at Global.

     Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends

     Interest  Expense  and  Preferred  Dividends  increased  $6  million to $31
million from $25 million for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 as compared to
the same period in 1998.  Interest Expense and Preferred  Dividends increased $5
million to $84 million from $79 million for the nine months ended  September 30,
1999 as compared to the same period in 1998. The increases were primarily due to
financing 1999 investment and acquisition activity.

     Income Taxes

     Income Taxes  increased  $27 million to $14 million from $(13)  million for
the  quarter  ended  September  30, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998.
Income Taxes  increased $28 million to $44 million from $16 million for the nine
months  ended  September  30, 1999 as  compared to the same period in 1998.  The
increases  were  primarily  due to higher  pre-tax  income for the quarter ended
September 30, 1999.

Energy Holdings -- Other Income (Loss)

     Other Income  (Loss)  increased  $20 million to $21 million from $1 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 1999 as compared to the same period in 1998.
Other Income  increased  $22 million to $28 million from $6 million for the nine
months  ended  September  30, 1999 as  compared to the same period in 1998.  The
increases  were  primarily  due to a gain on the sale of Global's  interest in a
co-generation  facility in Newark,  New Jersey,  as discussed  above,  partially
offset by write-downs on other investments, as discussed below.

     In the third quarter of 1999,  Global  completed a comprehensive  review of
its existing assets and development  activities  focusing on  rationalizing  the
portfolio to ensure efficient capital deployment. As part of this review, Global
assessed  the  present  carrying  value  of  its  equity   investments  in  such
activities.  Global's  management has decided that it will not commit additional
resources to its  investments in Thailand and the Philippines and will focus its
current Asian development  activities in China. As a result,  Global recorded an
$8 million  write-down,  net of tax, in the third  quarter of 1999 to adjust the
carrying  value of these  assets  to net  realizable  value.  In  addition,  the
projected  substantial  decline in revenue,  discussed above,  related to energy
contracts for six generation  facilities in California resulted in a $19 million
write-down,  net of tax, of Global's equity investment in such facilities in the
third quarter of 1999.
<PAGE>
PSEG -- Preferred Securities Dividend Requirements of Subsidiaries

     Preferred Securities Dividend  Requirements  increased $1 million or 5% and
$13 million or 23% for the quarter and nine months ended  September  30, 1999 as
compared to the same  periods in 1998.  The  increase was due to the issuance of
trust preferred  securities by three special purpose  statutory  business trusts
controlled by PSEG, Enterprise Capital Trust I, II and III, in January, June and
July 1998 of $525 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     PSEG and PSE&G

     PSEG is a holding  company and, as such,  has no operations of its own. The
following  discussion  of  PSEG's  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  on  a
consolidated  basis,  noting  the uses and  contributions  of PSEG's  two direct
operating subsidiaries, PSE&G and Energy Holdings.

     PSEG and PSE&G believe that the  deregulation of the utility  industry will
impact  the  sources  and uses of cash  going  forward.  Also,  as a  result  of
deregulation  and  related  corporate  structure  reorganizations,  the  capital
structure of PSEG will likely change with a likely  increase in debt levels.  As
of  September  30,  1999,  PSEG's  capital  structure  consisted of 40.7% common
equity,  47.2%  long-term  debt and 12.1%  preferred  stock and other  preferred
securities.  As of September 30, 1999,  PSE&G's capital  structure  consisted of
48.7% common equity,  42.4%  long-term  debt and 8.9% preferred  stock and other
preferred securities.  The BPU, in the Final Order, required that the use of the
net  proceeds  of  securitization  shall  be  done in a  manner  that  will  not
substantially alter PSE&G's overall capital structure.

     On September 17, 1999,  the BPU issued its Finance Order which  authorized,
among other things, the imposition of a non-bypassable transition bond charge on
PSE&G's customers;  the sale of PSE&G's property right in such charge created by
the Energy Competition Act to a bankruptcy-remote financing entity; the issuance
and sale of  $2.525  billion  of  transition  bonds by such  entity  in  payment
therefor,  including an estimated  $125 million of  transaction  costs;  and the
application by PSE&G of the transition bond proceeds to retire  outstanding debt
and/or  equity.  Assuming a  favorable  outcome of the  appeals,  PSEG and PSE&G
expect such sale of  transition  bonds and receipt of  proceeds  therefrom  will
occur in the first half of 2000.

     For a discussion of the pending  appeals of the Final Order and the Finance
Order, see Note 2. Regulatory Issues of Notes.

     Both the right of PSE&G to receive the bondable  transition charge pursuant
to the  securitization  transaction  and  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  of its
generation-related  assets to Power are property  subject to the lien of PSE&G's
First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage). All such property will be released from
the lien of the Mortgage at the time of sale. In accordance  with the provisions
of the Mortgage,  the net proceeds from the sale of such released  property will
be deposited with the Trustee.

     As previously  reported,  the Mortgage  authorizes PSE&G to exercise one or
more of the following options as to the application of proceeds of such released
property, at its sole discretion:

     1.   Withdraw   funds  for  corporate   use  by  utilizing   additions  and
          improvements. (Option 1)

     2.   Direct  the  Trustee  to  invest  the  proceeds  in  U.S.   Government
          Securities. (Option 2)
<PAGE>
     3.   Direct the Trustee to purchase its Mortgage Bonds at the lowest prices
          obtainable,  at or below  par  value.  If the  Trustee  is  unable  to
          purchase  sufficient Mortgage Bonds to exhaust such proceeds deposited
          with it, the  balance  may be applied on a pro rata basis  towards the
          redemption of eligible  series of Mortgage  Bonds  outstanding at par.
          (Option 3)

     At September 30, 1999,  PSE&G had a total of $3.9 billion of Mortgage Bonds
outstanding,  of which  $3.105  billion are taxable  registered  Mortgage  Bonds
subject to  special  redemption  provisions,  outlined  in Option 3  (Redeemable
Bonds).  At October 31,  1999,  PSE&G had a total of $3.729  billion of Mortgage
Bonds  outstanding,  of which $2.934 billion are Redeemable  Bonds (see External
Financings).  $624  million of these  Redeemable  Bonds are  scheduled to mature
within  twelve  months.  $780  million of the  Mortgage  Bonds  outstanding  are
tax-exempt  Pollution  Control  Bonds and $15  million are two series of taxable
coupon Mortgage Bonds due 2037 (Coupon Bonds).  Both the Pollution Control Bonds
and the Coupon Bonds are not subject to Option 3.

     PSE&G has not yet made a final  decision as to the amount and the manner in
which it will retire or redeem its Mortgage Bonds.  Such a decision will be made
on or about  the  time  the  proceeds  from  securitization  and the sale of the
generation-related  assets to Power are deposited with the Trustee, on the basis
of market conditions and other factors existing at that time. However,  based on
current information,  a likely utilization of the options available to PSE&G, as
noted above, could be as follows:

     1.   Withdraw $2.4 billion of net proceeds from securitization under Option
          1, above. These proceeds would be used to:

          (a)  Tender for all Coupon Bonds;

          (b)  Redeem $126.5 million of Pollution Control Bonds now redeemable;

          (c)  Retire up to an  additional  $300  million  of  Redeemable  Bonds
               through various means, such as maturities,  open market purchases
               and make-whole calls;

          (d)  Reduce PSE&G's short-term debt; and

          (e)  Reduce PSE&G common and/or  preferred  equity with the balance of
               proceeds, if any.

     2.   Apply   proceeds   ($2.4   billion   to   $2.8   billion)   from   the
          generation-related  asset  sale to Power  under  Option 3 against  any
          remaining taxable Mortgage Bonds outstanding.

     As previously reported, in anticipation of securitization,  PSEG's Board of
Directors  authorized  the repurchase of up to an aggregate of 20 million shares
of Common Stock in the open  market.  The  repurchased  shares have been held as
treasury stock. At September 30, 1999, PSEG had repurchased  approximately  13.2
million shares of Common Stock at a cost of  approximately  $516 million,  under
these authorizations. As of October 31, 1999, PSEG had repurchased approximately
13.6 million  shares of Common Stock at a cost of  approximately  $532  million.
Market  conditions and the availability of alternative  investments will dictate
if and  when  more  shares  of  Common  Stock  will be  repurchased  under  this
authorization.

     Going forward,  cash generated from PSE&G's regulated  business is expected
to provide  the  majority  of the funds for PSE&G's  regulated  business  needs.
Power's  capital  needs will be dictated by its strategy to size its  generation
fleet, and will likely require cash generated from external  financings,  equity
infusions  from  PSEG  and  cash  generated  from   operations  to  support  its
anticipated  growth.  Energy  Holdings'  growth will be funded through  external
financings, equity infusions from PSEG and cash generated from operations.

     Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock  were  $1.62  per  share  and  totaled
approximately  $357 million and $376 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Amounts and dates of such dividends on Common
Stock as may be declared in the future will necessarily be dependent upon PSEG's
future earnings,  cash flows,  financial  requirements,  the receipt of dividend
payments from its  subsidiaries  and other factors.  Since 1986,  PSE&G has made
regular cash payments to PSEG in the form of dividends on outstanding  shares of
PSE&G's  common stock.  PSEG has not increased its dividend rates in seven years
in order to retain additional  capital for reinvestment and to reduce its payout
ratio.  PSE&G paid common  stock  dividends  of $510 million and $376 million to
PSEG during the nine months  ended  September  30, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.

<PAGE>
These amounts were used to fund PSEG's Common Stock  dividends,  and in 1999, to
support a portion of PSEG's stock repurchase  program.  Based on its analysis of
the Final Order,  PSEG believes that its dividend  payments can be maintained at
their current  level (see Note 2.  Regulatory  Issues of Notes).  In the future,
PSEG  expects  to fund its  dividend  payments  through  cash  generated  by the
operations of PSE&G and Power.  Note that due to the competitive  environment in
which Power will  operate and due to reduced  revenues at PSE&G  resulting  from
mandated rate reductions,  such dividend payments will be at a greater risk. Due
to the growth in Energy Holdings investment  activities,  no dividends on Energy
Holdings' common stock were paid in the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and
1998.

     PSEG and PSE&G have each issued Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures
in connection  with the issuance of their  respective tax  deductible  preferred
securities.  If,  and for as long  as,  payments  on those  Deferrable  Interest
Subordinated  Debentures  have been deferred,  or PSEG or PSE&G has defaulted on
the applicable indenture related thereto or its guarantee thereof,  neither PSEG
nor PSE&G may pay any  dividends  on its common or preferred  stock.  Currently,
there has been no deferral nor default.

     As a result  of the 1992  focused  audit of PSEG's  non-utility  businesses
(Focused  Audit),  the BPU approved a plan which,  among other things,  provides
that:  (1) PSEG will not permit  Energy  Holdings'  non-utility  investments  to
exceed 20% of PSEG's  consolidated  assets without prior notice to the BPU (such
investments at September 30, 1999 were approximately 21% of PSEG's  consolidated
assets);  (2) the PSE&G Board of Directors will provide an annual  certification
that the business and  financing  plans of Energy  Holdings  will not  adversely
affect  PSE&G;  (3) PSEG will (a) limit debt  supported by the minimum net worth
maintenance  agreement between PSEG and PSEG Capital  Corporation (PSEG Capital)
to $650 million and (b) make a good-faith  effort to eliminate such support over
a six to ten year period from April 1993; and (4) Energy Holdings will pay PSE&G
an  affiliation  fee of up to $2 million a year to be applied by PSE&G to reduce
utility  rates.  PSEG and  Energy  Holdings  and its  subsidiaries  continue  to
reimburse  PSE&G for the costs of all services  provided to them by employees of
PSE&G.

     Capital resources and capital  requirements will be affected by the outcome
of the Energy Master Plan Proceedings and the requirements of the Focused Audit.
As a result of the final outcome and the accounting  impacts  resulting from the
deregulation  of the generation of electricity and the unbundling of the utility
business in New Jersey,  PSEG and PSE&G do not  believe  that the Focused  Audit
provision requiring  notification of the BPU if PSEG's non-utility assets exceed
20%  of  its   consolidated   assets  remains   appropriate   and  believe  that
modifications  will be required.  The Final Order  addressed the Focused  Audit,
noted that PSEG's  non-regulated  assets would  likely  exceed 20% of total PSEG
assets  once  the  utility's  generating  assets  were  sold to a  non-regulated
subsidiary  and directed  PSE&G to file a petition  with the BPU to maintain the
existing regulatory  parameters or to propose modifications to the Focused Audit
order no later than the end of the first quarter of 2000 (see Note 2. Regulatory
Issues of  Notes).  It was also  recognized  in the  Final  Order  that,  due to
significant  changes  in the  industry  and,  in  particular,  PSEG's  corporate
structure  as a result of the Final Order,  modifications  to or relief from the
Focused Audit might be warranted.

     Regulatory  oversight by the BPU to ensure that there is no harm to utility
ratepayers from PSEG's non-utility investments is expected to continue. PSEG and
PSE&G  believe that these issues will be  satisfactorily  resolved,  although no
assurances can be given. In addition,  if PSEG were no longer to be exempt under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA),  PSEG and its subsidiaries would
be subject to  additional  regulation  by the SEC with respect to financing  and
investing activities,  including the amount and type of non-utility investments.
Inability to achieve  satisfactory  resolution of these matters could impact the
future  relative size and financing  activities of Energy Holdings and Power and
accordingly,  their future prospects.  Consequently,  this could have a material
adverse impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial condition,  results of operations
or net cash flows.  For  discussion of the Energy Master Plan  Proceedings,  see
Note 2. Regulatory Issues of Notes.

     Energy Holdings

     As noted above, it is intended that Global and Resources  provide  earnings
and cash flow for  long-term  growth for Energy  Holdings  and PSEG.  Resources'
investments are designed to produce immediate earnings and cash flow that enable
Global and Energy Technologies to focus on longer investment horizons.
<PAGE>
     Energy  Holdings  plans to  continue  the  growth of Global  and  Resources
through further  investments  made by these  subsidiaries.  Energy Holdings will
assess the growth prospects and opportunities for Energy Technologies'  business
before committing substantial amounts of additional capital.  Investing activity
in 1999 will be subject to periodic  review and revision and may vary  depending
on the  opportunities  presented.  During the next five years,  Energy Holdings'
will need  significant  capital to fund its planned  growth.  Factors  affecting
actual expenditures and investments include availability of capital and suitable
investment  opportunities,  market  volatility  and local economic  trends.  The
anticipated sources of funds for such growth opportunities are additional equity
from PSEG,  cash flow from  operations  and external  financings.  A significant
portion of  Global's  growth is  expected  to occur  internationally  due to the
current and anticipated  growth in electric capacity required in certain regions
of the world. Resources will continue its focus on investments related to energy
infrastructure.   Energy   Technologies   is   expected   to  expand   upon  the
energy-related  services  currently  being provided to industrial and commercial
customers.

     In June 1999,  PSEG  contributed  approximately  $200 million of additional
equity to Energy  Holdings,  which was  applied by Energy  Holdings  to pay down
short-term  debt  that was used to  acquire  its  interest  in the  Chilean  and
Peruvian distribution companies.

     For a  discussion  of the source of Energy  Holdings'  funds,  see External
Financings.  Over the next several years,  Energy Holdings and its  subsidiaries
will be required to refinance  their maturing debt and provide  additional  debt
and equity  financing for growth.  Any inability to obtain  required  additional
external  capital  or  to  extend  or  replace  maturing  debt  and/or  existing
agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates may affect PSEG's and
Energy Holdings' financial  condition,  results of operations or net cash flows.
As of September 30, 1999 and 1998,  Energy  Holdings'  embedded cost of debt was
approximately 6.99% and 7.75%,  respectively.  Energy Holdings' embedded cost of
debt  increased  to  approximately  7.75% as of October 31,  1999 (see  External
Financings).

     Capital Requirements

     PSEG

     PSEG has entered into contracts to purchase a number of combustion turbines
to expand capacity at a number of generating  sites (see Note 5. Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities of Notes).

     PSE&G (including Power)

     PSE&G  has  substantial  commitments  as part of its  ongoing  construction
program.  PSE&G's construction program is continuously reviewed and periodically
revised as a result of changes in economic  conditions,  revised load forecasts,
scheduled  retirement dates of existing facilities,  business  strategies,  site
changes,  cost  escalations  under  construction   contracts,   requirements  of
regulatory  authorities  and laws,  the timing of and amount of electric and gas
transmission  and/or distribution rate changes and the ability of PSE&G to raise
necessary capital.

         In concert  with  separating  the  electric  generation  portion of the
business from PSE&G's  regulated  transmission and  distribution  businesses and
with  reviewing  PSE&G's  strategic  initiatives,  PSEG  is in  the  process  of
assessing the construction  requirements of its businesses.  This will include a
breakdown  of  anticipated  construction  expenditures  between  the  generation
business and the transmission and distribution businesses. For discussion of the
Energy Master Plan Proceedings and their impacts,  see Note 2. Regulatory Issues
of Notes.

     On October 6, 1999,  Power announced an agreement with Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation  (Niagara  Mohawk),  a New York State  utility,  to purchase its 400
megawatt oil (MW) and gas-fired electric  generating station in Albany, New York
(Albany Steam Station) for $47.5 million. On September 30, 1999, Power announced
that it has signed an  agreement to acquire all of  Conectiv's  interests in the
Salem Nuclear  Generating  Station (Salem) and the Hope Creek Nuclear Generating
Station (Hope Creek) and half of Conectiv's  interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic
Power Station (Peach Bottom),  for an aggregate  purchase price of $15.4 million
plus the net book value of nuclear fuel at closing. For further discussion,  see
Note 5. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes.
<PAGE>
     For the nine months ended  September 30, 1999,  PSE&G had plant  additions,
including  capitalized interest and Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFDC),  of $285 million,  an $83 million decrease from the  corresponding  1998
period. This decrease is primarily due to PSE&G's  capitalization  policy change
for the  electric  generation  portion  of its  business.  See Note 1.  Basis of
Presentation/Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies of Notes for further
discussion regarding the capitalization policy change.

     PSE&G has attempted to minimize the uncertainty  associated with the timing
of the final  allocation  of  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  allowances  by  purchasing
allowances,   upgrading   control   technologies  and  estimating  the  expected
allocation  with as much precision as is practicable  using  available data (see
Air Pollution  discussion of Note 5.  Commitments and Contingent  Liabilities of
Notes).   According  to  PSE&G's  present  analysis,  the  potential  costs  for
purchasing  additional  NOx budget  allowances  should not exceed a total of $10
million  through  December 31, 2002.  Expenditures  associated  with  installing
control technology could result in an additional $72 million.  However, PSE&G is
currently  analyzing  alternatives which could preclude the necessity of capital
improvements.

     PSE&G's  regulated  business expects to be able to internally  generate the
majority of its construction and capital  requirements over the next five years,
assuming adequate and timely recovery of costs, as to which no assurances can be
given,  with  the  balance  to be  provided  by  issuance  of  debt  to  replace
maturities.  The unregulated  generation  portion of PSE&G's current  operations
(i.e.,  Power) will likely be required to finance externally based on its growth
strategy.

     Energy Holdings

    From  December  31,  1998  through  September  30,  1999,  Energy  Holdings'
subsidiaries  made  investments  totaling   approximately  $931  million.  These
investments include acquisitions and other investments made by Global, Resources
and Energy Technologies,  discussed below. Projected investment expenditures for
the  fourth  quarter  of 1999  are  approximately  $250  million,  comprised  of
investments in generation and distribution facilities and projects and leveraged
lease  transactions.  Energy  Holdings  has  approximately  $35  million of debt
principal  payments due in November  1999 which are expected to be refinanced or
funded through existing credit facilities and operating cash flow.

         Global

     In October 1999,  Global closed on the  acquisition  of a 70% interest in a
power project development company in Italy specializing in renewable energy. The
company  currently  has  approximately  550  MW  of  power  projects  either  in
development or under construction  consisting of biomass,  hydro and gas powered
production.  Global's  acquisition and equity  investment  requirements over the
next two years are expected to be approximately $80 million.

     In August 1999,  Global and its partners closed project financing for a 487
MW gas-fired  combined-cycle  electric  generating  facility in Rades,  Tunisia.
Construction  of the  facility  began  in  August  1999  and is  expected  to be
completed in the Summer of 2001 at a total cost of  approximately  $261 million.
Upon  completion,  the  facility  is  expected  to qualify as a foreign  utility
company (FUCO).  Global's equity  investment for its 35% interest is expected to
be approximately $27 million including contingencies.

     In  August  1999,  Global  sold its 50%  partnership  interest  in a 137 MW
gas-fired  combined-cycle  co-generation  facility  in  Newark,  New  Jersey and
received net cash proceeds of approximately  $70 million.  Global  recognized an
after-tax gain of approximately $40 million as a result of this transaction.

     In June 1999,  Global and a partner acquired 90% of a Chilean  distribution
company,  which at the time owned a 37%  controlling  interest in a distribution
company in Peru,  together  providing  electric and gas service to approximately
one  million  customers.  The  acquisition  was  made in a 50/50  joint  venture
arrangement. Global's equity investment was approximately $268 million including
fees and closing costs.  In addition,  Global's  portion of the  acquisition was
financed  with $160  million  of debt that is  non-recourse  to  Global,  Energy
Holdings  and PSEG,  which is  consolidated  on the  Global  balance  sheet.  In
September 1999, Global and its partner  purchased an additional  interest in the
Peruvian  distribution  company.  Global's  investment in  connection  with this
purchase was approximately $108 million, resulting in a total combined ownership
share of 84.5% in the Peruvian distribution company.
<PAGE>
     Also in June 1999, Global and a partner closed the project financing for an
845 MW gas-fired  combined-cycle  electric generating facility to be constructed
in San Nicolas,  Argentina. The new facility will be adjacent to an existing 650
MW facility also owned by Global and its partner.  Construction  began in August
1999 and is expected to be  completed  by 2001 at a total cost of  approximately
$448  million.  Global's  equity  investment  for  its 33%  interest,  including
contingencies, is expected to be approximately $86 million.

     In May 1999,  Global  acquired a 63% equity  interest in a company which is
developing a 525 MW coal-fired electric generating facility to be constructed in
North  Chennai,  India.  Upon scheduled  completion in 2003,  Global will be the
operator of the plant.  The total  project cost is expected to be  approximately
$633 million,  of which Global's maximum equity investment for its 63% interest,
including contingencies, is expected to be approximately $180 million. Financial
closure is expected in the Fall of 1999 with construction to begin by the end of
1999.

     In April 1999,  Global and a partner entered into a joint venture agreement
to develop,  construct and operate a 1,000 MW gas-fired  combined-cycle electric
generating  facility in Guadalupe  County in south central Texas. 500 MW of this
facility is expected to be  operational  in late 2000 and is expected to qualify
as an EWG.  Global's maximum equity  investment for its 50% interest is expected
to be  approximately  $193 million  including loans and  guarantees.  In October
1999, Global closed on a $312 million non-recourse project financing, consisting
of a $260 million term loan and $52 million in letter of credit  facilities  for
the Guadalupe facility. At the completion of construction (approximately fifteen
months), the loan will convert to a five year term loan.

     Also in April 1999, Global and a partner announced the formation of a joint
venture to construct and operate three gas-fired electric generating  facilities
with total installed capacity of 200 MW and associated  distribution  systems to
serve,  under contract,  industrial  customers in Venezuela.  Global expects the
first two facilities, which are in construction,  to be operational in late 1999
with the third  facility  in  service  in early  2001.  The total  cost of these
facilities  is expected to be  approximately  $140 million and  Global's  equity
investment,  including  contingencies,  for its 50% interest,  is expected to be
approximately $70 million.

         Resources

     In 1999,  Resources,  through its  investment  in a leveraged  buyout (LBO)
fund, has received cash  distributions  of $99 million  resulting in a realized,
after-tax  gain of $23  million  from the fund's sale of a portion of its equity
interests.  This  includes  distributions  totaling  approximately  $40  million
resulting in a realized,  after-tax gain of  approximately  $11 million from the
sales of equity interests held by an LBO fund in the third quarter of 1999.

     In the third  quarter of 1999,  Resources  received  net cash  proceeds  of
approximately  $76  million  from  early  buy-outs  of  leveraged  leases  of  a
generation station and an office building, resulting in an after-tax gain of $10
million.

     In  1999,  Resources  has  invested  approximately  $243  million  in  five
leveraged lease transactions of energy-related assets: gas distribution networks
in the Netherlands,  cogeneration  plants in Germany and a liquefied natural gas
storage  facility  in  the  United  States.   This  includes  an  investment  of
approximately  $66 million in a  leveraged  lease  transaction  of a natural gas
distribution  network in the Netherlands and an investment of approximately  $40
million in a leveraged lease  transaction of  cogeneration  plants in Germany in
September 1999.

         Energy Technologies

     During  1999,  Energy  Technologies  acquired six  mechanical  and building
service contractors in New Jersey, Virginia and Rhode Island for a total cost of
approximately  $44 million  including debt assumed.  The latest  acquisition was
completed in November 1999.
<PAGE>
External Financings

     The changes in the utility industry are attracting  increased  attention of
bond rating  agencies  which  regularly  assess  business and financial  matters
including  how  utility  companies  are  meeting   competition  and  competitive
initiatives,  especially as they affect potential  stranded costs.  Bond ratings
affect the cost of capital and the ability to obtain external  financing.  Given
the changes in the industry and the anticipated use of securitization, attention
and scrutiny of PSEG's,  PSE&G's and Energy Holdings' competitive  strategies by
rating  agencies  will likely  continue.  These  changes  could  affect the bond
ratings, cost of capital and market prices of the respective securities of PSEG,
PSE&G and Energy Holdings.

     The  availability  and cost of  external  capital  could be affected by the
performance of Energy Holdings and PSE&G and by the actions  ultimately taken by
the BPU with regard to the Energy Master Plan  Proceedings  as well as by rating
agencies' views of such matters including the degree of structural or regulatory
separation  between the utility and its affiliates  and the potential  impact of
affiliate  ratings on the consolidated  credit quality of PSEG, PSE&G and Energy
Holdings.

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings are  analyzing  their future  capital and
financing  needs  in  light of  securitization,  the sale of  generation-related
assets to Power and their  business  strategies.  However,  it is expected  that
following  completion of securitization and the  generation-related  asset sale,
PSE&G will  refinance a portion of its debt and reduce its equity  level,  which
will not  substantially  alter its  existing  capitalization  ratios.  Power and
Energy Holdings will likely issue debt through the capital markets to fund their
projects and acquisitions,  including the sale of  generation-related  assets by
PSE&G to Power.

     PSEG

     At September 30, 1999, PSEG had a committed $150 million  revolving  credit
facility  which expires in December  2002.  At September 30, 1999,  PSEG had $41
million outstanding under this revolving credit facility.  On September 8, 1999,
PSEG  entered  into an  uncommitted  line of credit with a bank for an unlimited
amount.

     In June 1999, PSEG issued $300 million of Extendible  Notes,  Series C, due
June 15, 2001 with interest at the  three-month  London  Interbank  Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus 0.40%, reset quarterly.  These Notes will be automatically tendered
to the  remarketing  agent for  remarketing on March 15, 2000. PSEG used the net
proceeds to make an equity  investment  in Energy  Holdings and to reimburse its
treasury for expenditures made to repurchase shares of its Common Stock.

     PSE&G

     In  addition  to  the  petition  filed  with  the  BPU  to  effectuate  the
securitization  transaction,  PSE&G will need to file petitions with the BPU for
authorization  for any  additional  debt  financing  needed.  PSE&G is currently
evaluating the potential uses of the proceeds of  securitization  (see Liquidity
and Capital Resources).

     Under its Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
against  previous  additions and  improvements  and/or  retired  Mortgage  Bonds
provided  that its ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  calculated in accordance
with its Mortgage is at least 2:1. As of September 30, 1999,  the Mortgage would
permit up to $3.8 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be
issued against previous additions and improvements,  the level of which could be
impacted by the actions  ultimately taken in connection with  securitization and
the sale of  generation-related  assets to Power. At September 30, 1999, PSE&G's
Mortgage  coverage  ratio was  4.481:1.  PSE&G  expects to apply for and receive
necessary BPU  authorization  for external  financings to meet its  requirements
over the next five years, as needed. For a related discussion, see Liquidity and
Capital  Resources  and  Generation-Related  Asset  Sale  to  Power  of  Note 2.
Regulatory Issues of Notes.

     In  anticipation  of   securitization,   PSE&G  purchased  certain  of  its
outstanding series of Mortgage Bonds in the open market. These purchases totaled
$129 million in September 1999 and $171 million in October 1999.
<PAGE>
     On July 1, 1999,  $100 million of PSE&G's 8.750% Bonds,  Series Z, matured.
On September 27, 1999, PSE&G called its $2.990 million of 6.9% Pollution Control
Bonds, Series C, due September 1, 2009. Redemption is scheduled for November 12,
1999.

     To provide  liquidity for its commercial  paper program,  PSE&G has an $850
million  revolving  credit  agreement  expiring in June 2000 and a $650  million
revolving  credit  agreement  expiring  in June 2002 with a group of  commercial
banks,  which  provide for  borrowings of up to one year. On September 30, 1999,
there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.

     The BPU has authorized  PSE&G to issue and have outstanding at any one time
through  January 4, 2000, not more than $1.5 billion of short-term  obligations,
consisting of commercial  paper and other  unsecured  borrowings  from banks and
other lenders.  PSE&G has filed with the BPU for extension of this authorization
through  January 2, 2001 and for an increase to $2.0 billion in order to provide
for temporary  funding of maturing  long-term  debt in light of the  uncertainty
associated with the timing of  securitization  and the generation asset sale due
to the recent appeals. An inability to issue short-term obligations would have a
material adverse impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's  financial  condition,  results of
operations  and net cash flows.  On  September  9, 1999,  PSE&G  entered into an
uncommitted line of credit with a bank for an unlimited amount. Borrowings under
this line of credit and all other  short-term  borrowings  in  aggregate  cannot
exceed the maximum amount of short-term debt authorized, currently $1.5 billion.
PSE&G also had additional  uncommitted  lines of credit  totaling $70 million on
September  30,  1999.  On  September  30,  1999,  PSE&G had  $1.014  billion  of
short-term  debt  outstanding,   including  $30  million  borrowed  against  its
uncommitted bank lines of credit.

     PSE&G Fuel Corporation (Fuelco) has a $125 million commercial paper program
to finance a 42.49%  share of Peach  Bottom  nuclear  fuel,  supported by a $125
million  revolving credit facility with a group of banks,  which expires on June
28, 2001.  PSE&G has  guaranteed  repayment of Fuelco's  respective  obligations
under this program. As of September 30, 1999, Fuelco had commercial paper of $68
million outstanding.  Once the purchase of PSE&G's  generation-related assets is
completed,  Fuelco's commercial paper program will be discontinued and financing
of Peach Bottom nuclear fuel will be funded through Power.

     Energy Holdings

     In October 1999,  Energy Holdings issued $400 million of 10.0% Senior Notes
due October 2009.  The proceeds  were used for the repayment of short-term  debt
outstanding  under revolving credit  facilities.  Borrowings under the revolving
credit  facilities  were used to finance  investments and  acquisitions  and for
general  corporate  purposes.  Energy  Holdings  expects to file a  registration
statement  with the SEC  relating  to an  exchange  offer for, or the resale of,
these Senior  Notes.  At  September  30,  1999,  Energy  Holdings had total debt
outstanding of $1.471 billion, including debt at PSEG Capital as discussed below
and consolidated debt that is non-recourse to PSEG, Global and Energy Holdings.

     The minimum net worth  maintenance  agreement between PSEG Capital and PSEG
provides, among other things, that PSEG (1) maintain its ownership,  directly or
indirectly,  of all  outstanding  common stock of PSEG  Capital,  (2) cause PSEG
Capital to have at all times a positive  tangible net worth of at least $100,000
and (3) make sufficient  contributions of liquid assets to PSEG Capital in order
to permit it to pay its debt  obligations.  In 1993, PSEG agreed with the BPU to
make a good-faith effort to eliminate such PSEG support within six to ten years.
Effective  January 31, 1995, PSEG Capital  notified the BPU of its intention not
to have more than $650 million of debt outstanding at any time. PSEG Capital has
a $650 million  Medium Term Note (MTN)  program  which  provides for the private
placement of MTNs without registration.

     PSEG  Capital's  assets  consist  principally of demand notes of Global and
Resources.   Intercompany  borrowing  rates  are  established  based  upon  PSEG
Capital's  cost of funds.  In March and June  1999,  PSEG  Capital  issued  $252
million of 6.25% MTNs due May 2003 and $35  million of 6.73% MTNs due June 2001,
respectively.  The proceeds were used to repay $100 million of PSEG Capital MTNs
which  matured in February 1999 and $35 million which matured in May 1999 and to
reduce Energy Holdings' short-term debt. At September 30, 1999, PSEG Capital had
total debt outstanding of $650 million,  all of which was comprised of MTNs with
maturities  between  1999 and 2003.  Energy  Holdings  believes it is capable of
eliminating  PSEG  support of PSEG Capital debt within the time period set forth
in the Focused Audit.
<PAGE>
     In September  1999,  Energy  Holdings  closed on a $150  million  letter of
credit facility to support a future equity investment in a generation project in
Texas.

     In May 1999, Energy Holdings closed on two separate senior revolving credit
facilities,  with a syndicate of banks, a $165 million, 364 day revolving credit
facility and a $495  million,  five year  revolving  credit and letter of credit
facility.  These facilities  replaced  existing  revolving credit  facilities at
Enterprise  Capital Funding  Corporation  (Funding),  a financing  subsidiary of
Energy Holdings, totaling $450 million. Effective May 1999, Funding is no longer
being used as a financing vehicle for Energy Holdings.

     Financial  covenants  contained in this new  facility  include the ratio of
cash flow available for debt service (CFADS) to fixed charges. At the end of any
quarterly  financial  period  such  ratio  shall not be less than  1.50x for the
12-month period then ending. As a condition of borrowing, the pro-forma CFADS to
fixed charges  ratio shall not be less than 1.75x as of the quarterly  financial
period ending  immediately  following the first anniversary of each borrowing or
letter of credit issuance. CFADS includes, but is not limited to, operating cash
before  interest  and  taxes,   pre-tax  cash   distributions   from  all  asset
liquidations and equity capital  contributions  from PSEG to the extent not used
to fund investing  activity.  In addition,  the ratio of  consolidated  recourse
indebtedness to recourse  capitalization,  at the end of any quarterly financial
period,  shall not be greater  than 0.60 to 1.00.  This ratio is  calculated  by
dividing  the  total  recourse  indebtedness  of  Energy  Holdings  by the total
recourse  capitalization.  This ratio excludes the debt of PSEG Capital which is
supported by PSEG. As of September 30, 1999, the latest 12 months CFADS coverage
ratio  was  10.9x  and  the  ratio  of   recourse   indebtedness   to   recourse
capitalization was 0.25 to 1.00.

     Compliance  with  applicable  financial  covenants  will depend upon Energy
Holdings' future financial  position and levels of earnings and cash flow, as to
which no  assurances  can be given.  In addition,  Energy  Holdings'  ability to
continue  to grow its  business  will depend to a  significant  degree on PSEG's
ability to access  capital  and Energy  Holdings'  ability to obtain  additional
financing beyond current levels. At September 30, 1999, Energy Holdings had $481
million  outstanding under existing  revolving credit  facilities  totaling $660
million.

Foreign Operations

     In accordance with their growth strategies,  Global and Resources have made
approximately  $1.4 billion and $1.0  billion,  respectively,  of  international
investments.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets  located  in  Australia,  the  Netherlands  and the United  Kingdom  with
associated revenues  denominated in U.S. dollars and, therefore,  not subject to
foreign currency risk.

     Global's international  investments are primarily in projects that generate
or  distribute  electricity  in  Argentina,   Brazil,  Chile,  China,  Peru  and
Venezuela.  Investing in foreign  countries  involves  certain  risks.  Economic
conditions  that  result in higher  comparative  rates of  inflation  in foreign
countries  likely result in declining values in such countries'  currencies.  As
currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, there is a corresponding change in
Global's  investment value in terms of the U.S. dollar. Such change is reflected
as an increase or decrease in  comprehensive  income,  a separate  component  of
stockholders' equity. Net foreign currency  devaluations,  $185 million of which
was caused by the  devaluation of the Brazilian  Real, have reduced the reported
amount of PSEG's total stockholders'  equity by $203 million as of September 30,
1999. For further discussion of foreign currency risk and the devaluation of the
Brazilian Real, see Note 6. Financial Instruments and Risk Management of Notes.

Competitive Environment

     Generation

     PSE&G is  required  to  provide  BGS for all  customers  who do not elect a
different service provider.  Once the sale of the  generation-related  assets to
Power is complete,  Power,  through ER&T, will provide PSE&G with the energy and
capacity  required to meet PSE&G's BGS and OTRA  obligations.  ER&T will provide
such energy and capacity  under the BGS contract  rate for the first three years
of the  transition  period,  which  began  August 1, 1999.  Once the sale of the
generation-related  assets to Power is complete, ER&T will obtain the energy and
capacity  to  supply  PSE&G's  BGS and OTRA  requirements  from its  affiliates,
Nuclear and Fossil,  supplemented  as  necessary  with energy  purchased  in the
competitive  wholesale  electricity market.  Power's earnings will be exposed to
the risks of the  competitive  wholesale  electricity  market to the extent that
ER&T has to purchase energy and/or capacity to meet its BGS and OTRA obligations
at market  prices  which  approach  or  exceed  the BGS  contract  rate (see PJM
Interconnection,  LLC and Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About
Market  Risk).  ER&T's  policy  will be to use  derivatives  to manage this risk
consistent with its business plans and prudent  practices.  Also, as part of its
growth  strategy,  Power is  seeking  to  mitigate  this  risk by  building  and
purchasing  additional capacity in the PJM and surrounding  regions. BGS will be
competitively bid for the fourth year and thereafter. ER&T will also participate
in the competitive  wholesale electricity market for other items such as energy,
capacity and  ancillary  services.  Prior to the sale of the  generation-related
assets to Power,  such  energy and  capacity  continues  to be  provided  by the
generation-related assets owned by PSE&G as well as through any energy purchases
needed.  For further  discussion of the sale of  generation-related  assets, see
Note 2. Regulatory Issues of Notes.

     State Regulatory Matters

     For discussions of the Energy Master Plan Proceedings,  Gas Unbundling, and
other rate matters, see Note 2. Regulatory Issues of Notes.

     PJM Interconnection, LLC

     PSE&G is a member of PJM and  participates on the PJM Members  Committee as
part of its  governance  structure.  PSE&G is also a member of the  Mid-Atlantic
Area  Reliability  Council which provides for review and evaluation of plans for
generation  and  transmission  facilities  and  other  matters  relevant  to the
reliability of the bulk electric supply systems in the Mid-Atlantic area.

     As of April 1, 1999,  FERC lifted the  requirement  that bids for  electric
energy offered for sale in the PJM interchange  energy market from utility-owned
generation  located  within the PJM control area not exceed the variable cost of
producing such energy.  FERC found that no single market  participant can unduly
influence market prices.  Additionally, a market monitoring function is provided
by the PJM Independent System Operator (ISO). Transactions that are bid into the
PJM pool are now capped at $1,000 per  megawatt  hour.  The  current  PJM market
structure,  which  includes this price cap on offers into the spot market and an
installed capacity  obligation,  is being studied by a PJM user group and may be
modified in the future.

     All  power  providers  are paid the  locational  marginal  price  (LMP) set
through  power  providers'  bids.  Furthermore,  in the event that all available
generation  within the PJM control area is insufficient  to satisfy demand,  PJM
may institute  emergency  purchases  from  adjoining  regions.  The cost of such
emergency  purchases  is not  subject to any PJM price  cap.  Since the LEAC was
discontinued  as of August 1, 1999,  to the extent  PSEG's  generation  business
produces  less energy than  required to supply  PSE&G's BGS  customers  and OTRA
customers,  the lifting of such caps could present additional risks with respect
to the difference  between the LMP and the BGS rate.  For further  discussion of
price  volatility  of  electricity,  see Item 3.  Qualitative  and  Quantitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.
<PAGE>
     On May 12,  1999,  FERC  issued a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking  regarding
Regional  Transmission  Organizations (RTO). Although PJM is consistent with the
proposed  requirements  for a RTO, the proposed  rulemaking may restrict PSE&G's
ability to recover its transmission  related revenue  requirements.  Also, under
some RTO structures,  ownership of transmission  assets would be limited to a de
minimus level. Both of these possible restrictions could have a material adverse
impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial  condition,  results of operations or net
cash flows.  PSE&G is actively  participating  in this rulemaking  proceeding to
advocate positions favorable to PSE&G,  although no assurances on the outcome of
these proceedings can be given.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

     Many of PSEG's and PSE&G's systems,  which include  information  technology
applications, plant control and telecommunications  infrastructure systems, must
be modified due to computer  program  limitations  in  recognizing  dates beyond
1999.  PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy Holdings have had a formal project in place since
1997 to address  Year 2000  issues.  Based upon  project  progress to date,  all
mission critical systems are expected to be ready before January 1, 2000.

     Year 2000 Readiness Status

     PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings have  established a three-phase  program to
achieve Year 2000 readiness.  The initial phase (Inventory)  identified  systems
having  potential  Year  2000  issues  and  set  priorities  for  assessing  and
remediating  those systems.  The second phase  (Assessment)  determined  whether
systems are  digital/date  sensitive and the extent of date related issues.  The
third phase (Remediation/Testing) repairs programming code, upgrades or replaces
systems and validates that code repairs were implemented as intended.  Year 2000
readiness work is considered finished upon completion of all three phases.

     PSEG and PSE&G have  completed  required Year 2000  readiness work for more
than 99% of their  mission  critical  systems as of October  31,  1999.  Mission
critical systems are those systems whose unavailability would immediately impact
PSEG's or PSE&G's ability to meet their regulatory,  safety or fiduciary duties.
By the end of 1999,  a majority of PSEG's and PSE&G's  non-critical  systems are
also  expected  to be Year 2000 ready with the  remainder  of such  non-critical
systems to be ready in 2000.

     Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries have essentially  completed  Inventory
and  Assessment  work on all  systems  impacted by Year 2000  readiness  issues.
Remediation/Testing  is expected to be completed in 1999 on all mission critical
systems and a majority of non-critical systems, with the remaining  non-critical
systems to be  completed  in 2000.  Energy  Holdings  (parent  company),  Energy
Technologies and Resources have completed  required Year 2000 readiness work for
100% of their mission  critical  systems and such systems are Year 2000 ready as
of June 30, 1999. Global has completed required Year 2000 readiness work for 95%
of its mission critical systems through September 1999.

     As previously reported, on May 11, 1998, the NRC issued a Generic Letter to
all nuclear facilities requiring certain written responses addressing the status
of their Year 2000  programs.  In its  responses,  PSE&G  indicated that planned
implementation  will allow PSE&G's nuclear  facilities to be Year 2000 ready and
in compliance with the terms and conditions of their licenses and NRC regulation
by January 1, 2000.  On June 30,  1999,  PSE&G  reaffirmed  its plan to have all
mission  critical  systems ready and in compliance with the terms and conditions
of their  license and NRC  regulation  by January 1, 2000.  On October 20, 1999,
PSE&G provided an update to its June 30, 1999 response,  noting that all mission
critical  systems  for Hope  Creek and Salem  were  Year 2000  ready.  PSE&G has
identified no Year 2000 problem that could affect the proper  functioning of any
nuclear safety system.  All  safety-related  systems that could have a Year 2000
issue have already been identified and, where  necessary,  corrected and tested.
PSE&G will continue to monitor the Year 2000 issue to ensure that it is prepared
for any issues,  internal or external to the plants,  which could impact  PSE&G.
PSE&G has developed  contingency  plans to address  issues that may arise during
the December 31, 1999 through January 1, 2000 rollover. PECO informed PSE&G that
it provided the required  July 1999  response to the NRC  confirming  that Peach
Bottom's  Year 2000  effort  is on  schedule  to also be Year 2000  ready and in
compliance  with the terms and conditions of their license and NRC regulation by
January 1, 2000.  Additionally,  PECO informed  PSE&G that the remaining work on
Peach Bottom's mission critical systems has been completed and those systems are
Year 2000 ready.
<PAGE>
     PSEG,  PSE&G and  their  subsidiaries  are  continuing  to work with  their
supplier  base to assess the Year 2000  readiness  status of vendors who provide
critical   materials  and  services  (key  vendors).   PSEG,   PSE&G  and  their
subsidiaries  designate  a vendor as key under  the Year  2000  project  if that
vendor's product or service has a fiduciary, regulatory or safety impact on PSEG
or PSE&G or their  subsidiaries.  PSEG and PSE&G have indications from more than
97% of their key vendors that they are making or have made  preparations for the
Year 2000. To date, all such key vendors responding indicate that their business
operations will be ready.  Global's  vendors are not included in that statistic;
however, Global's key vendors have also indicated that they expect to be able to
meet Year 2000 requirements. Strategies are being put into place to minimize the
impact of  potential  vendor  failures on PSEG's,  PSE&G's and Energy  Holdings'
operations.  However,  failure of key vendors to be Year 2000 ready could result
in  material  adverse  impacts  to  PSEG's  and  PSE&G's  operations,  financial
condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

     Year 2000 Costs

     For a discussion of Year 2000 Costs, see Note 5. Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities of Notes.

     Year 2000 Risks

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings have  identified  some scenarios and will
continue  working to determine the most  reasonably  likely worst case scenarios
arising from Year 2000 readiness  issues.  PSE&G anticipates its most reasonably
likely worst case scenario as follows:

     o    Many   customers  may  revert  to their own back-up  generation or may
          preemptively  shut down their  operations  during  critical  Year 2000
          periods  (primarily around December 31, 1999 through January 1, 2000).
          Their individual decisions could aggregate to unpredictable and/or low
          electrical demand patterns,  especially given that this is typically a
          low electrical demand period.  Because  electricity  cannot be stored,
          PSE&G  must  anticipate  and  balance  supply  and  demand in order to
          maintain electric generation,  transmission and distribution  systems.
          Unusual demand patterns could  overburden  these systems so that PSE&G
          could fail to  coordinate  demand and supply.  In order to prepare for
          this contingency,  PSE&G has sought to increase system  flexibility by
          implementing measures to:

          o    Prepare  all  plants  for  significant  increase  or  decrease in
               production,

          o    Have equipment and facilities that can use electricity ready to
               run,

          o    Generate with a more diverse fuel mix than usual, and

          o    Have additional  generating units that typically do not  run
               during  this  time  of the  year  (i.e.,  combustion turbines)
               ready to operate.

          PSEG and PSE&G are planning for intense  media  attention  on  PSE&G's
          operations.  The period surrounding  December 31, 1999 through January
          1, 2000 will provide an opportunity to closely review PSE&G's  status.
          Part of PSE&G's  contingency  plans is to provide  timely and accurate
          status information.

     Energy  Holdings  has  identified  some  scenarios  and  will  continue  to
determine the most reasonably likely worst case scenarios arising from Year 2000
readiness  issues.  Global's  most  reasonably  likely worst case  scenarios may
include  potential  external  disturbances  of its  systems  including,  but not
limited to,  fuel supply or  transmission  interruptions  or  telecommunications
systems outages. Global's contingency plans have been finalized to address these
scenarios.
<PAGE>
     PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings have no outstanding  litigation relating to
Year 2000 issues. The likelihood of future Year 2000 related  liabilities cannot
be  determined  at this time.  PSEG and PSE&G have been subject to the following
Year 2000 regulatory action:

          o    The BPU has  issued  a  specific  order  requiring  a  number  of
               customer   related    disclosures,    including   bill   inserts,
               establishment of an "800" number, and others.

          o    The BPU has issued an interim report  assessing Year 2000 program
               progress by PSE&G up to June 15, 1999. The report  indicated that
               the BPU agreed with the overall  status of the project,  and that
               based on reported progress,  the Year 2000 program should come to
               a successful termination.

          o    The BPU has informed  PSE&G that it will expect  periodic  status
               reports  and  specific  outage   information  during  the  period
               December 31, 1999 through January 1, 2000.

     Additionally,  Energy Holdings, through Global, is subject to international
Year 2000 regulatory  initiatives,  which could include  sanctions being imposed
and  requirements  to indemnify  consumers for damages  resulting from Year 2000
non-compliance,   in  the  countries  in  which  it  has  operations,  including
Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China, Peru and Venezuela.  Global has reviewed the
impacts of local  regulations  and laws, has taken all necessary steps to comply
with the international regulatory initiatives and, as noted above, has completed
required  Year  2000  readiness  work for 95% of its  mission  critical  systems
through September 1999.

     Contingency Plans

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings have adopted the North American  Electric
Reliability Council's (NERC) timetable, guidelines and detailed requirements for
developing  these  contingency  plans. The planning process is an iterative one.
PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings have completed their  preliminary  contingency
plans. The second version of their  contingency  plans was completed by June 30,
1999, consistent with NERC's timetable.

     PSEG and PSE&G  conducted a limited scope internal drill on March 19, 1999.
The scope of the  drill  involved  using  alternate  communication  capabilities
(i.e.,  radio) to monitor electric generation and transmission should the public
switched  phone  network  become   unavailable.   The  drill  showed  the  basic
feasibility  of   preliminary   plans  and  it  identified   needed   procedural
enhancements,  which have since been included in the contingency plans. On April
9, 1999, PSEG and PSE&G  participated in a NERC  industry-coordinated  Year 2000
readiness  drill.  It involved a scope  similar to the March 19, 1999 drill plus
the  involvement  of PJM.  Additionally,  PSEG  and  PSE&G  participated  in the
NERC-led drill on September 8-9, 1999. The drill was intended to be a full-scale
dress rehearsal for the rollover period of December 31, 1999 to January 1, 2000.
For PSE&G,  this drill  built on previous  exercises.  Multiple  functions  were
involved  including gas, electric and distribution.  The centralized  status and
reporting  function  created for Year 2000 was  activated.  As with the previous
drills,  this exercise showed the basic  feasibility of the  contingency  plans.
Some procedural details,  such as the final development of facility  preparation
checklists,  creation of contact  listings and the distribution of communication
equipment, will be completed before December 31, 1999.

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings  expect that with  completion of the Year
2000 readiness work and implementation of programs from SAP America, Inc. (SAP),
the  possibility of significant  interruptions  of normal  operations  should be
reduced.   However,  if  PSEG,  PSE&G,  Energy  Holdings,   their  domestic  and
international subsidiaries,  their project affiliates, the other members of PJM,
PJM trading partners  supplying power through PJM, PSEG's or PSE&G's key vendors
and/or  customers  or the  capital  markets  are  unable  to meet the Year  2000
deadline,  such  inability  could have a material  adverse  impact on PSEG's and
PSE&G's  operations,  financial  condition,  results of  operations  or net cash
flows.

PSE&G

     The information  required by this item is incorporated  herein by reference

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market risk inherent in PSEG's market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions  is the  potential  loss  arising  from  adverse  changes in commodity
prices,  equity security prices,  interest rates and foreign  currency  exchange
rates as discussed  below.  PSEG's policy is to use  derivatives  to manage risk
consistent  with its  business  plans  and  prudent  practices.  PSEG has a Risk
Management   Committee   comprised  of  executive  officers  which  utilizes  an
independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies
and prudent risk management practices.

     PSEG is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event of  non-performance  or
non-payment by  counterparties.  PSEG also has a credit management process which
is used to assess,  monitor and  mitigate  counterparty  exposure  for PSE&G and
Energy  Holdings.  In the event of  non-performance  or  non-payment  by a major
counterparty,  there may be a  material  adverse  impact on PSEG's  and  PSE&G's
financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.

     For  discussion of interest  rates and Energy  Holdings'  commodity-related
instruments, equity securities and foreign currency risks, see Note 6. Financial
Instruments and Risk Management of Notes.

     Commodity-Related Instruments--PSE&G

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand,  state and Federal  regulatory  policies and other events. To
reduce price risk caused by market  fluctuations,  PSE&G enters into  derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties, to hedge its anticipated demand. These contracts, in conjunction
with owned electric generating  capacity and physical gas supply contracts,  are
designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer commitments.
<PAGE>
     PSE&G uses a value-at-risk model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load   requirements,   physical   contracts  and  financial   derivative
instruments.   Value-at-risk  represents  the  potential  gains  or  losses  for
instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time
period and confidence level. PSE&G estimates  value-at-risk across its commodity
business using a model with historical volatilities and correlations.

     The measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95%
confidence  level and assuming a one week time horizon at September 30, 1999 was
approximately $5 million, compared to the December 31, 1998 level of $4 million.
PSE&G's calculated  value-at-risk represents an estimate of the potential change
in the value of its portfolio of physical and financial derivative  instruments.
These  estimates,  however,  are not  necessarily  indicative of actual results,
which may differ due to the fact that actual market rate fluctuations may differ
from forecasted  fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio of hedging
instruments may change over the holding period.

September 15, 1999 and October 14, 1999 is updated below.

(1)  Form  10-K,  page 29 and June 30,  1999 Form 10-Q,  page 52. As  previously
     disclosed,  by complaints  filed in 1995 and 1996,  shareholder  derivative
     actions  on  behalf  of  PSEG  shareholders  were  commenced  by  purported
     shareholders  against certain  directors and officers.  The four complaints
     generally sought recovery of damages for alleged losses purportedly arising
     out of PSE&G's  operation of the Salem and Hope Creek generating  stations,
     together with certain other relief,  including removal of certain executive
     officers of PSE&G and PSEG and certain changes in the composition of PSEG's
     Board of Directors.  By decision dated July 28, 1999, the Court granted the
     defendants'  motions for summary  judgement  dismissing all four derivative
     actions. The plaintiffs have filed Notices of Appeals in all these actions.
     PSEG cannot predict the outcome of these appeals. Public Service Enterprise
     Group Inc. by G. E. Stricklin,  derivatively v. E. James Ferland,  et. al.,

(2)  March 31, 1999 Form 10-Q,  page 38 and June 30, 1999 Form 10-Q, page 52. As
     previously disclosed, a complaint was received by PSEG naming as defendants
     the current directors of PSEG, and naming PSEG as a nominal defendant, from
     the same  purported  shareholder  of PSEG who  instituted the December 1995
     shareholder  derivative  suit  and  who  instituted  the  June  1998  proxy
     litigation, alleging that the 1999 proxy statement provided to shareholders
     of PSEG was false and misleading by reason,  among other things, of failure
     to disclose  certain  material  facts relating to (i) the controls over and
     oversight of PSEG's nuclear  operations,  (ii) the condition of problems at
     and reserves with respect to PSEG's nuclear operations and (iii) the demand
     letter and derivative  litigation  described  above. The complaint seeks to
     have the 1999 proxy  statement  declared to be in  violation of law, to set
     aside  the  election  of  directors  of PSEG  and the  ratification  of the
     selection  of  Deloitte & Touche LLP as PSEG's  auditors at the 1999 annual
     shareholder  meeting,  and to require PSEG to conduct a special  meeting of
     shareholders   providing  for  election  of  directors   following   timely
     dissemination  of a proxy  statement  approved  by the  Court  hearing  the
     matter,  which should include as nominees for election as directors persons
     having no previous  relationship  with PSEG or the current  directors,  and
<PAGE>
     other relief. A motion to dismiss the complaint was filed by the defendants
     on June 28, 1999. On August 2, 1999, the Court issued an order granting the
     defendants'  motion to dismiss the complaint.  Plaintiff has filed a Notice
     of Appeal.  PSEG cannot predict the outcome of this appeal. G. E. Stricklin

     District of Pennsylvania. Civil Action No. 99-1950.

maximum permitted Basic Deposit to the Plan may also elect:

          (a)  to  make  Supplemental  Nondeferred  Deposits  to the  Plan in an

               Compensation each pay period; or

          (c)  to make,  or have made by an Employer  on his or her behalf,  any
               combination  of the  Deposits  specified  in  (a)  or (b)  above,

payroll  deduction.  For  convenience  of  administration,  if the percentage of
Compensation  elected to be contributed to the Plan by an Active  Participant is
not equal to a whole  dollar  amount,  such amount will be increased to the next
whole dollar  amount in  establishing  the deduction to be made from such Active
Participant's  pay. In  addition,  if an Active  Participant's  Compensation  is
changed,  the resulting change in deduction shall be made as soon as practicable
after such change in Compensation.

         Additional  Lump Sum Deposits shall be paid directly by Participants to

Deposits  for  any  Participant   attributable  to  any  taxable  year  of  such
Participant  (presumably the calendar year) exceed the amount  permitted by Code
section  402(g).  Where a Participant  elects under Section 4.1 to have Deferred
Deposits made by an Employer to the Plan which would otherwise  exceed the limit
of this Section 4.5,  such  excessive  Deferred  Deposits  shall be deemed to be
Nondeferred  Deposits to the Plan ("Deemed  Nondeferred  Deposits")  rather than
Deferred Deposits to the Plan; provided,  however,  that such Deemed Nondeferred
Deposits  shall be subject to the limits and rules of Sections  4.1 and 4.2; and
provided further,  that such Deemed  Nondeferred  Deposits shall be deemed to be
Basic Nondeferred Deposits (and, therefore, matched by Employer Contributions as
set forth in Article V) to the extent  possible under the limits of Sections 2.6
and 4.1,  taking into account other Basic Deferred and  Nondeferred  Deposits of
the Participant.

         Section 4.6. Distribution of Excess Deferral Amounts.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan to the contrary,
               an  Employer  shall  distribute  any Excess  Deferral  Amount (as
               defined  below),   adjusted   according  to  Section  4.6(d),  to
               Participants who claim such allocable Excess Deferral Amounts for
               a calendar year.  Such  distribution  shall be made no later than
               the April 15th next  following  the end of the calendar  year for
               which such claim is made.

          (b)  For purposes of this Section 4.6,  "Excess Deferral Amount" shall
               mean the amount of Deferred Deposits for a calendar year that the
               Participant  allocates  to this Plan and claims  pursuant  to the
               election procedure set forth in Section 4.6(c) below.

          (c)  A Participant's election to claim an Excess Deferral Amount for a
               calendar  year shall be in  writing,  shall be  submitted  to the
               Committee no later than the March 1st next  following  the end of
               such calendar year,  shall specify the Excess Deferral Amount and
               shall state that if such amount is not  distributed,  such Excess
               Deferral Amount, when added to amounts deferred under other plans
               or  arrangements  described in Code  sections  401(k),  408(k) or
               403(b),  exceeds  the limit  imposed on the  Participant  by Code
               section 402(g) for the taxable year (calendar  year) in which the
               deferral occurred.

          (d)  The amount distributed to a Participant  pursuant to this Section
               4.6  with  respect  to a  calendar  year  shall be  increased  or
               decreased,   as  applicable,   by  investment  income  or  losses
               attributable  thereto.  If a loss  is  allocable  to  the  Excess
               Deferral Amount,  the amount  distributed  shall not be less than
               the lesser of (1) the Participant's  Deferred Deposit  Subaccount
               or (2) the  Participant's  Deferred  Deposits  for the Plan  Year
               during which the Excess Deferral Amount occurred.

         Section 4.7 Code Section 401(k) Limits on Deferred Deposits.

          (a)  Correction   of  Excess   Nondeferred   Deposits   and   Employer
               Contributions.  If the Committee  determines after the end of the
               Plan Year that the  nondiscrimination  limitation of Code section
               401(m) has not been satisfied,  Nondeferred Deposits and Employer
               Contributions (adjusted to reflect any income or losses allocable
               to such  excess  contributions  for the Plan  Year in which  such
               excess   contributions  were  made)  of  the  Highly  Compensated
               Employees  shall  be  distributed  to  such  Highly   Compensated
               Employees  to  eliminate  such excess  Nondeferred  Deposits  and
               Employer  Contributions;  provided,  however,  that the amount of
               excess Nondeferred Deposits and Employer Contributions for a Plan
               Year shall be determined  after the excess  Nondeferred  Deposits
               and   Employer   Contributions   that  are  treated  as  employee
               contributions due to recharacterization under Treasury Regulation
               section 1.401(m)-1(e)(2)(iii).

          (b)  Elimination of Amount of Excess Nondeferred Deposits and Employer
               Contributions.  The  amount of excess  Nondeferred  Deposits  and
               Employer  Contributions for a Highly  Compensated  Employee for a
               Plan Year is to be determined by the following  leveling  method,
               under which the contribution  percentage of a Highly  Compensated
               Employee with the highest  contribution  percentage is reduced to
               the extent required to--

               (1)  enable  the  Plan to  satisfy  the  contribution  percentage
                    limitation, or

               (2)  cause  such  Highly  Compensated   Employee's   contribution
                    percentage to equal the percentage of the Highly Compensated
                    Employee with the next highest contribution percentage.

         This  process  must be  repeated  until the Plan  satisfies  the actual
contribution percentage test.

          (c)  Return of Excess Nondeferred Deposits and Employer Contributions.
               Excess Nondeferred Deposits and Employer  Contributions which are
               returned to Highly Compensated Employees pursuant to this section
               4.7  shall  be   distributed   to  such   Employees  as  soon  as
               practicable,  without regard to any limitation  otherwise imposed
               by law or by the  provisions  of this Plan.  The amount of excess
               Nondeferred  Deposits  and  Employer  Contributions  for a Highly
               Compensated  Employee is then equal to total Nondeferred Deposits
               and  Employer  Contributions  taken into  account  for the actual
               contribution percentage test, minus the product of the Employee's
               contribution  ratio  and  the  Employee's  Compensation  used  in
               determining such ratio.

          (d)  Family  Aggregation  Rules.  In the case of a Highly  Compensated
               Employee whose actual  contribution ratio is determined under the
               family  aggregation  rules,  the  determination  of the amount of
               excess aggregate contributions shall be made as follows:

               (1)  the actual  contribution  ratio shall be reduced pursuant to
                    the leveling method described above, and

               (2)  the excess aggregate  contributions  are allocated among the
                    family  members in  proportion to the  contribution  of each
                    such family member.

         Section 4.8 Unmatched Employer Contributions.  If, as the result of the
operation of Sections  4.5, 4.6 and/or 4.7, and before the  operation of Section
4.9,  the  combined  Deposits of a  Participant  are adjusted in such a way that
Employer  Contributions  previously  made on behalf of a Participant  for a Plan
Year are no  longer  matched  by such  Participant's  Basic  Deposits,  then the
matching Employer Contributions allocated to such Participant's Account for such
Plan Year shall be reduced,  under  nondiscriminatory  rules  established by the
Committee,  to  the  extent  necessary  to  equal  the  percentage  of  Employer
Contributions  (as set forth in  Article V) with  respect  to the  Participant's
remaining  Basic Deposits for such Plan Year. The amount,  if any, of previously
allocated  Employer  Contributions  in  excess  of the  percentage  of  Employer
Contributions (as set forth in Article V) of the  Participant's  remaining Basic
Deposits shall be forfeited and applied to reduce future Employer  Contributions
to the Plan.

         Section 4.9 Code  Section  401(m)  Limits on  Nondeferred  Deposits and
Employer Contributions.

          (a)  Limitation.  Nondeferred  Deposits  by,  together  with  Employer
               Contributions on behalf of, Highly Compensated Participants for a
               Plan Year shall not exceed  the  amount  permissible  to meet the
               nondiscrimination tests of Code section 401(m).

          (b)  Distribution  of  Excess   Contributions   The  Committee  shall,
               consistent   with   regulations   under   the   Code,   establish
               nondiscriminatory  rules to meet the requirements of this Section
               4.9.

         Section  4.10   Changing   Deposit   Percentages   The   percentage  of
Compensation  deposited  in the Plan by or on behalf  of an  Active  Participant
shall continue in effect until such Active  Participant shall change the rate of
such Deposits. An Active Participant may change the rate of Deposits to a higher
or lower percentage of Compensation  within the limitations of Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.5 by  arranging  for such  change with the Record  Keeper or as  otherwise
prescribed by the Committee.  Any such change shall become  effective as soon as
practicable after receipt of the notice of change by the Record Keeper.

         Section 4.11 Suspension of Deposits.

          (a)  An Active Participant may suspend all of the Deposits to the Plan
               made by such  Participant  or on his or her behalf at any time by
               arranging  for such  suspension  with  the  Record  Keeper  or as
               otherwise  prescribed by the Committee.  Such suspension shall be
               effective as soon as  practicable  after receipt of the notice of
               suspension by the Record  Keeper,  and shall  continue until such
               Participant elects to have Deposits resumed by arranging therefor
               with the Record Keeper.  Payroll  deductions under the Plan shall
               begin again as soon as practicable  after such notice is received
               by the Record Keeper.

          (b)  If, after other required and authorized deductions from an Active
               Participant's pay, there is not sufficient money available in any
               pay period to make the entire  authorized  payroll  deduction for
               such  Participant's  Nondeferred  Deposits,  no payroll deduction
               shall be made therefor for that pay period.

          (c)  In case of any such total  suspension  of  Deposits,  pursuant to
               Section  4.11(a),   Employer  Contributions  on  behalf  of  such
               Participant shall be automatically suspended for a like period.

         Section  4.12  Limit  on  Additional  Lump  Sum  Deposits.  No  further
Additional  Lump Sum Deposits may be made by any Participant in any Plan Year in
which the aggregate amount of all of such Participant's  Deposits under the Plan
exceeds  25%  of  such  Participant's  Compensation  for  that  Plan  Year.  Any
Additional Lump Sum Deposits inadvertently received in excess of this limitation
shall  be  refunded  to  the  Participant  as  soon  as  practicable   following
determination of such excess.

         Section 4.13  Elections.  All elections  under this Article IV shall be
made at the time,  in the manner and subject to the  conditions as are specified
by  the  Committee.  Elections  of  Deferred  Deposits  shall  in all  cases  be
irrevocably  made prior to the  beginning  of the payroll  period for which such
elections  shall apply. In any year in which the Committee deems it necessary to
do so to meet the  requirements  of Section 4.5, 4.7, 4.9 or 5.4 or the Code and
the regulations  thereunder,  the Committee may reduce,  for that Plan Year, the
permissible   amount  of  Deposits  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  or  all  Active
Participants.

         Section 4.14  Rollover  Contributions.  Subject to such rules as may be
established by the Committee, an Employee may transfer Rollover Contributions to
the Plan,  to be  deposited  in his or her  Supplemental  Deposit  Account.  The
Employee  must  certify  that  such  amount  to  be  transferred  as a  Rollover
Contribution  qualifies  for  such  transfer  under  the  Code  and  regulations
thereunder  and must submit such  information or evidence,  satisfactory  to the
Committee,  that it may require in order to approve such transfer. The Committee
may impose  such  nondiscriminatory  requirements  on such  transfer as it deems
necessary  or  desirable.  In  addition,  Rollover  Contributions  shall then be
subject to all terms and  conditions  of this Plan and the Trust  Agreement  and
shall be treated in the same manner as Supplemental Deposits, unless the context
of the Plan or Trust requires otherwise.

         Section 4.15  Transfers  from the Employee  Savings Plan.  Any Employee
who, at the time  he/she  becomes  employed  by the  Company or a  Participating
Affiliate, is a participant in the Employee Savings Plan, shall automatically be
enrolled in the Plan and all  balances  in the  Employee  Savings  Plan shall be
transferred to the Plan and all contribution and investment  elections in effect
for the Employee Savings Plan shall remain in effect, subject to change pursuant
to the operation of Sections 4.10, 4.11 and 6.2 hereof.

                                    ARTICLE V
                             EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         Section 5.1 Amount and Payment of Employer Contributions. Each Employer
shall  contribute  to the  Plan on  behalf  of  Participants  who  are  Eligible
Employees,  who are its  Employees  and who are making or having their  Employer
make on their  behalf  Basic  Deposits to the Plan an amount equal to 50% of the
aggregate of such Basic Deposits,  except to the extent that such Basic Deposits
are reduced or  distributed  as provided in Sections 4.5 through 4.9, and except
as provided in this Article V and in Section 11.4. Employer  Contributions shall
be allocated as Nondeferred.  Employer Contributions with respect to a Plan Year
shall be paid to the Trustee not later than the due date  (including  extensions
of time) for filing Enterprise's consolidated Federal income tax return for such
year.  All  Employer  Contributions  may be made  without  regard to  current or
accumulated  earnings of the Employer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Plan
shall be designated a profit sharing plan for purposes of Code sections  401(a),
402, 412 and 417.

         Section  5.2.  Employer   Contributions  in  Enterprise  Common  Stock.
Employer  Contributions  with  respect  to Basic  Deposits  in  excess  of 6% of
Compensation shall be made in shares of Enterprise Common Stock. Any such shares
credited  to a  Participant's  Account  shall be  acquired in the same manner as
shares  acquired for the Enterprise  Common Stock Fund  established  pursuant to
Section 7.2, be invested in that Fund and shall not be available for transfer to
any  other  Fund  or  withdrawal  from  the  Plan  prior  to  the  Participant's
termination of employment by the Company or any Affiliate.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  any portion of a  Participant's  Account  invested in the Enterprise
Common Stock Fund that is  apportioned  for an  alternate  payee under a QDRO in
accordance  with Article XXII may be  transferred  out of such Fund or withdrawn
from the Plan at any time.

         Section 5.3.  Reduction of Employer  Contributions by Forfeitures.  The
amount of an  Employer's  Contribution  shall be  reduced  by the  amount of the
reduction  of  an  unmatched  Employer   Contribution   allocable  to  a  Highly
Compensated  Participant as provided in Sections 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9, by the amount
of any  forfeiture  as a result of  termination  of the  employment of an Active
Participant  as  provided  in  Section  11.2 or as a  result  of the  Employer's
inability to locate a Participant or beneficiary to whom a benefit  hereunder is
due as provided in Section 11.14.

         Section 5.4. Maximum Annual Additions.  The maximum Annual Addition, as
defined in Section 12.1, for any Plan Year to any Participant's  Account may not
exceed the amount provided for by Code section  415(c).  The rules governing the
application  of this Section 5.4 and other  limitations  imposed by Code section
415 are more fully set forth in Article XII.

         Section 5.5. Return of Employer Contributions.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any provision of the Plan to the  contrary,  any
               Employer  Contribution  made to the Plan by reason of  mistake of
               fact  may  be  returned  to the  Employer  making  such  Employer
               Contribution,  provided the return of such Employer  Contribution
               is made  within one year from the date the  mistaken  payment was
               made and any  amount  so  returned  shall be  disposed  of as the
               Committee shall direct.

          (b)  If the Internal Revenue Service  determines that any contribution
               by an Employer to the Plan is not  deductible  under Code section
               404, such Employer  shall have the option,  which it may exercise
               within  one  year  after  the  date of the  disallowance  of such
               deduction, to have such contribution returned to the Employer and
               any amount so  returned  shall be  disposed  of as the  Committee
               shall direct.

         Section 5.6  Allocation  from Cash Balance  Plan.  Pursuant to the Cash
Balance Plan and the Retirement  Choice Program,  Participants  who so elect may
have certain  service and age points  otherwise  allocate to them under the Cash
Balance Plan made as an Employer Contribution to their Accounts under this Plan.
All  amounts so  elected  shall be  accepted  by the  Trustee  and  invested  in
accordance with Section 6.1. No amounts  attributable to Employer  Contributions
resulting from Participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash Balance Plan and
the Retirement  Choice  Program shall be available for withdrawal  from the Plan
until  the  Participant's  termination  of  employment  by  the  Company  or any
Affiliate.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                           THRIFT ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS

         Section 6.1 Investment of Deposits, Rollover Contributions and Employer
Contributions.  Deposits,  Rollover  Contributions and Employer Contributions to
the Plan shall be invested by the Trustee under the Trust Agreement in the Funds
established   pursuant  to  Section  7.1.  Upon  enrolling  in  the  Plan,  each
Participant shall specify, in such form as shall be prescribed by the Committee,
the percentage (which shall be an integral multiple of 1% - including 0% but not
exceeding  100% in the aggregate) of Deposits to his or her Thrift Account which
shall be invested in each of such Funds.  Subject to Section 5.2 with respect to
Employer   Contributions   related  to  Basic   Deposits  in  excess  of  6%  of
Compensation,  Employer  Contributions  shall be invested by the Trustee for the
Account of an Active  Participant in the same Funds and in the same  percentages
as directed by such Participant with respect to the Basic Deposits to his or her
Thrift Account.  Rollover  Contributions may be invested in funds under the Plan
in  such   dollar   amounts  as  shall  be   designated   by  the   Participant.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary herein, a Participant who, at the time
he/she becomes an Employee, is a participant in the Employee Savings Plan, shall
continue  the same  investment  elections as he/she  maintained  in the Employee
Savings Plan until a change in investment  direction is made in conformity  with
the Section 6.2 hereof.  Each  Participant  with a U.S. Energy Partners  Account
shall  specify,  in such  form as  shall be  prescribed  by the  Committee,  the
percentage  (which  shall be an integral  multiple of 1% - including  0% but not
exceeding  100% in the  aggregate) of his or her U.S.  Energy  Partners  Account
which  shall be invested  in each of the Funds  established  pursuant to Section
7.1; provided,  however,  that if the Participant fails to so specify,  the U.S.
Energy Partners Account shall be invested in a Fixed Income Fund.

         Section 6.2 Change in Investment  Direction.  Any investment  direction
given by a Participant  under Section 6.1 shall continue in effect until changed
by the Participant. A Participant may change any such direction by giving notice
of such change in the form  prescribed by the  Committee.  Any such change shall
become effective as soon as practicable after receipt of the notice of change by
the Record Keeper. A change in investment direction under this Section 6.2 shall
not automatically cause a transfer of investments under Section 6.3.

         Section 6.3 Transfer/  Reallocation of Investments.  Subject to Section
5.2 with respect to the  limitation  on the  transfer of Employer  Contributions
made in shares of Enterprise  Common Stock and Section 6.6  regarding  transfers
into and out of the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund, a Participant may:

          (a)  direct that all or any part (in integral  multiples of 1%) of his
               or her interest in any one or more of the Funds be transferred to
               any one or more of the other  Funds,  except that no transfer may
               be made into a Participant's ESOP Account. A Participant may also
               transfer his or her ESOP Account assets (in integral multiples of
               1%,  but not  exceeding  100% in the  aggregate)  into any one or
               several of the Funds.  However, any transfer from a Fund shall be
               subject to such contractual  limitations regarding transfers from
               such Fund as may  exist  from  time to time  under the  contracts
               governing  investments held in such Fund. A direction to transfer
               all or a portion of a  Participant's  interest in a Fund shall be
               made by giving notice in the form  prescribed  by the  Committee.
               Subject to any  contractual  limitations  that may be applicable,
               any  such  transfer  shall be made as soon as  practicable  after
               receipt of the notice of such transfer by the Record Keeper; or

          (b)  reallocate  all or any part (in integral  multiples of 1%) of his
               or her  interest  among the  Funds,  except  that no funds may be
               reallocated into or out of a Participant's ESOP Account. Any such
               reallocation shall be subject to such contractual  limitations as
               may  exist  from  time  to time  under  the  contracts  governing
               investments  held in such Funds.  A  direction  to  reallocate  a
               portion of a  Participant's  interest  in a Fund shall be made by
               giving notice in the form prescribed by the Committee. Subject to
               any  contractual  limitations  that may be  applicable,  any such
               reallocation  shall be made as soon as practicable  after receipt
               of the notice of such reallocation by the Record Keeper.

         Section 6.4 Quarterly Automatic Rebalancing.  Subject to the limitation
contained in Section 5.2 with respect to the transfer of Employer  Contributions
made in shares of  Enterprise  Common  Stock and  excluding  investments  in the
Participant's ESOP Account and in the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund, a
Participant may elect  automatically  rebalance his or her Account among some or
all of the Funds at the end of each calendar quarter. Any such rebalancing shall
also be  subject  to those  contractual  limitations  regarding  transfers  from
certain  Funds as may exist  from time to time  under  the  contracts  governing
investments  held in such Funds.  A direction  to elect to  quarterly  automatic
rebalancing  of a  Participant's  Account  shall be made by giving notice in the
form  prescribed  by the  Committee  and shall be in effect until an election is
made to discontinue  such  rebalancing.  Subject to any  applicable  contractual
limitations,  such rebalancing  shall commence as soon as practicable  after the
Record Keeper's receipt of the notice of such election and shall occur on, or as
soon as practicable following, the end of each subsequent calendar quarter.

         Section 6.5 Loans.  Participants  may receive  loans from their  Thrift
Accounts under the provisions of Section 11.13. A loan to a Participant shall be
considered an investment of such Participant's  Thrift Account and the principal
amount of the loan shall be treated as a separate  investment within the various
subaccounts.  Repayments of the  principal  amount of the loan shall reduce such
corresponding  investments of each such  subaccount in the inverse order of such
investment  and  repayments of such  principal  along with any accrued  interest
thereon shall be invested in the Funds in accordance with the Participant's then
current  investment  direction.  Loan amounts shall be taken from subaccounts in
the following order:

          (a)  Deferred Deposits;

          (b)  Unmatured Vested Employer Contributions;

          (c)  Matured Vested Employer Contributions;

          (d)  Rollover Contributions;

          (e)  Unmatured Post-1986 Nondeferred Deposits;

          (f)  Matured Post-1986 Nondeferred Deposits;

          (g)  Pre-1987 Nondeferred Deposits.

Loan  proceeds  shall  not  be  taken from a  Participant's  ESOP Account, from
assets invested in the Personal Choice  Retirement  Account Fund,   from   that
portion of a Participant's Thrift Account attributable to Employer Contributions
made  in  shares  of  Enterprise   Common  Stock  or  from  that  portion  of  a
Participant's  Account  attributable to age and service credits transferred from
the Cash Balance Plan as a result of Participant  elections made pursuant to the
Cash Balance Plan and the Retirement Choice Program.

         Section  6.6  Special  Rules  for  Investment  in the  Personal  Choice
Retirement  Account  Fund.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this Plan to the
contrary, the investment in the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund shall be
subject to the following restrictions and limitations:

          (a)  only vested amounts in a Participant's Account may be transferred
               into the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund;
          (b)  the minimum initial investment shall be $2,000;
          (c)  additional  investments  shall be in  minimum  amounts  of $1,000
               (therefore, no Basic Deposits,  Supplemental Deposits or Employer
               Contributions  may be made  directly  into  the  Personal  Choice
               Retirement Account Fund);
          (d)  transfers in to and out of the Personal Choice Retirement Account
               Fund shall be in whole dollar amounts only;
          (e)  with respect to transfers out of the Personal  Choice  Retirement
               Account  Fund,  the  Participant   must  designate  the  specific
               investment(s)  which  is(are) to be liquidated in order to effect
               the requested transfer;
          (f)  participation  shall be subject to an annual  participation  fee,
               initially  $50.00,  which may be changed by the  Committee at any
               time and from time to time;
          (g)  the annual  participation  fee shall be  deducted  on the day the
               Participant  first  invests  in the  Personal  Choice  Retirement
               Account  Fund,  and first  business  day of  January  thereafter,
               prorata from the portion of the  Participant's  Account  which is
               not invested in the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund;
          (h)  all fees related to specific  transactions in the Personal Choice
               Retirement  Account  Fund  will be  deducted  directly  from  the
               Participant's Account (first, from the Personal Choice Retirement
               Account   Fund   Balance   and  then  from  the  balance  in  the
               Participant's other Funds;
          (i)  for the  period  10/1/99  through  9/30/00,  investment  shall be
               limited  to 50%  of  the  vested  balance  in  the  Participant's
               Account;
          (j)  for the  period  10/1/00  through  9/30/01,  investment  shall be
               limited  to 75%  of  the  vested  balance  in  the  Participant's
               Account;
          (k)  For the period 10/1/01 and beyond, any Participant  maintaining a
               balance  in the  Personal  Choice  Retirement  Account  Fund must
               maintain a minimum $500 vested balance in the Plan's other Funds;
          (l)  All transactions  within and from the Personal Choice  Retirement
               Account  Fund  shall be in settled  cash only and,  to the extent
               that a  transaction  has not settled,  further  transactions  and
               withdrawals from the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund will
               not be available; and
          (m)  No transfer may be made  directly from the Stable Value Fund into
               the  Personal  Choice  Retirement  Account  Fund and any  amounts
               transferred from the Stable Value Fund must be invested in one of
               the Plan's  other  equity  funds for at least 90 days before they
               may be transferred  into the Personal Choice  Retirement  Account
               Fund.

         Section 7.1. Establishment of Funds. Except as provided in subparagraph
7.1(b), the following Funds shall be established  exclusively for the collective
investment of Trust Fund assets attributable to Participant Thrift Accounts,  as
directed by Participants:

               principally be invested, directly or indirectly, in common stocks
               of domestic or foreign  corporations.  To the extent practicable,
               no Equities Fund shall invest in Enterprise Common Stock.

          (b)  One or more "Fixed Income Funds" the assets of which shall be (1)
               held  by an  insurance  company,  banking  institution  or  other

               for  the  repayment  in full of the  amounts  transferred  to the
               insurance company,  banking institution or other corporate entity
               plus interest at a fixed annual rate for a specified  period,  or
               (2)  invested  in  direct   obligations   of  the  United  States
               Government agencies thereof,  or in obligations  guaranteed as to
               the  payment of  principal  and  interest  by the  United  States
               Government  or  agencies  thereof,   or  in  fully  insured  bank
               deposits,  or fixed income  private or public  securities  or (3)
               invested  in assets  that meet the  criteria in (1) and (2) whose

               trust  and  excluding,  in all  cases,  securities  issued by any
               Employer,   except  that  this  limitation  shall  not  apply  to
               securities  held by any commingled  fund or common trust in which
               any portion of a "Fixed Income Fund" shall be invested. The terms
               of such agreements and the identity of such insurance  companies,
               banking  institutions,  other  corporate  entities  and/or  third
               parties shall be determined by the Committee from time to time.

               At the election of the Committee, any Fixed Income Fund
               established  hereunder  may be merged or combined  with the fixed

               shall  principally be invested,  directly or indirectly,  in debt
               obligations  issued or  guaranteed by the U. S.  Government,  its
               agencies or instrumentalities.

          (f)  One or more  "Balanced  Funds",  the  assets  of  which  shall be
               principally invested, directly or indirectly, in a combination of
               the  common  stocks  and  fixed-income   securities  of  domestic
               corporations.

          (g)  One or more "Bond Funds",  the assets of which shall  principally

temporarily  maintained  in cash,  or may be invested  directly or indirectly in
certain short-term  obligations as permitted by the Trust Agreement.  Dividends,
interest and other income in respect of any Fund shall be reinvested in the same
Fund to the extent not used to pay  expenses  of the Plan.  Except as  otherwise
limited  by  the  provisions  of  this  Plan,  withdrawals,   distributions  and
forfeitures,  except as otherwise  specified  in the Plan,  shall be charged pro
rata  against  the  various  Funds in which  the  subaccounts  from  which  such
withdrawals, distributions or forfeitures are then invested.

         Section 7.2 Enterprise Common Stock Fund.

          (a)  Enterprise Common Stock purchased for the Enterprise Common Stock
               Fund shall be  purchased  by the  Trustee  on the open  market or
               directly from  Enterprise  should  Enterprise  elect to make such
               sales.

          (b)  If  Enterprise  shall elect to sell shares of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock  directly to the Plan,  the price to be paid by the Trustee
               for any such  purchases  shall be the average of the high and low
               sales  prices of  Enterprise  Common Stock as reported by the New
               York Stock Exchange, Inc. on the date of purchase.

          (c)  All voting  discretion,  including the power to decide whether or
               not to tender Enterprise Common Stock in connection with a tender
               offer, with respect to the shares of Enterprise Common Stock held
               under the  Enterprise  Common  Stock  Fund for the  Account  of a
               Participant (whether vested or not vested) shall be vested in the
               Trustee.  However,  the  Trustee  shall  vote all such  shares in
               accordance  with the  directions  of such  Participant.  Within a
               reasonable  time before voting  rights are to be  exercised,  the
               Company or the Trustee shall cause to be sent to each Participant
               entitled  to  give  voting   instructions  all  information  that
               Enterprise has or will  distribute to  shareholders of Enterprise
               Common Stock regarding the exercise of such voting rights. Shares
               with respect to which no voting  instructions  are received shall
               not be voted by the Trustee.

          (d)  If, during the course of the Plan, Enterprise should grant to the
               holders of  Enterprise  Common  Stock  rights to  subscribe to an
               issue or issues of  securities  of  Enterprise,  any such  rights
               attaching  to the shares of  Enterprise  Common Stock held by the
               Trustee under the  Enterprise  Common Stock Fund shall be sold by
               the  Trustee and the net  proceeds  applied by the Trustee to the
               purchase of  Enterprise  Common Stock on the open market for such
               Fund.  Stock  dividends on shares held by the  Enterprise  Common
               Stock Fund, and stock issued upon any split of such shares, shall
               be credited to such Enterprise Common Stock Fund.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                 THRIFT ACCOUNTS

         Section 8.1  Establishment  of Thrift  Accounts.  The  Committee  shall
maintain or cause to be maintained a Thrift Account for each  Participant  which
shall  consist  of  the  following   subaccounts:   Basic  Deposit   Subaccount,
Supplemental Deposit Subaccount and Employer Contribution Subaccount, the assets
of which  shall be  invested  as  provided  in Section  5.2 or  pursuant  to the
direction of the  Participant as provided in Article VI. The assets of each such
subaccount  of the Thrift  Account  shall be  identified  as to  Nondeferred  or
Deferred.

         Section 8.2 Measure of Thrift Accounts.

          (a)  The interests of  Participants  in the Funds shall be measured by
               participating  units in the particular Fund, the number and value
               of which shall be  determined as of each business day as provided
               in the next  paragraph.  Each  participating  unit  shall have an
               equal  beneficial  interest  in the  Fund,  and none  shall  have
               priority or preference over any other.

          (b)  As soon as  practicable  at the end of  each  business  day,  the
               Trustee  shall  determine  the value of each such Fund as of such
               business day in the manner  prescribed  in Section 8.3. The value
               so   determined   shall  be  divided  by  the  total   number  of
               participating  units  allocated to the  Accounts of  Participants
               participating  in such Fund in accordance  with subsection (a) as
               of the prior  business day. The resulting  quotient  shall be the
               value  of a  participating  unit  as of  such  business  day  and
               participating  units shall be  allocated,  as such value,  to and
               from the Fund subaccounts of Participants for all transactions by
               them or on their behalf with respect to the current business day.
               The value of all  participating  units allocated to Participants'
               Fund  subaccounts  shall be redetermined in a similar manner each
               succeeding   business  day  and  participating   units  shall  be
               allocated to and from the Accounts of Participants  participating
               in such Fund at such value for all  transactions  with respect to
               such business day.  Fractional  units shall be calculated to such
               number of decimal  places as shall be determined by the Committee
               from time to time.

          (c)  If a Participant shall direct pursuant to Section 6.3 that his or
               her interest in a Fund or any part thereof  shall be  transferred
               to another Fund or Funds, or if such Participant's  interest in a
               Fund or any part thereof is distributed,  withdrawn,  borrowed or
               forfeited  under  Articles IV or XI, the number of  participating
               units  representing  such  interest or portion  thereof as of the
               applicable  business day shall be  cancelled  for purposes of any
               subsequent  determination  of  the  number  of and  value  of the
               participating units in such Fund.

         Section 8.3 Valuation of Funds.  The value of a Fund as of any business
day shall be the market value of all assets (including any uninvested cash) held
by the Fund as determined  by the Trustee,  reduced by the amount of any accrued
liabilities of the Fund on such business day and increased by Deposits, Rollover
Contributions and Employer  Contributions with respect to such business day. The
Trustee's determination of market value shall be binding and conclusive upon all
parties.

         Section 8.4 Valuation of Thrift Accounts.  The value of a Participant's
subaccount  for any  Fund as of any  business  day  shall  be the  value  of the
participating  units allocated to the Participant's  subaccount for such Fund as
of such  business day. The value of a  Participant's  Account as of any business
day shall be the  aggregate  of the values of such  subaccounts,  determined  as
provided in the preceding Sections of this Article VIII.

         Section 8.5 Separate Accounting.  The amounts of Deferred Deposits in a
Participant's Thrift Account shall at all times be separately accounted for from
other amounts in such Thrift Account, by allocating  investment gains and losses
on Deferred  Deposit amounts on a reasonable pro rata basis and by adjusting the
Deferred and other portions of the subaccounts of a Participant's Thrift Account
for withdrawals,  distributions,  borrowings and contributions.  Gains,  losses,
withdrawals, distributions, borrowings, forfeitures and other credits or charges
shall be separately  allocated  between such Deferred  Deposit amounts and other
portions of the subaccounts on a reasonable and consistent basis.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  ESOP ACCOUNTS

         Section 9.1 Maintenance of Separate  Accounts.  Each ESOP Account shall
be  maintained on the basis of shares of  Enterprise  Common Stock  allocated to
such ESOP Account, with each ESOP Account being credited with the number of full
and fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock so allocated.

         Section 9.2 Allocation of Distributions. Any distributions received by
the Plan with respect to Enterprise  Common Stock  allocated to a  Participant's
ESOP Account shall be allocated to such ESOP Account.

         Section 9.3 Withdrawals or Transfers.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  in the Plan to the  contrary,  a
               Participant may withdraw in accordance with Sections 11.3 or 11.4
               or  transfer  in  accordance  with  Section  6.3,  the  shares of
               Enterprise  Common Stock allocated to Participant's  ESOP Account
               or the cash value thereof.

          (b)  With  respect  to  an  election  of  a  Participant  to  withdraw
               Enterprise  Common Stock from  Participant's  ESOP  Account,  the
               shares  of  Enterprise  Common  Stock,  or the cash  value at the
               election of the  Participant,  shall be distributed in accordance
               with  Article  XI,  provided  that  such  Participant  elects  to
               withdraw  all full and  fractional  shares of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock  allocated to such ESOP Account or the cash value  thereof.
               Such  distribution  shall  be made as soon as  practicable  after
               receipt by the Record  Keeper of the  Participant's  election  to
               withdraw.

          (c)  With respect to an election of a Participant to transfer the cash
               value of all full and  fractional  shares  of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock from the  Participant's  ESOP Account to the  Participant's
               Thrift   Account,   such  transfer  shall  be  made  as  soon  as
               practicable   after   receipt  by  the   Record   Keeper  of  the
               Participant's  election to  transfer,  shall be  deposited in the
               Participant's  Thrift  Account,  shall be invested in one or more
               (in  multiples  of 1% up to an  aggregate  of 100%) of the Thrift
               Account Funds as such Participant  shall designate and thereafter
               shall be deemed a Rollover  Contribution and treated accordingly.
               The  cash  value  of each  share of  Enterprise  Common  Stock so
               transferred  shall be equal to the price of a share of Enterprise
               Common Stock actually received by the Trustee.

          (d)  A Participant may not borrow from his or her ESOP Account.


         Section 9.4 Dividends and Other Income.  Unless  otherwise  directed as
hereinafter  provided,  dividends paid in cash with respect to Enterprise Common
Stock  allocated to a  Participant's  ESOP Account shall be  distributed  to the
Participant as soon thereafter as practicable  and, in any event, not later than
90 days after the close of the Plan Year in which paid.  Enterprise Common Stock
delivered  to  the  Trustee  pursuant  to  a  stock  dividend,  stock  split  or
reorganization,  shall be allocated to the ESOP Account of  Participants in that
proportion  which the shares of each  Participant's  ESOP  Account  bears to the
total shares of all Participants' ESOP Accounts.

         Section 9.5 Voting of ESOP Account Common Stock. As provided in Section
7.2 with respect to the Enterprise Common Stock Fund, all voting discretion with
respect to stock held in a  Participant's  ESOP Account,  including the power to
decide  whether or not to tender  Enterprise  Common Stock in connection  with a
tender offer, shall be vested in the Trustee. Each Participant shall be entitled
to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which voting  rights  attributable  to
Enterprise  Common Stock (including  fractional  shares or fractional  rights to
shares) allocated to such Participant's ESOP Account are to be exercised. Within
a reasonable  time before voting rights are to be exercised,  the Trustee or the
Company  shall  cause to be sent to each  Participant  entitled  to give  voting
instructions   all  information  that  Enterprise  has  or  will  distribute  to
shareholders  of Enterprise  Common Stock  regarding the exercise of such voting
rights.  Such voting  rights  shall be  exercised by the Trustee but only to the
extent  directed  by a  Participant.  Shares  with  respect  to which no  voting
instructions are received shall not be voted by the Trustee.

                                     VESTING


         Section 10.1 Vesting of Employer Contributions.

          (a)  Upon  completion of five Years of Service,  a  Participant  shall
               have a  100%  vested  interest  in  his  or  her  Thrift  Account
               attributable  to  Employer  Contributions  made on behalf of such
               Participant  during any Plan Year. In addition,  if a Participant
               is eligible for Retirement,  suffers a Disability, is Laid Off or
               dies, such  Participant  shall have a 100% vested interest in his
               or her Thrift Account attributable to Employer  Contributions for
               all Plan  Years.  Also  notwithstanding  anything  herein  to the
               contrary,  a  Participant  who  is an  Employee  of  CEA  Kennedy
               Operators, Inc. or CEA Stony Brook Operators, Inc. on the date of
               the  sale of his or her  respective  Employer  shall  have a 100%
               vested  interest  in his or her Thrift  Account  attributable  to
               Employer Contributions for all Plan Years of participation.


          (b)  A Participant  will become vested in the value of his or her U.S.
               Energy Partners Employer Contribution Subaccount according to the
               following schedule based on his or her Years of Service:

               Years of                     Vested
               Service                    Percentage
               -------                    ----------
               Less than one                   0
               One                            20
               Two                            40

               Four                           80
               Five or more                  100

               In the case of a Participant who has received a  withdrawal  or a
               distribution  under  Article  XI at a time when his or her vested
               percentage  in  his  or  her  U.S.   Energy   Partners   Employer
               Contribution  Subaccount was at least 20% but less than 100%, and
               who is  employed by the Company or an  Affiliated  Company  after
               receiving  such a withdrawal or  distribution,  the amount of the
               vested  portion  of his  or her  U.S.  Energy  Partners  Employer
               Contribution  Subaccount  shall be  determined  according  to the
               following formula:

                        Amount of the Vested Portion = P(AB + D) - D

               P  is   the   vested  percentage at the relevant  time (e.g.,  at
               subsequent  termination of employment).  AB  is the U.S.  Energy
               Partners   Employer  Contribution  Subaccount  balance  at    the
               relevant  time.  D  is  the  amount of  the  prior  distribution
               attributable to U.S. Energy Employer Contribution Subaccount.

               (c)  For purposes of determining Years of Service,  a Participant
                    shall  not be  considered  to  have  interrupted  his or her
                    continuous service as a result of a leave of absence or as a
                    result of a termination  of employment;  provided,  however,
                    that the  periods  of  absence  from  employment  for  these
                    reasons  shall not be counted  toward  Years of Service  for
                    vesting purposes.

         Section 10.2 Vesting of Deposits,  Rollover  Contributions and the ESOP
Account. A Participant's  interest in his or her Thrift Account  attributable to
Deposits  and Rollover  Contributions  for all Plan Years and in his or her ESOP
Account shall be 100% vested at all times.

                      ACCOUNT DISTRIBUTIONS AND WITHDRAWALS

         Section  11.1  Distribution  Upon  Retirement,  Disability,  Lay Off or
Death.  If a  Participant  terminates  employment  on account of  Retirement  or
Disability,  is Laid Off or dies, then, in that event, the Participant's  Thrift
Account, determined as of the business day coinciding with or next following the
date of the last Deposit made by or which would have been made on behalf of such
Participant, together with the Participant's ESOP Account, shall:

          (a)  if the value of such Account as so  determined is $5,000 (or such
               other amount established by law) or less, be distributed, subject
               to the provisions of Section 11.10(c),  as soon as practicable to
               the Participant,  or in the case of death of the Participant,  to
               the  Participant's  beneficiary as determined in accordance  with
               Article XIV or, if none, to the Participant's estate; or

          (b)  if the value of such Account as so determined shall exceed $5,000
               (or such other amount  established by law), be  distributed  upon

               death of such  Participant or the receipt by the Record Keeper of
               an application for  distribution  (which may be for less than all
               of the Participant's Account balance provided,  however, that the
               amount  of  distribution  shall be at  least  $200,  unless  such
               distribution   is  of  100%  of  the  remaining   value  of  such
               Participant's Account) in a form prescribed by the Committee.

         Section 11.2 Distribution  Upon Other  Termination of Employment.  Upon
termination of a Participant's  employment with an Employer or for reasons other
than  Retirement,  Disability,  Lay Off or  death,  the  vested  portion  of the

following  the date of the last Deposit made by or which would have been made on
behalf of such  Participant,  or, if none, the business day  coinciding  with or
next following the date of termination, shall:

          (a)  if the value of such Account as so  determined is $5,000 (or such
               other amount established by law) or less, be distributed, subject
               to the provisions of Section 11.10(c),  as soon as practicable to
               the  Participant,  or,  in the case of  death of the  Participant
               after  termination of employment but prior to such  distribution,
               to  the   Participant's   beneficiary,   or,  if  none,   to  the
               Participant's estate; or

          (b)  if the value of such Account as so determined shall exceed $5,000
               (or such other amount established by law) be distributed upon the
               earliest of the Participant's  Required Beginning Date, the death
               of the  Participant  or the  receipt by the  Record  Keeper of an
               application for  distribution  (which may be for less than all of
               the  Participant's  Account balance provided,  however,  that the
               amount  of  distribution  shall be at  least  $200,  unless  such
               distribution   is  of  100%  of  the  remaining   value  of  such
               Participant's Account) in a form prescribed by the Committee.

         Any nonvested  portion of the Participant's  Account,  determined as of
the date of termination,  shall be forfeited and shall be applied  thereafter to
reduce a subsequent contribution or contributions of the Employer as provided in
Section 5.2. If such former  Participant  is rehired by an Employer on or before
the end of and is  employed  by an  Employer  at the end of the fifth  Plan Year
after the Plan Year in which  such  termination  occurred,  then such  nonvested
portion of the Participant's Account shall be reinstated by the Employer and the
Participant's  right thereto shall be determined as if the  Participant  had not
terminated  employment,  provided  that the  Participant  repays to the Plan the
amount of any  distribution  paid to him or her on account of the termination of
employment.

         The nonvested  portion of the Participant's  Account,  determined as of
the date of  termination,  shall be  forfeited as of the earlier of (i) the date
the  Participant  receives a cash-out  distribution  as  described  in  Treasury
Regulation  section  1.411(a)-7(d)  or (ii)  the time at  which  the  terminated
Participant  experiences five consecutive  one-year breaks in service, and shall
be applied  thereafter to reduce a subsequent  contribution or  contributions of
the Employer as provided in Section 5.2.

Beginning  Date,  upon  application  to the  Committee  in such format as it may

          (f)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,  no withdrawals of Employer
               Contributions  made in  shares  of  Enterprise  Common  Stock  or
               resulting  from  Participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash

Age 59 1/2. A  Participant  over the age 59 1/2 may withdraw all or a portion of
the value of his or her Thrift Account  attributable  to the Deferred  Deposits.

          (a)  Upon the  application  of any  Participant,  or his or her  legal
               representative,  the  Committee,  in  accordance  with a  uniform
               nondiscriminatory   policy,  shall  permit  such  Participant  to
               withdraw  such  portion of the value of his or her vested  Thrift
               Account as deemed to be necessary for the purpose of:

               (1)  Expenses for medical care  described in Code section  213(d)
                    previously  incurred by the Participant,  the  Participant's

               (4)  Payments   necessary   to  prevent   the   eviction  of  the
                    Participant  from his principal  residence or foreclosure on
                    the mortgage of the Participant's principal residence.

          (b)  A Participant or legal  representative  making  application under
               this  Section  11.6 shall have the  burden of  presenting  to the
               Committee  satisfactory  proof of such need. The Committee  shall
               not permit  withdrawal under this Section without first receiving
               such  proof  as it  shall  deem  necessary  to  demonstrate  such
               hardship.

          (c)  The  amount  which  may  be  withdrawn  shall  be  withdrawn,  as
               necessary, in the following order:

               (1)  Nondeferred   Deposits   together   with   vested   Employer
                    Contributions,  in the order prescribed by Section 11.4, but

               (2)  Deferred Supplemental Deposits; and

               (3)  Deferred Basic Deposits.

          (d)  A  withdrawal  will be  deemed  to be  necessary  to  satisfy  an
               immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if all of the
               following requirements are satisfied:

               (1)  The  withdrawal  is  not in  excess  of  the  amount  of the
                    immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant,

               (2)  The Participant has obtained all  distributions,  other than
                    hardship  withdrawals,  and all nontaxable  loans  currently
                    available under all plans maintained by his or her Employer,

               (3)  The Participant is prohibited under the terms of the Plan or
                    an  otherwise  legally  enforceable  agreement  from  making
                    elective  contributions  and employee  contributions  to the
                    Plan and all other  plans  maintained  by the  Company or an
                    Affiliate  for at  least  12  months  after  receipt  of the
                    hardship withdrawal, and

               (4)  The Plan and all other  plans  maintained  by the  Employer,
                    provide  that  the   Participant   may  not  make   elective
                    contributions for the Participant's taxable year immediately
                    following  the taxable  year of the hardship  withdrawal  in
                    excess of the applicable limit under Code section 402(g) for
                    such next taxable year less the amount of such Participant's
                    elective  contributions for the taxable year of the hardship
                    withdrawal. A Participant shall not fail to be treated as an
                    eligible  Participant  for purposes of paragraph (b) of this
                    Section  merely  because he is suspended in accordance  with
                    this provision.

               (e)  If a  Participant  shall make a withdrawal  pursuant to this
                    Section 11.6, then

                    (1)  the Participant shall not be permitted to make Deposits
                         (including  Additional  Lump Sum  Deposits) to the Plan
                         during  the one year  period  beginning  on the date of
                         receipt of such withdrawal; and

                    (2)  a Participant's Deferred Deposits for the Participant's

                         hardship   withdrawal   may  not   exceed   the   limit
                         established  under Code section  402(g) less the amount
                         of Deferred  Deposits  made by the  Participant  in the
                         year of such withdrawal.

               (f)  Amounts  available for hardship  withdrawals with respect to
                    Deferred  Deposits  will  be  limited  to  the  amount  of a
                    Participant's  Deferred  Deposits,  plus earnings  allocable
                    thereto which were credited to Participant's  Accounts as of
                    December 31, 1988, less the amount of any previous  hardship
                    withdrawals.

               (g)  A hardship  withdrawal  from the Thrift Account shall not be
                    permitted  unless  and until a  Participant  has  withdrawn,
                    pursuant to Section  9.3, all  Enterprise  Common Stock from
                    his or her ESOP Account.

               (h)  The hardship  withdrawal shall be paid to the Participant in
                    the amount approved as soon as practicable  after his or her
                    application is approved by the Committee.

               (i)  Notwithstanding  any of the  foregoing,  no  withdrawals  of
                    Employer  Contributions  made in shares of Enterprise Common
                    Stock or resulting from Participant  elections made pursuant
                    to the Cash Balance Plan and the  Retirement  Choice Program
                    shall be  permitted  prior to the date that the  Participant
                    terminates his or her employment.

to be an Eligible  Employee,  Deposits and Employer  Contributions to his or her
Thrift  Account shall be suspended and no Additional  Lump Sum Deposits shall be
permitted to be made during the period of  ineligibility.  Distribution  of such
Participant's Account shall be deferred until such Participant's  termination of
employment with an Employer, whereupon the Participant's Thrift Account shall be
distributed  in accordance  with the  applicable  provisions of this Article XI.
Such  Participant  shall  continue to be deemed a  Participant  for all purposes
other than for Articles IV and V during such period of ineligibility.

         Section  11.8  Transfer  of  Employment.  If  a  Participant  shall  be
transferred to the employ of an Affiliate which is not an Employer, distribution
of such  Participant's  Account shall be deferred  until the  Participant  is no
longer  in  the  employ  of  the  Employer  or  any  Affiliate,   whereupon  the
Participant's  Account shall be  distributed  in accordance  with the applicable
provisions of this Article XI. Such transferred Participant shall continue to be
deemed a  Participant  for all purposes  other than for Articles IV and V during
such period of deferral of distribution.

         Section 11.9 Form of Distributions.

          (a)  All distributions  from the Plan shall be made in money by check,
               except that in the case of a lump sum  distribution  only,  other
               than a hardship  withdrawal  in  accordance  with Section 11.6, a
               Participant  may,  by  notice  to the  Record  Keeper in the form
               prescribed by the  Committee,  (i) elect to have any whole shares
               of Enterprise Common Stock held for such Participant's Enterprise
               Common Stock Fund subaccount  and/or ESOP Account  distributed in
               shares of  Enterprise  Common Stock (the value of any  fractional
               shares shall be paid in money by check) and/or (ii) elect to have
               particular assets held in the Personal Choice Retirement  Account
               Fund  transferred  to an individual  retirement  account with the
               vendor  administering  the Personal - Choice  Retirement  Account
               Fund.  Any such  election  may be made at any  time  prior to the
               distribution  under Sections 11.1 and 11.2 or prior to receipt by
               the Record  Keeper of the notice of  withdrawal  in the case of a
               distribution  under Sections 11.3 or 11.4. If no such election is
               made, the entire value of the amount of the Participant's Account
               being distributed shall be distributed in money by check.

          (b)  All  distributions  from the Plan  shall be made in one lump sum,
               with the following exceptions:

               (1)  In the case of a distribution  from a Participant's  Account
                    on account of a Participant's  Retirement,  such Participant
                    may  elect to have his or her  Account,  including  the ESOP
                    Account,  which is to be transferred  into one of the Thrift
                    Account Funds,  distributed in annual or quarterly  payments
                    in money by check by the Trustee in amounts as nearly  equal
                    as possible for a specified number of years up to ten years.
                    Each payment  shall be an amount equal to the  Participant's
                    Thrift  Account  as of the  applicable  date  divided by the
                    number of payments remaining.

               (2)  In the  case of a  distribution  from a  Participant's  U.S.
                    Energy Partners Account which exceeds,  or has ever exceeded
                    at the time of any prior  distribution,  $3,500, if any, the
                    Participant  may  elect  to  have  his  or her  U.S.  Energy
                    Partners Account distributed in one of the following forms:

                    (A)  in the  form of a joint  and  survivor  annuity  with a
                         benefit following the Participant's death continuing to
                         the  Participant's  spouse during the spouse's lifetime
                         at a rate  equal  to  100%  (or,  at the  Participant's
                         election,  50%) of the  rate  at  which  benefits  were
                         payable to the Participant.

                    (B)  in the form of a single life annuity, provided that the
                         Participant's spouse consents.

          (c)  If a Participant shall die prior to complete  distribution of his
               or her Thrift Account pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the value of
               the Participant's  Thrift Account shall be distributed as soon as
               practicable in a lump sum to the Participant's  beneficiary,  or,
               if none, to the Participant's  estate.  The amount so distributed
               after a  Participant's  death  shall  be the  remaining  value of
               Participant's  Thrift  Account  determined as of the business day
               coinciding  with or next following the date of the  Participant's
               death.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant who has a
               U.S. Energy Partners Account which exceeds,  or has ever exceeded
               at the time of any prior distribution, $3,500 dies before amounts
               have  become  distributable  under  subsection  (b),  his  or her
               surviving  spouse,  if any,  may  elect to have  the U.S.  Energy
               Partners  Account paid in the form of a pre  retirement  survivor
               annuity.  In addition,  if a  Participant  who has a U.S.  Energy
               Partners  Account dies after  amounts  have become  distributable
               under paragraph (2) of subsection (b), survivor benefits, if any,
               will be paid in accordance with the annuity elected.

          (d)  If no  election  is made under  subparagraph  (b) above,  and the
               value of a Participant's Thrift Account, when aggregated with the
               value of any ESOP Account and/or U.S. Energy Partners  Account of
               the  Participant,  determined  in  accordance  with  Article  IX,
               exceeds  $3,500,  a distribution  will be made in one lump sum at
               the time provided for in Section 11.1 or Section 11.2,  except as
               otherwise provided in Section 11.6.

          (e)  Anything  to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  any Thrift  Account
               distribution to be made to a Participant  under  subparagraph (b)
               (1) above shall be made in such a manner  that the present  value
               of the payments to be made to the  Participant  during his or her
               life expectancy are calculated to be more than 50% of the present
               value of the total payments to be made to the Participant and any
               beneficiaries.

         Section 11.10 Time of Distributions.

          (a)  All  distributions  from  the  Plan  shall  commence  as  soon as
               practicable,  and in any  event no later  than 60 days  after the
               close  of the  Plan  Year in  which  the  Participant  terminates
               employment, reaches his or her Required Beginning Date, dies, or,
               if applicable, requests distribution under Section 11.1 and 11.2,
               or 60  days  after  the  close  of the  Plan  Year in  which  the
               Participant elects to withdraw funds from the Plan in the case of
               distributions under Sections 9.3, 9.4, 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5.

          (b)  In the  case of a  distribution  over a  period  of  years  under
               subparagraph  (b) of Section 11.9,  the initial  payment shall be
               made at a time determined in accordance with  subparagraph (a) of
               this  Section  11.10.  In the case of annual  distributions,  the
               remaining  annual  payments shall be made in successive  calendar
               years  on such  date  each  year as shall  be  determined  by the
               Committee,  subject  to the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (b) of
               Section 11.9 in the case of the Participant's  death. In the case
               of quarterly distributions,  the remaining payments shall be made
               each successive  three month period on such day during the period
               as may be established by the Committee, subject to the provisions
               of  subparagraph   (b)  of  Section  11.9  in  the  case  of  the
               Participant's death.

          (c)  In the  case of a  distribution  on  account  of a  Participant's
               Retirement,  subject to the provisions of subsection  11.11,  the
               Participant may elect to have his or her Account distributed as a
               lump sum during (1) the Plan Year next following the Plan Year of
               his or her  Retirement  or (2)  the  next  succeeding  Plan  Year
               thereafter  or (3) if the Account value  exceeds  $5,000,  at any
               time up to the Participant's  Required Beginning Date. If no such
               election is made,  distribution shall commence in accordance with
               Section 11.1 and subparagraph (a) above.

         Section 11.11 Limitation on Post Age 70 1/2 Distributions.

         Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 11.9 and 11.10:

          (a)  the entire interest of a Participant must:

               (1)  be  distributed  not later than the  Participant's  Required
                    Beginning Date, or,

               (2)  commence no later than such Required  Beginning  Date and be
                    payable in accordance with regulations under the Code over a
                    period  not  extending  beyond the life  expectancy  of such
                    Participant.

          (b)  If a Participant  dies before his or her entire interest has been
               distributed,  then such entire interest (or the remaining part of
               such interest if  distribution  thereof has  commenced)  shall be
               distributed within five years after the Participant's death, and,
               if  distribution   has  commenced   prior  to  death,   shall  be
               distributed  at least as rapidly  as the  method of  distribution
               being used as of the date of such Participant's death.

          (c)  The amount of the distribution  required by this Section 11.11 is
               to be determined by Treasury  Regulations Section 1.72-9, Table V
               using  the  attained  age  of  the  Participant  as  provided  in
               regulations   without   recalculation  of  the  life  expectancy;
               provided,  however,  that the amount of the distribution required
               by this Section 11.11 with respect to a Participant's U.S. Energy
               Partners  Account,  if  any,  is to  be  determined  by  Treasury
               Regulations Section 1.72-9, using the attained age or ages of the
               Participant and his or her designated  beneficiary as provided in
               regulations with  recalculation  of the life  expectancies as the
               Participant  may elect.  Distribution  will be made in accordance
               with the regulations under Code section 401(a)(9),  including the
               minimum  distribution  incidental  death benefit  requirement  of
               section  1.401(a)(9)-2,  and such regulations  shall override any
               inconsistent Plan provisions.

     Section  11.12  Distribution  in the Case of Certain  Disabilities.  In the
event that the Committee  shall find that any person  entitled to a distribution
under the Plan is unable to care for his or her  affairs  because  of illness or
accident or because the person is a minor or has died,  the Committee may direct
that any  distribution  due such  person,  unless  claim  shall  have  been made
therefor by a duly appointed legal representative,  be paid or applied to or for
the  benefit of such  person,  or his or her  spouse,  any child of such  person
(including an adopted child), any parent or other blood relative of such person,
or a person with whom the person  resides,  or any of them, and any such payment
or application so made shall be a complete  discharge of the  liabilities of the
Plan therefor.

         Section 11.13 Loans.

          (a)  The  Committee  shall have  complete  authority to establish  and
               administer a loan program to provide loans to  Participants.  The
               loan program shall include the following:

               (1)  A procedure for applying for loans;
               (2)  The basis on which loans will be approved or denied;
               (3)  Limitations  (if  any) on the  types  and  amounts  of loans
                    offered;
               (4)  The  procedure  under the loan  program  for  determining  a
                    reasonable rate of interest;
               (5)  The types of collateral which may secure a loan; and
               (6)  The events  constituting  default and the steps that will be
                    taken to preserve plan assets in the event of such default.

               The  rules   and  applicable limitations  established by the loan
               program shall be such as to prevent any loan from constituting  a
               prohibited  transaction under Code section 4975 and ERISA section
               406, or a Plan distribution under Code section 72(p).

          (b)  The Trustee shall, subject to the approval of the General Manager
               and  compliance  with the written loan program and the provisions
               of the Code, lend a Participant,  who is employed by an Employer,
               an amount up to 50% of the vested  portion of his or her Account,
               including  the ESOP  Account,  but not more than  $50,000  in the
               aggregate as of the date on which the loan is approved reduced by
               the highest  outstanding loan balance during the preceding twelve
               months.  However,  no amount may be loaned directly from any ESOP
               Account,  from any portion of the  Enterprise  Common  Stock Fund
               attributable to Employer  Contributions  made in shares of stock,
               from Employer Contributions  resulting from Participant elections
               made pursuant to the Cash Balance Plan and the Retirement  Choice
               Program  or  from   investments   held  in  the  Personal  Choice
               Retirement  Account Fund.  The General  Manager shall review each
               application  for a  loan  in a  nondiscriminatory  manner  and in
               accordance with such rules as may be prescribed by the Committee.
               Loans,  if  approved,   shall  be  made  as  soon  thereafter  as
               practicable.

          (c)  In addition to such rules and  regulations  as the  Committee may
               adopt,  all  loans  shall  comply  with the  following  terms and
               conditions:

               (1)  An application for a loan by an eligible  Participant  shall
                    be made by making application  therefor to the Record Keeper
                    in the form prescribed by the Committee.

               (2)  An eligible Participant may not apply for more than one loan
                    in  any  calendar  year  nor  for a  loan  with  an  initial
                    principal  amount of less than $1,000 and, in any event, may
                    not have  more  than two (2)  loans  outstanding  at any one
                    time.

               (3)  All loans,  including  interest thereon,  shall be repaid by
                    payroll  deduction  in  equal  monthly  installments  over a
                    period of 12 to 60 months as  selected  by the  Participant.
                    Nothing herein,  however,  shall prohibit a Participant from
                    prepaying  such  loan in  whole  or in part in a lump sum in
                    accordance  with such rules as may be established  from time
                    to time by the Committee.

               (4)  Each  loan  shall  be  secured  by  an   assignment  of  the
                    Participant's entire right, title and interest in and to the
                    Trust  Fund to the extent of the loan and  accrued  interest
                    thereon  and  shall  be  evidenced   by  the   Participant's
                    promissory  note  for  the  amount  of the  loan,  including
                    interest, payable to the order of the Trustee.

               (5)  Each loan shall bear  interest at a  reasonable  rate (which
                    rate may be a variable rate) to be established  from time to
                    time by the  Committee,  not in violation of any  applicable
                    usury laws. In determining  the interest rate, the Committee
                    shall take into  consideration  interest rates being charged
                    by other lenders at the time of such determination.

          (d)  No  distribution  shall be made to any Participant or beneficiary
               thereof  unless and until all unpaid  loans,  including  interest
               thereon, have been repaid.

         Section  11.14  Inability  to Locate  Payee.  Any benefit  payable to a
Participant or beneficiary shall be forfeited if the Employer,  after reasonable
effort,  is unable to locate such  Participant or beneficiary to whom payment is
due.  The amount of any such  forfeited  benefit  shall be applied to reduce the
amount of Employer  Contributions required under the Plan as provided in Section
5.3. However,  any such forfeited benefit shall be reinstated and become payable
if a claim therefor is made by such Participant or beneficiary.

         Section 11.15  Federal  Income Tax  Withholding  on  Distributions  and
Withdrawals.  Distributions  and withdrawals under this Plan shall be subject to
Federal  income tax  withholding  as  prescribed  by Code  section  3405 and the
regulations thereunder.

         Section  11.16  Direct  Rollover  to  Another  Plan or IRA On or  after
January 1, 1993, at the election of a Participant or his spouse or former spouse
entitled to a  distribution  under Section 22.1 or the  foregoing  provisions of
this  Article  XI,  the  Committee  shall  direct  the  Trustee to make a direct
rollover to the trustee or other custodian of an "eligible  retirement  plan" by
any reasonable  means  (including  providing the Participant or spouse or former
spouse with a check made payable only to the trustee or  custodian) of all, or a
specified  portion,  of an  "eligible  rollover  distribution,"  subject  to the
following restrictions:

          (a)  An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
               any  portion  of  the  Participant's  Account,   except  that  an
               "eligible rollover distribution" does not include

               (i)  any  distribution  that is one of a series of  substantially
                    equal  periodic  payments  (made  not less  frequently  than
                    annually)  made for the life  (or  life  expectancy)  of the
                    recipient or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
                    the recipient and the recipient's designated beneficiary, or
                    for a specified period of at least ten years; or

               (ii) any distribution required under Code section 401(a)(9).

          (b)  An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
               described  in  Code  section  408(a),  an  individual  retirement
               annuity  described  in  Code  section  408(b),  an  annuity  plan
               described in Code section 403(a),  or a qualified trust described
               in Code section 401(a),  that accepts the  recipient's  "eligible
               rollover  distribution."  If the  recipient is the  Participant's
               surviving  spouse,   but  not  an  alternate  payee  receiving  a
               distribution pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, an
               "eligible  retirement plan" is an individual  retirement  account
               described  in Code  section  408(a) or an  individual  retirement
               annuity  described  in  Code  section  408(b)  that  accepts  the
               surviving spouse's  "eligible rollover  distribution," but not an
               annuity plan  described  in Code  section  403(a) nor a qualified
               trust described in Code section 401(a).

          (c)  The  Participant  or his or her  spouse  or  former  spouse  must
               specify,  in such  form  and at such  time as the  Committee  may
               prescribe,   the   "eligible   retirement   plan"  to  which  the
               distribution  is to  be  paid  and  may  specify  more  than  one
               "eligible                                              retirement
               plan."

          (d)  The  Participant  or his or her  spouse  or  former  spouse  must
               provide to the Committee in a timely manner adequate  information
               regarding the designated "eligible retirement plan".

                                   ARTICLE XII
           LIMITS ON BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER QUALIFIED PLANS

         Section  12.1.  Definitions.  For  purposes of this  Article  XII,  the
following definitions and rules of interpretation shall apply:

          (a)  "Annual  Additions"  to a  participant's  account under a defined
               benefit plan or a defined  contribution plan is the sum, credited
               to a participant's account for any Limitation Year, of:

               (1)  Company contributions,

               (2)  Forfeitures, if any,

               (3)  Employee contributions and

               (4)  Amounts, if any,  attributable to medical benefits allocated
                    to an account established under Code section 419 A (d)(2) on
                    behalf of such Participant.

          (b)  "Annual Benefit"

               (1)  A  benefit  which  is  payable  annually  in the  form  of a
                    straight  life annuity under a defined  benefit  plan.  Such
                    benefit does not include any benefits attributable to either
                    employee  contributions  or rollover  contributions.  If the
                    defined  benefit plan  provides  for a benefit  which is not
                    payable in the form of a straight life annuity,  the benefit
                    is adjusted in accordance with Section 12.1(b)(5) below.

               (2)  Where a defined benefit plan provides for mandatory employee
                    contributions (as defined in Code section 411(c)(2)(C)), the
                    Annual Benefit  attributable  to such  contributions  is not
                    taken into  account.  The  Annual  Benefit  attributable  to
                    mandatory  contributions  is determined by using the factors
                    described in Code section  411(c)(2)(B)  and the regulations
                    thereunder.  However,  mandatory employee  contributions and
                    any voluntary  employee  contributions  are all considered a
                    separate  defined   contribution   plan  maintained  by  the
                    Company.

               (3)  If  rollover  contributions  are made to a  defined  benefit
                    plan, the Annual Benefit attributable to these contributions
                    is  determined   on  the  basis  of   reasonable   actuarial
                    assumptions.

               (4)  When there is a transfer of assets or  liabilities  from one
                    qualified  defined  benefit  plan  to  another,  the  Annual
                    Benefit  attributable to the assets transferred shall not be
                    taken into  account by the  transferee  plan in applying the
                    limitations of Code section 415. The Annual Benefit  payable
                    on  account  of the  transfer  for  any  individual  that is
                    attributable to the assets  transferred will be equal to the
                    Annual  Benefit  transferred  on behalf  of such  individual
                    multiplied  by a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the
                    total assets transferred and the denominator of which is the
                    total liabilities transferred.

               (5)  If a defined  benefit plan provides a retirement  benefit in
                    any  form  other  than a  straight  life  annuity,  the plan
                    benefit is adjusted to a straight life annuity  beginning at
                    the  same  age  which is the  actuarial  equivalent  of such
                    benefit  in  accordance  with the  rules  determined  by the
                    Commissioner.  However,  the following  values are not taken
                    into account:

                    (i)  The value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as
                         defined  in  Code  section  417  and  the   regulations
                         thereunder)  provided  by the plan to the  extent  that
                         such value exceeds the sum of

                        (A)   the value of a straight life annuity  beginning on
                              the same date and

                        (B)   the value of any  post-retirement  death  benefits
                              which would be payable even if the annuity was not
                              in the form of a joint and survivor annuity.

                    (ii) The value of benefits that are not directly  related to
                         retirement benefits (such as pre-retirement  disability
                         and  death   benefits   and   post-retirement   medical
                         benefits).


                    (iii)The  value  of  benefits  provided  by the  plan  which
                         reflect post-retirement cost of living increases to the
                         extent that such increases are in accordance  with Code
                         section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder.

               (6)  Where a defined  benefit plan provides a retirement  benefit
                    beginning  before a  participant  has  attained  the  Social
                    Security   Retirement   Age,  the  plan  benefit  shall,  in
                    accordance  with rules  determined by the  Commissioner,  be
                    adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of a benefit commencing
                    at the Social  Security  Retirement  Age. This adjustment is
                    only  for  purposes  of  applying   the  dollar   limitation
                    described   in  Code   section   415(b)(1)(A)   and  Section
                    12.1(f)(1) to the Annual Benefit of the participant.

               (7)  Where a  participant  has less than 10 Years of Service with
                    the  Company at the time the  Participant  begins to receive
                    retirement  benefits  under the defined  benefit  plan,  the
                    benefit limitations  described in Code sections 415(b)(1)(B)
                    and  415(b)(4) and Section  12.1(f)(2)  are to be reduced by
                    multiplying  the  otherwise   applicable   limitation  by  a
                    fraction:

                    (i)  the  numerator  which  is the  Years  of  Service  (and
                         fractions   thereof)   with  the  Company  as  of,  and
                         including the current Limitation Year, and

                    (ii) the denominator of which is 10.

                    The  preceding  sentence  shall  also  apply for purposes of
                    reducing  the benefit  limitation  described in Code section
                    415(b)(1)(A) and Section  12.1(f)(1),  by substituting years
                    of participation for Years of Service wherever it appears in
                    such sentence.

                    (iii)If the retirement  benefit under a defined benefit plan
                         begins  after the  Participant  has attained the Social
                         Security   Retirement  Age,  the  determination  as  to
                         whether the Maximum  Permissible Defined Benefit Amount
                         limitation  has  been   satisfied   shall  be  made  in
                         accordance   with   regulations   prescribed   by   the
                         Commissioner  by  adjusting  such benefit so that it is
                         actuarially  equivalent to such a benefit  beginning at
                         the Social Security  Retirement Age. This adjustment is
                         only for purposes of applying the limitation  described
                         in Code section  415(b)(1)(A) and Section 12.1(f)(1) to
                         the Annual Benefit of the participant.

               (8)  The Annual Benefit to which a participant is entitled at any
                    time  under all  defined  benefit  plans  maintained  by the
                    Company shall not,  during the Limitation  Year,  exceed the
                    Maximum Permissible Defined Benefit Amount.

               (9)  In  determining  the actuarial  equivalency  for purposes of
                    Sections  12.1(b)(5),  12.1(b)(6) and 12.1(b)(8)  above, the
                    interest rate shall be 5%.

          (c)  "Company"  shall mean the  Company,  as described in Section 2.11
               and any Affiliate as defined in Section 2.4.

          (d)  "Compensation" with respect to a Limitation Year -

               (1)  includes  amounts  paid  to  a  Participant  (regardless  of
                    whether  he or she was such  during  the  entire  Limitation
                    Year);

                    (i)  as wages, salaries,  fees for professional services and

                         actually  rendered in the course of employment with any
                         Company  including  but  not  limited  to  commissions,
                         compensation  for services on the basis of a percentage
                         of profits,  fringe benefits,  reimbursements and other
                         expense  allowances  under   nonaccountable  plans  (as
                         described  in  Treasury   Regulation   1.b2-2(c))   and
                         bonuses;  (ii) for purposes of (A) above, earned income

                         gross income under Code section 911 or deductible under
                         Code sections 931 and 933;

                         are includable in the gross income of the Participant;

                    (iv) in the case of an  employee  within the meaning of Code
                         section 401(c)(1) and the regulations  thereunder,  the
                         Participant's  earned  income  (as  described  in  Code
                         section 401(c)(2) and the regulations thereunder);

                    (iv) amounts  paid or  reimbursed  by the Company for moving

                         Participant  by a Company,  but only to the extent that
                         the  value of the  option  is  includable  in the gross
                         income of the Participant for the taxable year in which

                    (vi) The  amount   includable  in  the  gross  income  of  a

               (2)  Compensation does not include -

                    (i)  notwithstanding   subsection  (1)(A)  of  this  Section

                         thereunder);

                    (ii) other  contributions  made by the  Company to a plan of
                         deferred  compensation  to the extent that,  before the
                         application of the Code section 415  limitations to the
                         plan, the contributions are not includable in the gross

                         considered  as  Compensation  for the  taxable  year in
                         which contributed to the extent such  contributions are
                         deductible  by  the  Participant   under  Code  section
                         219(b)(7).  Additionally, any distributions from a plan

                         Compensation,  regardless  of whether  such amounts are
                         includable in the gross income of the Participant  when
                         distributed.   However,   any  amounts  received  by  a
                         Participant  pursuant to an unfunded  nonqualified plan
                         shall be  considered as  Compensation  in the year such
                         amounts  are  includable  in the  gross  income  of the
                         Participant;

                    (iii)amounts  realized  from the exercise of a  nonqualified
                         stock  option or when  restricted  stock (or  property)
                         held   by   a   Participant   either   becomes   freely
                         transferable  or is no longer  subject to a substantial
                         risk  of  forfeiture  (see  Code  section  83  and  the
                         regulations thereunder);

                    (vi) amounts  realized  from  the  sale,  exchange  or other
                         disposition of stock  acquired under a qualified  stock
                         option;

                    (v)  other amounts which receive special tax benefits,  such
                         as premiums for group term life  insurance (but only to
                         the extent that the premiums are not  includable in the
                         gross income of the Participant);

          (e)  "Limitation Year" - the Plan Year;

          (f)  "Maximum  Permissible  Defined Benefit Amount" - for a Limitation
               Year the Maximum  Permissible Defined Benefit Amount with respect
               to any Participant shall be the lesser of:

               (1)  $90,000, or,

               (2)  100% of the  Participant's  average  Compensation for his or
                    her high three consecutive Years of Service,  subject to the
                    following rules:

                    (i)  As of January 1 of each calendar year  commencing  with
                         the calendar year 1988, the dollar limitation set forth
                         in Paragraph (1) above shall be adjusted  automatically
                         to equal the dollar  limitation  as  determined  by the
                         Commissioner  for that calendar year under Code section
                         415(d)(1)(A). This adjustment dollar limitation applies
                         for the  Limitation  Year  ending  with or  within  the
                         calendar  year.  It is  applicable to Employees who are
                         Participants  in the  Plan  and to  Employees  who have
                         retired or otherwise terminated their service under the
                         Plan with a nonforfeitable  right to accrued  benefits,
                         regardless  of  whether  they  have  actually  begun to
                         receive such benefits.  The Annual Benefit payable to a
                         terminated  Participant  which is otherwise  limited by
                         the dollar  limitation  shall be increased to take into
                         account the adjustment of the dollar limitation.

                    (ii) With regard to  Participants  who have  separated  from
                         service  with  a  nonforfeitable  right  to an  accrued
                         benefit,  the  compensation   limitation  described  in
                         paragraph  (2) above  applicable  to  Limitation  Years
                         commencing  on and  after  January  1,  1976  shall  be
                         adjusted annually to take into account increases in the
                         cost of living. For any Limitation Year beginning after
                         the   separation   occurs,   the   adjustment   of  the
                         compensation   limitation   is  made  as  specified  in
                         regulations and rules  prescribed by the  Commissioner.
                         In the case of a Participant who separated from service
                         prior to January 1, 1976, the cost of living adjustment
                         of the compensation limitation under this paragraph for
                         all Limitation Years prior to January 1, 1976, is to be
                         determined as provided by the Commissioner.

                    (iii)Anything  herein to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  in
                         the case of an individual  who was a Participant in the
                         Plan  before  January  1, 1983,  if such  Participant's
                         "current   accrued  benefit"  (as  defined  in  section
                         235(g)(4)  of the Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility
                         Act of 1982  ("TEFRA"))  under the Plan as of the close
                         of the last Limitation Year beginning before January 1,
                         1983  exceeded  the dollar  limitation  with respect to
                         such  Participant  under  Section  12.1(g)(1)  shall be
                         equal to such current accrued benefit.

                    (iv) Anything  herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,  for
                         any  individual  who was a  Participant  in the Plan on
                         January 1, 1987, if such Participant's "current accrued
                         benefit"  under the Plan,  as that term is  defined  in
                         section 1106(i)(3)(B) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as
                         of the  close of the  last  Limitation  Year  beginning
                         before   January  1,  1987   exceeded  the   limitation
                         described  in  Section  12.1(f)(1)  above,  the  dollar
                         limitation  with  respect  to  such  Participant  under
                         Section  12.1(f)(1)  shall  be  equal  to such  current
                         accrued benefit.

          (g)  "Maximum   Permissible  Defined  Contribution  Amount"  -  for  a
               Limitation  Year the  Maximum  Permissible  Defined  Contribution
               Amount with respect to any Participant shall be the lesser of:

               (1)  $30,000,  or if  greater,  one fourth of the  limitation  in
                    effect under Code section  415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted by Code
                    section 415(d)(1)(A)).

               (2)  25% of the  Participant's  Compensation  for the  Limitation
                    year.

               Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  or   anything   herein  to  the
               contrary,  the  percentage  of  compensation  limitation  of this
               Section  12.1(g)(2)  shall  not  apply  to any  Annual  Additions
               pursuant to Section 12.1(a)(4) above.

          (h)  "Projected  Annual  Benefit"  - the  Annual  Benefit  to  which a
               Participant  would be entitled  under the Plan on the  assumption
               that he or she continues  employment until the normal  retirement
               age (or current  age, if that is later)  thereunder,  that his or
               her Compensation  continues at the same rate as in effect for the
               Limitation Year under  consideration until such age, and that all
               other relevant factors used to determine  benefits under the Plan
               remain constant as of the current  Limitation Year for all future
               Limitation Years;

          (i)  "Social Security Retirement Age" - the age used as the retirement
               age under  Social  Security Act section  216(1)  except that such
               section shall be applied:

               (1)  without regard to the age increase factor, and,

               (2)  as if the early  retirement  age under  Social  Security Act
                    section 216(1)(2) were 62.

          (j)  For purposes of applying the limitations of Code sections 415(b),
               (c) and (e) to a Participant  for a particular  Limitation  Year,
               all qualified  defined benefit plans (without regard to whether a
               plan has been  terminated) ever maintained by the Company will be
               treated as one defined  benefit  plan and all  qualified  defined
               contribution  plans  (without  regard to  whether a plan has been
               terminated)  ever  maintained  by the Company  will be treated as
               part of this Plan.

         Section 12.2 Annual Addition Limits.  The amount of the Annual Addition
which may be  credited  under this Plan to any  Participant's  Account as of any
allocation date shall not exceed the Maximum  Permissible  Defined  Contribution
Amount (based upon his or her  Compensation up to such allocation  date) reduced
by the sum of any credits of Annual Additions made to the Participant's  Account
under all defined  contribution plans as of any preceding allocation date within
the  Limitation  Year.  If an  allocation  date of this Plan  coincides  with an
allocation date of any other qualified  defined  contribution plan maintained by
the Company, the amount of the Annual Additions which may be credited under this
Plan to any  Participant's  Account as of such date shall be an amount  equal to
the product of the amount to be credited  under this Plan without regard to this
Section 12.2  multiplied  by the lesser of one or a fraction,  the  numerator of
which is the amount  described in this Section 12.2 during the  Limitation  Year
and the  denominator of which is the amount that would be otherwise  credited on
this allocation date under all defined contribution plans without regard to this
Section 12.2. However, if a security is not allocated to a Participant's Account
under any  qualified tax credit  employee  stock  ownership  plan of the Company
because  of the  operation  of the  limitations  of  Code  section  415  and the
provisions  of this  Section  12.2,  no other  amount  may be  allocated  to the
Participant's  Account  under this Plan after the  allocation  date for such tax
credit employee stock  ownership  plan's plan year,  until all such  unallocated
securities  have been  allocated in accordance  with the  provisions of such tax
credit employee stock ownership plan. If contributions to this Plan on behalf of
a Participant are to be reduced as a result of this Section 12.2, such reduction
shall be effected by reducing contributions in the following order: Supplemental
Nondeferred  Deposits,  Basic Nondeferred  Deposits and  corresponding  matching
Company Contributions, Supplemental Deferred Deposits and finally, if necessary,
Basic  Deferred   Deposits  and   corresponding   remaining   matching   Company
Contributions.   If,  as  a  result  of  a  reasonable  error  in  estimating  a
Participant's  Compensation,  or under the limited facts and circumstances which
the  Commissioner  finds  justify  the  availability  of the  rules set forth in
paragraphs  (a)-(c) of this Section 12.2,  the  allocation  of Annual  Additions
under  the  terms of the Plan  for a  particular  Participant  would  cause  the
limitations  of  Code  section  415  applicable  to  that  Participant  for  the
Limitation  Year to be exceeded,  the excess  amounts  shall not be deemed to be
Annual Additions in that Limitation Year if they are treated as follows:


          (a)  To the extent  necessary,  Deferred Deposits to the Plan shall be
               recharacterized  as  Nondeferred  Deposits and the  Participant's
               Nondeferred  Deposits to the Plan  (including  Deferred  Deposits
               recharacterized as Nondeferred  Deposits  hereunder) and earnings
               thereon shall be returned to the Participant.

          (b)  The excess  amounts in the  Participant's  Account  consisting of
               Company   Contributions   shall   be  used  to   reduce   Company
               Contributions  for  the  next  Limitation  Year  (and  succeeding
               Limitation  Years,  as necessary)  for that  Participant  if that
               Participant  is  covered  by  the  Plan  as of  the  end  of  the
               Limitation Year.  However,  if that Participant is not covered by
               the Plan as of the end of the  Limitation  Year  then the  excess
               amounts must be held  unallocated  in a suspense  account for the
               Limitation  Year  and  allocated  and  reallocated  in  the  next
               Limitation Year to all of the remaining Participants in the Plan.
               If a  suspense  account  is in  existence  at any  time  during a
               particular  Limitation Year, other than the first Limitation Year
               described in the preceding sentence,  all amounts in the suspense
               account  must  be  allocated  and  reallocated  to  Participants'
               Accounts  (subject to the limitations of Code section 415) before
               any  Company  Contributions,  may be made to the  Plan  for  that
               Limitation Year. Furthermore,  the excess amounts must be used to
               reduce Company  Contributions  for the next  Limitation Year (and
               succeeding  Limitation  Years,  as  necessary)  for  all  of  the
               remaining   Participants  in  the  Plan.  For  purposes  of  this
               subdivision,  except as  provided  in (a) of this  Section  12.2,
               excess amounts may not be distributed to  Participants  or former
               Participants.

          (c)  In the event of a termination of the Plan,  the suspense  account
               described in (b) of this Section 12.2 shall revert to the Company
               to the extent it may not then be allocated  to any  Participant's
               Account.

          (d)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision in this Section  12.2,  the
               Company  shall not  contribute  any amount  that  would  cause an
               allocation   to  the   suspense   account  as  of  the  date  the
               contribution is allocated.  If the  contribution is made prior to
               the  date  as  of  which  it  is  to  be  allocated,   then  such
               contribution  shall  not  exceed an amount  that  would  cause an
               allocation  to the suspense  account if the date of  contribution
               were an allocation date.

         Section 12.3 Overall Limit. For any Participant of this Plan who at any
time participated in a defined benefit plan maintained by the Company,  the rate
of benefit accrual by such Participant in each defined benefit plan in which the
Participant  participates  during  the  Limitation  Year will be  reduced to the
extent necessary to prevent the sum of the following  fractions,  computed as of
the close of the Limitation Year, from exceeding 1.0:

          (a)  Defined  Benefit Plan Fraction.  Projected  Annual Benefit of the
               Participant  under all  defined  benefit  plans  divided  by: the
               lesser  of (1) the  product  of 1.25,  multiplied  by the  dollar
               limitation  in effect  under Code section  415(b)(1)(A)  for such
               Limitation  Year,  or (2) the  product of 1.4  multiplied  by the
               amount  which  may be  taken  into  account  under  Code  section
               415(b)(1)(B) with respect to such Participant for such Limitation
               Year.

          and

          (b)  Defined  Contribution  Plan Fraction.  Sum of Annual Additions to
               such Participant's  Account under all defined  contribution plans
               in  such  Limitation  Year  and for all  prior  Limitation  Years
               divided  by:  the  sum of the  lesser  of the  following  amounts
               determined  for such year and for each prior Year of Service with
               the Company:  (1) the product of 1.25,  multiplied  by the dollar
               limitation  in effect  under Code section  415(c)(1)(A)  for such
               Limitation Year, or (2) the product of (a) 1.4, multiplied by (b)
               25% of the Participant's Compensation for such Limitation Year.

         Section 12.4 Special Rules.

          (a)  For purposes of applying the Defined  Contribution  Plan Fraction
               in Section 12.3 for any Limitation  Year beginning after December
               31,  1975  to  Limitation  Years  before  January  1,  1976,  the
               aggregate  amount taken into account in determining the numerator
               of such  fraction  is deemed not to exceed the  aggregate  amount
               taken  into  account  in  determining   the  denominator  of  the
               fraction.

          (b)  In any case where the sum of the  fractions  in  Section  12.3 is
               greater  than  1.0,  calculated  as of  the  close  of  the  last
               Limitation   Year   beginning   before  January  1,  1983  for  a
               Participant,  in accordance  with  regulations  prescribed by the
               Commissioner pursuant to TEFRA section 235(g)(3), an amount shall
               be subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution plan
               fraction  so that the sum of such  fractions  does not exceed 1.0
               for such Limitation Year.

          (c)  If the sum of the  fractions  in Section  12.3 would  exceed 1.0,
               calculated as of the close of the last  Limitation Year beginning
               before  January 1, 1987 for a  Participant,  in  accordance  with
               regulations  prescribed by the  Commissioner  pursuant to section
               1106(i)(4)  of the Tax  Reform  Act of 1986,  an amount  shall be
               subtracted  from the numerator of the defined  contribution  plan
               fraction (not exceeding  such  numerator) so that the sum of such
               fractions  does not  exceed  1.0.  This  numerator,  as  adjusted
               herein,   will  be  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  defined
               contribution  plan fraction for Limitation Years commencing on or
               after January 1, 1987.


                                  ARTICLE XIII
                             TOP-HEAVY REQUIREMENTS

         Section  13.1  Definitions.  For  purposes of this  Article  XIII,  the
following  definitions  shall apply,  to be interpreted  in accordance  with the
provisions of Code section 416 and the regulations thereunder:

          (a)  "Aggregation  Group"  shall  mean a plan or group of plans  which
               includes  all plans  maintained  by the  Employers in which a Key
               Employee is a  Participant  or which  enables any plan in which a
               Key Employee is a Participant  to meet the  requirements  of Code
               section 401(a)(4) or Code section 410, as well as all other plans
               selected by the Company for permissive  aggregation  inclusion of
               which  would not prevent  the group of plans from  continuing  to
               meet the requirements of such Code sections.

          (b)  "Compensation" with respect to a Plan Year shall be as defined in
               Section XII without regard to Section 12.1(d)(2)(A).

          (c)  "Determination Date" shall mean, with respect to any Plan Year,

               (1)  the last day of the preceding Plan Year, or,

               (2)  in the case of the first Plan Year of any Plan, the last day
                    of such Plan Year.


          (d)  "Employee"  shall mean,  for purposes of this Article  XIII,  any
               person  employed  by an  Employer  and  shall  also  include  any
               beneficiary  of such person,  provided that the  requirements  of
               Sections  13.3,  13.4  and 13.5  shall  not  apply to any  person
               included in a unit of Employees covered by an agreement which the
               Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective  bargaining agreement
               between  Employee  representatives  and one or more  Employers if
               there is evidence  that  retirement  benefits were the subject of
               good faith bargaining between such Employee  representatives  and
               such Employer or Employers.

          (e)  "Employer"  shall mean,  any  corporation  which is a member of a
               controlled  group of  corporations  (as  defined in Code  section
               414(b))  which  includes  the  Company or any trades or  business
               (whether or not incorporated)  which are under common control (as
               defined in Code section 414(c)) with the Company,  or a member of
               an affiliated  service group (as defined in Code section  414(m))
               which includes the Company.

          (f)  "Key Employee"  shall mean,  any Employee or former  Employee who
               is, at any time during the Plan Year,  or was,  during any one of
               the four preceding Plan Years any one or more of the following:

               (1)  An  officer  of an  Employer  having an annual  Compensation
                    greater  than 50% of the amount in effect under Code section
                    415(b)(1)(A) for any Plan Year unless 50 other such officers
                    (or,  if  lesser,  a number  of such  officers  equal to the
                    greater of three or 10% of the Employees) have higher annual
                    Compensation.

               (2)  One of the 10 persons  employed by an Employer having annual
                    Compensation  greater  than the  limitation  in effect under
                    Code section  415(c)(1)(A) for any Plan Year, and owning (or
                    considered as owning within the meaning of Code section 318)
                    the largest interests in the Employers. For purposes of this
                    paragraph (2), if two Employees have the same interest,  the
                    one with the greater Compensation shall be treated as owning
                    the larger interest.

               (3)  Any  person  owning  (or  considered  as owning  within  the
                    meaning of Code section 318) more than 5% of the outstanding
                    stock of an Employer or stock possessing more than 5% of the
                    total combined voting power of such stock.

               (4)  A person who would be described  in  paragraph  (3) above if
                    "1%" were  substituted  for "5%" each  place it  appears  in
                    paragraph (3) above, and who has annual Compensation of more
                    than $150,000.  For purposes of determining  ownership under
                    this Section 13.11(f),  Code section  318(a)(2)(C)  shall be
                    applied  by  substituting  "5%" for  "50%"  and the rules of
                    subsections  (b),  (c) and (m) of Code section 414 shall not
                    apply.

          (g)  "Year of Service" shall mean, a year which constitutes a "Year of
               Service"  under the rules of paragraphs  (4), (5) and (6) of Code
               section 411(a) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions
               of this Article XIII.

         Section 13.2 General  Requirements.  For any Plan Year beginning  after
1983 in which the Plan is a Top-Heavy  Plan,  the  requirements  of this Article
XIII  must be met in  accordance  with  Code  section  416  and the  regulations
thereunder. The provisions of this Article XIII shall be inapplicable unless and
until the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.

         Section 13.3 Maximum Compensation.  Compensation for any Employee shall
not be taken into  account  under the Plan in excess of the amount  provided for
pursuant to Code section 401(a)(17) and the regulations thereunder.

         Section 13.4  Vesting.  A  Participant  who is credited with an Hour of
Service  while the Plan is  Top-Heavy,  or in any Plan Year after a Plan Year in
which the Plan is  Top-Heavy,  and who has  completed  at least  three  Years of
Service shall have a nonforfeitable  right to 100% of his or her accrued benefit
derived from Employer Contributions and no such amount may become forfeitable if
the Plan later ceases to be Top-Heavy nor may such amount be forfeited under the
provisions of Code sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411 (a)(3)(D).  Such accrued benefit
shall include  benefits  accrued  before the Plan becomes  Top-Heavy,  including
benefits accrued prior to January 1, 1984.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Plan to the contrary, once the vesting requirements of this Section 13.4
become applicable, they shall remain applicable even if the Plan later ceases to
be Top-Heavy.

         Section 13.5 Minimum Contributions.  Minimum Employer Contributions for
a Participant  (not including a beneficiary of any Participant) who is not a Key
Employee shall be required under the Plan for the Plan Year as follows:

          (a)  The amount of the minimum contribution shall be the lesser of the
               following percentages of Compensation:

               (1)  four percent, or,

               (2)  the highest  percentage at which such contributions are made
                    under  the  Plan  for  the  Plan  Year  on  behalf  of a Key
                    Employee.

                    (i)  For  purposes  of  this   paragraph  (2),  all  defined
                         contribution  plans  required  to  be  included  in  an
                         Aggregation Group shall be treated as one plan.

                    (ii) This  paragraph  (2)  shall  not  apply  if the Plan is
                         required to be included in an Aggregation Group and the
                         Plan  enables a defined  benefit  plan  required  to be
                         included   in  the   Aggregation   Group  to  meet  the
                         requirements of Code sections 401(a)(4) or 410.

                    (iii)For purposes of this paragraph (2), the  calculation of
                         the percentage at which Employer Contributions are made
                         for a Key  Employee  shall be based  only on his or her
                         Compensation   not  in   excess  of   maximum   counted
                         compensation as provided in Section 13.3.

          (b)  There shall be  disregarded  for purposes of this  Section  13.5,
               contributions  or benefits  under Code section 3111,  Title II of
               the Social  Security  Act or any other  federal or state law, and
               for Plan Years beginning  before  December 31, 1984,  there shall
               also be disregarded  any  contributions  attributable to a salary
               reduction or a similar arrangement.

          (c)  For purposes of this Section 13.5, the term  "Participant"  shall
               be deemed  to refer to all  Participants  who have not  separated
               from  service  at the end of the  Plan  Year  including,  without
               limitation, individuals who:

               (1)  failed to  complete  1000 Hours of  Service  during the Plan
                    Year, or

               (2)  declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan, or

               (3)  are excluded  from the Plan because  their  Compensation  is
                    less  than a  stated  amount  but  who  must  be  considered
                    Participants   for  the  Plan  to   satisfy   the   coverage
                    requirements  of Code section 410(b) in accordance with Code
                    section 401(a)(5).

         Section 13.6  Participants  Under Defined  Benefit  Plans.  If any Plan
Participant  other than a Key  Employee  is also a  Participant  under a defined
benefit  plan of an  Employer,  then  Section  13.5(a)  shall  not apply and the
required  minimum  annual  Employer   Contribution  for  such  Participant  (not
including a  beneficiary  of a  Participant)  under this Plan shall be 7 1/2% of
Compensation,  or  such  lesser  amount  as  may  be  required  to  satisfy  the
requirements of the Code related to Top-Heavy Plans. Such Employer  Contribution
shall be made without regard to the amount of contributions, if any, made to the
Plan on behalf of Key Employees.


         Section 13.7 Super  Top-Heavy  Plans. If for any Plan Year in which the
Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan it is also a Super Top-Heavy Plan, then for purposes of
the limitations on Employer  Contributions and benefits provided in Code section
415, and Section 5.3. and Article XII of the Plan, the dollar limitations in the
defined benefit plan fraction and the defined  contribution  plan fraction shall
be  multiplied  by 1.0 rather  than 1.25.  However,  if the  application  of the
provisions  of this  Section  13.7  would  cause any  Participant  to exceed the
combined Code section 415  limitations on Employer  Contributions  and benefits,
then the  application  of the provisions of this Section 13.7 shall be suspended
as to such  Participant  until  such  time as he or she no longer  exceeds  such
limitations  as  modified  by this  Section  13.7.  During  the  period  of such
suspension,   there  shall  be  no  Employer   Contributions,   forfeitures   or
Non-Deferred  Supplemental  Deposits allocated to such Participant under this or
any other  defined  contribution  plan of the  Employers  and there  shall be no
accruals for such Participant under any defined benefit plan of the Employers.

         Section 13.8  Determination  of  Top-Heaviness.  The  determination  of
whether this Plan is Top-Heavy shall be made as follows:

          (a)  If the Plan is not  required  to be  included  in an  Aggregation
               Group with other plans,  then it shall be Top-Heavy  only if when
               considered  by  itself  it is a  Top-Heavy  Plan  and  it is  not
               included  in  a  permissive  Aggregation  Group  that  is  not  a
               Top-Heavy Group.

          (b)  If the Plan is required to be  included in an  Aggregation  Group
               with other plans,  it shall be Top-Heavy only if the  Aggregation
               Group, including any permissively aggregated plans is Top-Heavy.

          (c)  If a plan  is not a  Top-Heavy  Plan  and is not  required  to be
               included in an Aggregation  Group, then it shall not be Top-Heavy
               even if it is  permissively  aggregated in an  Aggregation  Group
               which is a Top-Heavy Group.

         Section 13.9 Determination of Super Top-Heaviness. This Plan shall be a
Super  Top-Heavy  Plan if it would be a Top-Heavy  Plan under the  provisions of
Section  13.8,  but  substituting  "90%" for "60%" in the ratio  test of Section
13.10.

         Section  13.10  Calculation  of  Top-Heavy  Ratios.  A  Plan  shall  be
Top-Heavy and an  Aggregation  Group shall be a Top-Heavy  Group with respect to
any Plan Year as of the  Determination  Date if the sum as of the  Determination
Date of the Cumulative Accrued Benefits and the Cumulative Accounts of Employees
who are Key Employees for the Plan Year exceeds 60% of a similar sum  determined
for all Employees, excluding former Key Employees.

         Section 13.11 Cumulative Accounts and Cumulative Accrued Benefits.  The
Cumulative  Accounts and Cumulative  Accrued  Benefits for any Employee shall be
determined as follows:

          (a)  "Cumulative  Account"  shall  mean  the sum of the  amount  of an
               Employee's  Account  under a  defined  contribution  plan (for an
               unaggregated  Plan)  or  under  all  defined  contribution  plans
               included  in  an  Aggregation   Group  (for   aggregated   plans)
               determined  as of the most  recent plan  valuation  date within a
               12-month period ending on the  Determination  Date,  increased by
               any  contributions  due  after  such  valuation  date and  before
               Determination Date.

          (b)  "Cumulative  Accrued  Benefit"  shall mean the sum of the present
               value of an Employee's  accrued  benefits under a defined benefit
               plan  (for an  unaggregated  plan) or under all  defined  benefit
               plans included in an Aggregation  Group (for  aggregated  plans),
               determined under the actuarial assumptions set forth in such Plan
               or Plans,  as of the most recent plan  valuation date used by the
               Plan   actuary   within  the  12-month   period   ending  on  the
               Determination  Date  as if the  Employee  voluntarily  terminated
               service as of such  valuation  date.  The accrued  benefit of any
               Employee who is not a Key Employee shall be determined  under the
               method used for accrual purposes for all plans in the Aggregation
               Group or, if there is no such method,  as if such benefit accrued
               not more rapidly than the slowest  accrual rate  permitted  under
               Code section 411(b)(1)(c).

          (c)  Accounts and benefits  shall be calculated to include all amounts
               attributable  to both  Employer  and Employee  contributions  but
               excluding amounts  attributable to voluntary  deductible Employee
               contributions.

          (d)  Accounts  and  benefits  shall  be  increased  by  the  aggregate
               distributions   during  the   five-year   period  ending  on  the
               Determination  Date made with  respect to an  Employee  under the
               Plan or  Plans as the  case  may be or  under a  terminated  plan
               which, if it had not been terminated, would have been required to
               be included in the Aggregation Group.

          (e)  Rollover Contributions and direct plan to plan transfers shall be
               handled as follows:

               (1)  If the transfer is initiated by the Employee and made from a
                    plan  maintained  by one  employer to a plan  maintained  by
                    another  employer,  the transferring plan continues to count
                    the  amount   transferred   under  the  rules  for  counting
                    distributions.  The receiving plan does not count the amount
                    if accepted  after  December 31, 1983,  but does count it if
                    accepted prior to December 31, 1983.

               (2)  If the transfer is not  initiated by the Employee or is made
                    between plans maintained by the Employers,  the transferring
                    plan shall no longer  count the amount  transferred  and the
                    receiving plan shall count the amount transferred.

               (3)  For  purposes  of  this   subsection   (e),  all   Employers
                    aggregated under the rules of Code sections 414(b),  (c) and
                    (m) shall be considered a single employer.

          (f)  For plan years  beginning  after  December 31, 1984,  the accrued
               benefits  and  Accounts  of any  Employee  who has not  performed
               services for any Employer at any time during the five-year period
               ending on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.


                                   ARTICLE XIV
                          BENEFICIARY IN EVENT OF DEATH

         Section 14.1 Designation and Change of Beneficiary. Upon the death of a
married  Participant,  the  spouse  of  the  Participant  shall  be  deemed  the
designated beneficiary of the Participant,  unless such spouse has consented, in
writing, to the designation of another  beneficiary or beneficiaries  (which may
include  the estate of the  Participant)  or any change  thereof.  If such other
designated beneficiary or beneficiaries  predecease a married Participant,  such
Participant's  spouse  shall  be  deemed  the  designated   beneficiary  of  the
Participant. If, in such case, the Participant's spouse has also predeceased the
Participant,  the value of the Participant's Account shall be paid to his or her
estate.

         Each  unmarried  Participant  shall  have  the  right  to  designate  a
beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  to receive  any  distributions  to be made under
Article XI upon the death of such Participant. An unmarried Participant may from
time to time, without the consent of any beneficiary,  change or cancel any such
designation.   If  no  beneficiary  has  been  named  by  a  deceased  unmarried
Participant, or the designated beneficiary has predeceased such Participant, the
value  of the  Participant's  Account  shall  be  paid to his or her  estate  as
beneficiary.

         Any spousal  consent,  beneficiary  designation  and any change therein
shall be made in the form and manner  prescribed  by the  Committee and shall be
filed with the General  Manager.  Any  distribution  made to a beneficiary  of a
deceased  Participant under the Plan shall be made to the beneficiary as soon as
practicable  after such  Participant's  death and shall be in the form of a lump
sum  payment,  regardless  of the  form  of  benefit  selected  by the  deceased
Participant.  The  beneficiary  may elect to have such  payment made in money by
check, or may elect to have any whole shares of Enterprise Common Stock held for
the deceased  Participant's  Enterprise  Common Stock Fund  subaccount  and ESOP
Account  distributed in shares of Enterprise Common Stock and the balance of the
deceased  Participant's Account (including the value of any fractional shares of
Enterprise  Common  Stock) paid in money by check.  If no election is made,  the
entire distribution to the beneficiary shall be made in money by check.

                                 ADMINISTRATION

         Section 15.1 Named  Fiduciary.  The  Committee  (and each member of the
Committee  acting  as  such)  shall be the  named  fiduciary  of the  Plan  with
authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan.

         Section 15.2  Administration.

          (a)  The  Committee  shall  have  full   discretionary   authority  to
               interpret  the Plan  and to  answer  all  questions  which  arise
               concerning the application,  administration and interpretation of
               the Plan. The Committee  shall adopt such rules and procedures as
               in its opinion are necessary and advisable to administer the Plan
               and to transact its business.  Subject to the other  requirements
               of this Article XV, the Committee may --

               (1)  Employ agents to carry out non-fiduciary responsibilities;

               (2)  Employ agents to carry out fiduciary responsibilities (other
                    than trustee  responsibilities  as defined in ERISA  Section
                    405(c)(3));

               (3)  Consult with  counsel,  who may be of counsel to an Employer
                    or an Affiliate; and

               (4)  Provide for the  allocation  of  fiduciary  responsibilities
                    (other  than  trustee  responsibilities  as defined in ERISA
                    Section  405(c)(3)) among its members.  However,  any action
                    described in subparagraphs  (2) or (4) of this  subparagraph
                    (a) and any  modification  or rescission of any such action,
                    may  be  effected  by the  Committee  only  by a  resolution
                    approved by a majority of the Committee.

          (b)  The Committee shall keep written minutes of all its  proceedings,
               which shall be open to inspection  by the Board of Directors.  In
               the case of any decision by the Committee with respect to a claim
               for benefits under the Plan,  the Committee  shall include in its
               minutes  a brief  explanation  of the  grounds  upon  which  such
               decision was based.

          (c)  In performing  their duties,  the members of the Committee  shall
               act solely in the  interest of the  Participants  in the Plan and
               their beneficiaries and:

               (1)  for the  exclusive  purpose  of  providing  benefits  to the
                    Participants and their beneficiaries;

               (2)  with the  care,  skill,  prudence  and  diligence  under the
                    circumstances  then  prevailing  that a prudent man or woman
                    acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would
                    use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like  character and
                    with like aims; and

               (3)  in accordance with the documents and  instruments  governing
                    the Plan  insofar  as such  documents  and  instruments  are
                    consistent  with  the  provisions  of Title I of  ERISA.  In
                    addition to any other  duties the  Committee  may have,  the
                    Committee shall  periodically  review the performance of the
                    Trustee and any Investment  Managers and the  performance of
                    all  other  persons  to  whom  fiduciary  duties  have  been
                    delegated or allocated  pursuant to the  provisions  of this
                    Article XV.

          (d)  The Company  agrees to indemnify  and  reimburse,  to the fullest
               extent permitted by law, members of the Committee,  directors and
               Employees of an Employer and all such former  members,  directors
               and  Employees,  for any and all expenses,  liabilities or losses
               arising out of any act or omission  relating to the  rendition of
               services for or the management and administration of the Plan.

          (e)  No  member of the  Committee  nor any of its  delegates  shall be
               personally  liable by virtue of any contract,  agreement or other
               instrument made or executed by him or her or on his or her behalf
               in such capacity.

         Section 15.3 Control and  Management of Assets.  The assets of the Plan
shall be held by the  Trustee,  in trust,  and shall be managed  by the  Trustee
and/or  one or  more  Investment  Managers  appointed  from  time to time by the
Committee; provided, however, that the Committee shall have investment authority
with respect to loans approved  pursuant to Section 11.13, and may, from time to
time,  determine  that the  Trustee  shall be  subject to the  direction  of the
Committee with respect to certain other  investments,  in which case the Trustee
shall be subject to proper  directions of the Committee  which are in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and which are not contrary to applicable law.

         Section 15.4  Benefits to be Paid from Trust.  Benefits  under the Plan
shall be payable only from the Trust Fund and only to the extent that such Trust
Fund shall suffice  therefore and each  Participant  assumes all risk  connected
with any decrease in market price of any  securities  in the  respective  Funds.
Neither  the  Company  nor any  Affiliate  shall have any  liability  to make or
continue from its own funds the payment of any benefits under the Plan.

         Section  15.5  Expenses.  There  shall be paid from the Trust  Fund all
expenses incurred in connection with the  administration of the Plan,  including
but not limited to the  compensation  of the Trustee,  record  keeping fees, the
reasonable  fees of counsel for the Trustee for legal  services  rendered to the
Trustee  and the fees of  Investment  Managers  appointed  with  respect  to the
investment and  reinvestment  of the Trust Fund,  except to the extent that such
expenses and fees are paid by the  Employer.  There shall be paid from the Trust
Fund all taxes of any and all kinds  whatsoever  that may be levied or  assessed
under  existing  or future  laws  upon or in  respect  of the Trust  Fund or any
property  of any  kind  forming  a part  thereof  and  all  expenses,  including
brokerage costs and transfer  taxes,  incurred in connection with the investment
and reinvestment of the Trust Fund.

         Section 15.6 Overpayments. Any overpayment made to a Participant may be
withheld from subsequent payments made to such Participant or from payments made
to  his/her  surviving  spouse or  beneficiary  until the  overpayment  has been
recouped.

                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

         Section 16.1 Filing of Claims. Claims for benefits under the Plan shall
be filed in writing on such form or forms as may be  prescribed by the Committee
with the General Manager.

         Section  16.2 Appeal of Claims.  Written  notice  shall be given to the
claiming  Participant or beneficiary of the  disposition of such claim,  setting
forth  specific  reasons for any denial of such claim in whole or in part.  If a
claim  is  denied  in whole  or in  part,  the  notice  shall  state  that  such
Participant or beneficiary may, within sixty days of the receipt of such denial,
request  in writing  that the  decision  denying  the claim be  reviewed  by the
Committee and provide the Committee  with  information  in support of his or her
position by  submitting  such  information  in writing to the  Secretary  of the
Committee.

         Section 16.3 Review of Appeals.  The Committee  shall review each claim
for benefits which has been denied in whole or in part and for which such review
has been  requested and shall notify,  in writing,  the affected  Participant or
beneficiary  of its decision and of the reasons  therefor.  All decisions of the
Committee shall be final and binding upon all of the parties involved.


                                  ARTICLE XVII
                             MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION

         Section  17.1  Merger or  Consolidation.  In the case of any  merger or
consolidation  of the Plan with,  or transfer of assets or  liabilities  to, any
other  plan,  each  Participant  or  beneficiary  shall be entitled to receive a
benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan had
been  terminated)  which is equal to or greater than the benefit he or she would
have been entitled to receive  immediately  before the merger,  consolidation or
transfer (if the Plan had then  terminated).  A merger or  consolidation  of the
Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities  to, any other plan shall not be
deemed to be a  termination  or  discontinuance  of deposits  and  contributions
having the effect of such termination of the Plan.


                                  ARTICLE XVIII
                           NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

         Section  18.1  Non-Alienation  of  Benefits.  Except as provided  under
Sections  11.13 and 22.1, no benefit or right under the Plan shall in any manner
or to any extent be assigned,  alienated or  transferred  by any  Participant or
beneficiary  under the Plan or be subject to  attachment,  garnishment  or other
legal process.

                                   ARTICLE XIX
                                   AMENDMENTS

         Section 19.1  Amendment  Process.  The Company  reserves the right,  by
action of the Board of Directors, but subject to applicable law, at any time and
from time to time, to modify, suspend or amend in whole or in part any or all of
the  provisions  of the  Plan,  provided  that no  modification,  suspension  or
amendment  shall make it possible to deprive any Participant or beneficiary of a
previously  acquired  right;  and provided  further  that no such  modification,
suspension or amendment shall make it possible for any part of the assets of the
Plan to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit
of Participants  and their  beneficiaries  under the Plan and for the payment of
expenses of the Plan.


                                   ARTICLE XX
                                   TERMINATION

         Section 20.1  Authority to  Terminate.  The Plan may be  terminated  in
whole or in part at any time by the Board of Directors,  but only upon condition
that such  action is taken as shall  render  it  impossible  for any part of the
corpus or income of the Trust Fund to be used for or diverted to purposes  other
than for the exclusive  benefit of the Participants or their  beneficiaries  and
for the payment of expenses of the Plan.

         Section 20.2 Distribution Upon Termination. Upon termination or partial
termination  of the Plan or upon the  complete  discontinuance  of Deposits  and
Employer  Contributions  under the Plan,  the  assets of the Trust Fund shall be
administered and distributed to the Participants or their  beneficiaries at such
time or times  and in such  nondiscriminatory  manner  as is  determined  by the
Committee.  Upon  termination  or  partial  termination  of the Plan or upon the
complete  discontinuance of Deposits and Employer  Contributions under the Plan,
the  rights of all  affected  Participants  as of the date of such  termination,
partial  termination or  discontinuance  of Deposits and Employer  Contributions
shall be nonforfeitable.


                                   ARTICLE XXI
                       PLAN CONFERS NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT

         Section  21.1 No Right to  Employment.  Nothing  contained  in the Plan
shall be  construed  as  conferring  any legal  rights upon any  Employee  for a
continuation  of employment or shall interfere with the rights of an Employer or
an Affiliate to discharge  any Employee or otherwise to treat him or her without
regard to the effect which such  treatment  might have upon such  Employee  with
respect to the Plan, except as may be limited by applicable law.

                                ALTERNATE PAYEES

         Section 22.1 Alternate Payees Under QDROs. In the event that a domestic
relations  order of any State is received by the Plan and thereafter  determined
to be a Qualified  Domestic  Relations  Order (QDRO)  within the meaning of Code
section 414p, the vested portion of the Account of the Participant to which such
QDRO is directed shall be  apportioned  as specified in such QDRO,  valued as of
the business day preceding the date  specified in such QDRO.  Upon notice to the
Committee that a QDRO is being sought with respect to a  Participant's  Account,
no  distribution  or loan shall be made to a Participant  until such time as the
status  of the QDRO is  determined.  The  alternate  payee of the  Participant's
Account shall  thereafter  participate in the Plan in accordance with its terms,
except such person shall not have the rights or benefits provided in Article IV,
Article V and in Section  11.13.  If a QDRO is issued and the amount awarded the
alternate  payee  exceeds  the  value  of the  Participant's  Account  less  the
outstanding  loan  balance,  such loan shall be deemed to be in default  and the
Participant shall immediately repay the loan.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Article, the Plan may, without the consent of any such alternate payee, pay
to  such  alternate  payee  the  value  of his or her  respective  share  of the
apportioned Account of the Participant, if the value thereof as so determined is
$5,000.00 or less.  If a QDRO so provides,  benefits may be paid to an alternate
payee before they would otherwise be  distributable  under the Plan, and no such
distribution  to an  alternate  payee  shall be treated as a  withdrawal  by the
Participant for purposes of Article XI.

                                  ARTICLE XXIII
                                  CONSTRUCTION

         Section 23.1 Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by and construed
and administered under the laws of the State of New Jersey, except to the extent
superseded by ERISA.

         Section 23.2  Headings.  The headings are for  reference  only.  In the
event of a conflict  between a heading and the content of an Article or Section,
the content shall control.

                    above,  totaling up to 18% of his or her  Compensation  each
                    pay period;

          (b)  who is  employed  by CEA Newark  Bay  Services,  Inc.  and who is
               electing the maximum permitted Basic Deposit to the Plan may also
               elect:

               (1)  to make Supplemental  Nondeferred Deposits to the Plan in an
                    amount  equal to any  integral  multiple of 1% of his or her
                    Compensation  to a total  of 17% of his or her  Compensation
                    each pay period; or

               (2)  to have  Supplemental  Deferred Deposits made by an Employer
                    on his or her  behalf  in an  amount  equal to any  integral
                    multiple of 1% of his or her  Compensation  up to a total of
                    17% of his or her  Compensation  each pay period;  or (3) to
                    make, or have made by an Employer on his or her behalf,  any
                    combination  of the amounts  specified  in (1) or (2) above,
                    totaling  up to 17% of his  or  her  Compensation  each  pay
                    period; or

               (3)  to make, or have made by an Employer on his or her behalf,
                    any combination of the amounts specified in (1) or (2)
                    above, totaling up to 18% of his or her Compensation each
                    pay period;



subject to limitations of Sections 4.5 and 5.4. Supplemental Deposits made by or
on behalf of a Participant  shall be paid over by an Employer to the Trustee and
deposited in the Trust Fund as soon as practicable  after  deduction and, in any
event, within 90 days of deduction. Such Supplemental Deposits shall be credited
as soon as practicable to such Participant's  Supplemental Deposit Subaccount in
the Plan.

         Section 4.3.  Additional Lump Sum Deposits.  Within any Plan Year, each
Participant  may make one or more  Additional Lump Sum Deposits on a Nondeferred
basis in the minimum  amount of $250.00 and in such total  amounts  which,  when
aggregated with such Participant's Basic Deposits and Supplemental  Deposits, do
not exceed 25% of his or her  Compensation for that Plan Year and subject to the
limitations of Sections 4.5, 4.12 and 5.4.  Additional Lump Sum Deposits made by
a  Participant  shall be paid  over by the  Record  Keeper  to the  Trustee  and
deposited  in the Trust Fund as soon as  practicable,  but no later than 90 days
after receipt.  Such  Additional  Lump Sum Deposits shall be credited as soon as
practicable to such Participant's Supplemental Deposit Subaccount in the Plan.

         Section  4.4.  Method of  Deposits.  Basic  Deposits  and  Supplemental
Deposits  by or on  behalf  of  Active  Participants  shall  be made by means of
payroll  deduction.  For  convenience  of  administration,  if the percentage of
Compensation  elected to be contributed to the Plan by an Active  Participant is
not equal to a whole  dollar  amount,  such amount will be increased to the next
whole dollar  amount in  establishing  the deduction to be made from such Active
Participant's  pay. In  addition,  if an Active  Participant's  Compensation  is
changed,  the resulting change in deduction shall be made as soon as practicable
after such change in Compensation.

         Additional  Lump Sum Deposits shall be paid directly by Participants to
the Record  Keeper who shall  forward them to the Trustee for  investment in the
Participant's  Savings  Account  in  accordance  with  his or her  then  current
investment direction.

         Section 4.5. Limit on Deferred  Deposits.  In no event may the sum of a
Participant's  Deferred  Deposits  (including  all other  deferrals  under other
plans,  contracts,  or arrangements maintained by the Company or an Affiliate on
such Participant's  behalf) attributable to any taxable year of such Participant
(presumably  the  calendar  year)  exceed the amount  permitted  by Code section
402(g) for the  calendar  year in which such  taxable  year  commences.  Where a
Participant  elects  under  Section  4.1 to have  Deferred  Deposits  made by an
Employer to the Plan which would otherwise exceed the limit of this Section 4.5,
such excessive  Deferred Deposits shall be deemed to be Nondeferred  Deposits to
the Plan ("Deemed  Nondeferred  Deposits")  rather than Deferred Deposits to the
Plan; provided,  however, that such Deemed Nondeferred Deposits shall be subject
to the limits and rules of Sections 4.1 and 4.2; and provided further, that such
Deemed  Nondeferred  Deposits shall be deemed to be Basic  Nondeferred  Deposits
(and, therefore, matched by Employer Contributions as set forth in Article V) to
the  extent  possible  under the limits of  Sections  2.6 and 4.1,  taking  into
account other Basic Deferred and Nondeferred Deposits of the Participant.

         Section 4.6. Distribution of Excess Deferral Amounts.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan to the contrary,
               an  Employer  shall  distribute  any Excess  Deferral  Amount (as
               defined  below),   adjusted   according  to  Section  4.6(d),  to
               Participants who claim such allocable Excess Deferral Amounts for
               a calendar year.  Such  distribution  shall be made no later than
               the April 15th next  following  the end of the calendar  year for
               which such claim is made.

          (b)  For purposes of this Section 4.6,  "Excess Deferral Amount" shall
               mean the amount of Deferred Deposits for a calendar year that the
               Participant  allocates  to this Plan and claims  pursuant  to the
               election  procedure set forth in Section 4.6(c) below;  provided,
               however,  that the "Excess Deferral Amount" to be distributed for
               a  taxable  year will be  reduced  by  excess  Deferred  Deposits
               previously  distributed to the  Participant  during the Plan Year
               beginning in such taxable year of the Participant.

          (c)  A Participant's election to claim an Excess Deferral Amount for a
               calendar  year shall be in  writing,  shall be  submitted  to the
               Committee no later than the March 1st next  following  the end of
               such calendar year,  shall specify the Excess Deferral Amount and
               shall state that if such amount is not  distributed,  such Excess
               Deferral Amount, when added to amounts deferred under other plans
               or  arrangements  described in Code  sections  401(k),  408(k) or
               403(b),  exceeds  the limit  imposed on the  Participant  by Code
               section 402(g) for the taxable year (calendar  year) in which the
               deferral occurred.

          (d)  The amount distributed to a Participant  pursuant to this Section
               4.6  with  respect  to a  calendar  year  shall be  increased  or
               decreased,   as  applicable,   by  investment  income  or  losses
               attributable  thereto.  If a loss  is  allocable  to  the  Excess
               Deferral Amount,  the amount  distributed  shall not be less than
               the lesser of (1) the Participant's  Deferred Deposit  Subaccount
               or (2) the  Participant's  Deferred  Deposits  for the Plan  Year
               during which the Excess Deferral Amount occurred.

         Section 4.7. Code Section 401(k) Limits on Deferred Deposits.

          (a)  Limitation.  Deferred  Deposits  on behalf of Highly  Compensated
               Participants  for  a  Plan  Year  shall  not  exceed  the  amount
               permissible  to meet the  nondiscrimination  test of Code section
               401(k).

          (b)  Distribution  of  Excess  Contributions.   The  Committee  shall,
               consistent   with   regulations   under   the   Code,   establish
               nondiscriminatory  rules to meet the requirements of this Section
               4.7;  provided,  however,  that the amount of  Deferred  Deposits
               which must be distributed to any  Participant  under this section
               for a Plan Year shall be reduced  by  "Excess  Deferral  Amounts"
               previously distributed to the Participant for the taxable year of
               such Participant ending during the Plan Year.

         Section 4.8. Unmatched Employer Contributions. If, as the result of the
operation of Sections  4.5, 4.6 and/or 4.7, and before the  operation of Section
4.9,  the  combined  Deposits of a  Participant  are adjusted in such a way that
Employer  Contributions  previously  made on behalf of a Participant  for a Plan
Year are no  longer  matched  by such  Participant's  Basic  Deposits,  then the
matching Employer Contributions allocated to such Participant's Account for such
Plan Year shall be reduced,  under  nondiscriminatory  rules  established by the
Committee,  to  the  extent  necessary  to  equal  the  percentage  of  Employer
Contributions  (as set forth in  Article V) with  respect  to the  Participant's
remaining  Basic Deposits for such Plan Year. The amount,  if any, of previously
allocated  Employer  Contributions  in  excess  of the  percentage  of  Employer
Contributions (as set forth in Article V) of the  Participant's  remaining Basic
Deposits shall be forfeited and applied to reduce future Employer  Contributions
to the Plan.

         Section 4.9.  Code Section  401(m) Limits on  Nondeferred  Deposits and
Employer Contributions.

          (a)  Limitation.  Nondeferred  Deposits  by,  together  with  Employer
               Contributions on behalf of, Highly Compensated Participants for a
               Plan Year shall not exceed  the  amount  permissible  to meet the
               nondiscrimination tests of Code section 401(m).

          (b)  Distribution  of  Excess  Contributions.   The  Committee  shall,
               consistent   with   regulations   under   the   Code,   establish
               nondiscriminatory  rules to meet the requirements of this Section
               4.9.

         Section  4.10.   Changing  Deposit   Percentages.   The  percentage  of
Compensation  deposited  in the Plan by or on behalf  of an  Active  Participant
shall continue in effect until such Active  Participant shall change the rate of
such Deposits. An Active Participant may change the rate of Deposits to a higher
or lower percentage of Compensation  within the limitations of Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.5 by  arranging  for such  change with the Record  Keeper or as  otherwise
prescribed by the Committee.  Any such change shall become  effective as soon as
practicable after receipt of the notice of change by the Record Keeper.

         Section 4.11. Suspension of Deposits.

          (a)  An Active Participant may suspend all of the Deposits to the Plan
               made by such  Participant  or on his or her behalf at any time by
               arranging  for such  suspension  with  the  Record  Keeper  or as
               otherwise  prescribed by the Committee.  Such suspension shall be
               effective as soon as  practicable  after receipt of the notice of
               suspension by the Record  Keeper,  and shall  continue until such
               Participant elects to have Deposits resumed by arranging therefor
               with the Record Keeper.  Payroll  deductions under the Plan shall
               begin again as soon as practicable  after such notice is received
               by the Record Keeper.

          (b)  If, after other required and authorized deductions from an Active
               Participant's pay, there is not sufficient money available in any
               pay period to make the entire  authorized  payroll  deduction for
               such  Participant's  Nondeferred  Deposits,  no payroll deduction
               shall be made therefor for that pay period.

          (c)  In case of any such total  suspension  of  Deposits,  pursuant to
               Section  4.11(a),   Employer  Contributions  on  behalf  of  such
               Participant shall be automatically suspended for a like period.


         Section  4.12.  Limit on  Additional  Lump  Sum  Deposits.  No  further
Additional  Lump Sum Deposits may be made by any Participant in any Plan Year in
which the aggregate amount of all of such Participant's  Deposits under the Plan
exceeds  25%  of  such  Participant's  Compensation  for  that  Plan  Year.  Any
Additional Lump Sum Deposits inadvertently received in excess of this limitation
shall  be  refunded  to  that  Participant  as  soon  as  practicable  following
determination of such excess.

         Section 4.13.  Elections.  All elections under this Article IV shall be
made at the time,  in the manner and subject to the  conditions as are specified
by  the  Committee.  Elections  of  Deferred  Deposits  shall  in all  cases  be
irrevocably  made prior to the  beginning  of the payroll  period for which such
elections  shall apply. In any year in which the Committee deems it necessary to
do so to meet the  requirements  of Section 4.5, 4.7, 4.9 or 5.4 or the Code and
the regulations  thereunder,  the Committee may reduce,  for that Plan Year, the
permissible   amount  of  Deposits  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  or  all  Active
Participants.

         Section 4.14. Rollover  Contributions.  Subject to such rules as may be
established by the Committee, an Employee may transfer Rollover Contributions to
the Plan,  to be  deposited  in his or her  Supplemental  Deposit  Account.  The
Employee  must  certify  that  such  amount  to  be  transferred  as a  Rollover
Contribution  qualifies  for  such  transfer  under  the  Code  and  regulations
thereunder  and must submit such  information or evidence,  satisfactory  to the
Committee,  that it may require in order to approve such transfer. The Committee
may impose  such  nondiscriminatory  requirements  on such  transfer as it deems
necessary  or  desirable.  In  addition,  Rollover  Contributions  shall then be
subject to all terms and  conditions  of this Plan and the Trust  Agreement  and
shall be treated in the same manner as Supplemental Deposits, unless the context
of the Plan or Trust requires otherwise.

         Section 4.15  Transfers  from the Thrift Plan. Any Employee who, at the
time he/she becomes employed by the Company or a Participating  Affiliate,  is a
participant in the Thrift Plan, shall  automatically be enrolled in the Plan and
all  balances  in the  Thrift  Plan  shall  be  transferred  to the Plan and all
contribution and investment elections in effect for the Thrift Plan shall remain
in effect,  subject to change  pursuant to the operation of Sections 4.10,  4.11
and 6.2 hereof.

                                    ARTICLE V

                             EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

         Section  5.1.  Amount  and  Payment  of  Employer  Contributions.  Each
Employer shall contribute to the Plan on behalf of Participants who are Eligible
Employees,  who are its Employees and who are making or having Basic Deposits to
the Plan made on their  behalf,  an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate of such
Basic  Deposits,  except to the extent that such Basic  Deposits  are reduced or
distributed  as provided in Sections  4.5 through 4.9, and except as provided in
this Article V and in Section 11.4.

         Employer  Contributions  shall be  allocated as  Nondeferred.  Employer
Contributions with respect to a Plan Year shall be paid to the Trustee not later
than  the due  date  (including  extensions  of time)  for  filing  Enterprise's
consolidated Federal income tax return for such year. All Employer Contributions
may be made without regard to current or  accumulated  earnings of the Employer.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Plan shall be designated a profit  sharing
plan for purposes of Code sections 401(a), 402, 412 and 417.

         Section  5.2.  Employer   Contributions  in  Enterprise  Common  Stock.
Employer  Contributions  with  respect  to Basic  Deposits  in  excess  of 5% of
Compensation  for  Participants  who are employed by an Employer  other than CEA
Newark Bay Services,  Inc.  shall be made in shares of Enterprise  Common Stock.
Employer  Contributions  with  respect  to Basic  Deposits  in  excess  of 6% of
Compensation for Participants who are employed by CEA Newark Bay Services,  Inc.
shall be made in shares of Enterprise  Common Stock. Any such shares credited to
a Participant's  account shall be acquired in the same manner as shares acquired
for the  Enterprise  Common Stock Fund  established  pursuant to Section 7.2, be
invested  in that Fund and not be  available  for  transfer to any other Fund or
withdrawal from the Plan prior to the Participant's termination of employment by
the Company or any Affiliate.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  any portion of a
Participant's  Account  invested  in the  Enterprise  Common  Stock Fund that is
apportioned  for an alternate payee under a QDRO in accordance with Article XXII
may be transferred out of such Fund or withdrawn from the Plan at any time.

         Section 5.3.  Reduction of Employer  Contributions by Forfeitures.  The
amount of an  Employer's  Contribution  shall be  reduced  by the  amount of the
reduction  of  an  unmatched  Employer   Contribution   allocable  to  a  Highly
Compensated  Participant as provided in Sections 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9, by the amount
of any  forfeiture  as a result of  termination  of the  employment of an Active
Participant  as  provided  in  Section  11.2 or as a  result  of the  Employer's
inability to locate a Participant or beneficiary to whom a benefit  hereunder is
due as provided in Section 11.14.

         Section 5.4. Maximum Annual Additions.  The maximum Annual Addition, as
defined in Section 12.1, for any Plan Year to any Participant's  Account may not
exceed the amount provided for by Code section  415(c).  The rules governing the
application  of this Section 5.4 and other  limitations  imposed by Code section
415 are more fully set forth in Article XII.

         Section 5.5. Return of Employer Contributions.

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any provision of the Plan to the  contrary,  any
               Employer  Contribution  made to the Plan by reason of  mistake of
               fact  may  be  returned  to the  Employer  making  such  Employer
               Contribution,  provided the return of such Employer  Contribution
               is made  within one year from the date the  mistaken  payment was
               made and any  amount  so  returned  shall be  disposed  of as the
               Committee shall direct.

          (b)  If the Internal Revenue Service  determines that any contribution
               by an Employer to the Plan is not  deductible  under Code section
               404, such Employer  shall have the option,  which it may exercise
               within  one  year  after  the  date of the  disallowance  of such
               deduction, to have such contribution returned to the Employer and
               any amount so  returned  shall be  disposed  of as the  Committee
               shall direct.

         Section 5.6.  Allocation  from Cash Balance Plan.  Pursuant to the Cash
Balance Plan and the Retirement  Choice Program,  Participants  who so elect may
have certain service and age points  otherwise  allocated to them under the Cash
Balance Plan made as an Employer  Contribution  to their Savings  Accounts under
this Plan.  All amounts so elected shall be accepted by the Trustee and invested
in   accordance   with  Section  6.1.  No  amounts   attributable   to  Employer
Contributions  resulting  from  Participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash
Balance Plan and the Retirement Choice Program shall be available for withdrawal
from the Plan until the  Participant's  termination of employment by the Company
or any Affiliate.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                           SAVINGS ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS

         Section  6.1.  Investment  of  Deposits,   Rollover  Contributions  and
Employer   Contributions.   Deposits,   Rollover   Contributions   and  Employer
Contributions  to the Plan  shall be  invested  by the  Trustee  under the Trust
Agreement in the Funds  established  pursuant to Section 7.1. Upon  enrolling in
the Plan, each Participant shall specify, in such form as shall be prescribed by
the  Committee,  the  percentage  (which  shall be an integral  multiple of 1% -
including 0% but not exceeding  100% in the aggregate) of Deposits to his or her
Savings  Account  which  shall be  invested  in each of such  Funds.  Subject to
Section 5.2 with respect to Employer  Contributions made in shares of Enterprise
Common Stock,  Employer  Contributions  with respect to Basic  Deposits shall be
invested by the Trustee  for the Account of the Active  Participant  in the same
Funds and in the same  percentages as directed by such  Participant with respect
to the Basic Deposits to his or her Savings Account.  Rollover Contributions may
be  invested  in  funds  under  the  Plan in such  dollar  amounts  as  shall be
designated by the Participant.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
a Participant  who, at the time he/she becomes an Employee,  is a participant in
the  Thrift  Plan,  shall  continue  the same  investment  elections  as  he/she
maintained in the Thrift Plan until a change in investment  direction is made in
conformity with Section 6.2 hereof.

         Section 6.2. Change in Investment  Direction.  Any investment direction
given by a Participant  under Section 6.1 shall continue in effect until changed
by the Participant. A Participant may change any such direction by giving notice
of such change in the form  prescribed by the  Committee.  Any such change shall
become effective as soon as practicable after receipt of the notice of change by
the Record Keeper. A change in investment direction under this Section 6.2 shall
not automatically cause a transfer of investments under Section 6.3.

         Section 6.3. Transfer/ Reallocation of Investments.  Subject to Section
5.2 with respect to the  limitation  on the  transfer of Employer  Contributions
made in shares of Enterprise  Common Stock and Section 6.6  regarding  transfers
into and out of the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund, a Participant may:

          (a)  direct that all or any part (in integral  multiples of 1%) of his
               or her interest in any one or more of the Funds be transferred to
               any one or more of the other  Funds,  except that no transfer may
               be made into a Participant's ESOP Account. A Participant may also
               transfer his or her ESOP Account assets (in integral multiples of
               1%,  but not  exceeding  100% in the  aggregate)  into any one or
               several of the Funds.  However, any transfer from a Fund shall be
               subject to such contractual  limitations regarding transfers from
               such Fund as may  exist  from  time to time  under the  contracts
               governing  investments held in such Fund. A direction to transfer
               all or a portion of a  Participant's  interest in a Fund shall be
               made by giving notice in the form  prescribed  by the  Committee.
               Subject to any  contractual  limitations  that may be applicable,
               any  such  transfer  shall be made as soon as  practicable  after
               receipt of the notice of such transfer by the Record Keeper; or


          (b)  reallocate  all or any part (in integral  multiples of 1%) of his
               or her  interest  among the  Funds,  except  that no funds may be
               reallocated into or out of a Participant's ESOP Account. Any such
               reallocation shall be subject to such contractual  limitations as
               may  exist  from  time  to time  under  the  contracts  governing
               investments  held in such Funds.  A  direction  to  reallocate  a
               portion of a  Participant's  interest  in a Fund shall be made by
               giving notice in the form prescribed by the Committee. Subject to
               any  contractual  limitations  that may be  applicable,  any such
               reallocation  shall be made as soon as practicable  after receipt
               of the notice of such reallocation by the Record Keeper;

         Section 6.4. Quarterly Automatic Rebalancing. Subject to the limitation
contained in Section 5.2 with respect to the transfer of Employer  Contributions
made in shares of  Enterprise  Common  Stock and  excluding  investments  in the
Participant's ESOP Account and in the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund, a
Participant may elect  automatically  rebalance his or her Account among some or
all of the Funds at the end of each calendar quarter. Any such rebalancing shall
also be  subject  to those  contractual  limitations  regarding  transfers  from
certain  Funds as may exist  from time to time  under  the  contracts  governing
investments  held in such Funds.  A direction  to elect to  quarterly  automatic
rebalancing  of a  Participant's  Account  shall be made by giving notice in the
form  prescribed  by the  Committee  and shall be in effect until an election is
made to discontinue  such  rebalancing.  Subject to any  applicable  contractual
limitations,  such rebalancing  shall commence as soon as practicable  after the
Record Keeper's receipt of the notice of such election and shall occur on, or as
soon as practicable following, the end of each subsequent calendar quarter.

         Section 6.5 Loans.  Participants  may receive  loans from their Savings
Accounts under the provisions of Section 11.13. A loan to a Participant shall be
considered an investment of such Participant's Savings Account and the principal
amount of the loan shall be treated as a separate  investment within the various
subaccounts.  Repayments of the  principal  amount of the loan shall reduce such
corresponding  investments of each such  subaccount in the inverse order of such
investment  and  repayments of such  principal  along with any accrued  interest
thereon shall be invested in the Funds in accordance with the Participant's then
current  investment  direction.  Loan amounts shall be taken from subaccounts in
the following order:

          (a)  Deferred Deposits;
          (b)  Unmatured Vested Employer Contributions;
          (c)  Matured Vested Employer Contributions;
          (d)  Rollover Contributions;
          (e)  Unmatured Post-1986 Nondeferred Deposits;
          (f)  Matured Post-1986 Nondeferred Deposits;
          (g)  Pre-1987 Nondeferred Deposits.

Loan proceeds shall not be taken from a Participant's ESOP Account,  from assets
invested in the Personal Choice Retirement  Account Fund, from that portion of a
Participant's  Savings Account  attributable to Employer  Contributions  made in
shares of  Enterprise  Common  Stock or from  that  portion  of a  Participant's
Savings Account  attributable to age and service  credits  transferred  from the
Cash Balance Plan as a result of Participant elections made pursuant to the Cash
Balance Plan and the Retirement Choice Program.

         Section  6.6  Special  Rules  for  Investment  in the  Personal  Choice
Retirement  Account  Fund.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of this Plan to the
contrary, the investment in the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund shall be

Participant  first invests in the Personal Choice  Retirement  Account Fund, and
first  business  day of  January  thereafter,  prorata  from the  portion of the
Participant's  Account which is not invested in the Personal  Choice  Retirement
Account Fund;

         (h) all fees related to specific  transactions  in the Personal  Choice
Retirement Account Fund will be deducted directly from the Participant's Account
(first,  from the Personal Choice Retirement  Account Fund Balance and then from
the balance in the Participant's other Funds;

         (i) for the period 10/1/99 through 9/30/00, investment shall be limited
to 50% of the vested balance in the Participant's Account;

         (j) for the period 10/1/00 through 9/30/01, investment shall be limited

at least  90 days  before  they may be  transferred  into  the  Personal  Choice
Retirement Account Fund.

                              SAVINGS ACCOUNT FUNDS

               principally be invested, directly or indirectly, in common stocks

               no Equities Fund shall invest in Enterprise Common Stock.

          (b)  One or more 'Fixed Income Funds' the assets of which shall be (1)

               trust  and  excluding,  in all  cases,  securities  issued by any
               Employer,   except  that  this  limitation  shall  not  apply  to

               any portion of a 'Fixed Income Fund' shall be invested. The terms
               of such agreements and the identity of such insurance  companies,
               banking  institutions,  other  corporate  entities  and/or  third
               parties shall be determined by the Committee from time to time.

          (e)  One or more "Government  Obligations  Funds", the assets of which
               shall  principally be invested,  directly or indirectly,  in debt
               obligations  issued or  guaranteed by the U. S.  Government,  its

          (f)  One or more  "Balanced  Funds",  the  assets  of  which  shall be

               the  common  stocks  and  fixed-income   securities  of  domestic
               corporations.

          (g)  One or more "Bond Funds",  the assets of which shall  principally

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any or all of the above  Funds may be
temporarily  maintained  in cash,  or may be invested  directly or indirectly in
certain short-term  obligations as permitted by the Trust Agreement.  Dividends,
interest and other income in respect of any Fund shall be reinvested in the same
Fund to the extent not used to pay  expenses  of the Plan.  Except as  otherwise
limited  by  the  provisions  of  this  Plan,  withdrawals,   distributions  and
forfeitures,  except as otherwise  specified  in the Plan,  shall be charged pro
rata  against  the  various  Funds in which  the  subaccounts  from  which  such
withdrawals, distributions or forfeitures are then invested.

         Section 7.2. Enterprise Common Stock Fund.

          (a)  Enterprise Common Stock purchased for the Enterprise Common Stock
               Fund shall be  purchased  by the  Trustee  on the open  market or
               directly from  Enterprise  should  Enterprise  elect to make such
               sales.

          (b)  If  Enterprise  shall elect to sell shares of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock  directly to the Plan,  the price to be paid by the Trustee
               for any such  purchases  shall be the average of the high and low
               sales  prices of  Enterprise  Common Stock as reported by the New
               York Stock Exchange. Inc. on the date of purchase.

          (c)  All voting  discretion,  including the power to decide whether or
               not to tender Enterprise Common Stock in connection with a tender
               offer, with respect to the shares of Enterprise Common Stock held
               under the  Enterprise  Common  Stock  Fund for the  Account  of a
               Participant (whether vested or not vested) shall be vested in the
               Trustee.  However,  the  Trustee  shall  vote all such  shares in
               accordance  with the  directions  of such  Participant.  Within a
               reasonable  time before voting  rights are to be  exercised,  the
               Employer  or  the  Trustee   shall  cause  to  be  sent  to  each
               Participant  entitled to give voting instructions all information
               that  Enterprise  has  or  will  distribute  to  shareholders  of
               Enterprise  Common  Stock  regarding  the exercise of such voting
               rights.  Shares with respect to which no voting  instructions are
               received shall not be voted by the Trustee.

          (d)  If, during the course of the Plan, Enterprise should grant to the
               holders of  Enterprise  Common  Stock  rights to  subscribe to an
               issue or issues of  securities  of  Enterprise,  any such  rights
               attaching  to the shares of  Enterprise  Common Stock held by the
               Trustee under the  Enterprise  Common Stock Fund shall be sold by
               the  Trustee and the net  proceeds  applied by the Trustee to the
               purchase of  Enterprise  Common Stock on the open market for such
               Fund.  Stock  dividends on shares held by the  Enterprise  Common
               Stock Fund, and stock issued upon any split of such shares, shall
               be credited to such Enterprise Common Stock Fund.

                                SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

         Section 8.1.  Establishment  of Savings  Accounts.  The Committee shall
maintain or cause to be maintained a Savings Account for each Participant  which
shall  consist  of  the  following   subaccounts:   Basic  Deposit   Subaccount,
Supplemental Deposit Subaccount and Employer Contribution Subaccount, the assets
of which  shall be  invested  as  provided  in Section  5.2 or  pursuant  to the
direction of the  Participant as provided in Article VI. The assets of each such
subaccount  of the Savings  Account shall be  identified  as to  Nondeferred  or
Deferred.

         Section 8.2. Measure of Savings Accounts.

          (a)  The interests of  Participants  in the Funds shall be measured by
               participating  units in the particular Fund, the number and value
               of which shall be  determined as of each business day as provided
               in the next  paragraph.  Each  participating  unit  shall have an
               equal  beneficial  interest  in the  Fund,  and none  shall  have
               priority or preference over any other.


          (b)  As soon as  practicable  at the end of  each  business  day,  the
               Trustee  shall  determine  the value of each such Fund as of such
               business day in the manner  prescribed  in Section 8.3. The value
               so   determined   shall  be  divided  by  the  total   number  of
               participating  units  allocated to the  Accounts of  Participants
               participating  in such Fund in accordance  with subsection (a) as
               of the prior  business day. The resulting  quotient  shall be the
               value  of a  participating  unit  as of  such  business  day  and
               participating  units shall be  allocated,  as such value,  to and
               from the Fund subaccounts of Participants for all transactions by
               them or on their behalf with respect to the current business day.
               The value of all  participating  units allocated to Participants'
               Fund  subaccounts  shall be redetermined in a similar manner each
               succeeding   business  day  and  participating   units  shall  be
               allocated to and from the Accounts of Participants  participating
               in such Fund at such value for all  transactions  with respect to
               such business day.  Fractional  units shall be calculated to such
               number of decimal  places as shall be determined by the Committee
               from time to time.


          (c)  If a Participant shall direct pursuant to Section 6.3 that his or
               her interest in a Fund or any part thereof  shall be  transferred
               to another Fund or Funds, or if such Participant's  interest in a
               Fund or any part thereof is distributed,  withdrawn,  borrowed or
               forfeited  under  Articles IV or XI, the number of  participating
               units  representing  such  interest or portion  thereof as of the
               applicable  business  day shall be canceled  for  purposes of any
               subsequent  determination  of  the  number  of and  value  of the
               participating units in such Fund.

         Section 8.3. Valuation of Funds. The value of a Fund as of any business
day shall be the market value of all assets (including any uninvested cash) held
by the Fund as determined  by the Trustee,  reduced by the amount of any accrued
liabilities of the Fund on such business day and increased by Deposits, Rollover
Contributions and Employer  Contributions with respect to such business day. The
Trustee's determination of market value shall be binding and conclusive upon all
parties.

         Section   8.4.   Valuation  of  Savings   Accounts.   The  value  of  a
Participant's  subaccount for any Fund as of any business day shall be the value
of the participating  units allocated to the  Participant's  subaccount for such
Fund as of such  business  day. The value of a  Participant's  Account as of any
business  day  shall  be  the  aggregate  of the  values  of  such  subaccounts,
determined as provided in the preceding Sections of this Article VIII.

         Section 8.5. Separate Accounting. The amounts of Deferred Deposits in a
Participant's  Savings  Account shall at all times be  separately  accounted for
from other amounts in such Savings Account,  by allocating  investment gains and
losses  on  Deferred  Deposit  amounts  on a  reasonable  pro rata  basis and by
adjusting the Deferred and other portions of the  subaccounts of a Participant's
Savings Account for withdrawals,  distributions,  borrowings and  contributions.
Gains, losses,  withdrawals,  distributions,  borrowings,  forfeitures and other
credits or charges shall be separately  allocated  between such Deferred Deposit
amounts and other  portions of the  subaccounts  on a reasonable  and consistent
basis.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  ESOP ACCOUNTS

         Section 9.1. Maintenance of Separate Accounts.  Each ESOP Account shall
be  maintained on the basis of shares of  Enterprise  Common Stock  allocated to
such ESOP Account, with each ESOP Account being credited with the number of full
and fractional shares of Enterprise Common Stock so allocated.

         Section 9.2. Allocation of Distributions. Any distributions received by
the Plan with respect to Enterprise  Common Stock  allocated to a  Participant's
ESOP Account shall be allocated to such ESOP Account.


         Section 9.3. Withdrawals or Transfers

          (a)  Notwithstanding  any  provision  in the Plan to the  contrary,  a
               Participant  may withdraw in accordance with Section 11.3 or 11.4
               or  transfer  in  accordance  with  Section  6.3,  the  shares of
               Enterprise  Common Stock allocated to Participant's  ESOP Account
               or the cash value thereof.

          (b)  With  respect  to  an  election  of  a  Participant  to  withdraw
               Enterprise  Common Stock from  Participant's  ESOP  Account,  the
               shares  of  Enterprise  Common  Stock,  or the cash  value at the
               election of the  Participant,  shall be distributed in accordance
               with  Article  XI,  provided  that  such  Participant  elects  to
               withdraw  all full and  fractional  shares of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock  allocated to such ESOP Account or the cash value  thereof.
               Such  distribution  shall  be made as soon as  practicable  after
               receipt by the Record  Keeper of the  Participant's  election  to
               withdraw.

          (c)  With respect to an election of a Participant to transfer the cash
               value of all full and  fractional  shares  of  Enterprise  Common
               Stock from the  Participant's  ESOP Account to the  Participant's
               Savings  Account,   such  transfer  shall  be  made  as  soon  as
               practicable   after   receipt  by  the   Record   Keeper  of  the
               Participant's  election to  transfer,  shall be  deposited in the
               Participant's  Savings Account,  shall be invested in one or more
               (in  multiples  of 1% up to an  aggregate of 100%) of the Savings
               Account Funds as such Participant  shall designate and thereafter
               shall be deemed a Rollover  Contribution and treated accordingly.
               The  cash  value  of each  share of  Enterprise  Common  Stock so
               transferred  shall be equal to the price of a share of Enterprise
               Common Stock actually received by the Trustee.

          (d)  A Participant may not borrow from his or her ESOP Account.

         Section 9.4.  Dividends and Other Income.  Unless otherwise directed as
hereinafter  provided,  dividends paid in cash with respect to Enterprise Common
Stock  allocated to a  Participant's  ESOP Account shall be  distributed  to the
Participant as soon thereafter as practicable  and, in any event, not later than
90 days after the close of the Plan Year in which paid.  Enterprise Common Stock
delivered  to  the  Trustee  pursuant  to  a  stock  dividend,  stock  split  or
reorganization,  shall be allocated to the ESOP Account of  Participants in that
proportion  which the shares of each  Participant's  ESOP  Account  bears to the
total shares of all Participants' ESOP Accounts.

         Section  9.5.  Voting of ESOP  Account  Common  Stock.  As  provided in
Section  7.2 with  respect  to the  Enterprise  Common  Stock  Fund,  all voting
discretion with respect to stock held in a Participant's ESOP Account, including
the  power  to  decide  whether  or not to  tender  Enterprise  Common  Stock in
connection with a tender offer, shall be vested in the Trustee. Each Participant
shall be entitled to direct the Trustee as to the manner in which voting  rights
attributable  to  Enterprise  Common  Stock  (including   fractional  shares  or
fractional rights to shares) allocated to such Participant's ESOP Account are to
be exercised. Within a reasonable time before voting rights are to be exercised,
the Trustee or the Employer shall cause to be sent to each Participant  entitled
to  give  voting  instructions  all  information  that  Enterprise  has or  will
distribute to shareholders of Enterprise  Common Stock regarding the exercise of
such voting  rights.  Such voting  rights  shall be exercised by the Trustee but
only to the extent  directed by a  Participant.  Shares with respect to which no
voting instructions are received shall not be voted by the Trustee.

          (a)  Upon  completion of five Years of Service,  a  Participant  shall
               have a 100%  vested  interest  in  his  or  her  Savings  Account
               attributable  to  Employer  Contributions  made on behalf of such
               Participant  during any Plan Year. In addition,  if a Participant
               is eligible for Retirement,  suffers a Disability, is Laid Off or
               dies, such  Participant  shall have a 100% vested interest in his

               all Plan Years.

          (b)  For purposes of determining Years of Service, a Participant shall
               not be  considered  to  have  interrupted  his or her  continuous
               service  as a result  of a leave of  absence  or as a result of a
               termination of employment; provided, however, that the periods of
               absence from  employment  for these  reasons shall not be counted
               toward Years of Service for vesting purposes.

         Section 10.2. Vesting of Deposits,  Rollover Contributions and the ESOP
Account. A Participant's  interest in his or her Savings Account attributable to
Deposits  and Rollover  Contributions  for all Plan Years and in his or her ESOP
Account shall be 100% vested at all times.

         Section 11.1.  Distribution  Upon  Retirement,  Disability,  Lay Off or
Death.  If a  Participant  terminates  employment  on account of  Retirement  or
Disability,  is Laid Off or dies, then, in that event, the Participant's Savings
Account, determined as of the business day coinciding with or next following the
date of the last Deposit made by or which would have been made on behalf of such
Participant, together with the Participant's ESOP Account, shall:

          (a)  if the value of such Account as so  determined is $5,000 (or such
               other amount established by law) or less, be distributed, subject
               to the provisions of Section 11.10(c),  as soon as practicable to
               the Participant,  or in the case of death of the Participant,  to
               the  Participant's  beneficiary as determined in accordance  with
               Article XIV or, if none, to the Participant's estate; or

          (b)  if the value of such Account as so determined shall exceed $5,000
               (or such other amount  established by law), be  distributed  upon
               the earliest of the  Participant's  Required  Beginning Date, the
               death of such  Participant or the receipt by the Record Keeper of
               an application for  distribution  (which may be for less than all
               of the Participant's Account balance provided,  however, that the
               amount  of  distribution  shall be at  least  $200,  unless  such
               distribution   is  of  100%  of  the  remaining   value  of  such
               Participant's Account) in a form prescribed by the Committee.

         Section 11.2.  Distribution Upon Other Termination of Employment.  Upon
termination of a Participant's  employment with an Employer or for reasons other
than  Retirement,  Disability,  Lay Off or  death,  the  vested  portion  of the
Participant's Account, determined as of the business day coinciding with or next
following  the date of the last Deposit made by or which would have been made on
behalf  of such  Participant,  or,  if none,  the date  coinciding  with or next
following the date of termination, shall:

          (a)  if the value of such Account as so  determined is $5,000 (or such
               other amount established by law) or less, be distributed, subject
               to the provisions of Section  11.9(c),  as soon as practicable to
               the  Participant,  or,  in the case of  death of the  Participant
               after  termination of employment but prior to such  distribution,
               to  the   Participant's   beneficiary,   or,  if  none,   to  the
               Participant's estate; or

          (b)  if the value of such Account as so determined shall exceed $5,000
               (or such other amount established by law) be distributed upon the
               earliest of the Participant's  Required Beginning Date, the death
               of the  Participant  or the  receipt by the  Record  Keeper of an
               application for  distribution  (which may be for less than all of
               the  Participant's  Account balance provided,  however,  that the
               amount  of  distribution  shall be at  least  $200,  unless  such
               distribution   is  of  100%  of  the  remaining   value  of  such
               Participant's Account) in a form prescribed by the Committee.

         Any nonvested  portion of the Participant's  Account,  determined as of
the date of termination,  shall be forfeited and shall be applied  thereafter to
reduce a subsequent contribution or contributions of the Employer as provided in
Section 5.2. If such former  Participant  is rehired by an Employer on or before
the end of and is  employed  by an  Employer  at the end of the fifth  Plan Year
after the Plan Year in which  such  termination  occurred,  then such  nonvested
portion of the Participant's Account shall be reinstated by the Employer and the
Participant's  right thereto shall be determined as if the  Participant  had not
terminated  employment,  provided  that the  Participant  repays to the Plan the
amount of any  distribution  paid to him or her on account of the termination of
employment.

         The nonvested  portion of the Participant's  Account,  determined as of
the date of  termination,  shall be  forfeited as of the earlier of (i) the date
the  Participant  receives a cash-out  distribution  as  described  in  Treasury
Regulation  section  1.411(a)-7(d)  or (ii)  the time at  which  the  terminated
Participant  experiences five consecutive  one-year breaks in service, and shall
be applied  thereafter to reduce a subsequent  contribution or  contributions of
the Employer as provided in Section 5.2.

         Any  Participant  who receives a  distribution  under this Section 11.2
shall be  prohibited  from  participating  in the Plan for the  period  of three
months following such distribution.

         Section 11.3 Partial Distributions Following Termination of Employment.
A  Participant  who elects  pursuant  to Section  11.1(b) or 11.2(b) to continue
participation in the Plan following termination of employment may, subsequent to
such  Participant's  termination  of employment but prior to his or her Required
Beginning  Date,  upon  application  to the  Committee  in such format as it may
determine, withdraw all or part of such Participant's Account in minimum amounts

               Plan any or all of his or her  Nondeferred  Deposits and earnings
               thereon,  Rollover  Contributions and earnings thereon and Vested
               Employer   Contributions   (except  for  Employer   Contributions
               resulting  from  Participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash
               Balance  Plan  and  the  Retirement  Choice  Program)  as well as
               earnings thereon;  provided,  however,  that the amount withdrawn
               shall be at least $200,  unless such withdrawal is of 100% of the
               value of such Participant's Savings Account.

          (b)  If a withdrawal includes Deposits that are not Matured,  Employer
               Contributions with respect to such Participant shall be suspended
               for a period of three months.

          (c)  Withdrawals  shall be taken  from a  Participant's  Savings  Plan
               subaccounts in the following order:

          (d)  Except as provided in Section 6.6 with respect to a Participant's

               withdrawal  made by a  Participant  pursuant to this Section 11.4
               shall be made from all Funds in which the  Nondeferred  Deposits,
               Rollover Contributions and Employer Contributions by or on behalf
               of such  Participant  are  invested and shall be charged pro rata
               against such subaccounts in the Participant's Savings Account.

          (e)  The amount of any  withdrawal  made by a Participant  pursuant to
               this  Section  11.4  shall be  determined  as of the close of the
               business day on which the notice of withdrawal is received by the
               Record Keeper.

          (f)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,  no withdrawals of Employer
               Contributions  made in  shares  of  Enterprise  Common  Stock  or
               resulting  from  participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash
               Balance Plan and the Retirement Choice Program shall be permitted
               prior to the  date  that the  Participant  terminates  his or her
               employment.

         Section 11.5.  Withdrawals of Deferred Deposits During Employment After
Age 59 1/2. A  Participant  over the age 59 1/2 may withdraw all or a portion of
the value of his or her Savings Account  attributable to the Deferred  Deposits.
The value of such Deferred  Deposits for the purpose of such withdrawal shall be
determined as of the close of the business day in which the notice of withdrawal
is received by the Record  Keeper.  The minimum  withdrawal  permitted  shall be
$200,  unless  such  withdrawal  is 100% of the  current  value of the  Deferred
portion of a Participant's Savings Account.

         Section 11.6. Hardship Withdrawals.

          (a)  Upon the  application  of any  Participant,  or his or her  legal
               representative,  the  Committee,  in  accordance  with a  uniform
               nondiscriminatory   policy,  shall  permit  such  Participant  to
               withdraw  such portion of the value of his or her vested  Savings
               Account as deemed to be necessary for the purpose of:
               (1)  Expenses for medical care  described in Code section  213(d)
                    previously  incurred by the Participant,  the  Participant's
                    spouse or any dependents (as defined in Code section 152) of
                    the  Participant  or necessary  for these  persons to obtain
                    medical care described in Code section 213(d);
               (2)  Costs directly related to the purchase  (excluding  mortgage

               (3)  Payment of tuition and related educational fees for the next
                    12 months of  post-secondary  education for the Participant,
                    the  Participant's  spouse,  children or any  dependents (as
                    defined in Code section 152) of the Participant; or
               (4)  Payments   necessary   to  prevent   the   eviction  of  the
                    Participant  from his principal  residence or foreclosure on
                    the mortgage of the Participant's principal residence.
          (b)  A Participant or legal  representative  making  application under
               this  Section  11.6 shall have the  burden of  presenting  to the
               Committee  satisfactory  proof of such need. The Committee  shall
               not permit  withdrawal under this Section without first receiving
               such  proof  as it  shall  deem  necessary  to  demonstrate  such
               hardship.
          (c)  The  amount  which  may  be  withdrawn  shall  be  withdrawn,  as
               necessary,  in the  following  order:
               (1)  Nondeferred   Deposits   together   with   vested   Employer
                    Contributions,  in the order prescribed by Section 11.4, but
                    without regard to the  limitations on withdrawals of Section
                    11.4;
               (2)  Deferred  Supplemental  Deposits;  and
               (3)  Deferred  Basic Deposits.

          (d)  A  withdrawal  will be  deemed  to be  necessary  to  satisfy  an
               immediate and heavy financial need of a Participant if all of the
               following requirements are satisfied:
               (1)  The  withdrawal  is  not in  excess  of  the  amount  of the
                    immediate and heavy financial need of the Participant,
               (2)  The Participant has obtained all  distributions,  other than
                    hardship  withdrawals,  and all nontaxable  loans  currently
                    available  under all plans  maintained  by the Company or an
                    Affiliate,
               (3)  The Participant is prohibited under the terms of the Plan or
                    an  otherwise  legally  enforceable  agreement  from  making
                    elective  contributions  and employee  contributions  to the
                    Plan and all other  plans  maintained  by the  Company or an
                    Affiliate  for at  least  12  months  after  receipt  of the
                    hardship  withdrawal,  and
               (4)  The Plan and all other  plans  maintained  by the  Employer,
                    provide  that  the   Participant   may  not  make   elective
                    contributions for the Participant's taxable year immediately
                    following  the taxable  year of the hardship  withdrawal  in
                    excess of the applicable limit under Code section 402(g) for
                    such next taxable year less the amount of such Participant's
                    elective  contributions for the taxable year of the hardship
                    withdrawal. A Participant shall not fail to be treated as an
                    eligible  Participant  for purposes of paragraph (b) of this
                    Section  merely  because he is suspended in accordance  with
                    this provision.

          (e)  If a Participant shall make a withdrawal pursuant to this Section
               11.6, then

               (1)  the  Participant  shall not be  permitted  to make  Deposits
                    (including  Additional Lump Sum Deposits) to the Plan during
                    the one year period beginning on the date of receipt of such
                    withdrawal and
               (2)  a  Participant's  Deferred  Deposits  for the  Participant's
                    taxable year next following the taxable year of the hardship
                    withdrawal may not exceed the limit  established  under Code
                    section 402(g) less the amount of Deferred  Deposits made by
                    the Participant in the year of such withdrawal.

          (f)  Amounts  available  for  hardship  withdrawals  with  respect  to
               Deferred   Deposits   will  be   limited   to  the  amount  of  a
               Participant's Deferred Deposits,  plus earnings allocable thereto
               which were credited to Participant's  Accounts as of December 31,
               1988, less the amount of any previous hardship withdrawals.

          (g)  A  hardship  withdrawal  from the  Savings  Account  shall not be
               permitted unless and until a Participant has withdrawn,  pursuant
               to Section 9.3, all Enterprise  Common Stock from his or her ESOP
               Account.

          (h)  The hardship  withdrawal  shall be paid to the Participant in the
               amount  approved  as  soon  as  practicable   after  his  or  her
               application is approved by the Committee.

          (i)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,  no withdrawals of Employer
               Contributions  made in  shares  of  Enterprise  Common  Stock  or
               resulting  from  Participant  elections made pursuant to the Cash
               Balance Plan and the Retirement Choice Program shall be permitted
               prior to the  date  that the  Participant  terminates  his or her
               employment.

         Section 11.7. Suspension of Participation. If a Participant shall cease
to be an Eligible  Employee,  Deposits and Employer  Contributions to his or her
Savings  Account shall be suspended and no Additional Lump Sum Deposits shall be
permitted to be made during the period of  ineligibility.  Distribution  of such
Participant's Account shall be deferred until such Participant's  termination of
employment with an Employer,  whereupon the Participant's  Savings Account shall
be distributed in accordance with the applicable  provisions of this Article XI.
Such  Participant  shall  continue to be deemed a  Participant  for all purposes
other than for Articles IV and V during such period of ineligibility.

         Section  11.8.  Transfer  of  Employment.  If a  Participant  shall  be
transferred to the employ of an Affiliate of the Company,  distribution  of such
Participant's  Account shall be deferred  until the  Participant is no longer in
the employ of the Company or any Affiliate,  whereupon the Participant's Account
shall be  distributed  in  accordance  with the  applicable  provisions  of this
Article  XI.  Such  transferred  Participant  shall  continue  to  be  deemed  a
Participant for all purposes other than for Articles IV and V during such period
of deferral of distribution.

         Section 11.9. Form of Distributions.

          (a)  All distributions  from the Plan shall be made in money by check,
               except that in the case of a lump sum  distribution  only,  other
               than a hardship  withdrawal  in  accordance  with Section 11.6, a
               Participant  may,  by  notice  to the  Record  Keeper in the form
               prescribed  by the  Committee,  elect to have any whole shares of
               Enterprise  Common Stock held for such  Participant's  Enterprise
               Common Stock Fund subaccount  and/or ESOP Account  distributed in
               shares of Enterprise  Common Stock.  (the value of any fractional
               shares shall be paid in money by check) and/or (ii) elect to have
               particular assets held in the Personal Choice Retirement  Account
               Fund  transferred  to an individual  retirement  account with the
               vendor administering the Personal Choice Retirement Account Fund.
               Any  such  election  may  be  made  at  any  time  prior  to  the
               distribution  under  Section 11.1 and 11.2 or prior to receipt by
               the Record  Keeper of the notice of  withdrawal  in the case of a
               distribution  under Sections 11.3 or 11.4. If no such election is
               made, the entire value of the amount of the Participant's Account
               being distributed shall be distributed in money by check.

          (b)  All  distributions  from the Plan  shall be made in one lump sum,
               except that, in the case of a distribution  from a  Participant's
               Account   on  account  of  a   Participant's   Retirement,   such
               Participant  may elect to have his or her Account,  including the
               ESOP Account,  which is to be transferred into one of the Savings
               Account  Funds,  distributed  in annual or quarterly  payments in
               money by check by the  Trustee  in  amounts  as  nearly  equal as
               possible  for a specified  number of years up to ten years.  Each
               payment  shall be an amount  equal to the  Participant's  Savings
               Account  as of the  applicable  date  divided  by the  number  of
               payments remaining.  If a Participant shall die prior to complete
               distribution  of his or her  Savings  Account  pursuant  to  this
               subparagraph  (b)(1),  the  value  of the  Participant's  Savings
               Account shall be distributed as soon as practicable in a lump sum
               to  the   Participant's   beneficiary,   or,  if  none,   to  the
               Participant's   estate.   The  amount  so  distributed   after  a
               Participant's death shall be the remaining value of Participant's
               Savings Account determined as of the business day coinciding with
               or next following the date of the Participant's death.

          (c)  If no  election  is made under  subparagraph  (b) above,  and the
               value of a Participant's  Savings  Account,  when aggregated with
               the value of any ESOP Account of the  Participant,  determined in
               accordance with Article IX, exceeds $5,00, a distribution will be
               made in one lump sum at the time  provided for in Section 11.1 or
               Section 11.2, except as otherwise provided in Section 11.6.

          (d)  Anything to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  any Savings  Account
               distribution to be made to a Participant  under  subparagraph (b)
               above shall be made in such a manner  that the  present  value of
               the payments to be made to the Participant during his or her life
               expectancy  are  calculated  to be more  than 50% of the  present
               value of the total payments to be made to the Participant and any
               beneficiaries.

         Section 11.10. Time of Distributions.

          (a)  All  distributions  from  the  Plan  shall  commence  as  soon as
               practicable,  and in any  event no later  than 60 days  after the
               close  of the  Plan  Year in  which  the  Participant  terminates
               employment, reaches his or her Required Beginning Date, dies, or,
               if applicable, requests distribution under Section 11.1 and 11.2,
               or 60  days  after  the  close  of the  Plan  Year in  which  the
               Participant elects to withdraw funds from the Plan in the case of
               distributions under Sections 9.3, 9.4, 11.4, and 11.5.

          (b)  In the  case of a  distribution  over a  period  of  years  under
               subparagraph  (b) of Section 11.9,  the initial  payment shall be
               made at a time determined in accordance with  subparagraph (a) of
               this  Section  11.10.  In the case of annual  distributions,  the
               remaining  annual  payments shall be made in successive  calendar
               years  on such  date  each  year as shall  be  determined  by the
               Committee,  subject  to the  provisions  of  subparagraph  (b) of
               Section 11.9 in the case of the Participant's  death. In the case
               of quarterly distributions,  the remaining payments shall be made
               each successive  three month period on such day during the period
               as may be established by the Committee, subject to the provisions
               of  subparagraph   (b)  of  Section  11.9  in  the  case  of  the
               Participant's death.

          (c)  In the  case of a  distribution  on  account  of a  Participant's
               Retirement,  subject to the provisions of subsection  11.11,  the
               Participant may elect to have his or her Account distributed as a
               lump sum during (1) the Plan Year next following the Plan Year of
               his or her  Retirement  or (2)  the  next  succeeding  Plan  Year
               thereafter or (3) if the Account value exceeds $5,000 at any time
               up to the  Participant's  Required  Beginning  Date.  If no  such
               election is made,  distribution shall commence in accordance with
               Section 11.1 and subparagraph (a) above.

         Section   11.11.   Limitation   on  Post  Age  70  1/2   Distributions.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 11.9 and 11.10:

          (a)  the entire interest of a Participant must:

               (1)  be  distributed  not later than the  Participant's  Required
                    Beginning Date, or,

               (2)  commence no later than such Required  Beginning  Date and be
                    payable in accordance with regulations under the Code over a
                    period  not  extending  beyond the life  expectancy  of such
                    Participant.

          (b)  If a Participant  dies before his or her entire interest has been
               distributed,  then such entire interest (or the remaining part of
               such interest if  distribution  thereof has  commenced)  shall be
               distributed within five years after the Participant's death, and,
               if  distribution   has  commenced   prior  to  death,   shall  be
               distributed  at least as rapidly  as the  method of  distribution
               being used as of the date of such Participant's death.

          (c)  The amount of the distribution  required by this Section 11.11 is
               to be determined by Treasury  Regulations Section 1.72-9, Table V
               using  the  attained  age  of  the  Participant  as  provided  in
               regulations   without   recalculation  of  the  life  expectancy.
               Distribution  will be made in  accordance  with  the  regulations
               under Code section 401(a)(9),  including the minimum distribution
               incidental  death benefit  requirement of section  1.401(a)(9)-2,
               and  such  regulations   shall  override  any  inconsistent  Plan
               provisions.

         Section 11.12. Distribution in the Case of Certain Disabilities. In the
event that the Committee  shall find that any person  entitled to a distribution
under the Plan is unable to care for his or her  affairs  because  of illness or
accident or because the person is a minor or has died,  the Committee may direct
that any  distribution  due such  person,  unless  claim  shall  have  been made
therefor by a duly appointed legal representative,  be paid or applied to or for
the  benefit of such  person,  or his or her  spouse,  any child of such  person
(including an adopted child), any parent or other blood relative of such person,
or a person with whom the person  resides,  or any of them, and any such payment
or application so made shall be a complete  discharge of the  liabilities of the
Plan therefor.

         Section 11.13. Loans.

          (a)  The  Committee  shall have  complete  authority to establish  and
               administer a loan program to provide loans to  Participants.  The
               loan program shall include the following:

               (1)  A procedure for applying for loans;
               (2)  The basis on which loans will be approved or denied;
               (3)  Limitations  (if  any) on the  types  and  amounts  of loans
                    offered;
               (4)  The  procedure  under the loan  program  for  determining  a
                    reasonable rate of interest;
               (5)  The types of collateral which may secure a loan; and
               (6)  The events  constituting  default and the steps that will be
                    taken to preserve  plan assets in the event of such default.
                    The rules and applicable limitations established by the loan
                    program   shall  be  such  as  to  prevent   any  loan  from
                    constituting  a  prohibited  transaction  under Code section
                    4975 and ERISA  section  406, or a Plan  distribution  under
                    Code section 72(p).

          (b)  The  Trustee  shall,  subject  to the  approval  of  the  General
               Manager,  subject to compliance with the written loan program and
               the provisions of the Code,  lend a Participant,  who is employed
               by an Employer,  an amount up to 50% of the vested portion of his
               or her Account,  including  the ESOP  Account,  but not more than
               $50,000  in the  aggregate  as of the date on  which  the loan is
               approved  reduced by the highest  outstanding loan balance during
               the preceding  twelve  months.  However,  no amount may be loaned
               directly  from  any  ESOP  Account,   from  any  portion  of  the
               Enterprise   Common   Stock   Fund   attributable   to   Employer
               Contributions made in shares of stock, resulting from Participant
               elections  made  pursuant  to  the  Cash  Balance  Plan  and  the
               Retirement  Choice  Program  or  from  investments  held  in  the
               Personal  Choice  Retirement  Account  Fund.  The Director  shall
               review each application for a loan in a nondiscriminatory  manner
               and in  accordance  with such rules as may be  prescribed  by the
               Committee.  Loans, if approved,  shall be made as soon thereafter
               as practicable.

          (c)  In addition to such rules and  regulations  as the  Committee may
               adopt,  all  loans  shall  comply  with the  following  terms and
               conditions:

               (1)  An application for a loan by an eligible  Participant  shall
                    be made by making application  therefor to the Record Keeper
                    on a form prescribed by the Committee.

               (2)  An eligible Participant may not apply for more than one loan
                    in  any  calendar  year  nor  for a  loan  with  an  initial
                    principal  amount of less than $1,000 and, in any event, may
                    not have  more  than two (2)  loans  outstanding  at any one
                    time.

               (3)  All loans,  including  interest thereon,  shall be repaid by
                    payroll  deduction  in  equal  monthly  installments  over a
                    period of 12 to 60 months as  selected  by the  Participant.
                    Nothing herein,  however,  shall prohibit a Participant from
                    prepaying  such  loan in  whole  or in part in a lump sum in
                    accordance  with such rules as may be established  from time
                    to time by the Committee.

               (4)  Each  loan  shall  be  secured  by  an   assignment  of  the
                    Participant's entire right, title and interest in and to the
                    Trust  Fund to the extent of the loan and  accrued  interest
                    thereon  and  shall  be  evidenced   by  the   Participant's
                    promissory  note  for  the  amount  of the  loan,  including
                    interest, payable to the order of the Trustee.

               (5)  Each loan shall bear  interest at a  reasonable  rate (which
                    rate may be a variable rate) to be established  from time to
                    time by the  Committee,  not in violation of any  applicable
                    usury laws. In determining  the interest rate, the Committee
                    shall take into  consideration  interest rates being charged
                    by other lenders at the time of such determination.

          (d)  No  distribution  shall be made to any Participant or beneficiary
               thereof  unless and until all unpaid  loans,  including  interest
               thereon, have been repaid.

         Section  11.14.  Inability to Locate  Payee.  Any benefit  payable to a
Participant or beneficiary shall be forfeited if the Employer,  after reasonable
effort,  is unable to locate such  Participant or beneficiary to whom payment is
due.  The amount of any such  forfeited  benefit  shall be applied to reduce the
amount of Employer  Contributions required under the Plan as provided in Section
5.3. However,  any such forfeited benefit shall be reinstated and become payable
if a claim therefor is made by such Participant or beneficiary.

         Section 11.15.  Federal Income Tax  Withholding  on  Distributions  and
Withdrawals.  Distributions  and withdrawals under this Plan shall be subject to
Federal  income tax  withholding  as  prescribed  by Code  section  3405 and the
regulations thereunder.

         Section  11.16  Direct  Rollover  to Another  Plan or IRA.  On or after
January 1, 1993, at the election of a Participant or his spouse or former spouse
entitled to a  distribution  under Section 22.1 or the  foregoing  provisions of
this  Article  XI,  the  Committee  shall  direct  the  Trustee to make a direct
rollover to the trustee or other custodian of an "eligible  retirement  plan" by
any reasonable  means  (including  providing the Participant or spouse or former
spouse with a check made payable only to the trustee or  custodian) of all, or a
specified  portion,  of an  "eligible  rollover  distribution,"  subject  to the
following restrictions:

          (a)  An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
               any  portion  of  the  Participant's  Account,   except  that  an
               "eligible rollover distribution" does not include

               (i)  any  distribution  that is one of a series of  substantially
                    equal  periodic  payments  (made  not less  frequently  than
                    annually)  made for the life  (or  life  expectancy)  of the
                    recipient or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of
                    the recipient and the recipient's designated beneficiary, or
                    for a specified period of at least ten years; or

               (ii) any distribution required under Code section 401(a)(9).

          (b)  An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account
               described  in  Code  section  408(a),  an  individual  retirement
               annuity  described  in  Code  section  408(b),  an  annuity  plan
               described in Code section 403(a),  or a qualified trust described
               in Code section 401(a),  that accepts the  recipient's  "eligible
               rollover  distribution."  If the  recipient is the  Participant's
               surviving  spouse,   but  not  an  alternate  payee  receiving  a
               distribution pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, an
               "eligible  retirement plan" is an individual  retirement  account
               described  in Code  section  408(a) or an  individual  retirement
               annuity  described  in  Code  section  408(b)  that  accepts  the
               surviving spouse's  "eligible rollover  distribution," but not an
               annuity plan  described  in Code  section  403(a) nor a qualified
               trust described in Code section 401(a).

          (c)  The  Participant  or his or her  spouse  or  former  spouse  must
               specify,  in such  form  and at such  time as the  Committee  may
               prescribe,   the   "eligible   retirement   plan"  to  which  the
               distribution  is to  be  paid  and  may  specify  more  than  one
               "eligible retirement plan."

          (d)  The  Participant  or his or her  spouse  or  former  spouse  must
               provide to the Committee in a timely manner adequate  information
               regarding the designated "eligible retirement plan."


                                   ARTICLE XII

           LIMITS ON BENEFITS AND CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER QUALIFIED PLANS


         Section  12.1.  Definitions.  For  purposes of this  Article  XII,  the
following definitions and rules of interpretation shall apply:

          (a)  "Annual  Additions"  to a  participant's  account under a defined
               benefit plan or a defined  contribution plan is the sum, credited
               to a participant's account for any Limitation Year, of:

               (1)  Company contributions,
               (2)  Forfeitures, if any,
               (3)  Employee contributions and
               (4)  Amounts, if any,  attributable to medical benefits allocated
                    to an account established under Code section 419 A (d)(2) on
                    behalf of such Participant.

          (b)  "Annual Benefit"

               (1)  A  benefit  which  is  payable  annually  in the  form  of a
                    straight  life annuity under a defined  benefit  plan.  Such
                    benefit does not include any benefits attributable to either
                    employee  contributions  or rollover  contributions.  If the
                    defined  benefit plan  provides  for a benefit  which is not
                    payable in the form of a straight life annuity,  the benefit
                    is adjusted in accordance with Section 12.1(b)(5) below.
               (2)  Where a defined benefit plan provides for mandatory employee
                    contributions (as defined in Code section 411(c)(2)(C)), the
                    Annual Benefit  attributable  to such  contributions  is not
                    taken into  account.  The  Annual  Benefit  attributable  to
                    mandatory  contributions  is determined by using the factors
                    described in Code section  411(c)(2)(B)  and the regulations
                    thereunder.  However,  mandatory employee  contributions and
                    any voluntary  employee  contributions  are all considered a
                    separate  defined   contribution   plan  maintained  by  the
                    Company.
               (3)  If  rollover  contributions  are made to a  defined  benefit
                    plan, the Annual Benefit attributable to these contributions
                    is  determined   on  the  basis  of   reasonable   actuarial
                    assumptions.
               (4)  When there is a transfer of assets or  liabilities  from one
                    qualified  defined  benefit  plan  to  another,  the  Annual
                    Benefit  attributable to the assets transferred shall not be
                    taken into  account by the  transferee  plan in applying the
                    limitations of Code section 415. The Annual Benefit  payable
                    on  account  of the  transfer  for  any  individual  that is
                    attributable to the assets  transferred will be equal to the
                    Annual  Benefit  transferred  on behalf  of such  individual
                    multiplied  by a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the
                    total assets transferred and the denominator of which is the
                    total liabilities transferred.
               (5)  If a defined  benefit plan provides a retirement  benefit in
                    any  form  other  than a  straight  life  annuity,  the plan
                    benefit is adjusted to a straight life annuity  beginning at
                    the  same  age  which is the  actuarial  equivalent  of such
                    benefit  in  accordance  with the  rules  determined  by the
                    Commissioner.  However,  the following  values are not taken
                    into  account:
                    (i)  The value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity (as
                         defined  in  Code  section  417  and  the   regulations
                         thereunder)  provided  by the plan to the  extent  that
                         such value exceeds the sum of
                         (A)  the value of a straight life annuity beginning on
                              the same date and
                         (B)  the value of any  post-retirement  death benefits
                              which would be payable  even if the  annuity was
                              not in the form of a joint and survivor  annuity.
                    (ii) The value of benefits that are not directly  related to
                         retirement benefits (such as pre-retirement  disability

                         benefits).
                    (iii)The  value  of  benefits  provided  by the  plan  which
                         reflect post-retirement cost of living increases to the
                         extent that such increases are in accordance  with Code
                         section  415(d)  and the  regulations  thereunder.
               (6)  Where a defined  benefit plan provides a retirement  benefit
                    beginning  before a  participant  has  attained  the  Social
                    Security   Retirement   Age,  the  plan  benefit  shall,  in
                    accordance  with rules  determined by the  Commissioner,  be
                    adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of a benefit commencing
                    at the Social  Security  Retirement  Age. This adjustment is
                    only  for  purposes  of  applying   the  dollar   limitation
                    described   in  Code   section   415(b)(1)(A)   and  Section
                    12.1(f)(1)  to the Annual  Benefit of the  participant.

               (7)  Where a  participant  has less than 10 Years of Service with
                    the  Company at the time the  Participant  begins to receive
                    retirement  benefits  under the defined  benefit  plan,  the
                    benefit limitations  described in Code sections 415(b)(1)(B)
                    and  415(b)(4) and Section  12.1(f)(2)  are to be reduced by
                    multiplying  the  otherwise   applicable   limitation  by  a
                    fraction:

                    (i)  the  numerator  which  is the  Years  of  Service  (and
                         fractions   thereof)   with  the  Company  as  of,  and
                         including the current Limitation Year, and

                    (ii) the denominator of which is 10. The preceding  sentence
                         shall also apply for  purposes of reducing  the benefit
                         limitation  described in Code section  415(b)(1)(A) and
                         Section   12.1(f)(1),    by   substituting   years   of
                         participation  for Years of Service wherever it appears
                         in such sentence.

               (8)  If the  retirement  benefit  under a  defined  benefit  plan
                    begins  after  the   Participant  has  attained  the  Social
                    Security Retirement Age, the determination as to whether the
                    Maximum  Permissible  Defined Benefit Amount  limitation has
                    been satisfied shall be made in accordance with  regulations
                    prescribed by the  Commissioner by adjusting such benefit so
                    that  it  is  actuarially   equivalent  to  such  a  benefit
                    beginning  at  the  Social  Security  Retirement  Age.  This
                    adjustment  is only for purposes of applying the  limitation
                    described   in  Code   section   415(b)(1)(A)   and  Section
                    12.1(f)(1) to the Annual Benefit of the participant.

                    time  under all  defined  benefit  plans  maintained  by the

                    Maximum   Permissible   Defined  Benefit  Amount.

               (10) In  determining  the actuarial  equivalency  for purposes of
                    Sections  12.1(b)(5),  12.1(b)(6) and 12.1(b)(8)  above, the
                    interest  rate  shall be 5%.  (c)  "Company"  shall mean the

               (1)  includes  amounts  paid  to  a  Participant  (regardless  of

                              year  under  Code   section   415(d)(1)(A).   This

                              occurs,   the   adjustment  of  the   compensation
                              limitation is made as specified in regulations and

                              accrued  benefit.
                        (iv)  Anything  herein to the contrary  notwithstanding,
                              for any  individual  who was a Participant  in the
                              Plan on  January 1,  1987,  if such  Participant's
                              "current  accrued benefit" under the Plan, as that
                              term is defined in  section  1106(i)(3)(B)  of the

                              12.1(f)(1)   above,  the  dollar  limitation  with
                              respect   to  such   Participant   under   Section
                              12.1(f)(1)  shall be equal to such current accrued
                              benefit.

                    (2)  25%  of  the   Participant's   Compensation   for   the
                         Limitation  year.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  or
                         anything  herein to the  contrary,  the  percentage  of
                         compensation  limitation  of  this  Section  12.1(g)(2)
                         shall not apply to any  Annual  Additions  pursuant  to
                         Section 12.1(a)(4) above.

               (h)  "Projected  Annual  Benefit" - the Annual Benefit to which a
                    Participant   would  be  entitled  under  the  Plan  on  the
                    assumption  that he or she  continues  employment  until the
                    normal  retirement  age (or  current  age, if that is later)
                    thereunder,  that his or her  Compensation  continues at the
                    same  rate  as in  effect  for  the  Limitation  Year  under
                    consideration  until such age,  and that all other  relevant
                    factors  used to  determine  benefits  under the Plan remain
                    constant  as of the current  Limitation  Year for all future
                    Limitation Years;

               (i)  "Social  Security  Retirement  Age" - the  age  used  as the
                    retirement  age under  Social  Security  Act section  216(1)
                    except  that such  section  shall be  applied:  (1)  without
                    regard to the age increase factor,  and, (2) as if the early
                    retirement age under Social  Security Act section  216(1)(2)
                    were 62.

               (j)  For purposes of applying the  limitations  of Code  sections
                    415(b),  (c)  and  (e)  to a  Participant  for a  particular
                    Limitation   Year,  all  qualified   defined  benefit  plans
                    (without regard to whether a plan has been  terminated) ever
                    maintained  by the  Company  will be treated as one  defined
                    benefit plan and all qualified  defined  contribution  plans
                    (without regard to whether a plan has been  terminated) ever
                    maintained  by the  Company  will be treated as part of this
                    Plan.

         Section 12.2. Annual Addition Limits. The amount of the Annual Addition
which may be  credited  under this Plan to any  Participant's  Account as of any
allocation date shall not exceed the Maximum  Permissible  Defined  Contribution
Amount (based upon his or her  Compensation up to such allocation  date) reduced
by the sum of any credits of Annual Additions made to the Participant's  Account
under all defined  contribution plans as of any preceding allocation date within
the  Limitation  Year.  If an  allocation  date of this Plan  coincides  with an
allocation date of any other qualified  defined  contribution plan maintained by
the Company, the amount of the Annual Additions which may be credited under this
Plan to any  Participant's  Account as of such date shall be an amount  equal to
the product of the amount to be credited  under this Plan without regard to this
Section 12.2  multiplied  by the lesser of one or a fraction,  the  numerator of
which is the amount  described in this Section 12.2 during the  Limitation  Year
and the  denominator of which is the amount that would be otherwise  credited on
this allocation date under all defined contribution plans without regard to this
Section 12.2. However, if a security is not allocated to a Participant's Account
under any  qualified tax credit  employee  stock  ownership  plan of the Company
because  of the  operation  of the  limitations  of  Code  section  415  and the
provisions  of this  Section  12.2,  no other  amount  may be  allocated  to the
Participant's  Account  under this Plan after the  allocation  date for such tax
credit employee stock  ownership  plan's plan year,  until all such  unallocated
securities  have been  allocated in accordance  with the  provisions of such tax
credit employee stock ownership plan. If contributions to this Plan on behalf of
a Participant are to be reduced as a result of this Section 12.2, such reduction
shall be effected by reducing contributions in the following order: Supplemental
Nondeferred  Deposits,  Basic Nondeferred  Deposits and  corresponding  matching
Company Contributions, Supplemental Deferred Deposits and finally, if necessary,
Basic  Deferred   Deposits  and   corresponding   remaining   matching   Company
Contributions.   If,  as  a  result  of  a  reasonable  error  in  estimating  a
Participant's  Compensation,  or under the limited facts and circumstances which
the  Commissioner  finds  justify  the  availability  of the  rules set forth in
paragraphs  (a)-(c) of this Section 12.2,  the  allocation  of Annual  Additions
under  the  terms of the Plan  for a  particular  Participant  would  cause  the
limitations  of  Code  section  415  applicable  to  that  Participant  for  the
Limitation  Year to be exceeded,  the excess  amounts  shall not be deemed to be
Annual Additions in that Limitation Year if they are treated as follows:

          (a)  To the extent  necessary,  Deferred Deposits to the Plan shall be
               recharacterized  as  Nondeferred  Deposits and the  Participant's
               Nondeferred  Deposits to the Plan  (including  Deferred  Deposits
               recharacterized as Nondeferred  Deposits  hereunder) and earnings
               thereon shall be returned to the Participant.

          (b)  The excess  amounts in the  Participant's  Account  consisting of
               Company   Contributions   shall   be  used  to   reduce   Company
               Contributions  for  the  next  Limitation  Year  (and  succeeding
               Limitation  Years,  as necessary)  for that  Participant  if that
               Participant  is  covered  by  the  Plan  as of  the  end  of  the
               Limitation Year.  However,  if that Participant is not covered by
               the Plan as of the end of the  Limitation  Year  then the  excess
               amounts must be held  unallocated  in a suspense  account for the
               Limitation  Year  and  allocated  and  reallocated  in  the  next
               Limitation Year to all of the remaining Participants in the Plan.
               If a  suspense  account  is in  existence  at any  time  during a
               particular  Limitation Year, other than the first Limitation Year
               described in the preceding sentence,  all amounts in the suspense
               account  must  be  allocated  and  reallocated  to  Participants'
               Accounts  (subject to the limitations of Code section 415) before
               any  Company  Contributions,  may be made to the  Plan  for  that
               Limitation Year. Furthermore,  the excess amounts must be used to
               reduce Company  Contributions  for the next  Limitation Year (and
               succeeding  Limitation  Years,  as  necessary)  for  all  of  the
               remaining   Participants  in  the  Plan.  For  purposes  of  this
               subdivision,  except as  provided  in (a) of this  Section  12.2,
               excess amounts may not be distributed to  Participants  or former
               Participants.

          (c)  In the event of a termination of the Plan,  the suspense  account
               described in (b) of this Section 12.2 shall revert to the Company
               to the extent it may not then be allocated  to any  Participant's
               Account.

          (d)  Notwithstanding  any other  provision in this Section  12.2,  the
               Company  shall not  contribute  any amount  that  would  cause an
               allocation   to  the   suspense   account  as  of  the  date  the
               contribution is allocated.  If the  contribution is made prior to
               the  date  as  of  which  it  is  to  be  allocated,   then  such
               contribution  shall  not  exceed an amount  that  would  cause an
               allocation  to the suspense  account if the date of  contribution
               were an allocation date.

         Section 12.3.  Overall Limit.  For any  Participant of this Plan who at
any time  participated in a defined benefit plan maintained by the Company,  the
rate of benefit  accrual by such  Participant  in each  defined  benefit plan in
which the Participant participates during the Limitation Year will be reduced to
the extent necessary to prevent the sum of the following fractions,  computed as
of the close of the Limitation Year, from exceeding 1.0:

          (a)  Defined  Benefit Plan Fraction.  Projected  Annual Benefit of the
               Participant  under all  defined  benefit  plans  divided  by: the
               lesser  of (1) the  product  of 1.25,  multiplied  by the  dollar
               limitation  in effect  under Code section  415(b)(1)(A)  for such
               Limitation  Year,  or (2) the  product of 1.4  multiplied  by the
               amount  which  may be  taken  into  account  under  Code  section
               415(b)(1)(B) with respect to such Participant for such Limitation
               Year; and

          (b)  Defined  Contribution  Plan Fraction.  Sum of Annual Additions to
               such Participant's  Account under all defined  contribution plans
               in  such  Limitation  Year  and for all  prior  Limitation  Years
               divided  by:  the  sum of the  lesser  of the  following  amounts
               determined  for such year and for each prior Year of Service with
               the Company:  (1) the product of 1.25,  multiplied  by the dollar
               limitation  in effect  under Code section  415(c)(1)(A)  for such
               Limitation Year, or (2) the product of (a) 1.4, multiplied by (b)
               25% of the Participant's Compensation for such Limitation Year.

         Section 12.4. Special Rules.

          (a)  For purposes of applying the Defined  Contribution  Plan Fraction
               in Section 12.3 for any Limitation  Year beginning after December
               31,  1975  to  Limitation  Years  before  January  1,  1976,  the
               aggregate  amount taken into account in determining the numerator
               of such  fraction  is deemed not to exceed the  aggregate  amount
               taken  into  account  in  determining   the  denominator  of  the
               fraction.

          (b)  In any case where the sum of the  fractions  in  Section  12.3 is
               greater  than  1.0,  calculated  as of  the  close  of  the  last
               Limitation   Year   beginning   before  January  1,  1983  for  a
               Participant,  in accordance  with  regulations  prescribed by the
               Commissioner pursuant to TEFRA section 235(g)(3), an amount shall
               be subtracted from the numerator of the defined contribution plan
               fraction  so that the sum of such  fractions  does not exceed 1.0
               for such Limitation Year.

          (c)  If the sum of the  fractions  in Section  12.3 would  exceed 1.0,
               calculated as of the close of the last  Limitation Year beginning
               before  January 1, 1987 for a  Participant,  in  accordance  with
               regulations  prescribed by the  Commissioner  pursuant to section
               1106(i)(4)  of the Tax  Reform  Act of 1986,  an amount  shall be
               subtracted  from the numerator of the defined  contribution  plan
               fraction (not exceeding  such  numerator) so that the sum of such
               fractions  does not  exceed  1.0.  This  numerator,  as  adjusted
               herein,   will  be  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  defined
               contribution  plan fraction for Limitation Years commencing on or
               after January 1, 1987.


                                  ARTICLE XIII

                             TOP-HEAVY REQUIREMENTS

         Section  13.1.  Definitions.  For  purposes of this Article  XIII,  the
following  definitions  shall apply,  to be interpreted  in accordance  with the
provisions of Code section 416 and the regulations thereunder:

          (a)  "Aggregation  Group"  shall  mean a plan or group of plans  which
               includes  all plans  maintained  by the  Employers in which a Key
               Employee is a  Participant  or which  enables any plan in which a
               Key Employee is a Participant  to meet the  requirements  of Code
               section 401(a)(4) or Code section 410, as well as all other plans
               selected by the Company for permissive  aggregation  inclusion of
               which  would not prevent  the group of plans from  continuing  to
               meet the requirements of such Code sections.

          (b)  "Compensation" with respect to a Plan Year shall be as defined in
               Section XII without regard to Section 12.1(d)(2)(A).

          (c)  "Determination  Date" shall mean,  with respect to any Plan Year,

               (1)  the last day of the preceding Plan Year, or,

               (2)  in the case of the first Plan Year of any Plan, the last day
                    of such Plan Year.

          (d)  "Employee"  shall mean,  for purposes of this Article  XIII,  any
               person  employed  by an  Employer  and  shall  also  include  any
               beneficiary  of such person,  provided that the  requirements  of
               Sections  13.3,  13.4  and 13.5  shall  not  apply to any  person
               included in a unit of Employees covered by an agreement which the
               Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective  bargaining agreement
               between  Employee  representatives  and one or more  Employers if
               there is evidence  that  retirement  benefits were the subject of
               good faith bargaining between such Employee  representatives  and
               such Employer or Employers.

          (e)  "Employer"  shall mean,  any  corporation  which is a member of a
               controlled  group of  corporations  (as  defined in Code  section
               414(b))  which  includes  the  Company or any trades or  business
               (whether or not incorporated)  which are under common control (as
               defined in Code section 414(c)) with the Company,  or a member of
               an affiliated  service group (as defined in Code section  414(m))
               which includes the Company.

          (f)  "Key Employee"  shall mean,  any Employee or former  Employee who
               is, at any time during the Plan Year,  or was,  during any one of
               the four  preceding  Plan Years any one or more of the following:

               (1)  An  officer  of an  Employer  having an annual  Compensation
                    greater  than 50% of the amount in effect under Code section
                    415(b)(1)(A) for any Plan Year unless 50 other such officers
                    (or,  if  lesser,  a number  of such  officers  equal to the
                    greater of three or 10% of the Employees) have higher annual
                    Compensation.

               (2)  One of the 10 persons  employed by an Employer having annual
                    Compensation  greater  than the  limitation  in effect under
                    Code section  415(c)(1)(A) for any Plan Year, and owning (or
                    considered as owning within the meaning of Code section 318)
                    the largest interests in the Employers. For purposes of this
                    paragraph (2), if two Employees have the same interest,  the
                    one with the greater Compensation shall be treated as owning
                    the larger interest.

               (3)  Any  person  owning  (or  considered  as owning  within  the
                    meaning of Code section 318) more than 5% of the outstanding
                    stock of an Employer or stock possessing more than 5% of the
                    total combined voting power of such stock.

               (4)  A person who would be described  in  paragraph  (3) above if
                    "1%" were  substituted  for "5%" each  place it  appears  in
                    paragraph (3) above, and who has annual Compensation of more
                    than $150,000.  For purposes of determining  ownership under
                    this Section 13.11(f),  Code section  318(a)(2)(C)  shall be
                    applied  by  substituting  "5%" for  "50%"  and the rules of
                    subsections  (b),  (c) and (m) of Code section 414 shall not
                    apply.

          (g)  "Year of Service" shall mean, a year which constitutes a "Year of
               Service"  under the rules of paragraphs  (4), (5) and (6) of Code
               section 411(a) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions
               of this Article XIII.

         Section 13.2. General  Requirements.  For any Plan Year beginning after
1983 in which the Plan is a Top-Heavy  Plan,  the  requirements  of this Article
XIII  must be met in  accordance  with  Code  section  416  and the  regulations
thereunder. The provisions of this Article XIII shall be inapplicable unless and
until the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.

         Section 13.3. Maximum Compensation. Compensation for any Employee shall
not be taken into  account  under the Plan in excess of the amount  provided for
pursuant to Code section 401(a)(17) and the regulations thereunder.

         Section 13.4.  Vesting.  A Participant  who is credited with an Hour of
Service  while the Plan is  Top-Heavy,  or in any Plan Year after a Plan Year in
which the Plan is  Top-Heavy,  and who has  completed  at least  three  Years of
Service shall have a nonforfeitable  right to 100% of his or her accrued benefit
derived from Employer Contributions and no such amount may become forfeitable if
the Plan later ceases to be Top-Heavy nor may such amount be forfeited under the
provisions of Code sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411 (a)(3)(D).  Such accrued benefit
shall include  benefits  accrued  before the Plan becomes  Top-Heavy,  including
benefits accrued prior to January 1, 1984.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Plan to the contrary, once the vesting requirements of this Section 13.4
become applicable, they shall remain applicable even if the Plan later ceases to
be Top-Heavy.

         Section 13.5. Minimum Contributions. Minimum Employer Contributions for
a Participant  (not including a beneficiary of any Participant) who is not a Key
Employee shall be required under the Plan for the Plan Year as follows:

          (a)  The amount of the minimum contribution shall be the lesser of the
               following percentages of Compensation:

               (1)  four percent, or,
               (2)  the highest  percentage at which such contributions are made
                    under  the  Plan  for  the  Plan  Year  on  behalf  of a Key
                    Employee.
                    (i)  For  purposes  of  this   paragraph  (2),  all  defined
                         contribution  plans  required  to  be  included  in  an
                         Aggregation Group shall be treated as one plan.

                    (ii) This  paragraph  (2)  shall  not  apply  if the Plan is
                         required to be included in an Aggregation Group and the
                         Plan  enables a defined  benefit  plan  required  to be
                         included   in  the   Aggregation   Group  to  meet  the
                         requirements  of Code sections  401(a)(4) or 410.
                    (iii)For purposes of this paragraph (2), the  calculation of
                         the percentage at which Employer Contributions are made
                         for a Key  Employee  shall be based  only on his or her
                         Compensation   not  in   excess  of   maximum   counted
                         compensation as provided in Section 13.3.

               (b)  There shall be  disregarded  for  purposes  of this  Section
                    13.5,  contributions  or benefits  under Code section  3111,
                    Title II of the Social  Security Act or any other federal or
                    state law, and for Plan Years beginning  before December 31,
                    1984,  there  shall also be  disregarded  any  contributions
                    attributable to a salary reduction or a similar arrangement.

               (c)  For purposes of this Section  13.5,  the term  "Participant"
                    shall be  deemed to refer to all  Participants  who have not
                    separated   from  service  at  the  end  of  the  Plan  Year
                    including,  without limitation,  individuals who:

                    (1)  failed to  complete  1000 Hours of  Service  during the
                         Plan Year, or

                    (2)  declined to make mandatory  contributions  to the Plan,
                         or

                    (3)  are excluded from the Plan because  their  Compensation
                         is less than a stated amount but who must be considered
                         Participants  for the  Plan  to  satisfy  the  coverage
                         requirements  of Code section 410(b) in accordance with
                         Code section 401(a)(5).

         Section 13.6.  Participants  Under Defined  Benefit Plans.  If any Plan
Participant  other than a Key  Employee  is also a  Participant  under a defined
benefit  plan of an  Employer,  then  Section  13.5(a)  shall  not apply and the
required  minimum  annual  Employer   Contribution  for  such  Participant  (not
including a  beneficiary  of a  Participant)  under this Plan shall be 7 1/2% of
Compensation,  or  such  lesser  amount  as  may  be  required  to  satisfy  the
requirements of the Code related to Top-Heavy Plans. Such Employer  Contribution
shall be made without regard to the amount of contributions, if any, made to the
Plan on behalf of Key Employees.

         Section 13.7.  Super Top-Heavy Plans. If for any Plan Year in which the
Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan it is also a Super Top-Heavy Plan, then for purposes of
the limitations on Employer  Contributions and benefits provided in Code section
415, and Section 5.3. and Article XII of the Plan, the dollar limitations in the
defined benefit plan fraction and the defined  contribution  plan fraction shall
be  multiplied  by 1.0 rather  than 1.25.  However,  if the  application  of the
provisions  of this  Section  13.7  would  cause any  Participant  to exceed the
combined Code section 415  limitations on Employer  Contributions  and benefits,
then the  application  of the provisions of this Section 13.7 shall be suspended
as to such  Participant  until  such  time as he or she no longer  exceeds  such
limitations  as  modified  by this  Section  13.7.  During  the  period  of such
suspension,   there  shall  be  no  Employer   Contributions,   forfeitures   or
Non-Deferred  Supplemental  Deposits allocated to such Participant under this or
any other  defined  contribution  plan of the  Employers  and there  shall be no
accruals for such Participant under any defined benefit plan of the Employers.

         Section 13.8.  Determination  of  Top-Heaviness.  The  determination of
whether this Plan is Top-Heavy shall be made as follows:

          (a)  If the Plan is not  required  to be  included  in an  Aggregation
               Group with other plans,  then it shall be Top-Heavy  only if when
               considered  by  itself  it is a  Top-Heavy  Plan  and  it is  not
               included  in  a  permissive  Aggregation  Group  that  is  not  a
               Top-Heavy Group.

          (b)  If the Plan is required to be  included in an  Aggregation  Group
               with other plans,  it shall be Top-Heavy only if the  Aggregation
               Group, including any permissively aggregated plans is Top-Heavy.

          (c)  If a plan  is not a  Top-Heavy  Plan  and is not  required  to be
               included in an Aggregation  Group, then it shall not be Top-Heavy
               even if it is  permissively  aggregated in an  Aggregation  Group
               which is a Top-Heavy Group.

         Section 13.9. Determination of Super Top-Heaviness.  This Plan shall be
a Super  Top-Heavy  Plan if it would be a Top-Heavy Plan under the provisions of
Section  13.8,  but  substituting  "90%" for "60%" in the ratio  test of Section
13.10.

         Section  13.10.  Calculation  of  Top-Heavy  Ratios.  A Plan  shall  be
Top-Heavy and an  Aggregation  Group shall be a Top-Heavy  Group with respect to
any Plan Year as of the  Determination  Date if the sum as of the  Determination
Date of the Cumulative Accrued Benefits and the Cumulative Accounts of Employees
who are Key Employees for the Plan Year exceeds 60% of a similar sum  determined
for all Employees, excluding former Key Employees.

         Section 13.11. Cumulative Accounts and Cumulative Accrued Benefits. The
Cumulative  Accounts and Cumulative  Accrued  Benefits for any Employee shall be
determined as follows:

          (a)  "Cumulative  Account"  shall  mean  the sum of the  amount  of an
               Employee's  Account  under a  defined  contribution  plan (for an
               unaggregated  Plan)  or  under  all  defined  contribution  plans
               included  in  an  Aggregation   Group  (for   aggregated   plans)
               determined  as of the most  recent plan  valuation  date within a
               12-month period ending on the  Determination  Date,  increased by
               any  contributions  due  after  such  valuation  date and  before
               Determination Date.

          (b)  "Cumulative  Accrued  Benefit"  shall mean the sum of the present
               value of an Employee's  accrued  benefits under a defined benefit
               plan  (for an  unaggregated  plan) or under all  defined  benefit
               plans included in an Aggregation  Group (for  aggregated  plans),
               determined under the actuarial assumptions set forth in such Plan
               or Plans,  as of the most recent plan  valuation date used by the
               Plan   actuary   within  the  12-month   period   ending  on  the
               Determination  Date  as if the  Employee  voluntarily  terminated
               service as of such  valuation  date.  The accrued  benefit of any
               Employee who is not a Key Employee shall be determined  under the
               method used for accrual purposes for all plans in the Aggregation
               Group or, if there is no such method,  as if such benefit accrued
               not more rapidly than the slowest  accrual rate  permitted  under
               Code section 411(b)(1)(c).

          (c)  Accounts and benefits  shall be calculated to include all amounts
               attributable  to both  Employer  and Employee  contributions  but
               excluding amounts  attributable to voluntary  deductible Employee
               contributions.

          (d)  Accounts  and  benefits  shall  be  increased  by  the  aggregate
               distributions   during  the   five-year   period  ending  on  the
               Determination  Date made with  respect to an  Employee  under the
               Plan or  Plans as the  case  may be or  under a  terminated  plan
               which, if it had not been terminated, would have been required to
               be included in the Aggregation Group.

          (e)  Rollover Contributions and direct plan to plan transfers shall be
               handled as  follows:

               (1)  If the transfer is initiated by the Employee and made from a
                    plan  maintained  by one  employer to a plan  maintained  by
                    another  employer,  the transferring plan continues to count
                    the  amount   transferred   under  the  rules  for  counting
                    distributions.  The receiving plan does not count the amount
                    if accepted  after  December 31, 1983,  but does count it if
                    accepted prior to December 31, 1983.

               (2)  If the transfer is not  initiated by the Employee or is made
                    between plans maintained by the Employers,  the transferring
                    plan shall no longer  count the amount  transferred  and the
                    receiving plan shall count the amount transferred.

               (3)  For  purposes  of  this   subsection   (e),  all   Employers
                    aggregated under the rules of Code sections 414(b),  (c) and
                    (m) shall be considered a single employer.

          (f)  For plan years  beginning  after  December 31, 1984,  the accrued
               benefits  and  Accounts  of any  Employee  who has not  performed
               services for any Employer at any time during the five-year period
               ending on the Determination Date shall not be taken into account.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                          BENEFICIARY IN EVENT OF DEATH

         Section 14.1. Designation and Change of Beneficiary.  Upon the death of
a married  Participant,  the  spouse  of the  Participant  shall be  deemed  the
designated beneficiary of the Participant,  unless such spouse has consented, in
writing, to the designation of another  beneficiary or beneficiaries  (which may
include  the estate of the  Participant)  or any change  thereof.  If such other
designated beneficiary or beneficiaries  predecease a married Participant,  such
Participant's  spouse  shall  be  deemed  the  designated   beneficiary  of  the
Participant. If, in such case, the Participant's spouse has also predeceased the
Participant,  the value of the Participant's Account shall be paid to his or her
estate.

         Each  unmarried  Participant  shall  have  the  right  to  designate  a
beneficiary  or  beneficiaries  to receive  any  distributions  to be made under
Article XI upon the death of such Participant. An unmarried Participant may from
time to time, without the consent of any beneficiary,  change or cancel any such
designation.   If  no  beneficiary  has  been  named  by  a  deceased  unmarried
Participant, or the designated beneficiary has predeceased such Participant, the
value  of the  Participant's  Account  shall  be  paid to his or her  estate  as
beneficiary.

         Any spousal  consent,  beneficiary  designation  and any change therein
shall be made in the form and manner  prescribed  by the  Committee and shall be
filed with the General  Manager.  Any  distribution  made to a beneficiary  of a
deceased  Participant under the Plan shall be made to the beneficiary as soon as
practicable  after such  Participant's  death and shall be in the form of a lump
sum  payment,  regardless  of the  form  of  benefit  selected  by the  deceased
Participant.  The  beneficiary  may elect to have such  payment made in money by
check, or may elect to have any whole shares of Enterprise Common Stock held for
the deceased  Participant's  Enterprise  Common Stock Fund  subaccount  and ESOP
Account  distributed in shares of Enterprise Common Stock and the balance of the
deceased  Participant's Account (including the value of any fractional shares of
Enterprise  Common  Stock) paid in money by check.  If no election is made,  the
entire distribution to the beneficiary shall be made in money by check.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                 ADMINISTRATION

         Section 15.1.  Named  Fiduciary.  The Committee (and each member of the
Committee  acting  as  such)  shall be the  named  fiduciary  of the  Plan  with
authority to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan.

         Section 15.2. Administration.

          (a)  The  Committee  shall  have  full   discretionary   authority  to
               interpret  the Plan  and to  answer  all  questions  which  arise
               concerning the application,  administration and interpretation of
               the Plan. The Committee  shall adopt such rules and procedures as
               in its opinion are necessary and advisable to administer the Plan
               and to transact its business.  Subject to the other  requirements
               of this  Article XV, the  Committee  may --

               (1)  Employ agents to carry out non-fiduciary responsibilities;

               (2)  Employ agents to carry out fiduciary responsibilities (other
                    than trustee  responsibilities  as defined in ERISA  Section
                    405(c)(3));

               (3)  Consult with  counsel,  who may be of counsel to the Company
                    or an Affiliate; and

               (4)  Provide for the  allocation  of  fiduciary  responsibilities
                    (other  than  trustee  responsibilities  as defined in ERISA
                    Section  405(c)(3)) among its members.  However,  any action
                    described in subparagraphs  (2) or (4) of this  subparagraph
                    (a) and any  modification  or rescission of any such action,
                    may  be  effected  by the  Committee  only  by a  resolution
                    approved by a majority of the Committee.

          (b)  The Committee shall keep written minutes of all its  proceedings,
               which shall be open to inspection  by the Board of Directors.  In
               the case of any decision by the Committee with respect to a claim
               for benefits under the Plan,  the Committee  shall include in its
               minutes  a brief  explanation  of the  grounds  upon  which  such
               decision was based.

          (c)  In performing  their duties,  the members of the Committee  shall
               act solely in the  interest of the  Participants  in the Plan and
               their  beneficiaries  and:

               (1)  for the  exclusive  purpose  of  providing  benefits  to the
                    Participants and their beneficiaries;


               (2)  with the  care,  skill,  prudence  and  diligence  under the
                    circumstances  then  prevailing  that a prudent man or woman
                    acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would
                    use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like  character and
                    with like aims; and

               (3)  in accordance with the documents and  instruments  governing
                    the Plan  insofar  as such  documents  and  instruments  are
                    consistent  with  the  provisions  of Title I of  ERISA.  In
                    addition to any other  duties the  Committee  may have,  the
                    Committee shall  periodically  review the performance of the
                    Trustee and any Investment  Managers and the  performance of
                    all  other  persons  to  whom  fiduciary  duties  have  been
                    delegated or allocated  pursuant to the  provisions  of this
                    Article XV.

          (d)  The Company  agrees to indemnify  and  reimburse,  to the fullest
               extent permitted by law, members of the Committee,  directors and
               Employees of an Employer and all such former  members,  directors
               and  Employees,  for any and all expenses,  liabilities or losses
               arising out of any act or omission  relating to the  rendition of
               services for or the management and administration of the Plan.

          (e)  No  member of the  Committee  nor any of its  delegates  shall be
               personally  liable by virtue of any contract,  agreement or other
               instrument made or executed by him or her or on his or her behalf
               in such capacity.

         Section 15.3.  Control and Management of Assets. The assets of the Plan
shall be held by the  Trustee,  in trust,  and shall be managed  by the  Trustee
and/or  one or  more  Investment  Managers  appointed  from  time to time by the
Committee; provided, however, that the Committee shall have investment authority
with respect to loans approved  pursuant to Section 11.13, and may, from time to
time,  determine  that the  Trustee  shall be  subject to the  direction  of the
Committee with respect to certain other  investments,  in which case the Trustee
shall be subject to proper  directions of the Committee  which are in accordance
with the terms of the Plan and which are not contrary to applicable law.

         Section 15.4.  Benefits to be Paid from Trust.  Benefits under the Plan
shall be payable only from the Trust Fund and only to the extent that such Trust
Fund shall suffice  therefore and each  Participant  assumes all risk  connected
with any decrease in market price of any  securities  in the  respective  Funds.
Neither  the  Company  nor any  Affiliate  shall have any  liability  to make or
continue from its own funds the payment of any benefits under the Plan.

         Section  15.5.  Expenses.  There  shall be paid from the Trust Fund all
expenses incurred in connection with the  administration of the Plan,  including
but not limited to the  compensation  of the Trustee,  record  keeping fees, the
reasonable  fees of counsel for the Trustee for legal  services  rendered to the
Trustee  and the fees of  Investment  Managers  appointed  with  respect  to the
investment and  reinvestment  of the Trust Fund,  except to the extent that such
expenses and fees are paid by the  Employer.  There shall be paid from the Trust
Fund all taxes of any and all kinds  whatsoever  that may be levied or  assessed
under  existing  or future  laws  upon or in  respect  of the Trust  Fund or any
property  of any  kind  forming  a part  thereof,  and  all  expenses  including
brokerage  costs and transfer taxes  incurred in connection  with the investment
and reinvestment of the Trust Fund.

         Section 15.6.  Overpayments.  Any overpayment made to a Participant may
be withheld from subsequent  payments made to such  Participant or from payments
made to his/her  surviving spouse or beneficiary  until the overpayment has been
recouped.

                                   ARTICLE XVI

                                CLAIMS PROCEDURE

         Section  16.1.  Filing of Claims.  Claims for  benefits  under the Plan
shall be filed in  writing  on such  form or forms as may be  prescribed  by the
Committee with the General Manager.

         Section 16.2.  Appeal of Claims.  Written  notice shall be given to the
claiming  Participant or beneficiary of the  disposition of such claim,  setting
forth  specific  reasons for any denial of such claim in whole or in part.  If a
claim  is  denied  in whole  or in  part,  the  notice  shall  state  that  such
Participant or beneficiary may, within sixty days of the receipt of such denial,
request  in writing  that the  decision  denying  the claim be  reviewed  by the
Committee and provide the Committee  with  information  in support of his or her
position by  submitting  such  information  in writing to the  Secretary  of the
Committee.

         Section 16.3. Review of Appeals.  The Committee shall review each claim
for benefits which has been denied in whole or in part and for which such review
has been  requested and shall notify,  in writing,  the affected  Participant or
beneficiary  of its decision and of the reasons  therefor.  All decisions of the
Committee shall be final and binding upon all of the parties involved.

                                  ARTICLE XVII

                             MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION

         Section  17.1.  Merger or  Consolidation.  In the case of any merger or
consolidation  of the Plan with,  or transfer of assets or  liabilities  to, any
other  plan,  each  Participant  or  beneficiary  shall be entitled to receive a
benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan had
been  terminated)  which is equal to or greater than the benefit he or she would
have been entitled to receive  immediately  before the merger,  consolidation or
transfer (if the Plan had then  terminated).  A merger or  consolidation  of the
Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities  to, any other plan shall not be
deemed to be a  termination  or  discontinuance  of deposits  and  contributions
having the effect of such termination of the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE XVIII

                           NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS

         Section  18.1.  Non-Alienation  of Benefits.  Except as provided  under
Sections  11.13 and 22.1, no benefit or right under the Plan shall in any manner
or to any extent be assigned,  alienated or  transferred  by any  Participant or
beneficiary  under the Plan or be subject to  attachment,  garnishment  or other
legal process.

                                   ARTICLE XIX

                                   AMENDMENTS

         Section 19.1.  Amendment  Process.  The Company  reserves the right, by
action of the Board of Directors, but subject to applicable law, at any time and
from time to time, to modify, suspend or amend in whole or in part any or all of
the  provisions  of the  Plan,  provided  that no  modification,  suspension  or
amendment  shall make it possible to deprive any Participant or beneficiary of a
previously  acquired  right;  and provided  further  that no such  modification,
suspension or amendment shall make it possible for any part of the assets of the
Plan to be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit
of Participants  and their  beneficiaries  under the Plan and for the payment of
expenses of the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE XX

                                   TERMINATION

         Section  20.1.  Authority  to  Terminate.  The  Plan  may,  subject  to
collective  bargaining,  be  terminated  in  whole or in part at any time by the
Board of Directors,  but only upon  condition that such action is taken as shall
render it  impossible  for any part of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund to
be used for or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive  benefit of the
Participants or their beneficiaries and for the payment of expenses of the Plan.

         Section  20.2.  Distribution  Upon  Termination.  Upon  termination  or
partial termination of the Plan or upon the complete  discontinuance of Deposits
and Employer Contributions under the Plan, the assets of the Trust Fund shall be
administered and distributed to the Participants or their  beneficiaries at such
time or times  and in such  nondiscriminatory  manner  as is  determined  by the
Committee.  Upon  termination  or  partial  termination  of the Plan or upon the
complete  discontinuance of Deposits and Employer  Contributions under the Plan,
the  rights of all  affected  Participants  as of the date of such  termination,
partial  termination or  discontinuance  of Deposits and Employer  Contributions
shall be nonforfeitable.


                                   ARTICLE XXI

                       PLAN CONFERS NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT

         Section 21.1.  No Right to  Employment.  Nothing  contained in the Plan
shall be  construed  as  conferring  any legal  rights upon any  Employee  for a
continuation  of employment or shall interfere with the rights of the Company or
an Affiliate to discharge  any Employee or otherwise to treat him or her without
regard to the effect which such  treatment  might have upon such  Employee  with
respect to the Plan, except as may be limited by applicable law.

                                  ARTICLE XXII

                                ALTERNATE PAYEES

         Section  22.1.  Alternate  Payees  Under  QDROs.  In the  event  that a
domestic  relations  order of any State is received  by the Plan and  thereafter
determined to be a Qualified  Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) within the meaning
of Code section 414p,  the vested  portion of the Account of the  Participant to
which such QDRO is directed  shall be  apportioned  as  specified  in such QDRO,
valued as of the  Accounting  Period  preceding the date specified in such QDRO.
Upon  notice to the  Committee  that a QDRO is being  sought  with  respect to a
Participant's  Account,  no  distribution or loan shall be made to a Participant
until such time as the status of the QDRO is determined.  The alternate payee of
the Participant's Account shall thereafter participate in the Plan in accordance
with its  terms,  except  such  person  shall not have the  rights  or  benefits
provided in Article IV, Article V and in Section 11.13.  If a QDRO is issued and
the amount  awarded the alternate  payee exceeds the value of the  Participant's
Account less the  outstanding  loan balance,  such loan shall be deemed to be in
default and the Participant shall  immediately  repay the loan.  Notwithstanding
the  provisions of this Article,  the Plan may,  without the consent of any such
alternate  payee, pay to such alternate payee the value of his or her respective
share of the apportioned Account of the Participant,  if the value thereof as so
determined is $5,000.00 or less. If a QDRO so provides,  benefits may be paid to
an alternate payee before they would otherwise be distributable  under the Plan,
and no such  distribution to an alternate payee shall be treated as a withdrawal
by the Participant for purposes of Article XI.

                                  ARTICLE XXIII

                                  CONSTRUCTION

         Section  23.1.  Governing  Law.  The  Plan  shall  be  governed  by and
construed and administered under the laws of the State of New Jersey,  except to
the extent superseded by ERISA.

         Section 23.2.  Headings.  The headings are for  reference  only. In the
event of a conflict  between a heading and the content of an article or Section,
