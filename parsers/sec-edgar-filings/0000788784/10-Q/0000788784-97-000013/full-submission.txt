                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1.  Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These financial  statements and Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  (Notes)  thereto should be read in  conjunction  with the
respective  Registrant's Notes contained in the 1996 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Notes contained herein update and supplement  matters  discussed in the 1996
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The  unaudited  financial   information  furnished  herewith  reflects  all
adjustments  which  are,  in the  opinion  of  management,  necessary  to a fair
statement of the results for the interim periods presented.

Note 2.  Rate Matters

     Competitive Transition Charge (CTC)

     On April 24,  1997,  the Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU) issued a generic
order  regarding CTC filings by electric  utilities in New Jersey.  The BPU will
conduct a generic  review of CTC issues  since these  issues are integral to the
restructuring of the electric utility  industry.  As a result,  PSE&G's petition
and the motions concerning PSE&G's CTC filing will be placed in abeyance pending
the  conclusion of the generic  proceeding.  The BPU will hold a public  hearing
under the generic  proceeding to receive  written and oral testimony on June 19,
1997.  Written comments  regarding the generic proceeding are to be submitted to
the BPU by June 27, 1997 and the BPU expects to resolve CTC issues by the end of
July 1997. PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

     Levelized Gas Adjustment Charge (LGAC)

     On April 2, 1997, the BPU approved  PSE&G's LGAC  stipulation.  The interim
residential  LGAC charge,  approved on November 22, 1996, will continue  through
October 31, 1997.

     Demand Side Adjustment Factor (DSAF)

     On February 24, 1997,  PSE&G filed a motion with the BPU  requesting a $151
million increase for its DSAF to reflect  increases in the costs associated with
PSE&G's Demand Side  Management  (DSM)  Programs.  The increase was requested to
become effective on May 1, 1997 and continue through December 31, 1998. On March
26, 1997,  this matter was transferred to the Office of  Administrative  Law for
hearing. PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

Note 3.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

     Hazardous Waste

     Certain Federal and State laws authorize the U.S. Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP),
among other agencies,  to issue orders and bring  enforcement  actions to compel
responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is
determined  to present an imminent and  substantial  danger to the public or the
environment  because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous
substances.  Because of the nature of PSE&G's business, including the production
of electricity,  the distribution of gas and, formerly,  the manufacture of gas,
various by-products and substances are or were produced or handled which contain
constituents classified as hazardous.  PSE&G generally provides for the disposal
or processing  of such  substances  through  licensed  independent  contractors.
However,  these  statutory  provisions  impose joint and several  responsibility
without regard to fault on all responsible parties,  including the generators of
the hazardous  substances,  for certain  investigative  and remediation costs at
sites where these  substances  were  disposed  of or  processed.  PSE&G has been
notified  with  respect to a number of such sites and the  remediation  of these
potentially  hazardous sites is receiving attention from the government agencies
involved.  Generally,  actions directed at funding such site  investigations and
remediation  include  all  suspected  or known  responsible  parties.  Except as
discussed below with respect to its Manufactured Gas Plant  Remediation  Program
(Remediation Program), Enterprise and PSE&G do not expect their expenditures for
any such site to have a material effect on their financial condition, results of
operations and net cash flows.

     PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     In 1988,  NJDEP  notified  PSE&G that it had identified the need for PSE&G,
pursuant  to  a  formal  arrangement,  to  systematically  investigate  and,  if
necessary,  resolve environmental concerns extant at PSE&G's former manufactured
gas plant sites. To date,  NJDEP and PSE&G have identified 38 such sites.  PSE&G
is currently  working with NJDEP under a program to assess,  investigate and, if
necessary,  remediate  environmental  concerns at these sites.  The  Remediation
Program  is  periodically  reviewed  and  revised by PSE&G  based on  regulatory
requirements,  experience with the Remediation Program and available remediation
technologies.   The  cost  of  the  Remediation  Program  cannot  be  reasonably
estimated,  but  experience to date indicates that costs of at least $20 million
per year  could be  incurred  over a period  of more  than 30 years and that the
overall cost could be material to Enterprise  and PSE&G's  financial  condition,
results of operations and net cash flows.

     Settlement of Salem Litigation

     On May 12,  1997,  PSE&G  settled  the lawsuit  brought  against it by PECO
Energy Company (PECO) and Delmarva Power & Light Company  (DP&L),  two co-owners
of the Salem Nuclear  Generating  Station  (Salem),  relating to alleged damages
resulting  from the  current  outage  of the  facility.  Under  the terms of the
settlement,  PSE&G will pay an aggregate of $82.0 million to PECO and DP&L. This
resulted in an after-tax  charge to earnings of $53.3 million or $0.23 per share
of Enterprise Common Stock. PSE&G is also obligated to pay $1.4 million for each
reactor month that the outage continues beyond an aggregate outage of 64 reactor
months,  up to a maximum payment under this provision of $17 million.  Salem has
presently been out of service for  approximately 47 reactor months through April
30, 1997,  and PSE&G does not expect to be required to make any  payments  under
this provision.

     PECO, DP&L and PSE&G have also agreed to an operating  performance standard
through  December  31, 2011 for Salem and December 31, 2007 for the Peach Bottom
Atomic Power Station (Peach Bottom) operated by PECO.  Under this standard,  the
operator would be required to make payments to the non-operating  parties if the
three-year capacity factor,  determined annually,  of either station falls below
40 percent, subject to a maximum of $25 million per year. The initial three-year
period  begins for Peach Bottom on January 1, 1998 and for Salem on the date the
later of the two Salem units returns to service. The parties have further agreed
to forego  litigation  in the  future,  except  for  limited  cases in which the
operator would be responsible for damages of no more than $5 million per year.

     As previously  reported,  PSE&G and Atlantic  City  Electric  Company (ACE)
entered into an operating agreement which resulted in the dismissal of a similar
lawsuit by ACE. Under the agreement,  ACE pays a portion of its 1997  operation
and maintenance  (O&M)  requirements  based on the generation at Salem.  Current
expectations of the return to service of the Salem units (see Nuclear Operations
of MD&A),  is likely to result in PSE&G  absorbing  $7 to $10  million  of ACE's
share of 1997 O&M. As of April 30, 1997, PSE&G has realized $4.5 million of such
costs.

Note 4.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     Enterprise's  operations give rise to exposure to market risks from changes
in fossil fuel  prices,  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates and security
prices  of  investments.  Enterprise's  policy  is to use  derivative  financial
instruments for the purpose of managing market risk consistent with its business
plans  and  prudent  practices.  Enterprise  does  not  currently  hold or issue
financial instruments for trading purposes.

     Natural Gas Hedging

     Through March 31, 1997, Energis Resources  Incorporated (Energis Resources)
entered  into  futures  contracts  to buy  7,960,000  mmbtu of natural gas at an
average price of $2.04 per mmbtu related to fixed-price sales commitments.  Such
contracts,  together with physical purchase contracts,  hedged approximately 93%
of its fixed-price sales commitments at March 31, 1997.  Energis Resources had a
deferred unrealized hedge loss of $0.3 million at March 31, 1997.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


     The  Notes  to   Consolidated   Financial   Statements  of  Enterprise  are
incorporated  herein  by  reference  insofar  as they  relate  to PSE&G  and its
subsidiaries:

                  PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED
                 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


     Following  are the  significant  changes  in or  additions  to  information
reported in the Public Service Enterprise Group  Incorporated  (Enterprise) 1996
Annual Report on Form 10-K affecting the  consolidated  financial  condition and
the results of operations of Enterprise and its  subsidiaries.  This  discussion
refers to the Consolidated  Financial Statements  (Statements) and related Notes
of Enterprise and should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.

Results of Operations

     Earnings  per share of  Enterprise  common stock were $0.60 for the quarter
ended March 31,  1997,  a decrease  of $0.19 per share of common  stock from the
comparable 1996 period.

     The earnings per share  decrease was primarily  due to the  settlement of a
lawsuit filed by two of the co-owners of the Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station
(Salem)  (see Note 3 --  Commitments  and  Contingent  Liabilities).  Under this
settlement,  PSE&G will pay an aggregate of $82.0 million to PECO Energy Company
(PECO) and Delmarva  Power and Light Company  (DP&L),  resulting in an after tax
charge to  earnings  of $53.3  million or $0.23 per share.  Another  factor that
decreased  earnings  per  share  was weak  electric  and gas  sales  due to mild
weather,  partially  offset by lower operation and maintenance  expenses at Hope
Creek Nuclear  Generating  Station (Hope Creek) and Salem. In 1996,  expenses at
these  stations were higher than in 1997 due to the extended 1996  refueling and
maintenance outage at Hope Creek and restart activities at Salem.

     Enterprise  Diversified  Holdings  Incorporated's  (EDHI)  contribution  to
earnings decreased. This decrease was primarily due to the contribution of $0.04
per share in the first quarter of 1996 by EDHI's oil and gas subsidiary,  Energy
Development  Corporation (EDC),  which was sold on July 31, 1996.  Approximately
$350  million  of the  proceeds  was used to buy back  12.7  million  shares  of
Enterprise  common  stock.  The  resulting  lower  number of shares  outstanding
offset,  on an earnings per share basis,  the absence of an EDC  contribution in
the first quarter of 1997.

                                                         ===========

     Revenues  increased $1 million or 0.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 1997
from the comparable  period of 1996  primarily due to higher  recovery of energy
costs.  This increase was partially offset by lower  kilowatt-hour  sales due to
milder weather.

                                                           ==========

     Revenues decreased $63 million or 7.9% for the quarter ended March 31, 1997
over the comparable period of 1996 primarily due to lower recovery of fuel costs
and decreased therm sales due to milder weather.  Lower other operating revenues
due to weak off-system sales also contributed to the overall revenue decrease.

     (A)   Non-margin  revenues  primarily  reflect  recoveries  for Demand Side
           Management (DSM) Program costs,  uncollectibles and NJ Gross Receipts
           and Franchise Taxes (NJGRT).

PSE&G - Expenses

     Other Operation and Maintenance Expenses

     Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased $49 million or 14.5% for
the quarter ended March 31, 1997 from the comparable  1996 period.  The decrease
was primarily due to Hope Creek's  extended  refueling  and  maintenance  outage
during the first quarter of 1996.  Also  contributing to the decrease were lower
1997 restart activity expenses at Salem.

     Federal Income Taxes

     Federal  income taxes  increased  $7 million or 7.7% for the quarter  ended
March 31, 1997 from the comparable  1996 period.  The increase was primarily due
to the increase in 1997 pre-tax income.

     Interest on Long-Term Debt

     Interest on  long-term  debt  decreased  $8 million or 8.4% for the quarter
ended March 31, 1997 from the  comparable  1996  period.  In 1996, interest  was
higher due to a premium  payment in  connection  with open market  purchases  of
certain outstanding First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds.

     Fuel for Electric Generation and Interchanged Power

     Fuel for Electric  Generation and Interchanged  Power increased $32 million
or 14.9% due to an increase in fuel recovery  revenues.  Due to the operation of
the Electric  Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause (LEAC) mechanism,  variances in
fuel revenues and expenses offset, with no direct effect on earnings.

     Continuing Operations

     EDHI's  income from  continuing  operations  was $4 million for the quarter
ended March 31, 1997, a $5 million decrease from the comparable 1996 period. The
decrease  was  primarily  due  to  lower  gains  on  Public  Service   Resources
Corporation's (PSRC) security investments held in limited partnerships. The loss
for  Energis  Resources  increased  due to  higher  administrative  and  general
expenditures while income for Community Energy Alternatives Inc. (CEA) increased
due to the improved operations of several projects.

     Discontinued Operations

     EDC was sold on July 31, 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Enterprise

     Cash generated from  operations  will provide the major source of funds for
growth of the business.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $351 million at March
31, 1997.

     As of March 31, 1997,  Enterprise's  capital  structure  consisted of 49.8%
common equity, 42.9% long-term debt and 7.3% preferred stock and other preferred
securities.

     Dividend  payments on Common  Stock were $0.54 per share and  totaled  $125
million  for the quarter  ended March 31,  1997.  The ability of  Enterprise  to
declare and pay  dividends is contingent  upon its receipt of dividend  payments
from its subsidiaries.  Since 1992, Enterprise has maintained a constant rate of
dividend on its common stock.
A key Enterprise objective is to keep its common stock dividend secure.

     PSE&G

     For the quarter ended March 31, 1997,  PSE&G had utility  plant  additions,
including AFDC, of $111 million,  an $11 million increase from the corresponding
1996 period.  The increase was primarily due to the cost of the  replacement  of
the Salem Unit 1 steam generators.

     PSE&G  expects  that it will be  able  to  internally  generate  all of its
construction  and capital  requirements  over the next five years and reduce its
debt  outstanding  by  approximately  $1 billion,  assuming  adequate and timely
recovery of costs including any costs stranded as a result of changes in federal
and state regulations,  as to which no assurances can be given. (See Competitive
Environment  below;  Note 2, Rate Matters;  Note 3,  Commitments  and Contingent
Liabilities of Notes and Federal Regulations (Electric) of Item 5.)

     EDHI

     During the next five years, EDHI's capital  requirements are expected to be
provided  from  additional  debt  financing,  operational  cash flows and equity
capital.  CEA and Energis  Resources are expected to be the primary vehicles for
EDHI's  business  growth.  A significant  portion of CEA's growth is expected to
occur in the  international  arena due to the current and anticipated  growth in
electric capacity required in certain regions of the world. Energis Resources is
expected to expand upon the current  energy  related  services being provided to
industrial and commercial customers. PSRC will continue to limit new investments
to those  related  to energy  businesses,  while  Enterprise  Group  Development
Corporation  (EGDC) will continue to exit the real estate  business in a prudent
manner.

     In the first  quarter of 1997,  PSRC  entered  into a leveraged  lease of a
coal-fired steam generating  station located in the Netherlands.  In April 1997,
PSRC entered into two additional  leveraged leases of power plants:  one located
in the United  Kingdom;  the other in the  Netherlands.  The  aggregate of these
investments amounted to approximately $107 million.

     In the first  quarter  of 1997,  CEA  acquired a 50%  interest  in a 200 MW
natural   gas-fired   plant  located  in  Columbia  which  is  currently   under
construction.  In April 1997,  CEA and a partner won a bid to acquire,  for $565
million,  90% of two Argentinean  electric  distribution  companies  serving the
Buenos Aires  province.  CEA's  indirect  ownership of the two companies is 33%.
Financial  closing is expected to occur in June 1997. Each of these  investments
is considered an exempt  foreign  utility  company.  Also in April  1997,  CEA
acquired a 49% interest in an  operating  180 MW  oil-fired  cogeneration  plant
located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.  The aggregate  equity  investment  for
these and other projects will amount to approximately $225 million by year end.

     EDHI,  PSRC and CEA are  subject  to  restrictive  business  and  financial
covenants contained in existing debt agreements.  EDHI is required to maintain a
debt to equity ratio of no more than 2.00:1 and a twelve-months  earnings before
interest and taxes (EBIT)  coverage  ratio of at least  1.50:1.  As of March 31,
1997,  EDHI had a  consolidated  debt to equity ratio of 1.00:1.  For the twelve
months ended March 31, 1997, the EBIT coverage  ratio, as defined to exclude the
effects  of EGDC and the 1996 gain on the sale of EDC,  was  2.25:1.  Compliance
with applicable  financial  covenants will depend upon future financial position
and levels of earnings, as to which no assurance can be given.

     Over the next several years,  EDHI and its subsidiaries will be required to
refinance  a  portion  of their  maturing  debt in order to meet  their  capital
requirements.  Any inability to extend or replace  maturing debt and/or existing
agreements at current levels and interest  rates may affect future  earnings and
result in an increase in EDHI's cost of capital.

External Financings - PSE&G

     PSE&G has New Jersey  Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)  authority to issue
approximately $4.336 billion aggregate amount of additional Bonds/MTNs/Preferred
Stock/Preferred  Securities  through  1997 for  refunding  purposes.  Under  its
Mortgage, PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds (Bonds) against
previous additions and improvements and/or retired Bonds provided that its ratio
of earnings to fixed  charges is at least 2:1. At March 31, 1997,  this Mortgage
ratio was 3.34:1.  As of March 31, 1997,  the Mortgage would permit up to $3.047
billion  aggregate  principal  amount of new bonds to be issued against previous
additions and improvements.

     In February  1997,  PSE&G  Capital  Trust II, a special  purpose  statutory
business  trust  controlled  by PSE&G,  issued $95  million of 8.125%  Quarterly
Income Preferred Securities  (Quarterly Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest
in  PSE&G's  Subordinated  Debentures).  PSE&G  used  the  proceeds  to fund the
redemption of the remaining  188,684 shares  outstanding of its 6.80% Cumulative
Preferred Stock $100 par value at $102 per share in January 1997 and will redeem
all 750,000  shares of its 7.44%  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock $100 par value at
$103.72 per share in June 1997.

     The BPU has authorized  PSE&G to issue and have outstanding at any one time
not more than $1.3 billion of short-term  obligations,  consisting of commercial
paper and other  unsecured  borrowings  from  banks  and other  lenders  through
January 2, 1999. On March 31, 1997,  PSE&G had $467 million of  short-term  debt
outstanding.

     To provide  liquidity for its commercial  paper  program,  PSE&G has a $500
million one-year  revolving credit agreement  expiring in August 1997 and a $500
million  five-year  revolving  credit  agreement  expiring in August 2000 with a
group of commercial  banks,  which provide for  borrowings of up to one year. On
March  31,  1997,  there  were no  borrowings  outstanding  under  these  credit
agreements.  PSE&G expects to be able to renew the credit agreement  expiring in
1997.

     PSE&G Fuel Corporation (Fuelco) has a $125 million commercial paper program
to finance a 42.49% share of Peach Bottom  Atomic Power  Station  nuclear  fuel,
supported by a $125 million  revolving  credit  facility  with a group of banks,
which  expires on June 28,  2001.  PSE&G has  guaranteed  repayment  of Fuelco's
respective  obligations  under this  program.  As of March 31, 1997,  Fuelco had
commercial paper of $74 million outstanding under such program.

External Financings - EDHI

     PSEG Capital  Corporation's  (Capital)  Medium-Term  Note (MTN)  program is
expected to provide for an aggregate  principal amount of up to $650 million and
its total debt  outstanding  at any time,  including  MTNs,  is not  expected to
exceed such amount.  At March 31, 1997,  Capital had total debt  outstanding  of
$398 million, including $335 million of MTN's.

Nuclear Operations

     PSE&G's Salem Units 1 and 2 were taken out of service in the second quarter
of 1995.  Salem Unit 2 is in the final stage of  preparation  for restart and is
expected to return to service  early in the third  quarter of 1997.  In a May 5,
1997 letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), PSE&G requested that the
NRC commence its Readiness  Assessment  Team  Inspection (a requirement for unit
restart)  in early June  1997.  PSE&G  expects  that the NRC will  complete  its
inspection  in June.  Installation  of Salem Unit 1 steam  generators is nearing
completion,  and the unit is expected to return to service in late 1997. Restart
of each Salem Unit is subject to NRC approval.  The cost of the  replacement  of
Unit 1 steam generators, including installation, and the cost of disposal of the
four old steam  generators  is estimated at $180 million  (PSE&G's  share is $77
million),  of which  approximately  $150  million  has already  been spent.  The
inability to successfully return these units to continuous, safe operation could
have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations
and net cash flows of Enterprise and PSE&G.

Impact of New Accounting Pronouncement

     In March 1997,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS
128) which is effective for financial statements issued after December 15, 1997.
SFAS 128  supersedes  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 15 (APB 15) and
replaces the  presentation  of Primary EPS with a presentation  of Basic EPS. It
also requires  presentation of Basic and Diluted EPS on the income statement for
all entities with complex  capital  structures.  The adoption of SFAS 128 is not
expected  to have a  material  impact on the  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and net cash flows of Enterprise and PSE&G.

Competitive Environment

     Energy Master Plan

     On January 16, 1997, the BPU issued its draft report  regarding Phase II of
the New Jersey Energy Master Plan (draft Phase II report)  addressing  wholesale
and retail electric competition in New Jersey. PSE&G assessed the draft Phase II
report's  proposed  findings and  recommendations  and, in  accordance  with the
proceeding requirements,  filed formal written comments with the BPU on February
28, 1997.

     The comments stated that PSE&G will voluntarily commit to provide access to
its  transmission  system for retail  customers in order to facilitate  electric
industry  restructuring to open the market to competition.  PSE&G further stated
that it is committed to working toward rate  reductions in a manner that assures
the reliability of electric  service,  safeguards the environment,  protects the
New Jersey labor force and treats investors  fairly.  PSE&G urged the BPU not to
allow  prudently  incurred  costs to be stranded in the industry  transition  to
competition. PSE&G also recommended that, as long as the BPU's policy objectives
are met and the utility meets its burden of proof,  there should be  flexibility
in the  guidelines  for the form and  content  of the  various  utility  filings
required to be made by July 15, 1997. In addition,  PSE&G recommended that, at a
minimum, the BPU should require certain environmental protection standards.

     On April 30, 1997,  the BPU issued its final report  regarding  Phase II of
the New Jersey Energy  Master Plan (final Phase II report).  The majority of the
final  Phase II  report  mirrors  the  draft  Phase II  report,  except  that it
accelerates  the  phase-in  period  of  customer  choice  of  providers  for all
customers  to include 10% in October  1998,  20% by January  1999,  35% by April
1999,  50% by October 1999,  75% by April 2000 and 100% by July 2000.  The final
Phase II report also calls for: (1) near term rate reductions in retail electric
rates of 5-10%;  (2) utilities to have the  opportunity,  but no  guarantee,  to
recover  stranded  costs  associated  with  generating  capacity  investment and
independent  power  contract  costs;  (3)  a  market  transition  charge  to  be
established  for a limited  time of 4-8 years to  provide  for the  recovery  of
non-mitigated  stranded costs; (4) the issue of securitization of stranded costs
to be explored;  (5) functional separation of utility generating assets, subject
to BPU detailed  analyses of potential market power issues and (6) the filing of
a rate unbundling plan,  stranded cost status report and  restructuring  plan by
July 15, 1997. The final Phase II report  endorses  environmental  disclosure by
power  suppliers  to provide  consumers  with  information  necessary  to choose
cleaner sources of power  available in the  marketplace.  The  information  will
enable  verification  of claimed  emission  rates,  which will be  explored by a
Consumer  Protection Task Force. The final Phase II report is to be submitted to
New  Jersey's   Governor  and  Legislature  in  May  1997,  with   restructuring
legislation  expected to be introduced in the Legislature  before year-end 1997.
BPU action on the July 15, 1997 utility  filings  pursuant to the final Phase II
report is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 1998.

     Stranded Costs

     Recoverability  of stranded  costs is largely  dependent on the  transition
rules  established  by  regulators,  including  the  Federal  Energy  Regulatory
Commission  (FERC)  and the BPU.  The  final  Phase II report  concluded  that a
utility's  stranded  costs  should  be  limited  to costs  associated  with past
financial commitments made for the purpose of procuring a utility's power supply
and that the utility should be given the  opportunity  but that there should not
be a guarantee provided for 100% recovery of all eligible stranded costs. Due to
uncertainties  regarding future market prices of electricity and the duration of
the transition period,  PSE&G has not yet determined the level of stranded costs
related to its  generating  facilities  and thus  cannot  currently  predict the
amount of its potential  stranded costs. PSE&G plans to file, no later than July
15, 1997, a stranded cost status report with the BPU. The  opportunity  for full
recovery of such eligible costs would be contingent upon, and may be constrained
by, the utility  meeting a number of  conditions,  including  achievement of the
goal of delivering a near term rate reduction to customers of 5 to 10%.

     A mechanism that is currently being explored to mitigate stranded costs for
utilities is securitization. With the adoption of appropriate state legislation,
this mechanism  offers a means  to reduce the cost of stranded asset recovery by
refinancing  stranded capital,  formerly financed with a combination of debt and
equity,  with all debt.  The  final  Phase II report  recognizes  the  potential
benefits of this valuable  mechanism.  However,  the report  expresses the BPU's
view that  securitization is not the sole solution for solving the stranded cost
problems  but must be used with other  reasonably  available  mitigation  steps.
Recognizing that stranded costs have not yet been quantified,  that the issue of
asset securitization and the extent of its application have not been determined,
as well as the need for enabling legislation, PSE&G cannot predict the extent to
which regulators may allow recovery of its potentially stranded costs. Inability
to adequately recover stranded costs could have a material adverse affect on the
financial condition,  results of operations and net cash flows of Enterprise and
PSE&G.

     New Jersey Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax (NJGRT)

     On March 10, 1997, legislation was introduced in the New Jersey Legislature
to repeal the NJGRT  collected by utilities from their  customers and replace it
with a  combination  of corporate  business  tax,  state sales and use tax and a
transitional  assessment  which would be phased out over five years. The new tax
structure would improve the competitive position of PSE&G vis-a-vis  non-utility
energy  providers in New Jersey who are currently not subject to NJGRT.  If this
legislation  is approved,  the new tax  structure  would take effect  January 1,
1998. PSE&G cannot predict when or if this legislation will be approved.

     PSE&G SelectGas Pilot Program


     On March 12, 1997, the BPU approved  PSE&G's  SelectGas Pilot Program which
gives residential  customers in four  municipalities  the option to purchase gas
from a supplier other than PSE&G  beginning May 1, 1997.  This  residential  gas
unbundling  pilot program will extend through June 1998, but customers can elect
to return to the  PSE&G  system  during  the pilot or stay with  their  selected
supplier,  assuming the  customer's  supplier  also  provides for such a change.
Unbundling in the gas industry began in PSE&G's  service area in 1994 when PSE&G
opened the gas market to its commercial and industrial customers.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

     Certain  information  reported under Item 3 of Part I of  Enterprise's  and
PSE&G's 1996 Annual Report to the SEC on Form 10-K is updated below.  References
are to the related page of the Form 10-K.

     Page 24. PSE&G settled the lawsuit brought against it by PECO and DP&L, two
co-owners  of Salem,  relating  to alleged  damages  resulting  from the current
outage of the  facility.  Under the terms of the  settlement,  PSE&G will pay an
aggregate  of $82.0  million to PECO and DP&L.  PSE&G would also be obligated to
pay $1.4  million for each  reactor  month that the outage  continues  beyond an
aggregate  outage of 64  reactor  months,  up to a maximum  payment  under  this
provision  of  $17  million.  Salem  has  presently  been  out  of  service  for
approximately 47 reactor months and PSE&G does not expect to be required to make
any payments under this provision.  The parties have also agreed to an operating
performance  standard  through  December 31, 2007 for Peach Bottom  (operated by
PECO) and December 31, 2011 for Salem.  Under this standard,  the operator would
be  required  to make  payments  to the  non-operating  owners if the three year
capacity factor,  determined annually,  of either station falls below 40 percent
subject to a maximum  of up to $25  million  per year.  The  initial  three-year
period  begins for Peach Bottom on January 1, 1998 and for Salem on the date the
later of the two Salem units returns to service. The parties have further agreed
to forego  litigation  in the  future,  except  for  limited  cases in which the
operator would be  responsible  for damages of no more than $5 million per year.
(See Results of  Operations  of MD&A and Note 3 --  Commitments  and  Contingent
Liabilities for more information.)

New Matter

     On March  18,  1997,  Public  Service  Conservation  Resources  Corporation
(PSCRC),  an  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Enterprise  and  a  direct
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of PSE&G,  filed a  collection  action  against  SYCOM
Enterprises Limited Partnership (SYCOM) in connection with PSCRC's DSM business.
PSCRC  alleged  that SYCOM has breached a number of  different  loan  agreements
under which PSCRC is owed approximately $13.4 million in principal and interest.
On May 7, 1997,  SYCOM  filed a  counterclaim  against  PSCRC and a  third-party
complaint against an officer and certain consultants of PSCRC,  alleging damages
of $750 million and asserting  claims that pursuant to statute,  if  successful,
would  permit  treble  damages.   PSCRC  believes  that  the   counterclaim  and
third-party  complaint are spurious and without merit and PSCRC will  vigorously
contest  such  claims.  At March 31, 1997,  Enterprise  and PSE&G had  aggregate
investments in PSCRC of $54.9 million.  Public  Service  Conservation  Resources

Item 5.  Other Information

     Certain  information  reported under  Enterprise's  and PSE&G's 1996 Annual
Report to the SEC is updated  below.  References are to the related pages of the
Form 10-K as printed and distributed.

Nuclear Operations

     Form 10-K, Page 9

     In 1990,  General  Electric  (GE)  reported  that  crack  indications  were
discovered near the seam welds of the core shroud assembly in a GE Boiling Water
Reactor (BWR) located outside the United States. As a result, GE issued a letter
requesting  that the owners of GE BWR plants take  interim  corrective  actions.
PSE&G (Hope  Creek) and PECO  (Peach  Bottom)  participated  in a GE BWR Owners'
Group to evaluate this issue and develop long-term  corrective  actions.  During
its  1994  refueling  outage,  PSE&G  inspected  the  shroud  of Hope  Creek  in
accordance  with GE's  recommendations  and found no cracks.  In June  1994,  an
industry  group was  formed  and  subsequently  established  generic  inspection
guidelines  which were approved by the NRC.  Hope Creek was initially  placed in
the lowest susceptibility  category under these guidelines.  Due to Hope Creek's
operating time, it now falls into the intermediate susceptibility category. Hope
Creek will perform another shroud inspection during its next refueling outage in
September 1997.

     Form 10-K, Page 10

     In a separate matter, as a result of several BWRs experiencing  clogging of
some emergency core cooling  system suction  strainers,  which supply water from
the suppression pool for emergency  cooling of the core and related  structures,
the NRC issued a  Bulletin  in May 1996 to  operators  of BWRs  requesting  that
measures be taken to minimize the potential  for clogging.  The NRC has proposed
three  resolution  options and requires  that actions be completed by the end of
the unit's first refueling outage after January 1, 1997.  Alternative resolution
options  will be  subject  to NRC  approval.  PSE&G  has  responded  to the NRC,
indicating its intention to comply with the Bulletin.  The Bulletin requires all
BWRs to resolve  this issue at their first  refueling  outage  after  January 1,
1997.  Therefore,  PSE&G will be installing  large  capacity  passive  strainers
during Hope Creek's next  refueling in September  1997.  PECO has advised  PSE&G
that large  capacity  passive  strainers  will also be installed at Peach Bottom
Units 2 and 3  during  their  next  refueling  outages  in  September  1997  and
September 1998,  respectively.  PSE&G cannot predict what other actions, if any,
the NRC may take in this matter.

     Form 10-K, Page 12

     As  a  result  of  reracking  the  two  spent  fuel  pools  at  Salem,  the
availability of adequate spent fuel storage  capacity is estimated  through 2012
for Salem 1 and 2016 for  Salem 2,  prior to  losing  an  operational  full core
discharge  reserve.  The Hope Creek pool is also fully racked and it is expected
to provide  storage  capacity  until 2006,  again prior to losing an operational
full core  discharge  reserve.  PECO has advised  PSE&G that spent fuel racks at
Peach  Bottom have storage  capacity  until 2000 for Unit 2 and 2001 for Unit 3,
prior to losing full core discharge  reserve  capability.  PECO has also advised
PSE&G that it is  exploring  the  feasibility  of  constructing  an on-site  dry
storage  facility  which would be  operational  in the year 2000 and designed to
provide adequate storage capacity through 2014.


     Form 10-K, Page 16

     New Jersey  Department of Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP) issued a final
renewal permit for Hope Creek Station effective April 1, 1997.

Federal Regulation (Electric)

     Form 10-K, Page 2

     Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  Order No. 888 requires all
public utilities  owning,  controlling or operating  transmission  lines to file
nondiscriminatory  open  access  tariffs  that offer  others the same  wholesale
transmission service utilities provide to themselves. On February 28, 1997, FERC
issued an order  accepting for filing  nondiscriminatory  pool-wide  open access
transmission tariffs for existing power pools.  Transmission services covered by
Order No. 888 include network and point-to-point  services, as well as ancillary
services and a pro forma tariff setting  minimum terms and conditions of service
for  nondiscriminatory  open access transmission  service.  Public utilities are
required  both to offer  service to others under the pro forma tariff and to use
the pro forma tariff for their own wholesale  energy sales and  purchases.  This
Order also provides public  utilities with the opportunity to seek full recovery
of prudently  incurred,  legitimate and verifiable stranded costs resulting from
the transfer of open access wholesale  transmission service customers to another
supplier.  To be eligible for recovery,  stranded costs must be associated  with
wholesale  requirement  contracts  signed before July 11, 1994. After that date,
recovery must be specifically provided for in the contract.  FERC has ruled that
stranded  costs  should  be  recovered  from  a  utility's  departing  wholesale
customers.  FERC has also stated that if costs are stranded by retail  wheeling,
utilities  should  first look to the states to recover  those  costs.  FERC will

provide for stranded cost recovery.

     Numerous parties, including PSE&G, had filed requests seeking rehearing and
clarification  of various  aspects of Order No. 888. On February 26, 1997,  FERC
responded to rehearing  requests by  reaffirming  its findings in Order No. 888,
making minor adjustments to ease implementation and providing  clarifications to
issues raised on rehearing.

     On April 1, 1997,  PJM,  as agent for the PJM  transmission  owners,  began
providing  transmission  service under the PJM Open Access Transmission  Tariff.
The PJM Open Access Transmission  Tariff superseded all individual  transmission
open access tariffs of the PJM transmission  owners. In the order, FERC directed
PJM to use the  PECO  proposal  for  interim  implementation  due to  unresolved
questions  regarding the other PJM  companies'  proposal on pricing.  FERC had a
technical  conference on May 9, 1997 to facilitate  the resolution of issues not
fully  addressed in the other PJM  companies'  proposal on  congestion  pricing.
PSE&G cannot  predict what actions,  if any, FERC may take in this matter.  With
respect to the other tariff options contained in PJM's December 31, 1996 filing,
FERC  ordered  implementation  of the other PJM  companies  proposal.  Action on
interventions and requests for relief filed in response to the December 31, 1996
filing were deferred.
