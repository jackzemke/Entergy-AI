                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

     Public Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated  (PSEG) is an exempt public
utility   holding   company  which  has  four  principal   direct   wholly-owned
subsidiaries:  Public Service Electric and Gas Company  (PSE&G),  PSEG Power LLC
(Power),   PSEG  Energy  Holdings  Inc.  (Energy  Holdings)  and  PSEG  Services
Corporation (Services).

Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These Consolidated Financial Statements  (Statements)
and Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  (Notes) update and supplement
matters  discussed  in PSEG's  2000  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K and  Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2001 and June 30, 2001 and
should be read in conjunction with these Notes.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented.  The year-end  consolidated balance sheet was
derived from the audited  consolidated  financial  statements included in PSEG's
2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications of prior period data
have been made to conform with the current presentation.

Note 2.  Accounting Matters

     Issued in July 2000,  Emerging  Issues Task Force (EITF)  consensus  99-19,
"Reporting  Revenue  Gross as a Principal  versus Net as an Agent"  (EITF 99-19)
provided  guidance on the issue of whether a company should report revenue based
on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained. Beginning
in the first quarter of 2001,  based on an analysis and  interpretation  of EITF
99-19,  PSEG reported all the revenues and energy costs on a gross basis for the
physical  bilateral energy sales and purchases and capacity sales and purchases.
PSEG continues to report  revenues and costs related to swaps,  futures,  option
premiums,   firm  transmission  rights,   transmission  congestion  credits  and
purchases  and sales of emission  allowances  on a net basis.  The prior  period
financial statements have been reclassified accordingly.

     On  January  1,  2001,  PSEG  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as amended (SFAS 133), and recorded a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting  principle and other comprehensive  income of $9 million and $(14)
million,  respectively.  As of  September  30,  2001,  the fair  value of PSEG's
derivative   assets  and   liabilities   were  $27  million  and  $122  million,
respectively,  resulting in a net $95 million  liability,  a negative  impact to
Other Comprehensive  Income (OCI) of $43 million,  deferred taxes of $25 million
and a minimal impact on the income statement.


<PAGE>

     The Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) Derivative  Implementation
Group (DIG) issued  guidance,  effective  January 1, 2002,  regarding the normal
purchases  and normal sales  exception  for  option-type  contracts  and forward
contracts in electricity. In addition, the DIG issued amended guidance effective
April 1, 2002,  regarding  the normal  purchases  and normal sales  exception to
contracts that combine a forward contract and a purchased option contract.  PSEG
is currently  evaluating  this  guidance in light of its  potential  impacts and
cannot  predict the impact on its financial  position or results of  operations,
however,  such impact could be material.  PSEG has evaluated additional guidance
issued by the DIG which was effective July 1, 2001 which had no material  effect
on PSEG's financial position or results of operations.

     In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business  Combinations"  (SFAS
141).  SFAS 141 was  effective  July 1,  2001  and  requires  that all  business
combinations  on or after that date be accounted for under the purchase  method.
Upon  implementation  of this  standard,  there was no  impact on its  financial
position  or  results  of  operations  and PSEG does not  believe it will have a
substantial effect on its strategy.

     In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets"  (SFAS 142).  Under SFAS 142,  goodwill is  considered a  nonamortizable
asset and will be subject  to an annual  review  for  impairment  and an interim
review when required by events or  circumstances.  SFAS 142 is effective for all
fiscal years  beginning  after December 15, 2001.  PSEG is currently  evaluating
this  guidance  and does not  believe  it will  have a  material  impact  on its
financial position or results of operations.

     Also in July 2001,  the FASB  issued SFAS No.  143,  "Accounting  for Asset
Retirement  Obligations"  (SFAS  143).  Under  SFAS  143,  the  fair  value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation should be recorded in the period in
which it is incurred. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles
the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2002.  PSEG is
currently  evaluating  this  guidance  and  cannot  predict  the  impact  on its
financial  position or results of  operations,  however,  such  impact  could be
material.

     In August 2001,  FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting  for  Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" (SFAS 144). Under SFAS 144 long-lived  assets to
be disposed will be measured at the lower of carrying  amount or fair value less
cost to sell,  whether  reported  in  continued  operations  or in  discontinued
operations. Discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable
value or include amounts for operating  losses that have not yet occurred.  SFAS
144  also  broadens  the  reporting  of  discontinued  operations.  SFAS  144 is
effective for fiscal years  beginning after December 15, 2001. PSEG is currently
evaluating  this guidance and does not believe it will have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.

New Jersey Energy Master Plan Proceedings and Related Orders

     In August 1999, following the enactment of the New Jersey Electric Discount
and Energy  Competition  Act,  the New Jersey  Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)
rendered a Final Order relating to PSE&G's rate  unbundling,  stranded costs and
restructuring  proceedings (Final Order) providing,  among other things, for the
transfer to Power of all of PSE&G's electric  generation  facilities,  plant and
equipment  for  $2.443  billion  and  all  other  related  property,   including
materials,  supplies  and  fuel at the net book  value  thereof,  together  with
associated  rights and liabilities.  PSE&G  transferred its electric  generating
business  to Power in August 2000 in exchange  for a $2.786  billion  promissory
note, which was repaid by Power on January 31, 2001.

     Also in the Final Order,  the BPU concluded that PSE&G should recover up to
$2.94  billion (net of tax) of its  generation-related  stranded  costs over the
transition  period through  securitization of $2.4 billion and an opportunity to
recover up to $540 million (net of tax) of its unsecuritized  generation-related
stranded  costs on a net present  value  basis.  The $540  million is subject to
recovery through a market transition charge (MTC). PSE&G remits the MTC revenues
to Power as part of the basic generation  service (BGS) contract as provided for
by the Final Order.

     In September  1999,  the BPU issued its order  approving  PSE&G's  petition
relating  to the  proposed  securitization  transaction  (Finance  Order)  which
authorized,  among other things,  the imposition of a non-bypassable  transition
bond charge (TBC) on PSE&G's  customers;  the sale of PSE&G's  property right in
such charge to a  bankruptcy-remote  financing entity;  the issuance and sale of
$2.525  billion of  transition  bonds by such entity as  consideration  for such
property right,  including an estimated $125 million of transaction  costs;  and
the application by PSE&G of the transition  bond proceeds to retire  outstanding
debt and/or equity. PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) issued the
transition  bonds on January 31,  2001;  and the TBC and an  additional  2% rate
reduction  became  effective  on February 7, 2001 in  accordance  with the Final
Order.  An  additional  2% rate  reduction  became  effective  on August 1, 2001
bringing  the total  rate  reduction  to 9% since  August 1,  1999.  These  rate
reductions and the TBC were funded through the MTC rate.

     In October and November  1999,  appeals  were filed by New Jersey  Business
User's Coalition,  the New Jersey Ratepayer Advocate (RPA), and Co-Steel Raritan
(Co-Steel),  an individual  PSE&G  customer,  (the  appellants)  challenging the
validity of the Finance  Order as well as the Final  Order.  In April 2000,  the
Appellate  Division of the New Jersey  Superior Court  unanimously  rejected the
arguments made by the appellants and affirmed the Final Order and Finance Order.
In May 2000,  the  appellants  requested the New Jersey  Supreme Court to review
certain aspects of the Appellate Division decision. In July 2000, the New Jersey
Supreme Court granted the requests.  In December  2000, by a vote of 4 to 1, the
New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  issued  its order  affirming  the  judgment  of the
Appellate Division. The New Jersey Supreme Court's written opinion was issued on
May 18, 2001.

     On March 6, 2001,  Co-Steel filed a Petition of Writ of Certiorari with the
United States  Supreme Court seeking  limited  review of the New Jersey  Supreme
Court decision. In October 2001, the Supreme Court denied Co-Steel's petition.

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed  securities)  were issued by  Transition  Funding,  in eight classes with
maturities  ranging  from 1 year to 15 years.  Also on January 31,  2001,  PSE&G
received  payment  from  Power on its  $2.786  billion  promissory  note used to
finance the transfer of PSE&G's generation business in August 2000. The proceeds
from these  transactions  were used to pay for certain debt issuance and related
costs for  securitization,  retire a portion of PSE&G's  outstanding  short-term
debt, reduce PSE&G common equity, loan funds to PSEG and make various short-term
investments.

Note 5.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Pending Asset Purchases and Development

     Power

     In  1999,   Power  entered  into  agreements   with  Conectiv,   Conectiv's
subsidiaries  Delmarva Power and Light Company (DP&L) and Atlantic City Electric
Company (ACE), and Exelon  Generation LLC (Exelon) pursuant to which Power would
acquire all of DP&L's and ACE's  interests in Salem Nuclear  Generating  Station
(Salem) and Hope Creek  Generating  Station  (Hope Creek) and half of DP&L's and
ACE's  interest in Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station  (Peach Bottom) (a total of
544 MW) for a purchase price of $15.4 million plus the net book value of nuclear
fuel at the respective  closing dates. In December 2000, the DP&L portion of the
transaction (246 MW) closed.  The ACE portion of the transaction (298 MW) closed
in October 2001, yielding the following final ownership shares:


                                 Power                         Exelon
                          ----------------              ---------------------

     Salem                        57.41%                        42.59%
     Hope Creek                  100.00%                           --
     Peach Bottom                 50.00%                        50.00%

     PSEG  Power New York  Inc.,  an  indirect  subsidiary  of Power,  is in the
process of obtaining  permits and approvals to authorize the  development of the
Bethlehem Energy Center, a 750 MW  combined-cycle  power plant that will replace
the 400 MW Albany Steam  Station,  which was acquired from Niagara  Mohawk Power
Corporation  (Niagara  Mohawk)in May 2000. In September 2001, the New York State
Board on Electric  Generation  Siting and the  Environment  determined  that the
Certificate  of  Environmental   Compatibility   and  Public  Need  (Article  X)
application is in compliance with state regulations. This Board expects to reach
a final project certification decision within 12 months. Furthermore,  the state
Department of Environmental  Conservation has issued draft air and water permits
for the project. Under its Purchase Agreement with Niagara Mohawk, Power will be
obligated  to pay Niagara  Mohawk up to $9 million if it  redevelops  the Albany
Station, however, Power expects this payment will be reduced based on conditions
related to the service date and regulatory requirements.

     Power is constructing a 500 MW natural  gas-fired,  combined cycle electric
generation plant at Bergen  Generation  Station at a cost of approximately  $290
million with  completion  expected in June 2002.  Power is also  constructing an
1,186 MW  combined  cycle  generation  plant at Linden  for  approximately  $590
million expected to be completed in May 2003.

     In August 2001,  subsidiaries of Power closed with a group of banks on $800
million of non-recourse  project  financing for projects in Waterford,  Ohio and
Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The Waterford project will be completed in two phases and
will increase Power's capacity by 850MW. The first phase and second phase of the
project are expected to achieve commercial  operation in June 2002 and May 2003,
respectively.  The Lawrenceburg  project will increase Power's capacity by 1,150
MW and is  expected  to  achieve  commercial  operation  by May 2003.  The total
combined  project  cost for  Waterford  and  Lawrenceburg  is  estimated at $1.2
billion.  Power's required equity  investment in these projects is approximately
$400 million.

     In  addition,  Power also has  contracted  with a third  party to  purchase
combustion turbines through 2004. The aggregate amount due under these contracts
is approximately $600 million.

     Energy Holdings

     In March 2001,  Global,  through  Dhofar  Power  Company  (DPCO),  signed a
20-year  concession with the government of Oman to privatize the electric system
of Salalah. A consortium led by Global and several major Omani investment groups
owns DPCO.  The  project  will  enhance  the  existing  network  of  generation,
transmission and delivery assets and is expected to add 195 MW of new generating
capacity.  The project achieved  financial  closure in August 2001 and commenced
construction  in September  2001. The project is expected to achieve  commercial
operation  by March 2003.  Total  project  cost is  estimated  at $277  million.
Global's  equity  investment,   including  contingencies,   is  expected  to  be
approximately $82 million.

     In May 2001,  GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy),  a 50/50 joint  venture  between
Global and Harbinger GWF LLC,  entered into a 10-year power  purchase  agreement
with the California  Department of Water Resources to provide 340 MW of electric
capacity to California from three new natural  gas-fired  peaker plants that GWF
Energy  expects  to build and  operate  in  California.  Total  project  cost is
estimated at $310 million. The first plant, a 90 MW facility,  was completed and
began operation in August 2001.  Global's  permanent equity  investment in these
plants,  including  contingencies,  is not expected to exceed $100 million after
completion of project financing, expected to occur in 2002.

     In July  2001,  Global won the bid to  purchase  up to a 100%  interest  in
Empresa  de  Electricidad  de  los  Andes  S.A.  (Electroandes)  with  a bid  of
approximately  $227 million.  Global's closing for this acquisition is scheduled
for the fourth quarter of 2001 and may be dependent  upon  resolution of certain
matters  regarding  applicable  tax  rates.  Electroandes  is the sixth  largest
electric  generator in Peru with a 6% market  share.  Electroandes'  main assets
include four hydroelectric  facilities with a combined installed capacity of 183
MW and 460 miles of  transmission  lines  located in the Central  Andean  region
(northeast  of Lima).  In addition,  Electroandes  has the  exclusive  rights to
develop  a 100 MW  expansion  of an  existing  station  and a 150 MW  greenfield
hydroelectric  facility.  In 2000,  Electroandes  generated  1,150  gigawatts of
electrical  energy,  of which 97% was sold through power purchase  agreements to
mining companies in the region.

     In August 2001, Global purchased a 94% equity stake in SAESA and all of its
subsidiaries  from  COPEC.  The  SAESA  group  of  companies  consists  of  four
distribution  companies  and one  transmission  company  that  provide  electric
service in the southern part of Chile. Additionally, Global purchased from COPEC
approximately 14% of Frontel not owned by SAESA.  SAESA also owns a 50% interest
in the  Argentine  distribution  company  Empresa  Electrica  del Rio Negro S.A.
Collectively,  the  companies  serve more than 615,000  customers.  The purchase
approximated  $460 million,  including a tender offer for 6% of publicly  traded
SAESA shares in October 2001.

     In August 2001,  Global  entered into an agreement to sell its interests in
several joint ventures in Argentina to a subsidiary of the AES Corporation (AES)
for $376  million.  The  transaction  will  involve the transfer of Global's 30%
interest in three Argentine  distribution  companies,  Empresa  Distribuidora de
Energia Norte S.A. (EDEN),  Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Sur S.A. (EDES) and
Empresa  Distribuidora La Plata S.A. (EDELAP), a 19% share in the 650 MW Central
Termica San Nicolas power plant (CTSN),  and a 33% interest in the 830 MW Parana
power plant (Parana) nearing the completion of  construction.  Payment terms for
the  transaction  include a 10% down payment with the  remainder of the purchase
price payable under a promissory note to be issued by a subsidiary of the AES to
Global  and   collateralized  by  AES  subsidiary's   interest  in  the  assets.
Consummation  of the  transaction  is subject to the parties  obtaining  certain
lender and regulatory approvals and is expected to occur in early 2002.

     As of September 30, 2001,  Global's  investments  in the Texas  Independent
Energy (TIE) partnership  include $161 million of loans that earn interest at an
annual rate of 12%. Of the $161 million  currently  outstanding,  $83 million is
scheduled  to be repaid in full in February  2002 and $78 million will be repaid
over the next 12 years.

     Energy Holdings,  its subsidiaries and equity method investees are involved
in  various  legal  actions  arising in the normal  course of  business.  Energy
Holdings does not expect there will be material  adverse effect on its financial
statements  as a result of these  proceedings,  although  no  assurances  can be
given.

Hazardous Waste

     The New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of  contaminated  sites.  The  NJDEP is  presently  working  with
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of environmental investigations
and  remediations,  where  necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface
water bodies.  Power,  PSE&G and  predecessor  companies  owned and/or  operated
certain  facilities  situated  on  surface  water  bodies,  certain of which are
currently  the subject of remedial  activities.  While the  financial  impact of
these  regulations on these projects is not currently  estimable,  PSEG does not
anticipate  that the  compliance  with  these  regulations  will have a material
adverse  effect on its  financial  position,  results of  operations or net cash
flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     PSE&G is  currently  working  with the NJDEP  under a program  (Remediation
Program) to assess,  investigate  and,  if  necessary,  remediate  environmental
conditions at PSE&G's  former  manufactured  gas plant sites.  To date, 38 sites
have been  identified.  The  Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and
revised  by  PSE&G  based  on  regulatory  requirements,   experience  with  the
Remediation Program and available remediation technologies.  The long-term costs
of the  Remediation  Program cannot be reasonably  estimated,  but experience to
date indicates that  approximately $20 million per year could be incurred over a
period of about 30 years and that the overall cost could be material.  The costs
for this remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

     Net of  recoveries,  costs  incurred  through  September  30,  2001 for the
Remediation  Program amounted to $158.5 million.  In addition,  at September 30,
2001, PSE&G's estimated  liability for remediation costs through 2003 aggregated
$74.0 million. Expenditures beyond 2003 cannot be reasonably estimated.

Passaic River Site

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that
a six mile  stretch of the Passaic  River in Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"
within the  meaning of that term under the Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and that, to date, at
least thirteen  corporations,  including  PSE&G,  may be potentially  liable for
performing   required  remedial  actions  to  address  potential   environmental
pollution at the Passaic River "facility." PSE&G and certain of its predecessors
operated   industrial   facilities  at  properties   within  the  Passaic  River
"facility,"  which include one  operating  electric  generating  station and one
former generating  station.  PSEG cannot predict what action, if any, the EPA or
any third  party may take  against  PSE&G  and/or  Power  with  respect to these
matters,  or in such event,  what costs PSE&G  and/or Power may incur to address
any such claims. However, such costs may be material.

New Source Review

     In a response  to a demand by the EPA and NJDEP  under  Section  114 of the
Federal Clean Air Act (CAA)  requiring  information to assess  whether  projects
completed  since  1978  at  the  Hudson  and  Mercer  generating  stations  were
implemented in accordance with applicable New Source Review  regulations,  Power
provided certain data in November 2000.  Based upon the information  provided to
the EPA, it is likely that the EPA will seek to enforce the  requirements of the
New Source Review  program at Hudson 2 and Mercer 1 and 2. Power is currently in
discussions  with the EPA and  NJDEP to  resolve  the  matter.  It is  uncertain
whether these discussions will be successful; however, costs of compliance could
be material.

     The EPA indicated that it is considering  enforcement  action against Power
under its  Prevention of Significant  Deterioration  (PSD) rules relating to the
construction  that  is  currently  in  progress  for  Bergen  2,  scheduled  for
operations in 2002. The EPA had maintained that PSD  requirements are applicable
to  Bergen  2,  thereby  requiring  Power  to  obtain  a  permit  prior  to  the
commencement  of  construction.  To obtain  such a  permit,  an  applicant  must
demonstrate  that the  additional  emission  source  will not cause  significant
deterioration of the air shed in the vicinity of the plant. The time required to
obtain such a permit is estimated at 6-12 months. Power vigorously disputes that
PSD requirements are applicable to Bergen 2 and is continuing construction.  The
NJDEP has  informally  indicated it agrees with Power's  position,  but has also
advised that the ultimate  authority to decide PSD applicability  rests with the
EPA.  Discussions to resolve this matter are underway with the EPA and NJDEP. At
September  30,  2001,  Power had  expended  approximately  $210  million  in the
construction of Bergen 2.

Guaranteed Obligations

     Energy Holdings,  PSEG Global Inc. (Global),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Energy  Holdings,  and/or PSEG have guaranteed  certain  obligations of Global's
affiliates,   including  the   successful   completion,   performance  or  other
obligations  related to  certain  of the  projects,  in an  aggregate  amount of
approximately  $238 million as of September 30, 2001. A  substantial  portion of
such  guarantees is eliminated upon successful  completion,  performance  and/or
refinancing of construction debt with non-recourse project debt.

Note 6.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     PSEG's  operations  give rise to exposure to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and securities
prices. PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments for the purpose
of managing market risk consistent with its business plans and prudent  business
practices.

Energy Trading and Related Contracts

     Power   routinely   enters  into  exchange   traded   futures  and  options
transactions  for  electricity  and  natural  gas as part of  wholesale  trading
operations. Generally,  exchange-traded futures contracts require the deposit of
cash for  margins,  the  amount of which is  subject  to change  based on market
movement  and in  accordance  with  exchange  rules.  The  amount of the  margin
requirements  at September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was  approximately  $2
million and $1 million, respectively.

     Power's energy trading and related contracts have been marked to market and
gains and losses  from such  contracts  were  recorded  in  earnings,  including
unrealized  losses of $10.6  million  and $4.6  million for the quarter and nine
months ended  September  30, 2001,  respectively  and a unrealized  loss of $0.2
million and a unrealized  gain of $47.6  million for the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2000, respectively.  The losses in 2001 are primarily due to
significant drops in gas prices in the third quarter of 2001.

     The  fair  value of the  energy  trading  and  related  contracts  that are
marked-to-market are based on management's best estimates using over-the-counter
quotations, exchange prices, volatility factors and other valuation methodology.
The estimates  presented  herein are not  necessarily  indicative of the amounts
that Power could  realize in a current  market  exchange.  The fair values as of
September  30, 2001 and  December  31, 2000 and the average  fair values for the
periods  then  ended of Power's  significant  financial  instruments  related to
energy commodities are summarized in the following table:

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     Power and PSE&G also hold and issue  commodity  and  financial  instruments
that  reduce  exposure  to price  fluctuations  from  factors  such as  weather,
environmental policies,  changes in demand, changes in supply, state and Federal
regulatory policies and other events.  Power's instruments,  in conjunction with
owned electric generating  capacity  contracts,  are designed to cover estimated
electric  supply  commitments  and gas  requirements  for  electric  generation.
PSE&G's  instruments,  in conjunction  with physical gas supply  contracts,  are
designed  to cover  estimated  gas  customer  commitments.  Power  and PSE&G use
futures,  forwards,  swaps and options to manage and hedge price risk related to
these market exposures.

     As of September 30, 2001, Power had entered into electric  physical forward
contracts and gas futures and swaps to hedge its forecasted BGS requirements and
gas purchases requirements for generation,  with a maximum term of approximately
one year, which qualified for hedge  accounting  treatment under SFAS 133. These
commodity and financial  instruments are marked-to-market  based on management's
best estimates using over-the-counter  quotations,  exchange prices,  volatility
factors and other  valuation  methodology.  For the quarter ended  September 30,
2001, the total negative mark-to-market valuation of $34 million was recorded as
a  derivative  asset  offset by OCI and  deferred  taxes of $20  million and $14
million, respectively. The increase in the derivative asset was primarily due to
the dramatic decrease in natural gas prices.

     Also as of  September  30,  2001,  PSE&G had entered  into 349 MMBTU of gas
futures, options and swaps to hedge forecasted requirements. As of September 30,
2001, the fair value of those instruments was $(196) million with a maximum term
of  approximately  one  year.  PSE&G  utilizes  derivatives  to  hedge  its  gas
purchasing  activities  which,  when  realized,   are  recoverable  through  its
Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC). Accordingly, the offset to the change in
fair value of these derivatives is specified as a regulatory asset or liability.

     Interest Rates

     In February 2001, Power entered into various  forward-interest  rate swaps,
with an aggregate  notional  amount of $400 million,  to hedge the interest rate
risk  related to the  anticipated  issuance of debt.  On April 11,  2001,  Power
issued  $1.8  billion in  fixed-rate  Senior  Notes and  closed out the  forward
starting  interest rate swaps.  The aggregate  loss, net of tax, of $3.2 million
was classified as Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss and is being amortized
and charged to interest expense over the life of the debt.

     In  October  2001,  Power  entered  into two  interest  rate  swaps with an
aggregate  notional amount of $177.5 million to hedge its variable interest rate
loan related to the  construction  of its Waterford,  Ohio  facility.  The swaps
qualify for hedge accounting  treatment under SFAS 133 and will be recorded on
the balance  sheet at fair value with  changes in the  effective  portion of the
swap to be recorded in OCI.

     Transition Funding has entered into an interest rate swap on its sole class
of floating rate transition bonds. The notional amount of the interest rate swap
is  approximately  $497  million.  The  interest  rate  swap is  indexed  to the
three-month   LIBOR  rate.  The  fair  value  of  the  interest  rate  swap  was
approximately  $(32.0)  million as of  September  30, 2001 and was recorded as a
derivative  liability,  with an offsetting amount recorded as a regulatory asset
on the Consolidated  Balance Sheets. This amount will vary over time as a result
of changes in market conditions.

     PSEG is subject  to the risk of  fluctuating  interest  rates in the normal
course of business.  PSEG's  policy is to manage  interest rate risk through the
use of fixed rate debt,  floating  rate debt,  interest  rate swaps and interest
rate lock  agreements.  As of September 30, 2001, a  hypothetical  10% change in
market  interest rates would result in a $11 million  change in annual  interest
costs related to short-term and floating rate debt at PSEG and its subsidiaries.

Equity Securities

     PSEG  Resources  Inc.  (Resources),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Energy
Holdings,  has  investments  in  equity  securities  and  limited  partnerships.
Resources carries its investments in equity securities at their approximate fair
value  as of the  reporting  date.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value of these
investments  is  affected  by  changes  in the  fair  value  of  the  underlying
securities.  Fair value is  determined  by  adjusting  the  market  value of the
securities for liquidity and market volatility factors,  where appropriate.  The
aggregate fair values of such  investments  which had available market prices at
September  30, 2001 and  December  31,  2000 were $27 million and $115  million,
respectively.  The decrease in the recorded  amount of investments was primarily
due to the sale of  Resources'  interest in equity  securities  which had a fair
value of $66 million on  December  31,  2000 and a decline in the  valuation  of
publicly  traded equity  securities  held within its limited  partnerships.  The
potential  change in fair  value  resulting  from a  hypothetical  10% change in
quoted market prices of these investments  amounted to $2 million and $9 million
at September 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.

     In  August  2001,  Resources  received  $30  million  from  the sale of its
interest in an equity security within its leveraged buyout fund which had a book
value of $31 million.

Foreign Currencies

     As of September 30, 2001,  Global and Resources had assets  located or held
in international  locations of approximately  $3.014 billion and $1.406 billion,
respectively.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets  located  in  the  Australia,   Austria,  Belgium,  China,  Germany,  the
Netherlands,  the  United  Kingdom  and New  Zealand  with  associated  revenues
denominated  in U.S.  dollars  ($US),  and  therefore,  not  subject  to foreign
currency risk.

     Global's international investments are primarily in companies that generate
or distribute  electricity in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  India, Italy,
Oman,  Peru,  Poland,  Taiwan,  Tunisia  and  Venezuela.  Investing  in  foreign
countries involves certain additional risks.  Economic conditions that result in
higher  comparative rates of inflation in foreign countries are likely to result
in declining  values in such  countries'  currencies.  As  currencies  fluctuate
against  the U.S.  dollar  ($US),  there is a  corresponding  change in Global's
investment value in terms of the $US. Such change is reflected as an increase or
decrease in the investment  value and OCI. As of September 30, 2001, net foreign
currency   devaluations  have  reduced  the  reported  amount  of  PSEG's  total
stockholder's  equity  by  $278  million  (after-tax),  of  which  $190  million
(after-tax) of which was caused by the devaluation of the Brazilian Real.

Credit Risk

     Recent  events in the  California  energy  markets  affected  Pacific Gas &
Electric  Company  (PG&E),  one of the state's largest  utilities,  and resulted
starting on  February  1, 2001 in PG&E's  failure to pay the full amount due for
energy  delivered by three of Global's  project  affiliates:  GWF Power Systems,
L.P. (GWF),  Hanford L.P. (Hanford) and Thermal Energy Development  Partnership,
L.P.  (Tracy),  in late 2000 and early 2001. On March 27, 2001,  the  California
Public Utilities  Commission (CPUC) approved a substantial  increase in electric
retail rates and directed the state's  electric  utilities,  including  PG&E, to
make payment to suppliers for current energy deliveries.  On April 6, 2001, PG&E
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code asserting that
such  rate  increase  was  insufficient  to meet its  obligations  under  energy
purchase agreements. Amounts due to Global's project affiliates from PG&E at the
time  of its  bankruptcy  filing  (pre-petition  payables)  remain  outstanding.
However,  PG&E has subsequently paid, on a timely basis, the appropriate amounts
due to Global's project affiliates for power deliveries commencing April 6, 2001
(post-petition  payables) in compliance  with the CPUC order.  On June 13, 2001,
the CPUC issued an order  declaring as reasonable and prudent any amendment to a
power purchase agreement with eligible qualifying  facilities that conformed the
energy price to a certain  fixed-price  for a five-year term. In July 2001, GWF,
Hanford and Tracy entered into an agreement with PG&E (Agreement) and amendments
to their power  purchase  agreements  with PG&E that contained the CPUC approved
pricing for a term of five years  commencing  July 16, 2001.  In addition,  PG&E
agreed to assume  GWF's,  Hanford's and Tracy's power  purchase  agreements  and
elevate the outstanding pre-petition payables to administrative priority status.
The Agreement provides that the pre-petition  payables and interest thereon will
be  paid  pursuant  to  PG&E's  plan of  reorganization.  The  Bankruptcy  Court
subsequently  approved  the  Agreement,  the  amendments  to the power  purchase
agreements and the assumption of the contracts.

     As of June 30,  2001,  GWF,  Hanford  and Tracy had  combined  pre-petition
receivables  due from  PG&E,  for all  plants  amounting  to  approximately  $62
million.  Of this  amount,  approximately  $25 million  had been  reserved as an
allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  resulting  in a net  receivable  balance  of
approximately $37 million.  Global's pro-rata share of this gross receivable and
net receivable was approximately $30 million and $18 million, respectively.

     As of  September  30,  2001,  GWF,  Hanford  and Tracy  still had  combined
pre-petition receivables due from PG&E for all plants amounting to approximately
$62 million.  Global's pro-rata share of this receivable was $30 million. During
the third  quarter of 2001,  GWF,  Hanford  and Tracy  reversed  the $25 million
allowance for doubtful acccounts which increased operating income by $14 million
(of which Global's share was $7 million) with the remaining amount recorded as a
reserve for certain unresolved  matters.  As of September 30, 2001, GWF, Hanford
and Tracy  maintained  a reserve of $11 million (of which  Global's  share is $5
million) to reflect the amount of potential  counterclaims  alleged by PG&E. The
amounts received and the timeliness of payment are subject to legal, regulatory,
and  legislative  developments  and Energy  Holdings  cannot  predict  the final
resolution.

     Two affiliates of the California  utilities  referred to above have entered
into physical  forward and swap contracts  with PSEG Energy  Resources and Trade
(ER&T),  a  subsidiary  of Power,  for delivery in the  Pennsylvania-New  Jersey
Maryland (PJM) area. These counterparties have met their obligations to date and
are still investment  grade entities.  ER&T has entered into a limited number of
additional  contracts since May 2001 with one of these  counterparties  but none
with the other since  December  2000.  ER&T's  exposure to these  entities under
these contracts is not material and management does not believe that any reserve
is presently necessary.

</TABLE>

     The  decrease  in the  effective  tax rate for the  quarter and nine months
ended  September 30, 2001 as compared to the same periods for 2000, is primarily
due to adjustments as a result of closing the 1994-1996  audit,  upon filing our
actual  tax  returns  for the year  2000 and  Energy  Holdings'  foreign  equity
earnings which are recorded net of tax.

</TABLE>

     Basic and diluted  earnings per share of PSEG common stock  (Common  Stock)
was $0.82  for the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2001,  representing  a $0.16
increase from the comparable 2000 period.  Basic and diluted  earnings per share
of Common  Stock  were  $2.76 for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001,
representing a $0.19 increase from the comparable 2000 period.

     PSE&G's and Power's  combined  contribution to earnings per share of Common
Stock for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001,  increased $0.18
or  33%  and  decreased  $0.01  or  0.01%  from  the  comparable  2000  periods,
respectively.  The increase for the quarter was  primarily due to an $88 million
pre-tax charge to income  related to MTC recovery  recorded in the third quarter
of 2000 combined with higher trading margins and high  performance  from Power's
nuclear generation facilities. The increase for the quarter was partially offset
by the  effects  of  customers  returning  to PSE&G  in 2001  from  third  party
suppliers  (TPS) and by additional  rate  reductions  which became  effective in
2001,  which also were the primary  cause for the  decrease  for the nine months
ended September 30, 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000.

     Energy Holdings' contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for the
quarter and nine months ended  September 30, 2001 increased $0.01 and $0.24 from
the  comparable  2000  periods,  respectively,  primarily  due to earnings  from
Global's  recent  acquisitions  and interest  income  recorded on certain  notes
receivable and loans, and Resources'  higher  leveraged lease income,  partially
offset by increased interest expense, lower earnings from Global's investment in
Rio Grande Energia (RGE) and lower earnings at Energy Technologies. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2001,  Energy Holdings'  contribution to earnings per
share was also impacted by the gain on Global's  withdrawal from its interest in
the Eagle Point Cogeneration  Partnership  (Eagle Point),  partially offset by a
net decrease in the carrying value of publicly traded  securities within certain
leveraged buyout funds at Resources.

     As a result of PSEG's  stock  repurchase  program  which began in September
1998,  earnings  per share of Common Stock for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2001 increased  $0.02 and $0.08 from the comparable  2000 periods,
respectively.  A total of 24.3  million  shares  were  repurchased  at a cost of
approximately  $905 million under this program as of December 31, 2000, when the
authorization  expired.  In September 2001, the board re-authorized the purchase
of the balance of 5.7 million  shares.  As of October 31,  2001,  an  additional
600,000  shares  have  been  repurchased   under  this  program  at  a  cost  of
approximately $23.7 million.

Operating Revenues

     Electric Transmission and Distribution

     Transmission and Distribution revenues increased $44 million or 10% and $38
million or 3% for the quarter and the nine months ended  September 30, 2001 from
the comparable periods in 2000, respectively. These increases were primarily due
to warmer  weather  conditions  in the third  quarter of 2001 as compared to the
third quarter of 2000.

     Generation

     Generation  Revenues  increased  $96 million or 17% and $176 million or 11%
for the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2001 from the comparable
periods in 2000, respectively, primarily due to an $88 million pre-tax charge to
income  related to MTC recovery  recorded in the third  quarter of 2000 combined
with the  effects  of  customers  returning  to PSE&G in 2001 from  third  party
suppliers  (TPS) as wholesale  market prices have  typically  exceeded fixed BGS
rates.  As of September  30, 2001,  TPS were serving  approximately  0.4% of the
customer  load  traditionally  served by PSE&G as compared to the  September 30,
2000 level of 7.1%.  This  resulted in an increase of $33 million in BGS revenue
for the quarter ended September 30, 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000.
However,  the increased revenues resulting from this reverse migration were more
than offset by higher  energy costs  relating to the  increased  load during the
warmer summer months.  Power expects a more favorable  impact from the increased
load in the fourth quarter of 2001 when energy costs are typically  lower.  Also
contributing  to the increase for the nine months ended  September 30, 2001, was
output from new operating  generation plants placed in service subsequent to the
first quarter of 2000.  These increases were partially  offset by two additional
2% rate  reductions  PSE&G gave to customers as part of its  deregulation  plan,
effective  on February 7, 2001 and August 1, 2001  totaling  $37 million and $65
million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001,  respectively,
as compared to the same periods in 2000.  As of September  30, 2001, as required
by the Final Order,  PSE&G has had rate  reductions  totaling 9% since August 1,
1999 and will have an additional 4.9% rate reduction  effective  August 1, 2002.
These  rate  reductions  are  embedded  in the MTC rate that  PSE&G  charges  to
customers and are passed through to Power.

     Power has  contracted  with PSE&G to provide the capacity  and  electricity
necessary for the BGS obligation  through July 31, 2002. On June 29, 2001, PSE&G
and the  other  three  BPU  regulated  New  Jersey  electric  utility  companies
submitted a joint  filing to the BPU setting  forth an auction  proposal for the
provision of BGS supply  beginning August 1, 2002. Power will participate in the
BGS auction and will seek commitments on  approximately  75% of its capacity but
cannot predict the amounts of commitments received.

     Gas Distribution

     Gas Distribution  revenues decreased $8 million or 3% for the quarter ended
September  30,  2001  from the  comparable  period  in 2000  primarily  due to a
decrease in revenues from interruptible customers. Interruptible customers rates
vary  monthly.  These rates are based on oil market  prices,  and PSE&G does not
retain  margins from these  customers.  This  decrease was  partially  offset by
higher residential commodity revenues due to BPU approved rate increases.

     Gas Distribution revenues increased $360 million or 27% for the nine months
ended  September 30, 2001 from the  comparable  periods in 2000 primarily due to
higher gas rates.  Customer  rates in all classes of business have  increased in
2001 to recover a portion of the higher  natural gas costs.  The  commercial and
industrial  classes fuel  recovery  rates vary  monthly  according to the market
price of gas.  The BPU also  approved  increases  in the fuel  component  of the
residential  class  rates of 16% in  November  2000 and 2% for each  month  from
December 2000 through July 2001. These increased  revenues were offset by higher
gas distribution costs discussed below.

     PSE&G has filed  petitions  with the BPU for  authority  to revise  its gas
property depreciation rates and requesting an increase in gas base rates of $171
million  for gas  delivery  service  (Gas  Base Rate  Case).  If  approved,  the
requested  increase would result in an overall gas revenue  increase of 7.06% to
reflect current costs.  Present gas rates will remain in effect pending approval
by the BPU. PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

     Trading

     Trading revenues decreased by $64 million or 9% and $197 million or 10% for
the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 from the comparable periods
in 2000, respectively, due to lower trading volumes and lower prices as compared
to 2000.  However,  these decreased  revenues were more than offset by decreased
trading costs of $89 million (discussed below in Trading Costs). Trading margins
increased  from $13 million to $38 million and from $55 million to $124  million
for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2001, respectively,  as
compared to the same periods in 2000 due to favorable trading contracts.

     Other

     Revenues  increased  $126  million  or 68% and $166  million or 29% for the
quarter  and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001,  respectively,  from the
comparable periods in 2000.

     Revenues for quarter  ended  September  30, 2001  increased  $77 million at
Global primarily due to acquisitions and facilities becoming  operational in the
second quarter and third quarter of 2001 combined with interest income earned on
the various notes and loans  relating to Eagle Point and several other  projects
at Global,  and improvements in the operating  results of other projects.  These
increases were partially offset by lower revenues from Global's  withdrawal from
its interest in Eagle Point in January 2001 and a reduction in earnings  related
to the adverse  effect of exchange  rate changes in the  Brazilian  Real and the
continued economic slowdown in Brazil.  Revenues for the quarter ended September
30, 2001 increased $10 million at Resources  primarily due to improved  revenues
from higher  leveraged  lease income from  continued  investment by Resources in
such financing  transactions.  Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2001
increased $39 million at Energy Technologies primarily due to increased sales in
its mechanical contracting business.

     Revenues  for the nine  months  ended  September  30, 2001  increased  $132
million at Global. The increase was primarily due to acquisitions and facilities
becoming  operational  in the second  quarter and third quarter of 2001 combined
with the gain on the  withdrawal  from the  interest in Eagle Point and interest
income earned on the various notes and loans relating to Eagle Point and several
other projects and  improvements in operating  results of other projects.  These
increases  were  partially  offset by lower  revenues  attributable  to Global's
withdrawal  from its interest in Eagle Point in January 2001,  lower  management
fee  revenues  due to  recognition  of TIE  project  closing  fees in 2000 and a
reduction in earnings  related to the adverse effect of exchange rate changes in
the Real and the continued  economic  slowdown in Brazil.  Revenues for the nine
months ended September 30, 2001 increased $3 million at Resources  primarily due
to higher leveraged lease income from continued  investment by Resources in such
financing  transactions  and  increased  limited  partnership  income  which was
partially  offset by lower Net  Investment  Losses of which  resulted from a net
decrease in the  carrying  value of publicly  traded  equity  securities  within
certain leveraged buyout funds in which Resources has invested. Revenues for the
nine  months  ended   September  30,  2001   increased  $31  million  at  Energy
Technologies due to increased sales in its mechanical contracting business.

Operating Expenses

     Energy Costs

     Energy Costs  increased $123 million or 44% and $153 million or 21% for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 from the comparable  periods in
2000,  respectively,  primarily  due to  increased  load  served  under  the BGS
contract and higher fuel costs of $47 million for fossil  generation from higher
natural  gas  prices in the early part of the year.  Higher  gas  expense of $25
million due to increased MMBTU usage also contributed to the increase.

     Gas Costs

     Gas Costs  decreased $28 million or 14% for the quarter ended September 30,
2001 from the comparable period in 2000 primarily due to lower natural gas rates
in the third quarter of 2001 as compared to the same period in 2000.

     Gas Costs increased $285 million or 31% for the nine months ended September
30, 2001 from the comparable  period in 2000 primarily due to higher natural gas
costs.  Due to the Levelized Gas Adjustment  Clause,  gas costs are increased or
decreased to offset a  corresponding  increase or decrease in fuel revenues with
no impact on income.

     Trading Costs

     Trading Costs  decreased $89 million or 12% and $266 million or 13% for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 from the comparable  periods in
2000,  respectively,  primarily due to lower trading volumes and lower prices as
compared to 2000.

     Operations and Maintenance

     Operations and  Maintenance  expense  increased $102 million or 21% for the
quarter ended  September 30, 2001  primarily due to increased  acquisitions  and
commencement of operations at Global of $57 million and increased  volume of $42
million at Energy  Technologies.  Also  contributing to the increase was planned
generation outage work in the third quarter of 2001 for Power.

     Operations and Maintenance expense increased by $244 million or 17% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2001 primarily due to increased acquisitions and
commencement  of operations  at Global of $61 million and  increased  volume and
operations  of $37  million at Energy  Technologies.  Also  contributing  to the
increase  was planned  generation  outage work in the third  quarter of 2001 and
higher  expenses  relating to projects  going into  operation  subsequent to the
first quarter of 2000 for Power.

     Depreciation and Amortization

     Depreciation and Amortization expense increased $60 million or 67% and $115
million or 43% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2001 from the
comparable  2000 periods,  respectively.  The increases for the quarter and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2001 were  primarily  due to $61 million and $126
million,  respectively,  of  amortization  of the regulatory  asset recorded for
PSE&G's  stranded  costs,  which  commenced  with the issuance of the transition
bonds.  These increases were partially  offset by lower  depreciation  resulting
from various asset retirements.

     Interest Expense

     Interest  Expense  increased  $46 million or 31% and $98 million or 23% for
the quarter and nine months ended  September 30, 2001 from the  comparable  2000
periods,  respectively,  primarily  due to increased  long-term  debt to finance
various projects.

     Preferred Securities Dividend Requirements

     Preferred Securities Dividend Requirements decreased $10 million or 42% and
$13 million or 18% for the quarter and nine months ended  September 30, 2001 due
to the redemption of several series of PSE&G preferred securities in 2001.

     Income Taxes

     Income  taxes  decreased  $32 million or 38% and $78 million or 21% for the
quarter and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001 from the  comparable  2000
periods,  respectively.  These  decreases  were  primarily due  adjustments as a
result of the closing the audit for the 1994-1996 tax years, and upon filing our
actual tax return for 2000. Additionally,  Energy Holdings had a lower effective
tax due to a greater proportion of its earnings coming from foreign  operations,
which are accrued at the rate of 10% due to the incremental cost associated with
the repatriation of foreign earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     PSEG

     PSEG is a holding  company and, as such,  has no operations of its own. The
following  discussion  of  PSEG's  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  on  a
consolidated  basis,  noting the uses and  contributions  of PSEG's three direct
operating subsidiaries: PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

     Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock were $0.54 per share per  quarter  and
totaled  approximately  $112  million and $116  million for the  quarters  ended
September  30, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Dividend  payments on Common Stock
totaled  approximately  $337 million and $348 million for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Although PSEG  presently  believes it will have adequate  earnings and cash
flow in the future from its  subsidiaries  to maintain its Common Stock dividend
at the current  level,  earnings and cash flows required to support the dividend
will  become  more  volatile  as  PSEG's  business  changes  from  one  that  is
principally regulated to one that is principally  competitive.  Future dividends
declared will necessarily be dependent upon PSEG's future earnings,  cash flows,
financial requirements, alternate investment opportunities and other factors.

     In December 1999, the PSEG Board of Directors  authorized the repurchase of
up to 30  million  shares  of its  common  stock,  of which  24.3  million  were
purchased  through  December  31,  2000,  when  the  authorization  expired.  In
September  2001,  the board  re-authorized  the  purchase  of the balance of 5.7
million shares.

     PSE&G

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed   securities)   were   issued  by  PSE&G   Transition   Funding   LLC,  a
bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned subsidiary of PSE&G. PSE&G also received payment
from Power on its $2.786 billion Promissory Note used to finance the transfer of
PSE&G's  generation  business to Power in August 2000.  The proceeds  from these
transactions  were used to pay for certain debt  issuance and related  costs for
securitization,  redeem a portion of PSE&G's outstanding short-term debt, reduce
PSE&G common equity by $2.265 billion,  loan funds to PSEG of $1.084 billion and
make  various  short-term  investments.  These funds are expected to be used for
further debt and/or equity  reductions in 2001 including payment of maturing and
certain  redeemable  securities.  Any  inability to obtain  required  additional
external  capital  or  to  extend  or  replace  maturing  debt  and/or  existing
agreements at current  levels and  reasonable  interest rates may affect PSE&G's
financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

     Cash  generated  from PSE&G's  transmission  and  distribution  business is
expected to provide the majority of the funds for PSE&G's business needs.  Since
1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash  payments to PSEG in the form of dividends on
outstanding shares of PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G paid common stock dividends of
$112 million and $450 million to PSEG for the nine months  ended  September  30,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Power

     In 2000, Power financed the transfer of the generation  business from PSE&G
through the issuance of a $2.786 billion  promissory  note. On January 31, 2001,
through $1.2 billion of equity  infusions  and $1.62 billion of loans from PSEG,
Power repaid this note to PSE&G. In April 2001, Power issued $1.8 billion of its
Senior Notes in a private  placement,  the proceeds of which were used primarily
to replace its interim  financing  from PSEG. It is expected that Power's future
capital  needs will be funded with cash  generated  from  operations  and may be
supplemented  with external  financings,  equity  infusions  from PSEG and other
project  financing  alternatives  as dictated by Power's  growth  strategy.  Any
inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace
maturing  debt  and/or  existing  agreements  at current  levels and  reasonable
interest rates may affect Power's financial condition, results of operations and
net cash flows.

     Energy Holdings

     It is intended that Global and Resources will provide the earnings and cash
flow for Energy Holdings' long-term growth.  Resources' investments are designed
to  produce  immediate  cash flow and  earnings  that  enable  Global and Energy
Technologies to focus on longer investment horizons. During the next five years,
Energy Holdings will need  significant  capital to fund its planned  growth.  In
addition to cash  generated from  operations,  Energy  Holdings'  growth will be
funded through external financings and equity infusions from PSEG.

     Over the next  several  years,  Energy  Holdings,  certain  of its  project
affiliates  and PSEG  Capital  Corporation  (PSEG  Capital)  will be required to
refinance  maturing  debt,  incur  additional  debt and  provide  equity to fund
investment  activity.  Any  inability  to obtain  required  additional  external
capital or to extend or replace  maturing  debt and/or  existing  agreements  at
current  levels  and  reasonable  interest  rates may  affect  Energy  Holdings'
financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Capital Requirements

     PSE&G

     PSE&G  has  substantial  commitments  as part of its  ongoing  construction
programs. These programs are continuously reviewed and periodically revised as a
result of changes in  economic  conditions,  revised  load  forecasts,  business
strategies,   site  changes,  cost  escalations  under  construction  contracts,
requirements  of regulatory  authorities  and laws,  the timing of and amount of
electric and gas transmission  and/or  distribution rate changes and the ability
of PSE&G to raise necessary capital.

     Construction   expenditures   are  related  to   improvements   in  PSE&G's
transmission and distribution system, gas system and common facilities.  For the
nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  PSE&G had
net plant  additions of $269 million and $280 million,  excluding  Allowance for
Funds Used During Construction (AFDC).

     Power

     Construction  expenditures  were  related  to  acquisitions  by  Power  and
improvements in Power's existing power plants. Power had net plant additions for
the nine months ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of $1.2 billion
and $0.3 million,  excluding  capitalized  interest.  The expenditures  were for
developing  the 1,150 MW  Lawrenceburg,  Indiana site and the 850 MW  Waterford,
Ohio site and adding  capacity to its  Bergen,  Linden,  Burlington,  and Kearny
stations in New Jersey.  Changes in  environmental  regulations  and  unexpected
impacts of existing  regulations  could  impact both  Power's  construction  and
growth  strategy  as  well  as its  capital  expenditure  amounts.  For  further
information,  including New Source Review and PSD requirements under the Federal
Clean Air Act (CAA), see Note. 5. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     For a discussion of Power's pending asset purchases and  developments,  see
Note 5. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

     Energy Holdings

     Energy  Holdings  plans to  continue  the growth of Global  and  Resources.
Energy Holdings will assess the growth  prospects and  opportunities  for Energy
Technologies'  business  before  committing  substantial  amounts of  additional
capital.  For the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001,  Energy  Holdings'
subsidiaries made net investments totaling  approximately $1.311 billion.  These
net  investments  included  leveraged  lease  investments  of  $442  million  by
Resources and net  investments of $871 million by Global,  primarily  related to
the acquisition of Sociedad Austral de Electricidad S.A. (SAESA) and incremental
investments in certain existing  generation and distribution  projects including
those in operation and currently under  construction  and loans to TIE.  Factors
affecting actual  expenditures and investments  include  availability of capital
and suitable investment opportunities, market volatility and economic trends.

     For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, PSEG invested $400 million of
additional  equity in Energy  Holdings,  the proceeds of which were used to fund
additional investments at Global.

     For a discussion of Global's pending  investments,  see Note 5. Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities of Notes.

External Financings

     PSEG

     At September 30, 2001, PSEG had a committed $150 million  revolving  credit
facility which will expire in December  2002. At September 30, 2001,  there were
no borrowings under this revolving  credit facility.  In 1999, PSEG entered into
an uncommitted line of credit with a bank with no stated limit. At September 30,
2001, PSEG had $149 million outstanding under this line of credit.

     PSEG has an $850  million  commercial  paper  program to provide  funds for
general corporate purposes.  On September 30, 2001, PSEG had commercial paper of
$425 million outstanding under this program.

     To provide back up liquidity for its commercial  paper program,  PSEG has a
$570 million revolving credit facility expiring in March 2002 and a $280 million
revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2005.  These  agreements are with
groups of banks and provide for borrowings with maturities up to one year. As of
September 30, 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

     PSE&G

     Under its Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
against  previous  additions and  improvements  and/or  retired  Mortgage  Bonds
provided  that its ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  calculated in accordance
with its  Mortgage is at least 2:1. At  September  30,  2001,  PSE&G's  Mortgage
coverage  ratio was 3:1. As of September 30, 2001,  the Mortgage would permit up
to $1 billion  aggregate  principal  amount of new  Mortgage  Bonds to be issued
against previous  additions and improvements.  In addition to the refinancing of
existing  long-term  debt  authorized by the BPU in the Final Order,  PSE&G will
need to  obtain  BPU  authorization  to issue  any  incremental  debt  financing
necessary for its capital  program.  The BPU has authorized PSE&G to issue up to
$1 billion of long-term  debt on the basis of  previously  matured,  redeemed or
purchased debt through December 31, 2001, of which $590 million has been issued.

     As   discussed   previously,   on  January  31,  2001,   transition   bonds
(non-recourse  asset  backed  securities)  in the amount of $2.525  billion were
issued by Transition  Funding,  in eight classes with maturities  ranging from 1
year to 15 years.

     In March  2001,  PSE&G  reduced the maximum  size of its  commercial  paper
program from $1.5 billion to $900 million. To provide back up liquidity for this
program,  PSE&G maintains $900 million in revolving credit  facilities,  each of
which expire in June 2002.  As of September  30, 2001,  there were no borrowings
outstanding under these facilities.  In addition,  PSE&G has an uncommitted line
of credit with a bank.  As of September 30, 2001,  PSE&G had no short-term  debt
outstanding, and no borrowings against its uncommitted line of credit.

     Also in March 2001, PSE&G redeemed all of its $150 million of 9.375% Series
A cumulative  monthly  income  preferred  securities,  all of its $75 million of
5.97% preferred  stock, $15 million of its 6.75% preferred stock and $52 million
of its floating  rate notes due December 7, 2002. In June 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed
the remaining  $248 million  outstanding  of floating rate notes due December 7,
2002.

     In June 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed all of its $208  million of 8.625%  Series A
cumulative quarterly income preferred securities.

     On November 1, 2001, $100 million of Mortgage Bonds, Series FF matured.

     Power

     In April 2001, Power, in a private placement, issued $500 million of 6.875%
Senior  Notes due 2006,  $800  million of 7.75%  Senior  Notes due 2011 and $500
million of 8.625%  Senior Notes due 2031.  The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were used  primarily  for the  repayment of loans from PSEG,  which
were provided to finance Power's purchase of PSE&G's generation business.  Power
filed a  registration  statement with the SEC relating to an exchange offer for,
or the resale of, these Senior Notes on October 5, 2001.

     Power  obtains any  required  short term  funding  through  loans from PSEG
through PSEG's credit  facilities.  As of September 30, 2001,  letters of credit
were issued in the amount of approximately $60 million.

     Energy Holdings

     On September 30, 2001,  Energy Holdings had two separate  senior  revolving
credit facilities with a syndicate of banks; a $495 million five-year  revolving
credit and letter of credit facility and a $200 million 364-day revolving credit
facility.  The five-year  facility also permits up to $250 million of letters of
credit to be issued of which $91 million are  outstanding  as of  September  30,
2001. The 364-day facility and the five-year facility mature in May 2002 and May
2004,  respectively.  On September 30, 2001,  Energy Holdings had an outstanding
balance of $200 million under its existing revolving credit facilities.

     In March 2001, $160 million of non-recourse  bank debt originally  incurred
to fund a portion of the  purchase  price of  Global's  interest  in  Chilquinta
Energia,  S.A. was  refinanced.  The private  placement  offering by  Chilquinta
Energia Finance Co. LLC, a Global  affiliate,  of senior notes was structured in
two tranches: $60 million due 2008 at an interest rate of 6.47% and $100 million
due 2011 at an  interest  rate of 6.62%.  An  extraordinary  loss of $2  million
(after-tax)  was recorded in connection with the refinancing of the $160 million
non-recourse bank debt.

     In  July  2001,  Energy  Holdings  received  the  proceeds  from a  private
placement of $550 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2011.  The net proceeds were
used for the repayment of short-term debt  outstanding from  intercompany  loans
and borrowings under Energy Holdings' revolving credit facilities. The remaining
proceeds were used for general  corporate  purposes.  In September 2001,  Energy
Holdings  filed a  registration  statement  with the SEC relating to an exchange
offer for, or the resale of, these Senior Notes.  The exchange offer is expected
to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2001.

     In September 2001, Energy Holdings filed a registration  statement with the
SEC  relating  to an exchange  offer for, or the resale of, the $400  million of
8.625% Senior Notes due 2008 sold in February 2001. The exchange offer for these
notes is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2001.

     In October 2001, Energy Holdings obtained an uncommitted  credit line of up
to $100 million from a single  financial  institution,  which can be accessed as
market  conditions  warrant.

     In October  2001,  $135  million of 6.74%  medium term notes (MTN)  matured
under the PSEG  Capital  MTN  program  and were  refinanced  with funds from the
issuance of short-term debt at Energy Holdings.

     Also in October 2001,  PSEG Chile  Holdings,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Global and a $US  functional  currency  entity closed on $150 million of project
financing related to its investment in SAESA, a Chilean Peso functional currency
entity.  The debt is variable  and is based on LIBOR.  In  connection  with this
project financing, PSEG Chile Holdings entered into two foreign currency forward
exchange  contracts  with a  total  notional  amount  of $150  million.  The two
contracts  were  entered  into to hedge the peso/US  dollar  exposure on the net
investment. This transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under SFAS 133.

     Regulatory Matters

     Capital  resources  and  investment  requirements  may be  affected  by the
outcome of the  proceedings  being  conducted  by the BPU pursuant to its Energy
Master Plan and the New Jersey  Electric  Discount  and Energy  Competition  Act
(Energy  Competition  Act)  and  the  requirements  of the  1992  Focused  Audit
conducted by the BPU, of the impact of PSEG's non-utility  businesses,  owned by
Energy Holdings,  on PSE&G. As a result of the Focused Audit, the BPU approved a
plan which, among other things, provides that:

     (1)  PSEG will not permit  Energy  Holdings'  investments  to exceed 20% of
          PSEG's consolidated assets without prior notice to the BPU;

     (2)  PSEG  will  (a)  limit  debt   supported  by  the  minimum  net  worth
          maintenance  agreement  between  PSEG and PSEG Capital to $650 million
          and (b) make a good-faith  effort to eliminate such support over a six
          to ten year period from May 1993; and

     (3)  Energy  Holdings will pay PSE&G an affiliation fee of up to $2 million
          a year.

     In its Final Order  requiring  PSE&G to transfer its  generation  assets to
Power,  the BPU noted that, due to  significant  changes in the industry and, in
particular,  PSEG's  corporate  structure  as  a  result  of  the  Final  Order,
modifications  to or relief  from the Focused  Audit  order might be  warranted.
PSE&G must make a filing in the first quarter of 2002 to address the  provisions
of the Focused  Audit in light of the Final Order.  PSEG  believes  that the BPU
order issued in 1986 with respect to formation of PSEG (Holding  Company Order),
the Final Order and Energy  Competition Act provide the  appropriate  regulatory
framework in the restructured  electric and gas markets, and that the provisions
of the Focused  Audit,  if applicable,  will not adversely  affect its financial
condition,  results of operations or net cash flows. Regulatory oversight by the
BPU to assure  that  there is no harm to  utility  ratepayers  from  non-utility
investments  is  expected  to  continue  under the  Holding  Company  Order.  At
September 30, 2001,  Energy  Holdings' assets were  approximately  28% of PSEG's
consolidated assets and PSEG Capital debt amounted to $615 million.

     In addition,  if PSEG were no longer to be exempt under the Public  Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA),  PSEG and its subsidiaries would be subject
to  additional  regulation  by the SEC with respect to financing  and  investing
activities,  including  the amount  and type of  non-utility  investments.  PSEG
believes  that this would not have a material  adverse  effect on its  financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Accounting Matters

     For a discussion of EITF 99-19, SFAS 133 and related DIG issues,  SFAS 141,
SFAS 142,  SFAS 143 and SFAS 144, see Note 2.  Accounting  Matters,  and Note 6.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management.

Foreign Operations

     As of September 30, 2001,  Global and Resources  had  approximately  $3.014
billion  and  $1.406  billion,  respectively,  of  international  assets.  As of
September 30, 2001, foreign assets represented 18% of PSEG's consolidated assets
and the revenues related to those foreign assets contributed approximately 3% to
consolidated  revenues  for the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2001.  For
discussion of foreign currency risk, see Note 6. Financial  Instruments and Risk
Management of Notes.

     As of September  30,  2001,  approximately  $2.207  billion or 9% of PSEG's
assets were invested in Latin America, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile,
Peru and Venezuela.  The Argentine  economy has been in a state of recession for
approximately  three  years.  Continued  deficit  spending  in the 23  Argentine
provinces  coupled  with low  growth  and high  unemployment  have  caused  much
speculation  in the ability of the country to service and refinance $130 billion
of debt over the next several years. The Argentine  situation has contributed to
downward  pressure on the Brazilian and Chilean  currencies.  The Brazilian Real
has devalued approximately 41% since year-end 2000 from 1.9510 to $1US to 2.7631
to $1US as of September 30, 2001 and the Chilean Peso has devalued approximately
25% since  year-end  2000 from 573.90 to $1US to 720.82 to $1US as of  September
30, 2001. The Argentine  currency  remains pegged at 1 peso to $1US though there
has been much speculation as to whether or not the peg will hold. Recent actions
by the current Argentine  administration  provide for a more favorable  exchange
rate  for  exporters,  which  has  continued  to fuel the  speculation  that the
currency  peg may not  hold.  In  addition,  the  Argentine  administration  cut
spending to balance its budget by year-end 2001 to improve  financial  stability
in the region.

     In  Argentina,   the   electricity  law  provides  for  a  pass-through  of
devaluation to the end user customer. Customers' bills are first computed in the
$US and  converted  into the peso for billing.  This implies that a  devaluation
will not impact  the level of $US  revenues  an  electric  distribution  company
receives.  Energy Holdings' faces exposure as a result of secondary impacts of a
devaluation on the overall economy, which could follow many different scenarios.
In  addition,   Energy  Holdings'  share  of  $US  operating   company  debt  is
approximately  $118 million.  This is of concern  because such debt becomes more
costly  to  service  with  a  devaluation,  and  the  immediate  impact  of  the
devaluation  must be recorded  through the income  statement  as the $US debt is
revalued  into the local  currency.  Additionally,  upon  devaluation,  Global's
operating companies in the region may be exposed to increased collection risk.

     The  Brazilian  distribution  company in which  Global has a 32%  interest,
entered into a $190 million $US denominated loan, of which Global's share is $62
million.  The functional  currency of the distribution  company is the Brazilian
Real. Therefore, its debt is subject to exchange rate risk as the Brazilian Real
fluctuates with the $US. Changes in the exchange rate cause the loan amount,  as
reported in the functional  currency,  to be marked upward or downward,  with an
offset to the income statement.

     In  Chile,  the  operating   performance  of  Energy  Holdings'  assets  is
offsetting the impact of the weakening currency in relation to the $US.

     PSEG cannot predict if and when currencies  will fluctuate  against the $US
or  changes  in  economic  situations  in the  operating  companies  in which it
invests.  However,  the impact of these  changes  could cause  material  adverse
effects to Energy Holdings' financial condition,  results of operations,  or net
cash  flows.  For  further  discussion  of foreign  currency  risk,  see Note 6.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management of Notes.

Business Environment

     PSEG is currently evaluating the economic consequences of the September 11,
2001  terrorist  attacks  on the  United  States  and  subsequent  developments,
particularly their impact on accelerating the continued economic slowdown in the
United  States and  worldwide.  The  consequences  of a prolonged  recession may
include  continued  uncertainty  of energy  prices and the capital and commodity
markets, the continued weakening of certain Latin American currencies, including
the Brazilian  Real and the Chilean  Peso,  lower energy prices in power markets
and further  credit rating  downgrades of certain  airlines in the United States
and worldwide.  As of September 30, 2001,  $2.207 billion or 9% of PSEG's assets
were invested in Latin America,  specifically in Brazil, Argentina,  Chile, Peru
and  Venezuela  and $196  million  or 1% of  PSEG's  assets  were  comprised  of
leveraged leases of sixteen aircraft leased to six separate lessees. PSEG cannot
predict  the impact of any further  currency  devaluations,  continued  economic
slowdown,  fluctuating  energy prices,  and potential  lessee payment  defaults;
however,  such  impact  could have a material  adverse  effect on its  financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market risk inherent in PSEG's market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions  is the  potential  loss  arising  from  adverse  changes in commodity
prices,  pollution credits,  equity security prices,  interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates as discussed below.  PSEG's policy is to use derivatives
to manage risk  consistent with its business plans and prudent  practices.  PSEG
has a Risk Management  Committee  comprised of executive officers which utilizes
an  independent  risk  oversight  function to ensure  compliance  with corporate
policies and prudent risk management practices.

     PSEG is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event of  non-performance  or
non-payment by  counterparties.  PSEG also has a credit management process which
is used to assess,  monitor and mitigate  counterparty exposure for PSEG and its
subsidiaries.  In  the  event  of  non-performance  or  non-payment  by a  major
counterparty,  there  may  be a  material  adverse  impact  on  PSEG's  and  its
subsidiaries' financial condition,  results of operations or net cash flows. For
discussion of interest rates, commodity-related instruments,  equity securities,
credit risks and foreign currency risks,  see Note 6. Financial  Instruments and
Risk Management.

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand and state and Federal  regulatory  policies.  To reduce  price
risk caused by market  fluctuations,  PSEG's  subsidiaries enter into derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties,  to hedge anticipated  demand.  These contracts,  in conjunction
with owned electric generating  capacity and physical gas supply contracts,  are
designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer commitments.

     PSEG uses a value-at-risk  model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load  requirements,  physical  and  financial  contracts.  Value-at-risk
represents  the potential  gains or losses for  instruments or portfolios due to
changes in market  factors,  for a specified time period and  confidence  level.
PSEG estimates  value-at-risk  across its commodity  business using a model with
historical volatilities and correlations.

     The measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95%
confidence  level  over a  one-week  time  horizon  at  September  30,  2001 was
approximately  $11  million,  compared  to the  December  31,  2000 level of $19
million. PSEG's calculated value-at-risk represents an estimate of the potential
change  in the value of its  portfolio  of  physical  and  financial  derivative
instruments.  These estimates, however, are not necessarily indicative of actual
results,  which may differ due to the fact that actual market rate  fluctuations
may differ from forecasted  fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio
of hedging instruments may change over the holding period.

                            ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

     Certain  information  reported under PSEG's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2001 and June
30, 2001 is updated below.  References are to the related pages on the Form 10-K
and Forms 10-Q as printed and distributed.

     Electric Operation and Supply

     Form 10-K,  page 3. PSE&G has contracted with Power to provide the capacity
and electricity  necessary for the BGS obligation through July 31, 2002. On June
29, 2001 PSE&G and the other three BPU  regulated  New Jersey  electric  utility
companies  submitted a joint filing to the BPU setting forth an auction proposal
for the  provision of BGS supply  beginning  August 1, 2002.  In addition,  each
company also filed specific contingency plans and accounting information.

     Gas Contract Transfer

     Form 10-K,  page 12. On March 16, 2001, the New Jersey  Ratepayer  Advocate
(RPA)  filed a motion to  dismiss  this case.  The motion is pending  before the
Administrative Law Judge. A settlement meeting on a Stipulation of Settlement by
PSE&G and several  parties was  conducted  with the BPU staff on July 24,  2001.
PSE&G submitted a settlement agreement. PSE&G agreed to modify its proposals and
an oral agreement with the BPU staff has been reached.  However, the RPA opposes
PSE&G's  proposal.  The RPA filed its  comments on October 31, 2001 and the case
was returned to the BPU for resolution.

     FERC RTO Orders

     Form 10-K, page 14. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission  (FERC), in a
series  of orders  issued  on July 11,  2000 and July 12,  2000  called  for the
creation of four large regional transmission  organizations (RTOs) to facilitate
competitive  regional  markets in the U.S.  FERC  rejected  several  smaller RTO
proposals and directed  transmission  owners and  independent  system  operators
(ISOs) to combine into much larger RTOs,  dramatically  altering  their proposed
geographic size and configuration.

     In the Northeast region, FERC conditionally  approved the  Pennsylvania-New
Jersey  Maryland  (PJM) RTO  proposal  (subject  to  several  modifications  and
compliance  filings)  and  rejected  the New York ISO and  ISO-New  England  RTO
proposals.  FERC directed that the three existing ISOs for PJM, New York and New
England,  as well as the systems  involved in PJM West, form a single  Northeast
RTO, based on the "PJM platform" and "best  practices" of all three ISO's,  FERC
directed  that  the  parties  in the  region  engage  in  mediation  (with  FERC
oversight) to prepare a proposal and timetable for the merger of the ISOs into a
single RTO. At the end of the 45-day mediation period,  the  Administrative  Law
Judge  assigned  to the  matter  submitted  a report to the  Commission  with an
attached  business plan for  implementation of the single northeast RTO possibly
as  soon  as the  fourth  quarter  of  2003.  Numerous  details  must  still  be
negotiated.

     PSEG believes that  wholesale and retail  customers,  as well as lower-cost
generation  providers  should  benefit  from  having  better  access to a larger
regional  market.  While the impact on PSEG is uncertain  because specific rules
will not be  known  for some  time,  the  elimination  of seams  issues  and the
creation of a single wholesale market in the Northeast is generally  expected to
have a positive impact on PSEG. The goal of the mediation  process is to develop
a business plan and milestones for the creation and implementation of the single
northeast RTO.

     Gas Base Rate Filings

     June 30,  2001 Form 10-Q,  page 19. On May 4, 2001,  PSE&G filed a petition
with  the BPU for  authority  to  revise  its gas  property  depreciation  rates
(Depreciation  Case). In this filing, PSE&G requested authority to implement its
proposed  depreciation  rates  simultaneously  for book purposes and  ratemaking
purposes when the BPU implements new tariffs  designed to recover the additional
annual  revenues  resulting from the gas base rate case discussed  below. On May
25, 2001, PSE&G filed a petition with the BPU requesting an increase in gas base
rates of $171  million  for gas  delivery  service  (Gas  Base  Rate  Case).  If
approved, the requested increase would result in an overall gas revenue increase
of 7.06% to reflect  current  costs.  Present  gas rates  will  remain in effect
pending  approval by the BPU. PSE&G believes that the current gas base rates, in
effect since November 1991, do not reasonably  reflect  capital  investments and
other costs  required to maintain  the gas utility  infrastructure.  The BPU has
consolidated the  Depreciation  Case and the Gas Base Rate Case. All hearings in
the case were completed in October 2001.

     License Renewals

     Form 10-K page 5.  Exelon,  co-owner  and  operator  of Peach  Bottom,  has
informed PSEG that on July 3, 2001 an  application  was submitted to the Nuclear
Regulatory  Commission  (NRC) to renew the  operating  licenses for Peach Bottom
Units 2 and 3. If approved,  the current licenses would be extended by 20 years,
to 2033 and 2034 for Units 2 and 3  respectively.  NRC review of the application
is expected to take approximately two years.

     Form 10-K, page 18. The New Jersey  Department of Environmental  Protection
(NJDEP) issued a final New Jersey Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System permit
(Permit) for Salem on June 29, 2001,  with an effective  date of August 1, 2001,
allowing for the  continued  operation of Salem with its existing  cooling water
system.  The time allotted for anyone to request a hearing to contest the permit
has expired, and the NJDEP has advised that it has received no requests for such
a hearing.  This Permit renews Salem's  variance from  applicable  thermal water
quality  standards  under  Section  316(a) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA),
determines  that  the  existing  intake  structure  represents  best  technology
available  under Section  316(b) of the CWA,  requires that Nuclear  continue to
implement the wetlands  restoration and fish ladder programs  established  under
the 1994 permit and imposes  requirements  for  additional  analyses of data and
studies to determine if other intake  technologies are available for application
at Salem that are  biologically  effective.  The Permit also requires Nuclear to
install  up to two  additional  fish  ladders  in New  Jersey and fund an escrow
account in the amount of $500,000 for the  construction  of artificial  reefs by
NJDEP. The Permit's expiration date is July 31, 2006.

     Nuclear also reached an agreement  settlement with the Delaware  Department
of Natural  Resources and  Environmental  Control (DNREC) providing that Nuclear
will fund additional habitat  restoration and enhancement  activities as well as
fisheries  monitoring  and that PSEG and DNREC  will work  cooperatively  on the
finalization of regulatory  approvals required for implementation of the Permit.
As part of this  agreement,  PSEG was  required  to deposit  approximately  $5.8
million  into an escrow  account  to be used for  future  costs  related to this
settlement.

     Form 10-K, page 20 The Delaware River Basin Commission  (DRBC)  unanimously
approved  PSEG's  request  for  revisions  to its Docket for Salem at the DRBC's
meeting on  September  13,  2001.  The Docket,  as revised,  provides for a heat
dissipation area consistent with the hydrothermal  modeling studies conducted in
connection with the renewal application for Salem's NJPDES permit,  incorporates
by reference  the terms and  conditions  of the 2001  Permit,  rescinds the 1995
Revised Docket and establishes a twenty-five year term for the Docket. The newly
revised  Docket  again  includes  a  re-opener  clause  that  allows the DRBC to
re-consider  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Docket,  based  upon  changed
circumstances.

     Nuclear Fuel

     Form 10-K, page 6. Nuclear has several long-term contracts with uranium ore
operators, converters, enrichers and fabricators to meet the currently projected
fuel  requirements for Salem and Hope Creek.  Nuclear has been advised by Exelon
that it has similar contracts to satisfy the fuel requirements of Peach Bottom.

     On October 11, 2001, Nuclear filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims,  along  with  over  19  other  plaintiffs,   seeking  relief  from  past
overcharges by DOE for enrichment services. No assurances can be given as to any
claimed damage recovery.

     Form 10-K,  page 6. Pursuant to NRC rules,  spent nuclear fuel generated in
any reactor can be stored in reactor  facility  storage pools or in  independent
spent fuel storage  installations  located at or away-from-reactor  sites for at
least 30 years beyond the licensed life for reactor operation (which may include
the term of a revised or renewed  license).  The  availability of adequate spent
fuel storage  capacity is  estimated  through 2011 for Salem 1, 2015 for Salem 2
and 2007 for Hope  Creek.  Nuclear  presently  expects to  construct  an on-site
storage  facility  that would satisfy the spent fuel storage needs of both Salem
and Hope Creek, construction of which will require certain regulatory approvals,
the timely receipt of which cannot be assured.  Exelon has advised  Nuclear that
it has constructed an on-site dry storage  facility at Peach Bottom which is now
operational  to  provide  additional  storage  capacity  through  the end of the
current licenses for the two Peach Bottom units.

     Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), as amended,  the Federal
government has entered into contracts with operators of nuclear power plants for
transportation  and ultimate  disposal of the spent fuel and  mandated  that the
nuclear plant operators  contribute to a Nuclear Waste Fund at a rate of one mil
per kWh of nuclear generation,  subject to such escalation as may be required to
assure full cost recovery by the Federal government.  Under the NWPA, the United
States Department of Energy (DOE) was required to begin taking possession of all
spent nuclear fuel  generated by Power's  nuclear units for disposal by no later
than 1998. DOE construction of a permanent  disposal  facility has not begun and
the DOE has announced that it does not expect a facility to be available earlier
than 2010. Exelon has advised Power that it had signed an agreement with the DOE
applicable  to Peach Bottom under which  Exelon  would be  reimbursed  for costs
resulting  from the DOE's delay in accepting  spent nuclear fuel.  The agreement
allows  Exelon to reduce the charges  paid to the Nuclear  Waste Fund to reflect
costs reasonably  incurred due to the DOE's delay. Past and future  expenditures
associated with Peach Bottom's  recently  completed on-site dry storage facility
would be eligible for this reduction in future DOE fees. On November 22, 2000, a
group of eight  utilities filed a petition  against DOE in the Eleventh  Circuit
U.S.  Court of Appeals  seeking to set aside the  receipt of credits  out of the
Nuclear Waste Fund, as  stipulated in the Peach Bottom  agreement.  On September
26, 2001 PSEG  Nuclear  filed a complaint  in the U. S. Court of Federal  Claims
seeking  relief for  damages  caused by the DOE not taking  possession  of spent
nuclear fuel in 1998.  No assurances  can be given as to any damage  recovery or
the ultimate availability of a disposal facility.

Development Projects

     New Matter.  Power has filed an application  with the New York State Public
Service  Commission for  permission to construct and operate a direct  generator
lead  (dedicated  transmission  line)  that  would  deliver  up  to  500  MW  of
electricity to the West Side of Manhattan from the Bergen Generating  Station in
Ridgefield,  NJ. Applications for necessary New Jersey and federal approvals are
expected to be filed in the near  future.  Estimated  costs are not  expected to
exceed $100 million.
