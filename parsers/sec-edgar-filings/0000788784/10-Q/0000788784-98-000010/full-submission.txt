                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with the
Registrant's Notes contained in the 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These Notes
update and supplement matters discussed in the 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were
derived from the audited consolidated  financial statements included in the 1997
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications  of the prior year's data
have been made to conform with the current presentation.

Note 2.  Rate Matters

     New Jersey Energy Master Plan

     As reported in the 1997 Form 10-K, on April 30, 1997,  the New Jersey Board
of Public  Utilities  (BPU)  issued its final report  regarding  Phase II (final
Phase II report) of the  Energy  Master  Plan  addressing  wholesale  and retail
electric  competition  in New  Jersey.  In  accordance  with the final  Phase II
report,  Public  Service  Electric  and Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  filed a  proposal
regarding competition and rates with the BPU on July 15, 1997. The BPU is in the
process  of  reviewing  filings  of all New  Jersey  electric  utilities  and is
currently holding hearings.  The hearings on PSE&G's proposal commenced in early
February  1998 and are expected to conclude  during the second  quarter of 1998,
with a decision  expected  during the third quarter of 1998. The decision of the
BPU in the  Energy  Master  Plan  proceeding  and the  legislation  required  to
implement certain aspects of electric  restructuring,  if enacted into law, will
establish  the  industry  rules for the future.  These  actions are  expected to
fundamentally  change the electric  industry in the State by introducing  retail
competition to replace the utilities'  former monopoly  position and potentially
requiring or resulting in the separation or sale of generation assets.

     Also,  as  previously  reported,  by Order  dated  June 25,  1997,  the BPU
commenced  management  audits of all New  Jersey  electric  utilities,  with the
assistance of one or more consulting firms, under the direction of its own audit
staff. The audit process  included,  but was not limited to, reviews of electric
utility  filings in response to the Energy  Master Plan.  The  management  audit
process  for  PSE&G  concluded  in  December  1997  with a report  of the  BPU's
management consultants relating to issues of stranded costs,  securitization and
consumer rate reductions. A second report on restructuring was filed on February
27, 1998.  These audit  reports were  approved for release by the BPU on January
29, 1998 and March 5, 1998,  respectively,  and are being  considered as part of
the proceedings  discussed below. The BPU can adopt,  reject or modify the audit
reports' results in its decision on PSE&G's  proposal.  PSE&G cannot predict the
extent to which the BPU will  rely on the  results  of these  audit  reports  in
evaluating PSE&G's proposal.

     The  BPU  requested  the  Office  of  Administrative   Law  (OAL)  to  hold
evidentiary  hearings  regarding  stranded  costs and unbundling  issues.  These
hearings  concluded on March 18, 1998. The audit report released in January 1998
is being  considered  as part of this  proceeding.  Both initial and reply legal
briefs  regarding  those  issues were filed with the OAL in April 1998.  The OAL
Judge  has 45 days  from the  filing of such  briefs  to  render  his  advisory,
non-binding decision to the BPU.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


 Hearings at the BPU began on April 27, 1998 addressing other  restructuring
issues, such as market power,  affiliate  transactions and consumer  protection.
The audit  report  released in March 1998,  relating to these  issues,  is being
considered as part of this  proceeding.  Those hearings are expected to last one
month.

     The BPU has  indicated  its  intent  to  submit  draft  legislation  to the
Governor  later this  Spring to  provide it  requisite  authority  to  implement
wholesale and retail electric competition in New Jersey.  Legislative leadership
has  indicated  that it  probably  will not  consider  passage of a  legislative
package  providing  such  authority  until  this  Fall.  The  outcome  of  these
administrative and legislative  proceedings could have a material adverse effect
on Public  Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated's  (Enterprise)  and PSE&G's
financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash flows.  Enterprise and
PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

     Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC)

     On November 14, 1997,  PSE&G filed an LGAC petition with the BPU requesting
a $45  million  annual  increase  in its LGAC for the period  January 1, 1998 to
December 31, 1998,  which as filed would increase a typical  residential bill by
approximately  4.8%.  Public hearings were held on February 3, 1998. On February
18,  1998,  the BPU  approved  a  Stipulation  agreed to by the  parties  in the
proceeding  providing for an interim  increase in LGAC revenues of approximately
$31  million,  excluding  State  sales and use tax,  or an increase of 3.5% on a
typical  residential  bill. The parties continue to litigate this matter.  PSE&G
cannot predict the final outcome of this proceeding.

     In April 1997,  the BPU approved  PSE&G's  proposal for a  residential  gas
unbundling pilot program  (SelectGas)  allowing 65,000  residential  natural gas
customers,  out  of a  total  of  1.4  million  residential  gas  customers,  to
participate in the  competitive  marketplace  effective May 1, 1997. To date, of
the 65,000 eligible customers, none have subscribed to the program. On April 30,
1998,  PSE&G  filed  a  report  with  the  BPU on  SelectGas  and  its  proposed
refinements  for a  permanent  residential  gas  unbundling  program.  PSE&G has
proposed  that under  SelectGas  300,000  residential  customers be permitted to
choose their gas supplier on a  first-come,  first-served  basis.  This expanded
program is  expected  to  commence  by the later of sixty days after a BPU order
resolving  this matter or September 30, 1998.  PSE&G proposes that the remaining
residential  customers  be eligible to choose their gas supplier by July 1, 1999
or such date set by the BPU.

     Electric Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause (LEAC)/Demand Side Adjustment
     Factor (DSAF)

     On February 24, 1997,  PSE&G  requested  an  annualized  increase of $151.8
million in the DSAF component of the LEAC effective for the period from May 1997
through  December 1998. The request  included  recovery of electric  Demand Side
Management  (DSM)/conservation  costs related to BPU-approved programs. On April
1, 1998, the BPU approved  $150.8 million of PSE&G's  requested  increase.  This
increase was effective for service rendered on or after April 3, 1998.

     At March 31, 1998, PSE&G had an underrecovered balance, including interest,
of approximately  $155 million related to electric DSM programs.  Such amount is
included in Deferred Debits on  Enterprise's  and PSE&G's  Consolidated  Balance
Sheets (see Note 3. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities).

     As reported in the 1997 Form 10-K,  while  PSE&G's  proposal in response to
the final Phase II report of the Energy  Master Plan  provides  for a transition
period  of  seven  years  with  basic   tariff   rates  being   capped  and  the
discontinuation  of the LEAC effective December 31, 1998, such proposal provides
for recovery of mandated societal costs,  including DSM, to be adjusted based on
changes in such costs.  PSE&G  estimates  that the  underrecovered  electric DSM
programs  balance at December 31, 1998 will be approximately  $130 million.  For
further discussion of the potential impact on Enterprise and PSE&G of the Energy
Master Plan proceedings, see New Jersey Energy Master Plan.

Note 3.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

   Regulatory  assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  in  accordance  with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 71, "Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS 71). At March 31, 1998 and
December 31, 1997, respectively, Enterprise and PSE&G had deferred the following
regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

                                                          March 31, December 31,

   Underrecovered  Electric Energy and Gas Costs:  Recoveries of electric energy
and gas  costs  are  determined  by the BPU  under  the LEAC and  LGAC.  PSE&G's
deferred fuel balances as of March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, respectively,
reflect underrecovered costs as follows:

                                                   
                                                    March 31,   December 31,

                                                     ====        ====

   The BPU Order dated December 31, 1996 provides PSE&G the opportunity, but not
a guarantee,  during the period  January 1, 1997 through  December 31, 1998,  to
fully recover its December 31, 1996  underrecovered LEAC balance of $151 million
without  any  change  in  the  current  energy  component  of the  LEAC  charge.
Management  believes  that it will  recover this amount by December 31, 1998 and
continues to follow deferred accounting treatment for the LEAC.


<PAGE>


   Deferred Demand Side Management Costs:  Recoveries of DSM/conservation  costs
(related to BPU-approved  programs) are determined by the BPU.  PSE&G's deferred
DSM balance as of March 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997,  respectively,  reflects
underrecovered/(overrecovered) costs as follows:

                                                    March 31,   December 31,

                                                       ====        ====

    The increase  in the  electric  balance  is  primarily  due  to the  ongoing
underrecovery of DSM costs (see Note 2. Rate Matters).

Note 4.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

   Settlement of Salem Litigation

    As  reported  in the 1997 Form 10-K,  on May 12,  1997,  PSE&G  settled  the
lawsuit  brought  against it by PECO Energy  Company  (PECO Energy) and Delmarva
Power & Light  Company  (DP&L),  two  co-owners  of  Units 1 and 2 of the  Salem
Nuclear Generating Station (Salem 1 and 2), related to alleged damages resulting
from the outage of the facility.  One aspect of this settlement  obligated PSE&G
to pay $1.4 million for each reactor month that the outage  continued  beyond an
aggregate  outage of 64  reactor  months,  up to a maximum  payment  under  this
provision of $17 million.  PSE&G will not make any payments under this provision
since the  aggregate  Salem  outage was 61 reactor  months.  Salem 2 returned to
service on August 30, 1997 and Salem 1 returned to service on April 17, 1998.

   PECO  Energy,  DP&L and PSE&G have also  agreed to an  operating  performance
standard  (OPS)  applicable  to Salem and the Peach Bottom  Atomic Power Station
Units 2 and 3 (Peach  Bottom)  through  their  retirements,  now  scheduled  for
December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2007, respectively.  PSE&G is the operator of
Salem and PECO  Energy  is the  operator  of Peach  Bottom.  Under the OPS,  the
station  operator  is  required to make  payments  to the  non-operating  owners
(excluding  Atlantic  Electric  Company)  commencing  in  January  2001  if  the
three-year  historical average maximum  dependable  capacity net capacity factor
(MDC) (defined below) for that station for the preceding year,  calculated as of
December  31 of such year,  falls  below 40%.  Any such  payment is limited to a
maximum  of $25  million  per year.  MDC is the gross  electrical  output  for a
station  measured at the output terminals of its turbine  generators  during the
most  restrictive  seasonal  conditions,  less the station's  service load.  The
initial  three-year  period for Peach Bottom began  January 1, 1998 and will end
December 31, 2000. The initial  three-year period for Salem began April 17, 1998
and will end December 31, 2000. Excluded from the three-year  calculation is any
period of time to which force majeure (as defined in the OPS) is applicable. The
parties  have  further  agreed to forego  litigation  in the future,  except for
limited cases in which the operator would be responsible  for damages of no more
than $5 million per year.

   Year 2000

   Many  of  Enterprise's  and  PSE&G's  systems,   which  include   information
technology  applications,  plant control and  telecommunications  infrastructure
systems,  must be modified due to computer  program  limitations  in recognizing
dates beyond 1999. During the first quarter of 1998, $5 million of costs related
to Year 2000  readiness were  incurred.  Management  estimates the total cost of
this effort to be about $92 million to be incurred  from 1997 through  2001,  of
which $41 million is  expected to be incurred in 1998.  A portion of these costs
are not likely to be  incremental  to  Enterprise  or PSE&G,  but  rather,  will
represent a redeployment of existing personnel/resources.
<PAGE>

   An inability of Enterprise,  PSE&G,  their  subsidiaries,  both  domestic and
overseas   holdings,   members   of   the   Pennsylvania--New   Jersey--Maryland
Interconnection  (PJM) or Enterprise's or PSE&G's critical suppliers to meet the
Year 2000 deadline  could have a material  adverse  impact on  Enterprise's  and
PSE&G's  operations,  financial  condition,  results of operations  and net cash
flows.

   Hazardous Waste

   Certain  Federal and state laws authorize the U.S.  Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP),
among other agencies,  to issue orders and bring  enforcement  actions to compel
responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is
determined  to  present  an actual or  potential  threat to human  health or the
environment  because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous
substances.  Because of the nature of PSE&G's business, including the production
of electricity,  the distribution of gas and, formerly,  the manufacture of gas,
various by-products and substances are or were produced or handled which contain
constituents classified as hazardous.  PSE&G generally provides for the disposal
or processing  of such  substances  through  licensed  independent  contractors.
However,  these  statutory  provisions  impose joint and several  responsibility
without regard to fault on all responsible parties,  including the generators of
the hazardous  substances,  for certain  investigative  and remediation costs at
sites where these  substances  were  disposed  of or  processed.  PSE&G has been
notified  with  respect  to a number  of such  sites and the  investigation  and
remediation of these potentially hazardous sites is receiving attention from the
government agencies involved.  Generally,  actions directed at funding such site
investigations  and  remediation  include  all  suspected  or known  responsible
parties.  Except as  discussed  below with respect to its  Remediation  Program,
Enterprise and PSE&G do not expect its  expenditures for any such site to have a
material  effect on  financial  condition,  results of  operations  and net cash
flows.

   The NJDEP has recently revised regulations  concerning site investigation and
remediation.   These  regulations  will  require  an  ecological  evaluation  of
potential   injuries  to  natural   resources  in  connection  with  a  remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
utility industry to develop procedures for implementing these regulations. These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of remedial  investigations and
remediations,  where  necessary,  particularly at sites located on surface water
bodies. PSE&G and predecessor companies owned and/or operated facilities located
on surface water bodies,  certain of which are currently the subject of remedial
activities.  The financial impact of these  regulations on these projects is not
currently  estimable.  PSE&G does not anticipate  that the compliance with these
regulations  will have a  material  adverse  effect on its  financial  position,
results of operations or net cash flows.

   PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program (Remediation Program)

   In 1988,  NJDEP  notified  PSE&G that it had  identified  the need for PSE&G,
pursuant  to  a  formal  arrangement,  to  systematically  investigate  and,  if
necessary,  resolve environmental concerns extant at PSE&G's former manufactured
gas plant sites. To date, NJDEP and PSE&G have identified 38 former manufactured
gas plant  sites.  PSE&G is  currently  working  with  NJDEP  under a program to
assess, investigate and, if necessary, remediate environmental concerns at these
sites.  The Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and revised by PSE&G
based on regulatory  requirements,  experience with the Remediation  Program and
available remediation  technologies.  The cost of the Remediation Program cannot
be  reasonably  estimated,  but  experience  to date  indicates  that  costs  of
approximately  $20 million per year could be incurred  over a period of about 30
years and that the overall  cost could be material to  Enterprise's  and PSE&G's
financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Note 5.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

   Enterprise's operations give rise to exposure to market risks from changes in
commodity prices,  interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of
security  investments.  Enterprise's  policy  is  to  use  derivative  financial
instruments for the purpose of managing market risk consistent with its business
plans and prudent business practices.

   Equity Securities -- Enterprise Diversified Holdings Incorporated (EDHI)

   Public Service  Resources  Corporation  (PSRC), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
EDHI, has  investments in equity  securities  and  partnerships  which invest in
equity  securities.  The aggregate  carrying value  approximates the fair market
value of $201  million and $185  million as of March 31, 1998 and  December  31,
1997, respectively.

   Natural Gas Hedging -- EDHI

   As  of  March  31,  1998,  Energis  Resources   Incorporated   (Energis),   a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of EDHI,  had  outstanding  futures  contracts  to buy
natural gas related to fixed-price natural gas sales commitments. Such contracts
hedged  approximately  100% of its fixed  price sales  commitments  at March 31,
1998.  As of March  31,  1998,  Energis  had net  unrealized  hedge  gains of $4
million.

   Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds -- PSE&G

   Contributions made into the Nuclear  Decommissioning Trust Funds are invested
in debt and equity  securities.  The  carrying  value of $492  million  and $459
million of these funds  approximates  the fair market value as of March 31, 1998
and December 31, 1997, respectively.

Note 6.  Income Taxes

     As  reported  in the 1997 Form 10-K,  the New  Jersey  Gross  Receipts  and
Franchise Tax (NJGRT) was eliminated effective January 1, 1998 and replaced with
a combination of the New Jersey  Corporate  Business Tax which is a State income
tax, the State sales and use tax and a Transitional  Energy Facility  Assessment
(TEFA),  with  no  material  impact  on  the  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and net cash flows of Enterprise  and PSE&G.  The TEFA will be phased
out over five years.  While under NJGRT, PSE&G was subject to an effective state
tax on unit sales equal to  approximately  13% of receipts,  as a result of such
tax  reform,  after  the phase out of the  TEFA,  the  effective  state tax rate
applicable  to  PSE&G  will  be  substantially   reduced.   Interim  rates  were
implemented with regard to the new tax structure effective with service rendered
on and after January 1, 1998. The BPU continues its administrative review of the
filings of all New Jersey  utilities and is expected to approve  permanent rates
no later than July 1, 1998.

   Therefore,  effective January 1, 1998, PSE&G became subject to the New Jersey
Corporate Business Tax. Consequently, the effective income tax rate differs from

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Concluded)


Note 7.  Accounting Matters

   In June 1997,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued SFAS
130, "Reporting  Comprehensive Income" (SFAS 130), which is effective for fiscal
years  beginning  after  December  15, 1997.  SFAS 130  dictates  that all items
required  to  be  recognized  under   accounting   standards  as  components  of
comprehensive  income be reported in a financial  statement  displayed  with the
same  prominence  as  other  financial  statements.  It  also  requires  that an
enterprise  classify  items of other  comprehensive  income by their nature in a
financial  statement and display the accumulated  balance of other comprehensive
income separately from retained  earnings and additional  paid-in capital in the
equity section of a statement of financial  position.  Enterprise and PSE&G have
adopted SFAS 130 effective with this filing. The effects of adoption of SFAS 130
are not material for Enterprise or PSE&G.

   In February 1998,  the FASB issued SFAS 132,  "Employers'  Disclosures  about
Pensions and Other  Postretirement  Benefits" (SFAS 132), which is effective for
financial  statements  for periods  beginning  after  December  15,  1997.  This
statement revises and standardizes disclosure requirements for pension and other
postretirement  benefit plans but does not change the measurement or recognition
of those  plans.  Since SFAS 132 solely  revises  disclosure  requirements,  the
adoption of SFAS 132 will not have a material impact on the financial condition,
results of operations and net cash flows of Enterprise and PSE&G.

   In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
issued  Statement of Position (SOP) 98-1,  "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software  Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" (SOP 98-1), which is effective
for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP
98-1 provides criteria for capitalizing certain internal-use software costs. The
adoption of SOP 98-1 is not expected to have a material  impact on the financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows of Enterprise and PSE&G.

   In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities" (SOP 98-5),  which is effective for financial  statements for fiscal
years  beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP 98-5 provides for the expensing of
the costs of start-up activities as incurred. Enterprise and PSE&G are currently
evaluating the impact, if any, of SOP 98-5.

                    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


   The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Enterprise are incorporated
by reference insofar as they relate to PSE&G and its subsidiaries:

      Note 1. Basis of Presentation
      Note 2. Rate Matters
      Note 3. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
      Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
      Note 5. Financial Instruments and Risk Management
      Note 7. Accounting Matters

Note 6.  Income Taxes

     As  reported  in the 1997 Form 10-K,  the New  Jersey  Gross  Receipts  and
Franchise Tax (NJGRT) was eliminated effective January 1, 1998 and replaced with
a combination of the New Jersey  Corporate  Business Tax which is a State income
tax, the State sales and use tax and a Transitional  Energy Facility  Assessment
(TEFA),  with  no  material  impact  on  the  financial  condition,  results  of
operations and net cash flows of Enterprise  and PSE&G.  The TEFA will be phased
out over five years.  While under NJGRT, PSE&G was subject to an effective state
tax on unit sales equal to  approximately  13% of receipts,  as a result of such
tax  reform,  after  the phase out of the  TEFA,  the  effective  state tax rate
applicable  to  PSE&G  will  be  substantially   reduced.   Interim  rates  were
implemented with regard to the new tax structure effective with service rendered
on and after January 1, 1998. The BPU continues its administrative review of the
filings of all New Jersey  utilities and is expected to approve  permanent rates
no later than July 1, 1998.

   Therefore,  effective January 1, 1998, PSE&G became subject to the New Jersey
Corporate Business Tax. Consequently, the effective income tax rate differs from
the statutory Federal income tax rate as follows:

                  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


      Following  are the  significant  changes in or  additions  to  information
reported in the Public Service Enterprise Group  Incorporated  (Enterprise) 1997
Annual Report on Form 10-K affecting the  consolidated  financial  condition and
the results of operations of Enterprise and its  subsidiaries.  This  discussion
refers to the Consolidated  Financial Statements  (Statements) and related Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) of Enterprise and should be read in
conjunction with such Statements and Notes.

Results of Operations

   Basic and diluted  earnings  per share of  Enterprise  common  stock  (Common
Stock) were $0.82 for the quarter ended March 31, 1998, representing an increase
of $0.22 or 37% per share from the comparable 1997 period.

   Public Service  Electric and Gas Company's  (PSE&G)  contribution to earnings
per share of Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 1998  increased  $0.09
from the comparable 1997 period primarily due to the one-time charge to earnings
of $55 million or $0.24 per share in the first  quarter of 1997  resulting  from
the  settlements of lawsuits filed by the co-owners of Salem.  This increase was
partially  offset by lower  revenues due to the mild winter weather in the first
quarter of 1998 as well as higher operation and depreciation expenses.

   Enterprise   Diversified  Holdings   Incorporated's  (EDHI)  contribution  to
earnings  per  share of Common  Stock  for the  quarter  ended  March  31,  1998
increased  $0.13  from the  comparable  1997  period  primarily  due to  greater
earnings  of  Public  Service  Resources  Corporation  (PSRC).  PSRC's  earnings
increase  was due to higher  income from  investments  in  leveraged  buyout and
venture  capital  partnerships,  a gain  resulting from the exercise of an early
buyout  option by the lessee in a leveraged  lease and higher  earnings from new
leveraged lease investments.

PSE&G -- Revenues

   Electric

   Revenues  increased  $217 million or 23% for the quarter ended March 31, 1998
from   the  comparable  period  in 1997  primarily  due  to  an   increase   in
energy  trading  activity and higher sales to large industrial  customers.  See
PSE&G -- Expenses -- Fuel for Electric Generation and Interchanged Power.

   These  increases were  partially  offset with a decrease to revenue caused by
New  Jersey  energy  tax  reform in 1998 (see Note 6.  Income  Taxes of  Notes).
Collection of New Jersey Gross  Receipts and Franchise Tax (NJGRT) was reflected
in revenue in 1997, but with energy tax reform, the portion of NJGRT replaced by
the State sales and use tax is no longer  reflected in revenue or expense on the
income  statement.  State  sales  and use tax is a  liability  of the  customer,
collected by PSE&G and remitted to the State and is recorded in Tax  Collections
Payable  which is  included in Other  Current  Liabilities  on the  Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

   Gas

   Revenues  decreased  $122 million or 17% for the quarter ended March 31, 1998
from the  comparable  period in 1997.  The decrease was  primarily  due to lower
recovery of fuel costs and decreased therm sales due to milder winter weather in
1998 and energy tax reform (see PSE&G -- Revenues -- Electric above).


<PAGE>



PSE&G -- Expenses

   Fuel for Electric Generation and Interchanged Power

   Fuel for Electric Generation and Interchanged Power increased $238 million or
96% for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  1998  from the  comparable  1997  period
primarily due to an increase in energy trading  activity.  Effective  January 1,
1998, the amount included for Electric Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause (LEAC)
under/overrecovery  represents the difference between fuel-related  revenues and
fuel-related  expenses  which  are  comprised  of the  cost  of  generation  and
interchanged  power at the PJM market clearing  price.  Effective April 1, 1998,
the PJM locational marginal price replaced the PJM market clearing price. To the
extent fuel revenue and expense flow  through the LEAC  mechanism,  variances in
fuel revenues and expenses offset and thus have no direct effect on earnings.

   Gas Purchased

   Gas  purchased  decreased  $31 million or 7% for the quarter  ended March 31,
1998 from the comparable 1997 period. The decrease was primarily due to the mild
winter  weather in 1998.  Due to the operation of the  Levelized Gas  Adjustment
Clause (LGAC)  mechanism,  variances in fuel revenues and expenses  offset,  and
have no direct effect on earnings.

   Income Taxes

   PSE&G  became  subject to State income tax  effective  January 1, 1998 due to
energy  tax  reform in the State of New  Jersey  (see  Note 6.  Income  Taxes of
Notes).  Income Taxes  increased  $13 million or 13% for the quarter ended March
31, 1998 from the comparable 1997 period.  This increase is due to the inclusion
of State  income tax of $31 million,  partially  offset by a decrease in Federal
income tax of $18 million due to a decrease in pre-tax operating income.

   Transitional Energy Facility Assessment (TEFA)/New Jersey Gross Receipts and
   Franchise Tax (NJGRT)

   TEFA/NJGRT decreased $123 million or 72% for the quarter ended March 31, 1998
from the comparable  1997 period due to New Jersey energy tax reform.  For 1998,
the amount  represents  TEFA unit based taxes  while the 1997 amount  represents
NJGRT unit based  taxes.  The TEFA unit tax rates are  approximately  30% of the
NJGRT unit tax rates.  See PSE&G -- Revenues  and Income Taxes above and Note 6.
Income Taxes of Notes for other impacts of New Jersey energy tax reform.

   EDHI's  earnings  were $36 million for the quarter  ended March 31, 1998,  an
increase of $32 million  from the  comparable  1997  period.  The  increase  was
primarily due to PSRC's higher income from  investments in leveraged  buyout and
venture  capital  partnerships,  a gain  resulting from the exercise of an early
buyout  option by the lessee in a leveraged  lease and higher  earnings from new
leveraged lease investments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Enterprise

   Enterprise is a public utility holding company and as such, has no operations
of its own. The  following  discussion  of  Enterprise's  liquidity  and capital
resources  is on a  consolidated  basis,  noting the uses and  contributions  of
Enterprise's two direct subsidiaries, PSE&G and EDHI.

   Cash  generated  from  PSE&G's  operations  is  expected to provide the major
source of funds for  PSE&G's  business.  EDHI's  growth  will be funded  through
external financings, cash generated from EDHI's operations and equity capital.

   Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock  were $0.54 per share and  totaled  $125
million for the quarter ended March 31, 1998. Since 1986, PSE&G has made regular
cash payments to Enterprise  in the form of dividends on  outstanding  shares of
PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G has paid quarterly  dividends on its common stock in
each year  commencing in 1948,  the year of the  distribution  of PSE&G's common
stock by Public Service  Corporation of New Jersey,  the former parent of PSE&G.
PSE&G paid  dividends of $125  million to  Enterprise  during the quarter  ended
March 31, 1998.  From 1992  through  1996,  EDHI made  regular cash  payments to
Enterprise  in the form of  dividends  on  outstanding  shares of EDHI's  common
stock. Due to the growth in EDHI investment  activities,  no dividends on EDHI's
common stock were paid in the first quarter of 1998 or are anticipated for 1998.
In the first quarter of 1998,  EDHI paid $2 million of dividends  related to its
preferred stock issued to Enterprise.

   Enterprise  has paid  quarterly  dividends in each year  commencing  with the
corporate restructuring of PSE&G in 1985 when Enterprise became the owner of all
the  outstanding  common stock of PSE&G.  While a key  objective of the Board of
Directors of Enterprise is to keep the Common Stock dividend secure, amounts and
dates of such  dividends as may be declared will  necessarily  be dependent upon
Enterprise's future earnings, financial requirements and other factors including
the receipt of dividend payments from its subsidiaries.

   Enterprise and PSE&G have issued Deferrable Interest Subordinated  Debentures
in connection with the issuance of tax deferred  preferred  securities.  If, and
for as long as, payments on those Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures
have been  deferred,  or  Enterprise  or PSE&G has  defaulted  on the  indenture
related thereto or its guarantee  thereof,  neither Enterprise nor PSE&G may pay
any dividends on their common and preferred stock.

   As of March 31, 1998,  Enterprise's capital structure consisted of 48% common
equity,   44%  long-term  debt  and  8%  preferred  stock  and  other  preferred
securities.

     As  a  result  of  the  1992  focused  audit  of  Enterprise's  non-utility
businesses  (Focused  Audit),  the New Jersey  Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)
approved a plan which,  among other things,  provides that: (1) Enterprise  will
not  permit  EDHI's  non-utility  investments  to  exceed  20%  of  Enterprise's
consolidated  assets without prior notice to the BPU (such  investments at March
31, 1998 were  approximately  17% of assets);  (2) the PSE&G Board of  Directors
will provide an annual  certification  that the business and financing  plans of
EDHI will not  adversely  affect  PSE&G;  (3)  Enterprise  will (a)  limit  debt
supported by the minimum net worth maintenance  agreement between Enterprise and
Capital to $750  million  and (b) make a  good-faith  effort to  eliminate  such
support  over a six to ten year period  from April  1993;  and (4) EDHI will pay
PSE&G an  affiliation  fee of up to $2  million  a year to be  applied  by PSE&G
through its LGAC and its LEAC to reduce  utility  rates.  Beginning in 1995, the
debt  supported by such minimum net worth  maintenance  agreement was limited to
$650 million and the  affiliation fee has been  proportionately  reduced as such
supported debt is reduced.  Enterprise and EDHI and its subsidiaries continue to
reimburse  PSE&G for the cost of all  services  provided to them by employees of
PSE&G.

     As a result of Enterprise's  intent that EDHI and its subsidiaries  provide
growth  vehicles  for  Enterprise,  financing  requirements  connected  with the
continued  growth of EDHI,  changes to the utility  industry  expected  from the
final outcome of the Energy  Master Plan  proceedings  and potential  accounting
impacts  resulting  from the  deregulation  of the  generation  of  electricity,
modifications  will be  required  to  certain of the  restrictions  agreed to by
Enterprise  with the BPU in response to the Focused Audit.  Inability to achieve
satisfactory  resolution of these matters could impact the future  relative size
and financing of the non-utility businesses and accordingly Enterprise's future
prospects (see Note 2. Rate Matters of Notes).
<PAGE>
   PSE&G

   For the quarter  ended March 31,  1998,  PSE&G had utility  plant  additions,
including Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFDC), of $84 million, a
$27 million  decrease  from the  corresponding  1997  period.  The  decrease was
primarily due to the  replacement  of Salem 1 steam  generators  in 1997.  PSE&G
expects that it will be able to internally  generate all of its construction and
capital  requirements  over the next five years,  assuming  adequate  and timely
recovery  of costs,  as to which no  assurances  can be given  (see Note 2. Rate
Matters of Notes).

   EDHI

     CEA,  PSRC and Energis  are  expected  to be growth  vehicles  for EDHI and
Enterprise. During the next five years, EDHI's capital requirements are expected
to be provided from additional debt financing, operational cash flows and equity
capital.  A  significant  portion of CEA's  growth is  expected  to occur in the
international arena due to the current and anticipated growth in electric demand
and the  privatization  of  electric  transmission  and  distribution  assets in
certain  regions  of the  world.  PSRC will  continue  its focus on  investments
related to the energy  business.  Energis is expected to expand upon the current
energy related  services  being provided to industrial and commercial  customers
(see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Enterprise).

   In January 1998, EDHI sold $218 million of 5.01%  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
to Enterprise and used the proceeds to make additional equity investments in its
subsidiaries and to retire $75 million of its 4.10%  Cumulative  Preferred Stock
held by Enterprise.

   In the  first  quarter  of  1998,  PSRC  received  proceeds  from  investment
liquidations resulting from the exercise of an early buyout option by the lessee
in a leveraged lease and from sales of investments  held in leveraged buyout and
venture  capital  partnerships.  In May 1998,  CEA sold its 50% interests in two
domestic  cogeneration  plants.  The  aggregate  proceeds to EDHI from the above
investment liquidations amounted to approximately $175 million.

   In March and April 1998, EGDC entered into separate agreements to sell two of
its properties for a total of approximately $12 million.

   In  March  1998,  PSRC  entered  into a  leveraged  lease  of a  natural  gas
distribution  network in the Netherlands and, in April 1998, acquired a lease of
a domestic gas-fired steam electric generating  station.  The aggregate of these
investments totaled approximately $130 million.

   For a discussion of the source of EDHI's funds, see External Financings. Over
the next several years,  EDHI and its subsidiaries will be required to refinance
their maturing debt and provide additional debt and equity financing for growth.
Any inability to obtain  required  additional  external  capital or to extend or
replace maturing debt and/or existing  agreements at current levels and interest
rates may affect future earnings.

External Financings

   Enterprise

   On March 31,  1998,  Enterprise  had a $25 million line of credit with a bank
with no debt  outstanding  under this line of credit.  Also,  at March 31, 1998,
Enterprise had a committed $150 million  revolving credit facility which expires
in December 2002 with no debt outstanding under this revolving credit facility.

   In January  1998,  Enterprise  Capital Trust I, a special  purpose  statutory
business trust controlled by Enterprise,  issued $225 million of its 7.44% Trust
Originated  Preferred  Securities.  Proceeds  were  lent to  Enterprise  and are
evidenced by deferrable interest  subordinated  debentures.  Enterprise used the
proceeds to make a $218 million  equity  investment in EDHI.  The debentures and
their  related  indenture  constitute  a full  and  unconditional  guarantee  by
Enterprise of the preferred  securities  issued by the trust. If and for as long
as payments on  Enterprise's  debentures  have been deferred,  or Enterprise has
defaulted on the indenture related thereto or its guarantee thereof,  Enterprise
may not pay any  dividends  on its  Common  Stock  (see  Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources -- Enterprise).

<PAGE>


   PSE&G

   PSE&G has received  authority  from the BPU,  through  December 31, 1998,  to
opportunistically  refinance essentially all of its long-term debt and to refund
up to $250 million of matured debt.

   Under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage),  PSE&G may issue new First
and Refunding Mortgage Bonds (Bonds) against previous additions and improvements
and/or  retired Bonds provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is at
least 2:1. At March 31, 1998,  the  coverage  ratio under  PSE&G's  Mortgage was
3.68:1.  As of March 31,  1998,  the  Mortgage  would  permit up to $3.3 billion
aggregate  principal amount of new Bonds to be issued against previous additions
and improvements.

   In January 1998, $100 million of PSE&G's 6.00% Bonds, Series NN, matured.

   In April 1998, $8 million of PSE&G's 7.50% Bonds,  Series OO, were  purchased
in the open market.

   To provide  liquidity  for its  commercial  paper  program,  PSE&G has a $650
million  revolving  credit  agreement  expiring in June 1998 and a $650  million
revolving  credit  agreement  expiring  in June 2002 with a group of  commercial
banks,  which provide for borrowings of up to one year. On March 31, 1998, there
were no borrowings  outstanding under these credit agreements.  PSE&G expects to
be able to renew the credit agreement expiring in 1998.

   The BPU has  authorized  PSE&G to issue and have  outstanding at any one time
through  January 2, 1999, not more than $1.3 billion of short-term  obligations,
consisting of commercial  paper and other  unsecured  borrowings  from banks and
other  lenders.  On March 31, 1998,  PSE&G had $748 million of  short-term  debt
outstanding,  including $74 million  borrowed against its uncommitted bank lines
of credit which lines of credit totaled $174 million at March 31, 1998.

   PSE&G Fuel Corporation  (Fuelco),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PSE&G, has a
$125  million  commercial  paper  program to finance  its 42.49%  share of Peach
Bottom  nuclear  fuel,  which  program is supported by a $125 million  revolving
credit  facility  expiring on June 28, 2001.  PSE&G has guaranteed  repayment of
Fuelco's  obligations  under  this  program.  At  March  31,  1998,  Fuelco  had
commercial paper of $74 million outstanding under this program.

   EDHI

   At March 31, 1998,  PSEG Capital  Corporation,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
EDHI,  had total debt  outstanding  of $596 million,  including  $573 million of
Medium Term Notes and $23 million of Senior Notes.

   As of March 31, 1998,  Enterprise Capital Funding  Corporation  (Funding),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of EDHI,  had $300 million and $150 million  revolving
credit  facilities with two groups of banks and had $128 million of Senior Notes
outstanding.  As of March 31,  1998,  Funding  had $276  million  of total  debt
outstanding.

     EDHI,  PSRC and CEA are  subject  to  restrictive  business  and  financial
covenants contained in existing debt agreements.  EDHI is required to maintain a
debt to equity ratio of no more than 2.00:1 and a twelve-months  earnings before
interest and taxes to interest (EBIT)  coverage ratio of at least 1.50:1.  As of
March 31, 1998, EDHI had a consolidated debt to equity ratio of 1.29:1.  For the
twelve  months  ended March 31, 1998,  the EBIT  coverage  ratio,  as defined to
exclude the effects of EGDC, was 2.68:1.  Compliance with  applicable  financial
covenants will depend upon future financial position and levels of earnings,  as
to which no assurance can be given.  In addition,  EDHI's ability to continue to
grow its business will depend to a significant degree on Enterprise's and EDHI's
ability to obtain additional  financing beyond current levels (see Liquidity and
Capital Resources).

Nuclear Operations

   As  previously  reported,  PSE&G's  Salem  Units 1 and 2 (Salem 1 and 2) were
taken out of  service in the second  quarter of 1995 with Salem 2  returning  to
service on August 30, 1997.  Salem 1 returned to service on April 17, 1998.  The
Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC) has stated that it will continue to closely
monitor  activities  at Salem.  For a discussion  of the  operating  performance
standard applicable to Salem, see Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
of Notes.

Adjustment Factor and other rate matters, see Note 2. Rate Matters of Notes.

   Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) Order No. 888 (Order No. 888)

   As  previously  reported,  numerous  parties,  including  PSE&G,  have  filed
petitions for judicial review of Orders No. 888, 888A and 888B before the Courts
of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Second Circuits.  In March 1998,
all of these appeals were  consolidated in the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit (D.C.  Circuit),  Transmission  Access Policy Study Group v.
Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission,  United  States Court of Appeals in the
District of Columbia  Circuit,  Docket No. 97-1715.  On April 30, 1998, the D.C.
Circuit entered an order permitting  certain additional parties to intervene and
establishing certain procedural guidelines for the hearing of these appeals.

   Pennsylvania--New Jersey--Maryland Interconnection (PJM)

     Effective April 1, 1998, PJM implemented  locational marginal pricing (LMP)
for  congestion  costs within the PJM control area pursuant to the FERC November
25,  1997  Order.  LMP  provides  for  an  allocation  of  congestion  costs  to
transmission  users  within  the  PJM  control  area.   Depending  on  operating
conditions,  the use of LMP may have an effect on the cost of Fuel for  Electric
Generation and Interchanged  Power.  Since LMP is in its infancy,  its effect on
Enterprise's and PSE&G's financial condition, results of operations and net cash
flows is not presently determinable.

Forward Looking Statements

   The Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the Act)  provides a
"safe  harbor" for  forward-looking  statements  to encourage  such  disclosures
without the threat of litigation  providing  those  statements are identified as
forward-looking  and  are  accompanied  by  meaningful,   cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause the actual  results to differ
materially  from those  projected in the statement.  Forward-looking  statements
have been made in this report. Such statements are based on management's beliefs
as  well  as  assumptions  made  by  and  information   currently  available  to
management.  When used  herein,  the  words  "will",  "anticipate",  "estimate",
"expect", "objective",  "hypothetical",  "potential" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking  statements. In addition to any assumptions
and  other  factors   referred  to   specifically   in   connection   with  such
forward-looking  statements,  factors that could cause actual  results to differ
materially from those contemplated in any  forward-looking  statements  include,
among others, the following:  deregulation and the unbundling of energy supplies
and services;  an increasingly  competitive energy marketplace;  sales retention
and growth potential in a mature service  territory and a need to contain costs;
ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief, cost recovery,  including the
potential  impact of stranded costs, and other necessary  regulatory  approvals;
Federal  and  State  regulatory  actions;   costs  of  construction;   operating
restrictions;   increased  cost  and   construction   delays   attributable   to
environmental  regulations;  nuclear  decommissioning  and the  availability  of
reprocessing  and storage  facilities  for spent  nuclear  fuel;  licensing  and
regulatory approval necessary for nuclear and other operating  stations;  market
risk; and credit market  concerns.  Enterprise and PSE&G undertake no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information,  future events or otherwise. The foregoing review of factors
pursuant to the Act should not be construed as  exhaustive  or as any  admission
regarding the adequacy of disclosures  made by Enterprise and PSE&G prior to the
effective date of the Act.

        ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

   There are no material changes in or additions to information  reported in the
 Public  Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated  (Enterprise)  and the  Public
 Service  Electric  and Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  1997  Annual  Report on Form 10-K
 regarding  qualitative  and  quantitative  disclosures  about  market  risk  of
 Enterprise, PSE&G and their subsidiaries.

                            PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
                             ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


   Certain  information  reported  under  Item  3 of  Part I of  Public  Service
Enterprise Group Incorporated's (Enterprise) and Public Service Electric and Gas
Company's (PSE&G) 1997Annual Report on Form 10-K is updated below.

     (1) Form 10-K, Page 27. As previously reported, in October 1995, Enterprise
         received a letter  from a  representative  of a  purported  shareholder
         demanding that it commence legal action against certain of its officers
         and directors with regard to nuclear operations of Salem and Hope Creek
         Nuclear  Generating  Stations  (Salem  and Hope  Creek).  The  Board of
         Directors promptly commenced an investigation and advised the purported
         shareholder thereof. While the investigation was pending, the purported
         shareholder  nevertheless  commenced,  by  complaint  filed in December
         1995,  a  shareholder  derivative  action  against  the then  incumbent
         directors,  except Dr. Remick. Similar derivative complaints were filed
         by two profit  sharing  plans and one  individual in February and March
         1996 against Messrs.  Ferland,  Codey, Eliason and others. On March 19,
         1996, the Board's investigation was concluded, and the Board determined
         that this  litigation  should  not have been  instituted  and should be
         terminated.  On July 3, 1996, another individual purported  shareholder
         filed a  similar  complaint  naming  the same  defendants  as the first
         derivative  lawsuit.  The four  complaints  generally  seek recovery of
         damages for alleged losses purportedly arising out of PSE&G's operation
         of Salem and Hope Creek, together with certain other relief,  including
         removal of  certain  executive  officers  of PSE&G and  Enterprise  and
         certain changes in the composition of Enterprise's  Board of Directors.
         On August 21, 1996,  all  defendants  filed motions to dismiss all four
         derivative  actions,  which  motions were denied and attempts to appeal
         were  unsuccessful.  Pursuant to Court Order, on December 31, 1997, the
         defendants  filed  motions for  summary  judgment to dismiss two of the
         cases. In one of the other two cases,  separate motions for partial and
         complete  summary  judgment  were filed by the  defendants  on April 1,
         1998.  In the  fourth  case,  on April 1, 1998 the  defendants  filed a
         motion for partial summary judgment.  All of these motions are pending.
         On April 30,  1998,  the Court  issued a  decision  limiting  discovery
         solely to those  issues  relevant to summary  judgment in the first two
         cases.  The  defendants  expect to file  motions for  complete  summary
         judgment  in the  remaining  two cases.  The  outcome of these  matters
         cannot be predicted.

    Other Matters.  As previously  reported,  on March 18, 1997,  Public Service
Conservation Resources Corporation (PSCRC), an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary
of Enterprise and a direct wholly-owned  subsidiary of PSE&G, filed a collection
action against Sycom Enterprises  Limited Partnership (SYCOM) in connection with
PSCRC's  DSM  business.  PSCRC  alleged  that  SYCOM  has  breached  a number of
different loan agreements under which PSCRC is owed approximately $13 million in
principal and interest. On May 7, 1997, SYCOM filed a counterclaim against PSCRC
and a third-party complaint against an officer and certain consultants of PSCRC,
alleging  damages of $750 million and asserting claims that pursuant to statute,
if  successful,  would have  permitted  treble  damages.  On July 11, 1997,  the
Superior Court of New Jersey,  Law Division,  in response to a motion to dismiss
filed by PSCRC, dismissed the State Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization
Act (RICO) counts in SYCOM's counterclaim.  Thereafter, the parties entered into
settlement   discussions  which  culminated  in  the  parties  entering  into  a
comprehensive  settlement  agreement  resolving  all  outstanding  issues in the
dispute.  On January  15,  1998,  the  Superior  Court  entered a consent  order
dismissing the complaint, counterclaim and third party complaint with prejudice.
The  settlement  does not have a  material  effect on the  financial  condition,
results of operations and net cash flows of Enterprise or PSE&G. (Public Service
Conservation  Resources  Corporation v. Sycom Enterprises  Limited  Partnership,
Docket No.  L-2744-97  Superior  Court of New Jersey,  Law  Division,  Middlesex
County).

                             ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

   Certain  information  reported  under  Enterprise's  and PSE&G's  1997 Annual
Report to the SEC is updated  below.  References are to the related pages of the
Form 10-K as printed and distributed.

Nuclear Operations

   Form 10-K, Page 9

   PECO Energy has advised  PSE&G that Peach Bottom Unit 3 (Peach  Bottom 3) was
shut down  from  March 13  through  March  31,  1998 to  repair  cracks in three
recirculation  system jet pump  risers  within  the  reactor  vessel.  Permanent
repairs  have been  completed,  and Peach  Bottom 3 has  returned  to full power
operation.

   Form 10-K, Page 10

   In a March 1998 letter to PSE&G, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said
that two  issues  identified  at Hope  Creek  have  resulted  in two  Level  III
violations and an associated $55,000 civil penalty. PSE&G met with NRC officials
earlier this year and discussed these issues,  including  corrective actions and
improvements.  These were implemented  across the Nuclear Business Unit (NBU) to
ensure the continued safe,  reliable  operation of all three nuclear units.  The
first issue was  identified  at Hope Creek during an NRC  inspection in November
1997,  while the unit was shut down for normal  refueling  maintenance.  The NRC
noted that certain plant conditions  required more strict  procedure  compliance
and  management  oversight  than was  provided.  This resulted in one of the two
Level III  violations  and the civil  penalty.  The NRC issued the civil penalty
because a similar issue had been identified in 1996.

   The second issue concerned the  implementation of the Maintenance Rule, which
requires  utilities to monitor the effectiveness of equipment  reliability.  The
NRC said that PSE&G's  Maintenance  Rule  program did not include all  necessary
equipment.  Because  this issue was  self-identified  and  immediate  corrective
actions were taken, the NRC issued a Level III violation with no civil penalty.

   Form 10-K, Page 10

   As  previously  reported,  on  December  9, 1997,  predecisional  enforcement
conferences  were held to discuss two allegations  concerning  security  program
issues which occurred at Salem and Hope Creek. On April 24, 1998, the NRC issued
a severity  Level III violation for one of these matters and informed PSE&G that
it would await issuance of the Secretary of Labor's  Administrative Review Board
decision before making an enforcement decision in the other matter. There was no
civil  penalty  issued by the NRC for this  violation.  PSE&G does not intend to
contest this violation. PSE&G cannot predict what other actions, if any, the NRC
may take in regard to the second matter.

   Form 10-K, Page 27

   As previously  reported, a lawsuit filed by PECO Energy and DP&L as co-owners
of Salem in 1996 against Enterprise and PSE&G in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern  District  of  Pennsylvania  alleging  mismanagement  by  PSE&G  in  its
operation  of Salem was settled on May 12,  1997.  This  settlement  included an
obligation  for PSE&G to pay $1.4 million for each reactor month that the outage
continued  beyond an  aggregate  outage of 64  reactor  months,  up to a maximum
payment  under this  provision of $17 million.  PSE&G will not make any payments
under this  provision  since the aggregate  Salem outage was 61 reactor  months.
Salem Unit 2 returned to service on August 30, 1997 and Salem Unit 1 returned to
service on April 17, 1998.

Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)

   Form 10-K, Page 12

   As previously  reported,  on February 10, 1998, the State agency  responsible
for locating a site for a LLRW  disposal  facility  recommended  to the Governor
that this effort be  abandoned.  The Governor has accepted the agency's  plan to
reduce  the  scope of siting  activities  since the  development  of a  disposal
facility  in New Jersey  may not be  economically  feasible  in light of current
out-of-state  disposal options. As a result, the LLRW budget already adopted for
fiscal year 1999 and attention to the unspent funds paid by waste  generators in
New Jersey to finance the siting process will be reconsidered.

Other State Regulatory Matters

   Form 10-K, Page 4

   As previously reported in the 1997 Form 10-K, on December 3, 1997, one of the
interstate   pipeline  companies  from  which  PSE&G  obtains  service  filed  a
declaratory judgment action with FERC challenging PSE&G's  interpretation of the
capacity  release  rules.  Under the  interpretation  proposed by the interstate
pipeline company, PSE&G would be required to guarantee the performance of Public
Service Energy Trading Company (PSETC) under the transferred  agreements.  PSE&G
disagreed with these claims and filed a protest challenging the December 3, 1997
filing.  On February 11, 1998,  FERC ruled in favor of the  interstate  pipeline
company finding that it was not  unreasonable for the pipeline company to refuse
to discharge PSE&G under the circumstances  addressed in the order. On April 29,
1998, FERC issued an order on rehearing in which it denied PSE&G's request for a
rehearing.  Management  of  Enterprise  and  PSE&G is  reviewing  its  legal and
regulatory options.

Public  Service  Electric and Gas Company,  a  corporation  duly  organized  and
existing  under the laws of the State of New Jersey  (the  "Company" ) and First
Fidelity Bank, National  Association,  a national banking association  organized
and  existing  under the laws of the United  States of America,  as trustee (the
"Trustee")  under the Indenture dated as of November 1, 1994 between the Company
and the Trustee.

     WHEREAS,  the Company  executed and  delivered  the  Indenture  dated as of
November 1, 1994 to the Trustee to provide  for the  issuance of its  deferrable
interest subordinated  debentures (the "Debentures") in series from time to time
as might be  determined  by the Company and  pursuant  thereto,  the Company has
issued its 9-3/8% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debentures, Series A.

     WHEREAS,  the Company is the general partner of Public Service Electric and
Gas Capital,  L.P., a New Jersey limited partnership (the "Partnership"),  which
intends  to  issue  an  additional  series  of  its  limited  partner  interests
designated 8% Cumulative  Monthly  Income  Preferred  Securities,  Series B (the
"Series B Preferred Securities") and to loan the proceeds thereof, together with
the investment by the Company,  as its sole general partner,  in the Partnership
to the Company.

     WHEREAS, in order to evidence its intention to make such loan and to accept
the  Debentures  as evidence of such loan,  and its approval of the terms of the
Series B Debentures (as hereinafter defined), the Partnership has joined in this
First Supplemental Indenture.

     WHEREAS,  the  Company has  authorized  the  issuance of its 8%  Deferrable
Interest  Subordinated  Debentures,  Series B (the  "Series  B  Debentures")  to
evidence its  obligations  with respect to the loan from the  Partnership of the
proceeds of the Series B Preferred  Securities and the related investment by the
Company,  as its  sole  general  partner,  in the  Partnership,  and to  provide
therefor,  the Company has duly  authorized  the  execution and delivery of this
First Supplemental Indenture.

     WHEREAS,  all things  necessary to make the Series B  Debentures  when duly
issued and executed by the Company and  authenticated  and delivered  hereunder,
the  valid  obligations  of the  Company,  and to make this  First  Supplemental
Indenture a valid and binding  agreement of the Company,  in accordance with its

                        NOW THEREFORE:

     Each of the Company and the Trustee,  intending to be legally bound hereby,
agrees as  follows  for the  benefit  of the  other  party and for the equal and
ratable  benefit  of the  holders  of the  Debentures,  including  the  Series B

duties,  assessments  or  governmental  charges of whatever  nature  (other than

substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto. The terms and provisions
contained in the Series B Debentures shall constitute,  and are hereby expressly
made, a part of this First Supplemental Indenture.  The Company and the Trustee,
by their execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms
and provisions and to be bound thereby.
<PAGE>
     The aggregate  principal  amount of Series B Debentures  outstanding at any
time may not  exceed  $61,855,670  except as  provided  in  Section  2.09 of the

     The Stated  Maturity Date of the Series B Debentures is September 15, 2044.
The  interest  rate of the Series B Debentures  is 8% per annum plus  Additional

     The  Interest  Payment  Dates  for the  Series  B  Debentures  are the last
calendar day of each month of each year  commencing  September  30, 1995. In the
event that any date on which  interest is payable on the Series B Debentures  is

payment in respect of any such delay),  except that,  if such Business Day is in
the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on such date.  The Regular  Record Date for each  Interest  Payment Date for the
Series B Debentures  shall be the 15th day of each month,  provided  that if the
Partnership  is the sole  Holder  of the  Series B  Debentures  or the  Series B
Debentures are issued in book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be
the close of business on the Business Day next preceding  such Interest  Payment
Date.

     Each Series B Debenture shall bear interest from its Issue Date or from the
most  recent  Interest  Payment  Date to which  interest  has been  paid or duly
provided for with respect to such Series B  Debenture;  except that,  so long as
there is no  existing  Defaulted  Interest or  Extension  Period on the Series B
Debentures,  any Series B Debenture  authenticated  by the  Trustee  between the
Regular Record Date for any Interest Payment Date and such Interest Payment Date
shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date.

     Overdue  principal of, and interest on, any Series B Debenture and interest
which has been deferred  pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Indenture shall bear
interest  (to the  extent  that the  payment of such  interest  shall be legally
enforceable) at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate per annum, including
Additional Interest, if any, payable on such Series B Debenture.

     The Series B Debentures  shall be issuable only in registered  form without
coupons and only in denominations of $25 and any integral multiple thereof.

                     PUBLIC SERVICE ELECTRIC AND GAS COMPANY

                 8% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture,
                                    Series B

No. 1


     Public  Service  Electric and Gas Company,  a New Jersey  corporation  (the
"Company",  which term  includes any successor  corporation  under the Indenture
hereinafter  referred to), for value received,  hereby promises to pay to Public
Service Electric and Gas Capital,  L.P. or registered assigns, the principal sum
of Sixty-one Million Eight Hundred  Fifty-Five  Thousand and Six Hundred Seventy
Dollars  ($61,855,670) on September 15, 2044, and to pay interest on said
principal sum from September 15, 1995 or from the most recent  Interest  Payment
Date (as defined  below) to which  interest has been paid or duly  provided for,
monthly  in  arrears  on the  last  day of each  calendar  month  of  each  year
commencing  September 30, 1995 (each, an "Interest Payment Date") at the rate of
8% per annum plus Additional Interest,  if any, until the principal hereof shall
have become due and  payable,  and on any overdue  principal  and (to the extent
that  payment of such  interest  is  enforceable  under  applicable  law) on any
overdue  installment  of  interest  at the same rate per  annum.  The  amount of
interest  payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In the event that any Interest  Payment
Date is not a Business Day, then interest will be payable on the next succeeding
day which is a  Business  Day (and  without  any  interest  or other  payment in
respect of any such  delay),  except that,  if such  Business Day is in the next
succeeding  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall  be  made  on the  immediately
preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on such date. The interest  installment so payable,  and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest  Payment Date will, as provided in the  Indenture,
be paid to the person in whose name this Debenture is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for such interest  installment,  which shall
be the 15th day of each month,  provided  that if all of the Series B Debentures
(as defined  below) are then held by the  Partnership or the Series B Debentures
are held in book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of
business on the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such
interest  installment  not punctually  paid or duly provided for shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular  Record Date, and may be paid
to the  person  in whose  name  this  Debenture  is  registered  at the close of
business on a Special  Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below)
for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the
Holders of the Series B  Debentures  not less than 7 days prior to such  Special
Record Date, as more fully provided in the Indenture.
<PAGE>
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this  Debenture will be made in
such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at the time of payment
is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest on
an Interest  Payment Date will be made by check  mailed to the Holder  hereof at
the address  shown in the  Register or, at the option of the Holder  hereof,  to
such  other  place in the  United  States  of  America  as Holder  hereof  shall
designate  to the  Trustee in  writing.  At the  request of a Holder of at least
$10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series B Debentures,  interest on such
Debentures will be payable by wire transfer within the continental United States
in immediately  available funds to the bank account number  specified in writing
by such holder to the Registrar prior to the Regular Record Date.

     The principal amount hereof and interest due on the Stated Maturity Date or
a Redemption  Date (other than an Interest  Payment Date) will be paid only upon
surrender of this  Debenture at the  principal  corporate  trust office of First
Fidelity Bank, National Association,  Paying Agent, in Newark, New Jersey, or at
such other office or agency of the Paying Agent as the Company  shall  designate
by written notice to the Holder of this Debenture.

     The indebtedness  evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided in
the Indenture,  subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of all Senior Indebtedness,  and this Debenture is issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  The Holder of this Debenture,
by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions,  (b)
authorizes  and  directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or  appropriate to  acknowledge  or effectuate  the  subordination  so
provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.  The Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice
of the acceptance of the  subordination  provisions  contained herein and in the
Indenture  by each holder of Senior  Indebtedness,  whether now  outstanding  or
hereafter  incurred,   and  waives  reliance  by  each  such  Holder  upon  said
provisions.

     This  Debenture is one of a duly  authorized  series of  Debentures  of the
Company (herein sometimes  referred to as the "Series B Debentures"),  specified
in the Indenture,  limited in aggregate  principal amount to $61,855,670  issued
under and  pursuant to an  Indenture  dated as of November 1, 1994  executed and
delivered between the Company and First Fidelity Bank, National Association,  as
trustee (the  "Trustee"),  as supplemented by the First  Supplemental  Indenture
dated as of  September  1,  1995  between  the  Company  and the  Trustee  (said
Indenture as so supplemented being hereinafter  referred to as the "Indenture").

<PAGE>

Reference is made to the Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a
description  of the  rights,  limitations  of  rights,  obligations,  duties and

Debentures.  By  the  terms  of  the  Indenture,  subordinated  debentures  (the
"Debentures")  are  issuable  in  series  which may vary as to  amount,  date of
maturity, rate of interest and in other respects as in the Indenture provided.

     The Series B  Debentures  are  subject  to  mandatory  redemption  prior to
maturity at 100% of the principal  amount  thereof plus accrued  interest to the
Redemption Date as follows:

                        (i)         in whole upon the dissolution and winding up
                                    of the  Partnership,  unless,  in connection
                                    with such  dissolution  and  winding up, the
                                    Series B Debentures  are  distributed to the
                                    holders of the 8% Cumulative  Monthly Income
                                    Preferred Securities,  Series B (the "Series
                                    B Preferred  Securities") in accordance with
                                    the terms thereof; and

                        (ii)        in whole or in part upon a redemption of the
                                    Series  B  Preferred  Securities,  but if in
                                    part, in an aggregate principal amount equal
                                    to   the   aggregate   stated    liquidation
                                    preference   of  the   Series  B   Preferred
                                    Securities redeemed.

     At the option of the Company,  the Series B Debentures are redeemable prior
to maturity  (i) at any time after the  Company is  required  to pay  Additional
Interest on the Series B Debentures, in whole or in part, (ii) at any time on or
after  September 15, 2000,  in whole or in part,  and (iii) if a Tax Event shall
occur and be continuing, in whole (but not in part), in each case at 100% of the
principal  amount  thereof plus accrued  interest to the Redemption  Date.  "Tax
Event" shall mean that the Partnership shall have received an opinion of counsel
(which  may be  regular  counsel  to the  Company  or an  Affiliate,  but not an
employee thereof) experienced in such matters to the effect that, as a result of
any amendment to, or change (including any announced prospective change) in, the
laws (or any  regulations  thereunder)  of the  United  States or any  political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting  taxation,  or as a
result  of  any  official  administrative  pronouncement  or  judicial  decision
interpreting or applying such laws or regulations,  which amendment or change is
effective or such  interpretation  or pronouncement is announced on or after the
date of original  issuance of the Series B Preferred  Securities,  there is more
than an insubstantial  risk that (i) the Partnership is subject to United States
Federal  income tax with respect to interest  received on the Debentures or (ii)
interest payable by the Company to the Partnership on the Debentures will not be
deductible for United States Federal income tax purposes or the Partnership will
otherwise not be taxed as a partnership  or (iii) the  Partnership is subject to
more than a de  minimis  amount of other  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or other
governmental charges.
<PAGE>

     At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption  Date, the
Trustee shall mail or caused to be mailed a notice of redemption by  first-class
mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Debentures to be redeemed.

     In the event of redemption  of this  Debenture in part only, a new Series B
Debenture or Debentures for the unredeemed  portion hereof will be issued in the
name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

     In case an Event of  Default,  as  defined  in the  Indenture,  shall  have
occurred  and  be  continuing,  the  principal  of  and  interest  on all of the
Debentures  may be declared,  and upon such  declaration  shall become,  due and
payable,  in the manner,  with the effect and subject to the conditions provided
in the Indenture.

     The Indenture contains  provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire
indebtedness  of this  Debenture  upon  compliance  by the Company  with certain
conditions set forth therein.

     Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture which require the consent of
every  Holder,  the  Company  and the  Trustee  may amend the  Indenture  or the
Debentures  issued thereunder or may waive future compliance by the Company with
any provisions of the Indenture or the Debentures  issued  thereunder (i) if the
Partnership is the sole Holder of the  Debentures  issued  thereunder,  with the
written consent of the Special  Representative or, if no Special  Representative
has been appointed, the Partnership,  at the direction of the holders of 66 2/3%
of the aggregate stated  liquidation  preference of the Preferred  Securities at
the time  outstanding,  or (ii) if the Partnership is not the sole Holder of the
Debentures,  with the  consent of the  Holders of at least 66 2/3% in  aggregate
principal  amount  of the  Debentures  issued  under the  Indenture  at the time
outstanding. Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture, without the consent
of any Holder of the Debentures issued under the Indenture,  the Company and the
Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Debentures to cure any ambiguity,  defect
or  inconsistency,  to bind a successor to the obligations of the Indenture,  to
provide for uncertificated Debentures in addition to certificated Debentures, to
comply with any  requirements  of the Debentures and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the  qualification of the Indenture under the TIA,
or to make any change that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,  does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder of the Debentures. Amendments bind all
Holders and subsequent Holders of Debentures.



<PAGE>
     No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or
the  Indenture  shall alter or impair the  obligation  of the Company,  which is
absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay  the  principal  of and  interest  on this
Debenture  at the  time  and  place  and at the  rate  and in the  money  herein
prescribed.

     So long as an Event of Default  has not  occurred  and is  continuing,  the
Company  shall  have the right at any time and from  time to time to extend  the
interest payment period of the Debentures issued under the Indenture,  including
the Series B Debentures,  to up to 60 consecutive months (the "Extended Interest
Payment Period"), provided that no Extended Interest Payment Period shall extend
beyond the Stated Maturity Date or Redemption Date of any Debenture issued under
the Indenture.  At the end of the Extended Interest Payment Period,  the Company
shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid  (together with interest  thereon
at the respective  rates  specified for the  Debentures,  including the Series B
Debentures,  to the extent that payment of such  interest is  enforceable  under
applicable law). During such Extended  Interest Payment Period,  the Company may
not  declare  or pay  any  dividend  on,  redeem,  purchase,  acquire  or make a
liquidation  payment  with  respect to, any of its capital  stock.  Prior to the
termination  of any such  Extended  Interest  Payment  Period,  the  Company may
further  extend  such  Extended  Interest  Payment  Period,  provided  that such
Extended  Interest  Payment  Period  together with all such previous and further
extensions thereof shall not exceed 60 consecutive months. At the termination of
any such Extended  Interest  Payment  Period and upon the payment of all amounts
then due, the Company may select a new Extended Interest Payment Period, subject
to the foregoing restrictions.

     Series B Debentures are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations  of $25 and any  integral  multiple  thereof.  As  provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain  limitations  therein set forth, this Debenture
is exchangeable for a like aggregate  principal amount of Series B Debentures of
a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same.

     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth,  this  Debenture is  transferable  by the Holder hereof upon surrender of
this  Debenture  for  registration  of  transfer  at the office or agency of the
Registrar accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series B Debentures of
authorized  denominations  and for the same aggregate  principal  amount will be
issued to the designated  transferee or  transferees.  No service charge will be
made for any  such  transfer,  but the  Company  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge  payable in relation
thereto.

<PAGE>
     Prior to presentment for  registration  of transfer of this Debenture,  the
Company,  the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Registrar may deem and treat the
Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof  (whether or not this Debenture shall
be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by
anyone other than the Registrar)  for the purpose of receiving  payment of or on
account  of the  principal  hereof  and  interest  due  hereon and for all other
purposes,  and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying  Agent nor any
Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

     No  recourse  shall  be had  for the  payment  of the  principal  of or the
interest on this  Debenture,  or for any claim based  hereon,  or  otherwise  in
respect  hereof,  or  based  on or in  respect  of the  Indenture,  against  any
incorporator,  stockholder,  officer or director,  past,  present or future,  as
such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation,  whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability being, by the acceptance
hereof  and as part of the  consideration  for the  issuance  hereof,  expressly
waived and released.

     Each term used in this Debenture  which is defined in the Indenture and not
defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Indenture.

     This  Debenture  shall not be valid until an  authorized  signatory  of the
Trustee  manually signs and dates the Trustee's  Certificate  of  Authentication
below.

     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused  this  Debenture  to be signed
manually or by  facsimile  by a duly  authorized  officer and a facsimile of its
corporate seal to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon.

Section 2.01(d),  interest on the Debentures shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months, and for any period shorter than
thirty days, interest will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in such period.

                                    Unless otherwise provided with  respect to a
series of Debentures,

     (i)  the principal and  Redemption  Price of and interest on each Debenture
          shall be payable  in such coin or  currency  of the  United  States of
          America as at the time of payment is legal  tender for the  payment of

          payable on the Stated Maturity Date (if other than an Interest Payment

          Debenture at the office or agency of any Paying Agent therefor; and

     (iii)interest on any Debenture shall be paid on each Interest  Payment Date

          Date  therefor,  such  interest  to be payable by check  mailed to the
          address of the Person entitled  thereto as such address appears on the
          Register;  provided  however,  that (1) at the written  request of the
          Holder  of  at  least  $10,000,000   aggregate   principal  amount  of
          Debentures received by the Registrar not later than the Regular Record
          Date  for  such  Interest  Payment  Date,  interest  accrued  on  such
          Debenture  will be payable  by wire  transfer  within the  continental
          United  States  in  immediately  available  funds to the bank  account
          number of such  Holder  specified  in such  request and entered on the
          Register by the  Registrar  and (2) payments made in respect of global
          Debentures  shall  be  made  in  immediately  available  funds  to the
          Depositary.

                                    Except as specified pursuant to Section 2.01
or Section  4.01(b) hereof,  interest on any Debenture which is payable,  and is
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall
be paid to the Person in whose name that  Debenture (or one or more  Predecessor
Debentures)  is registered  at the close of business on the Regular  Record Date
for such interest.  Any interest on any Debenture  which is payable,  but is not
punctually  paid or duly  provided  for, on any  Interest  Payment  Date (herein
called  "Defaulted  Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant  Regular  Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,  and
such  Defaulted  Interest  may be paid by the  Company,  at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) and (2) below:

     (1)  The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the
          Persons in whose names the Debentures (or their respective Predecessor
          Debentures)  are  registered  at the  close of  business  on a Special
          Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be
          fixed in the following  manner.  The Company  shall,  not less than 15
          Business  Days prior to the date of the proposed  payment,  notify the
          Trustee  and the Paying  Agent in  writing of the amount of  Defaulted
          Interest  proposed  to be paid on each  Debenture  and the date of the
          proposed payment,  and at the same time the Company shall deposit with
          the  Paying  Agent an amount of money  equal to the  aggregate  amount
          proposed  to be paid in respect of such  Defaulted  Interest  or shall
          make  arrangements  satisfactory  to the Paying Agent for such deposit
          prior to the date of the proposed  payment,  such money when deposited
          to be held in trust for the  benefit of the  Persons  entitled to such
          Defaulted Interest as in this Clause provided. The Special Record Date
          for the  payment  of such  Defaulted  Interest  shall be the  close of
          business on the tenth  calendar  day prior to the date of the proposed
          payment.  The  Trustee  shall,  in the name and at the  expense of the
          Company,  cause  notice  of the  proposed  payment  of such  Defaulted
          Interest  and the  Special  Record  Date  therefor  to be given to the
          Holders  thereof,  not less than 7 calendar days prior to such Special
          Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest
          and the Special Record Date therefor having been given, such Defaulted
          Interest  shall be paid to the Persons in whose  names the  Debentures
          (or their  respective  Predecessor  Debentures)  are registered at the
          close of business on such  Special  Record Date and shall no longer be
          payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).

     (2)  The  Company  may  make  payment  of  any  Defaulted  Interest  on the
          Debentures  in any  other  lawful  manner  not  inconsistent  with the
          requirements  of any securities  exchange on which such Debentures may
          be listed,  and upon such notice as may be required by such  exchange,
          if,  after  notice  given by the Company to the Trustee and the Paying
          Agent of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause,  such manner of
          payment shall be deemed practicable by the Paying Agent.

                                    Subject to the foregoing  provisions of this
Section,  each Debenture  delivered  under this Indenture upon  registration  of
transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Debenture shall carry
the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue,  which were carried by
such other Debenture.

               SECTION 2.04 Execution, Authentication and Delivery

     (a)  The  Debentures  shall be  executed  on behalf of the  Company  by its

          ceased to hold such offices prior to the  authentication  and delivery
          of such  Debentures  or did not hold such  offices at the date of such
          Debentures.

          be valid or  obligatory  for any purpose  unless there appears on such
          Debenture a Certificate of Authentication duly executed by the Trustee
          by  manual  signature  of a Trust  Officer,  and such  Certificate  of
          Authentication  upon any Debenture shall be conclusive  evidence,  and

          made available for delivery hereunder.

          (3)  unless previously delivered,  this Indenture or a supplemental
               indenture hereto setting forth the form of such Debentures and

                    conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and

               (ii) such  Debentures,  when  authenticated  and delivered by the
                    Trustee  and  issued  and  delivered  by the  Company in the
                    manner  and  subject  to any  conditions  specified  in such
                    Opinion of Counsel,  will have been duly  issued  under this
                    Indenture  and will  constitute  valid and  legally  binding

                    provided by this  Indenture,  and  enforceable in accordance
                    with  their  terms,  subject,  as  to  enforcement  to  laws
                    relating  to  or  affecting  generally  the  enforcement  of
                    creditors' rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy
                    and  insolvency  laws and to  general  principles  of equity
                    (regardless of whether such  enforceability is considered in
                    a proceeding in equity or at law); and

               (iii)that this Indenture or any supplemental  indenture  referred
                    to in clause  (3) above has been duly  authorized,  executed

                    with its terms,  subject as to  enforcement to laws relating
                    to  or  affecting  creditors'  rights,  including,   without
                    limitation,  bankruptcy and  insolvency  laws and to general
                    principles   of   equity   (regardless   of   whether   such
                    enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
                    law); and

               (iv) that all consents,  approvals and orders of any  commission,
                    governmental authority or agency required in connection with
                    the  issuance  and  delivery  of such  Debentures  have been

               Default has occurred and is continuing.

          (f)  The  Trustee  shall  act as  the  initial  authenticating  agent.
               Thereafter,  the Trustee may appoint an authenticating  agent. An
               authenticating  agent may  authenticate  Debentures  whenever the
               Trustee  may  do  so.  Each   reference  in  this   Indenture  to
               authentication  by the Trustee  includes  authentication  by such
               agent. The Trustee shall pay any  authenticating  agent appointed
               by the Trustee  reasonable  compensation for its services and the
               Trustee  shall be  reimbursed  for such  payment  by the  Company

maintained, within or outside the State of New Jersey, an office or agency where
the Debentures may be presented for registration of transfer or for
exchange  ("Registrar"),  a Paying Agent at whose office the  Debentures  may be
presented or surrendered for payment,  and an office or agency where notices and
demands to or upon the Company in respect of the  Debentures  and this Indenture
may be served.  The  Registrar  shall keep a register  (the  "Register")  of the
Debentures and of their transfer and exchange.  The Company may have one or more
co-Registrars  and one or more  additional  Paying  Agents.  The term  Registrar
includes  any  additional  registrar  and the term  Paying  Agent  includes  any
additional  paying  agent.  The corporate  office of the Trustee in Newark,  New
Jersey,  shall  initially be the Registrar for the Series A Debentures and agent
for service of notice or demands on the Company, and the Trustee shall initially
be the Paying Agent for the Series A Debentures.

                                    The Company shall enter into an  appropriate
agency  agreement with any Registrar,  Paying Agent or co-Registrar  (if not the
Company or the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee). The agreement shall
implement  the  provisions  of this  Indenture  that relate to such  agent.  The
Company  shall give prompt  written  notice to the Trustee and to the Holders of
any change of  location  of such  office or agency.  If at any time the  Company
shall fail to maintain or cause to be  maintained  any such  required  office or
agency or shall fail to furnish  the  Trustee  with the  address  thereof,  such
presentations,  surrenders,  notices  and  demands  may be made or served at the
address of the  Trustee set forth in Section  11.02  hereof.  The Company  shall
notify the  Trustee of the name and  address of any such  agent.  If the Company
fails to maintain a  Registrar,  Paying Agent or agent for service of notices or
demands,  the Trustee  shall act as such and shall be  entitled  to  appropriate
compensation  therefor  pursuant  to Section  7.07  hereof.  The  Company or any
Affiliate  of the Company may act Paying  Agent,  Registrar or  co-Registrar  or
agent for service of notices and demands.

                                    The  Company  may  also  from  time  to time
designate  one or more other  offices or agencies  where the  Debentures  may be
presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time
rescind such  designations.  The Company will give prompt  written notice to the
Trustee  and to the Holders of any such  designation  or  rescission  and of any
change in location of any such other office or agency.

                SECTION 2.06 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust

                                    Except as otherwise  provided herein,  prior
to or on each due date of the  principal of and premium (if any) and interest on
any Debenture, the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum of
money  sufficient  to pay such  principal,  premium  (if any)  and  interest  so
becoming  due.  The Company  shall  require  each Paying  Agent  (other than the
Trustee or the Company) to agree in writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in
trust for the  benefit of Holders  or the  Trustee  all money held by the Paying
Agent for the payment of  principal  of and premium (if any) and interest on the
Debentures  and shall notify the Trustee of any Default by the Company in making
any such payment.  At any time during the  continuance of any such Default,  the
Paying  Agent  shall,  upon the  request of the  Trustee,  forthwith  pay to the
Trustee all money so held in trust and account  for any money  disbursed  by it.
The Company at any time may  require a Paying  Agent to pay all money held by it
to the Trustee and to account for any money  disbursed by it. Upon doing so, the
Paying Agent shall have no further  liability  for the money so paid over to the
Trustee.  If the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate of either of them acts as
Paying Agent,  it shall  segregate the money held by it as Paying Agent and hold
it as a separate trust fund.

                       SECTION 2.07 Debentureholder Lists

                                    The Trustee  shall  preserve in as current a
form as is reasonably  practicable  the most recent list  available to it of the
names and addresses of Debentureholders. If the Trustee is not the
Registrar,  the Company  shall cause to be furnished to the Trustee on or before
the Record Date for each  Interest  Payment  Date and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing,  within five Business  Days of such  request,  a
list,  in such  form as the  Trustee  may  reasonably  require  of the names and
addresses of Debentureholders.

                       SECTION 2.08 Transfer and Exchange

                                    When   Debentures  are   presented   to  the
Registrar  or a  co-Registrar  with a request to  register  the  transfer or to
exchange them for an equal principal  amount of Debentures of the same series of
other  authorized  denominations,  the Registrar  shall register the transfer or
make  the  exchange  as  requested  if  its  reasonable  requirements  for  such
transactions  are met. To permit  registrations  of transfer and exchanges,  the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Debentures,  all at the
Registrar's request.

                                    Every Debenture presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or
the Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Registrar  duly executed by the Holder or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

                                    The Company  shall not require  payment of a
service charge for any  registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures,  but
the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to pay all taxes,
assessments or other governmental charges that may be imposed in connection with
the   registration   of  the  transfer  or  exchange  of  Debentures   from  the
Debentureholder requesting such transfer or exchange (other than any exchange of
a temporary  Debenture  for a definitive  Debenture  not involving any change in
ownership).

                                    The  Company  shall not be required to make,
and the Registrar need not register, transfers or exchanges of (a) any Debenture
for a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the
mailing  of a notice of  redemption  of  Debentures  and  ending at the close of
business on the day of such  mailing or (b) any  Debenture  selected,  called or
being called for redemption, except, in the case of any Debenture to be redeemed
in part, the portion thereof not to be redeemed.

                       SECTION 2.09 Replacement Debentures

                                    If   (a)   any   mutilated    Debenture   is
surrendered  to the Company or the  Trustee,  or (b) the Company and the Trustee
receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Debenture,  and there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee such Debenture
or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless,  then, in
the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Debenture has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute in exchange for any
such  mutilated  Debenture  or in lieu of any  such  destroyed,  lost or  stolen
Debenture,  a new  Debenture of the same series and of like tenor and  principal
amount,  bearing a number not  contemporaneously  outstanding,  and the  Trustee
shall authenticate and make such new Debenture available for delivery.

                                    In case any such mutilated,  destroyed, lost
or stolen  Debenture  has  become or is about to become due and  payable,  or is
about to be redeemed by the Company pursuant to Article 3 hereof, the Company in
its discretion  may,  instead of issuing a new  Debenture,  pay or purchase such
Debenture, as the case may be.

                                    Upon  the  issuance  of any  new  Debentures
under this Section 2.09, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge  that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses  (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee)
in connection therewith.

                                    Every new Debenture  issued pursuant to this
Section 2.09 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall
constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company (whether
or not the mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen Debenture shall be at any time
enforceable) and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and
ratably with any and all other Debentures duly issued hereunder.


                                    The provisions of this Section 2.09 are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent  lawful) all other rights and 
remedies  with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, 
lost or stolen Debentures.

     SECTION 2.10 Outstanding Debentures; Determinations of Holders' Action

                                    Debentures  outstanding  at any time are all
the  Debentures  authenticated  by the Trustee  except for those canceled by it,
those delivered to it for  cancellation,  those  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or
stolen  Debentures  referred to in Section  2.09 hereof,  those  redeemed by the
Company  pursuant to Article 3 hereof,  and those described in this Section 2.10
as not  outstanding.  A Debenture does not cease to be  outstanding  because the
Company or a Subsidiary  or Affiliate  thereof  holds the  Debenture;  provided,
however,  that in  determining  whether the Holders of the  requisite  principal
amount  of  Debentures   have  given  or  concurred  in  any  request,   demand,
authorization,  direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Debentures owned
by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate (other than any Trust so long as any
of the Preferred  Securities of such Trust are outstanding) shall be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding.

                                    Subject to the  foregoing,  only  Debentures
outstanding  at the time of such  determination  shall be considered in any such
determination (including determinations pursuant to Articles 3, 6 and 9).

                                    If  a  Debenture  is  replaced  pursuant  to
Section 2.09 hereof,  it ceases to be  outstanding  unless the Trustee  receives
proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Debenture is held by a bona fide
purchaser.

                                    If the Paying Agent (other than the Company)
holds, in accordance  with this  Indenture,  at the Stated Maturity Date or on a
Redemption Date,  money  sufficient to pay the Debentures  payable on that date,
then  immediately on the Stated  Maturity Date or such  Redemption  Date, as the
case may be, such  Debentures  shall cease to be outstanding,  and interest,  if
any, on such Debentures shall cease to accrue.

                        SECTION 2.11 Temporary Debentures

                                   The Company may execute temporary Debentures,
and upon the  Company's  Order,  the Trustee shall  authenticate  and make such
temporary  Debentures  available for  delivery.  Temporary  Debentures  shall be
printed, lithographed,  typewritten,  mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any
authorized  denomination,  in the same series and  principal  amount and of like
tenor as the  definitive  Debentures  in lieu of which  they are issued and with
such appropriate  insertions,  omissions,  substitutions and other variations as
the  Officers  of the  Company  executing  such  Debentures  may  determine,  as
conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Debentures.

                                    After   the    preparation   of   definitive
Debentures,  the  temporary  Debentures  shall be  exchangeable  for  definitive
Debentures of the same series upon surrender of the temporary  Debentures at the
office or agency of the Company  designated for such purpose pursuant to Section
2.05  hereof,  without  charge  to  the  Holders  thereof.  Upon  surrender  for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Debentures,  the Company shall execute
a like  principal  amount  of  definitive  Debentures  of  the  same  series  of
authorized  denominations,  and the Trustee,  upon  receipt of a Company  Order,
shall  authenticate and make such Debentures  available for delivery in exchange
therefor.  Until so exchanged, the temporary Debentures shall in all respects be
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Debentures.

                         SECTION 2.12 Book-Entry System

                                    In order to utilize a book-entry-only system
for all or any portion of the Debentures of any series,  all or a portion of the
Debentures of any series may be issued in the form of one or more fully
registered  Debentures of the same series for the aggregate  principal amount of
such  Debentures of each Issue Date,  interest rate and Stated  Maturity Date (a
"global  Debenture"),  which global Debenture shall be registered in the name of
the depositary (the "Depositary") selected by the Company or in the name of such
Depositary's nominee. Each global Debenture shall be delivered by the Trustee to
the  Depositary  or pursuant to the  Depositary's  instruction  and shall bear a
legend  substantially to the following effect:  "Except as otherwise provided in
Section 2.12 of the Indenture,  this Debenture may be transferred,  in whole but
not in  part,  only to  another  nominee  of the  Depositary  or to a  successor
Depositary or to a nominee of such successor Depositary."

                                    Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Section 2.12 or of Section 2.08 hereof, a global Debenture may be transferred in
whole but not in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.08 hereof,
only by a nominee of the Depositary for such series, or by the Depositary or any
such nominee of a successor  Depositary for such series  selected or approved by
the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.

                                    If (i) at any time the Depositary for global
Debentures of any series of Debentures notifies the Company that it is unwilling
or unable to continue as Depositary for such global Debentures or if at
any time the Depositary for such global Debentures shall no longer be registered
or in good  standing  under the  Exchange  Act or other  applicable  statute  or
regulation,  and a  successor  Depositary  for  such  global  Debentures  is not
appointed by the Company  within 90 days after the Company  receives such notice
or  becomes  aware  of such  condition,  as the case  may be,  (ii) the  Company
determines in its sole  discretion,  that the  Debentures of any series shall no
longer be  represented  by one or more  global  Debentures  and  delivers to the
Trustee an Officer's Certificate evidencing such determination or (iii) an Event
of Default  occurs and is  continuing,  then the provisions of this Section 2.12
shall no longer  apply to the  Debentures  of such  series.  In such event,  the
Company will execute and the Trustee,  upon receipt of an Officer's  Certificate
evidencing such  determination  by the Company,  will  authenticate  and deliver
Debentures  of such series and of like tenor in definitive  registered  form, in
authorized  denominations,  and  in  aggregate  principal  amount  equal  to the
principal  amount of the global  Debentures  of such series in exchange for such
global Debentures. Upon the exchange of global Debentures for such Debentures in
definitive  registered form without coupons,  in authorized  denominations,  the
global  Debentures  shall  be  cancelled  by the  Trustee.  Such  Debentures  in
definitive  registered form issued in exchange for global Debentures pursuant to
this  Section  2.12 shall be  registered  in such  names and in such  authorized
denominations  as the Depositary,  pursuant to  instructions  from its direct or
indirect  participants  or otherwise,  shall  instruct the Trustee.  The Trustee
shall deliver such  Debentures to the Persons in whose names such Debentures are
so registered.

                                    Except   as   provided   above,   owners  of
beneficial  interests  in a global  Debenture  shall not be  entitled to receive
physical  delivery of Debentures  in definitive  form and will not be considered
the Holders thereof for any purpose under this Indenture.

                                    Members of or participants in the Depositary
shall have no rights under this Indenture  with respect to any global  Debenture
held on their behalf by the Depositary,  and such Depositary or its nominee,  as
the case may be, may be treated by the Company,  the  Trustee,  and any agent of
the  Company  or the  Trustee as the Holder of such  global  Debentures  for all
purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent
the  Company,  the  Trustee,  or any agent of the Company or the  Trustee,  from
giving  effect  to  any  written  certification  proxy  or  other  authorization
furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its members
or participants,  the operation of customary practices governing exercise of the
rights of a Holder of any Debenture,  including without  limitation the granting
of proxies or other  authorization  of participants to give or take any request,
demand, authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action which
a Holder is entitled to give or take under this Indenture.

                            SECTION 2.13 Cancellation

                                    All  Debentures   surrendered  for  payment,
redemption  by the  Company  pursuant  to  Article 3 hereof or  registration  of
transfer or exchange shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee,
be delivered to the Trustee and shall be promptly  canceled by the Trustee.  The
Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for  cancellation  any Debentures
previously  authenticated  and made available for delivery  hereunder  which the
Company  may have  acquired  in any manner  whatsoever,  and all  Debentures  so
delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. The Company may not reissue
or issue new  Debentures  to replace  Debentures it has paid or delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation.  No Debentures shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Debentures canceled as provided in this Section 2.13, except as
expressly  permitted  by this  Indenture.  All canceled  Debentures  held by the
Trustee  shall be  destroyed  by the Trustee,  and the Trustee  shall  deliver a
certificate of destruction to the Company.


                                    ARTICLE 3
                                   REDEMPTION

                   SECTION 3.01 Redemption; Notice to Trustee

          (a)  The  Series A  Debentures  are  subject  to  redemption  prior to
               maturity as provided therein.

          (b)  The  redemption  terms for any  additional  series of  Debentures
               shall be as specified in the supplemental indenture creating such
               series of Debentures.

          (c)  If any or all of the  Debentures  are to be redeemed  pursuant to
               Section 3.01 (a) or (b) hereof,  the Company shall deliver to the
               Trustee at least 45 days prior to the  Redemption  Date a Company
               Order specifying the series and principal amount of Debentures to
               be redeemed and the Redemption Date and Redemption Price for such
               Debentures.  Such Company Order shall be  accompanied  by a Board
               Resolution  authorizing such  redemption.  If the Debentures of a
               series are held by a Trust, the Company shall also deliver a copy
               of such Company Order to the Property Trustee for such Trust.

               SECTION 3.02 Selection of Debentures to be Redeemed

                                    If less than all the outstanding  Debentures
of a series  are to be  redeemed  at any time,  the  Trustee  shall  select  the
Debentures of such series to be redeemed by lot or by any other method the
Trustee considers fair and appropriate.  The Trustee shall make the selection at
least 30 but not more than 60 days before the Redemption  Date from  outstanding
Debentures of such series not previously  called for  redemption.  Provisions of
this  Indenture  that apply to Debentures  called for  redemption  also apply to
portions of  Debentures  called for  redemption.  The Trustee  shall  notify the
Company promptly of the Debentures or portions of Debentures to be redeemed.

                        SECTION 3.03 Notice of Redemption

                                    At least  30 days but not more  than 60 days
before the  Redemption  Date,  the  Trustee,  in the  Company's  name and at the
Company's expense, shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of redemption by
first-class mail,  postage prepaid,  to each Holder of Debentures to be redeemed
at such Holder's last address as it appears in the Register.

                                    The notice of redemption  shall identify the
Debentures  to be redeemed,  the provision of the  Debentures or this  Indenture
pursuant to which the Debentures called for redemption are being redeemed
and shall state:

          (1)  the Redemption Date;

          (2)  the Redemption Price;

          (3)  the name and address of the Paying Agent;

          (4)  that payment of the  Redemption  Price of  Debentures  called for
               redemption will be made only upon surrender of such Debentures to
               the Paying Agent;

          (5)  if fewer than all the outstanding Debentures of any series are to
               be redeemed,  the  identification  and  principal  amounts of the
               particular  Debentures  to be redeemed and that, on and after the
               Redemption  Date,  upon  surrender  of  such  Debentures,  a  new
               Debenture or  Debentures of the same series and of like tenor and
               in a principal  amount equal to the  unredeemed  portion  thereof
               will be issued; and

          (6)  that,  unless the Company defaults in paying the Redemption Price
               of the Debentures  called for redemption,  plus accrued  interest
               thereon to the Redemption Date,  interest will cease to accrue on
               such Debentures on and after the Redemption Date.

                                    Any notice of redemption given in the manner
provided  herein shall be conclusively  presumed to have been given,  whether or
not such notice is actually received. Failure to mail any notice or defect
in the mailed notice or the mailing  thereof in respect of any  Debenture  shall
not affect the validity of the redemption of any other Debenture.

                   SECTION 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption

                                    After notice of  redemption  has been given,
Debentures  called for redemption shall become due and payable on the Redemption
Date and at the Redemption  Price and from and after the Redemption Date (unless
the Company  shall  default in the payment of the  Redemption  Price and accrued
interest),  such Debentures shall cease to bear interest.  Upon the later of the
Redemption  Date and the date such  Debentures  are  surrendered  to the  Paying
Agent,  such  Debentures  shall be paid at the  Redemption  Price,  plus accrued
interest to the  Redemption  Date,  provided  that  installments  of interest on
Debentures with an Interest  Payment Date which is on or prior to the Redemption
Date  shall  be  payable  to the  Holders  of  such  Debentures,  or one or more
Predecessor  Debentures,  registered  as such at the  close of  business  on the
Regular Record Dates therefor according to their terms and provisions.

                    SECTION 3.05 Deposit of Redemption Price

                                    On or  prior  to the  Redemption  Date,  the
Company  shall  deposit with the Paying Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate
is the Paying Agent, shall segregate and hold in trust or cause such Affiliate
to segregate and hold in trust) money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of,
and accrued  interest on, all Debentures to be redeemed on that Redemption Date.
The Paying  Agent shall  return to the Company any money in excess of the amount
sufficient  to pay the  Redemption  Price  of,  and  accrued  interest  on,  all
Debentures  to be  redeemed  and any  interest  accrued on the amount  deposited
pursuant to this Section 3.05.

                    SECTION 3.06 Debentures Redeemed in Part

                                    Upon   surrender  of  a  Debenture  that  is
redeemed in part, the Trustee shall  authenticate for the Holder a new Debenture
of the same series and in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of
such Debenture.


                                    ARTICLE 4
                                    COVENANTS

                       SECTION 4.01 Payment of Debentures

          (a)  The Company shall pay the  principal of and premium,  if any, and
               interest  (including interest accruing during an Extension Period
               and/or on or after the  filing of a  petition  in  bankruptcy  or
               reorganization  relating to the  Company,  whether or not a claim
               for  post-filing  interest is allowed in such  proceeding) on the
               Debentures on or prior to the dates and in the manner provided in
               such Debentures or pursuant to this Indenture.  An installment of
               principal,  premium, if any, or interest shall be considered paid
               on the  applicable  due date if on such date the  Trustee  or the
               Paying Agent holds,  in  accordance  with this  Indenture,  money
               sufficient to pay all of such  installment then due. With respect
               to any  Debenture,  the  Company  shall pay  interest  on overdue
               principal  and  interest  on  overdue  installments  of  interest
               (including interest accruing during an Extension Period and/or on
               or after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy or reorganization
               relating to the Company,  whether or not a claim for  post-filing
               interest is allowed in such proceeding), to the extent lawful, at
               the rate per annum borne by such Debenture, compounded quarterly.
               Interest  on overdue  interest  shall  accrue  from the date such
               amounts become overdue.

          (b)  Notwithstanding  the provisions of Section  4.01(a) hereof or any
               other  provision  herein to the contrary,  the Company shall have
               the  right in its sole and  absolute  discretion  at any time and
               from  time  to  time  while  the  Debentures  of any  series  are
               outstanding,  so long as no Event of Default with respect to such
               series of  Debentures  has occurred and is  continuing,  to defer
               payments of interest by extending the interest payment period for
               such series of Debentures for the Extension  Period,  if any, for
               such series of Debentures,  provided that such  Extension  Period
               shall not extend  beyond the Stated  Maturity  Date or Redemption
               Date of any Debenture of such series,  and provided  further that
               at the end of each  Extension  Period the  Company  shall pay all
               interest then accrued and unpaid  (together with interest thereon
               to the extent  permitted by applicable  law at the rate per annum
               borne  by  such  Debentures).  Prior  to  the  termination  of an
               Extension  Period,  the Company may shorten or may further extend
               the  interest  payment  period  for such  series  of  Debentures,
               provided  that  such  Extension  Period  together  with  all such
               previous  and  further  extensions  may not  exceed  the  maximum
               duration of the Extension Period for such series of Debentures or
               extend beyond the Stated  Maturity Date or Redemption Date of any
               Debenture  of such  series.  The  Company  shall give the Trustee
               notice of the Company's election to begin an Extension Period for
               any series of Debentures and any shortening or extension  thereof
               at least one  Business  Day  prior to the date the  notice of the
               record  or  payment  date  of  the  related  distribution  on the
               Preferred  Securities  issued by the Trust which is the Holder of
               the  Debentures of such series or the date payment of interest on
               such   Debentures  is  required  to  be  given  to  any  national
               securities  exchange  on  which  such  Preferred   Securities  or
               Debentures  are then listed or other  applicable  self-regulatory
               organization,  but in any event not less than two  Business  Days
               prior to the Record  Date fixed by the Company for the payment of
               such  interest.  The  Company  shall give or cause the Trustee to
               give  notice (a form of which shall be provided by the Company to

               as to his or her knowledge of the Company's  compliance  with all
               conditions and covenants  under this  Indenture.  For purposes of
               this Section 4.04(a), such compliance shall be determined without
               regard to any period of grace or requirement  of notice  provided
               under this Indenture. If such Officer does know of such a Default
               or Event of Default, the Officer's Certificate shall describe any
               such Default or Event of Default,  and its status. Such Officer's
               Certificate need not comply with Sections 11.04 and 11.05 hereof.

          (b)  The  Company  shall  deliver  to  the  Trustee  any   information
               reasonably  requested  by the  Trustee  in  connection  with  the

whether by way of interest,  fee or otherwise,  to any Holder of any  Debentures
for or as an inducement to any consent,  waiver or amendment of any of the terms
or provisions of this Indenture or the Debentures  unless such  consideration is
offered to be paid or agreed to be paid to all Holders of the  Debentures who so
consent,  waive or agree to amend in the time  frame set forth in the  documents
soliciting such consent, waiver or agreement.

                   SECTION 4.07 Payment of Expenses of Trust I

                                    The  Company  may  not  consolidate  with or
merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets
as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (either in one transaction or
a series of transactions) to, any Person unless:

          (1)  the Person formed by or surviving such consolidation or merger or
               to which such sale, conveyance, transfer or lease shall have been
               made  (the  "Successor")  if  other  than  the  Company,  (a)  is
               organized  and  existing  under the laws of the United  States of
               America or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and (b)

               delivered to the Trustee,  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee,
               all the  obligations  of the Company under the Debentures and the
               Indenture; 

          (2)  immediately  prior to and after giving effect to such transaction
               (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an obligation of the
               Successor   Person  or  any   Subsidiary  as  a  result  of  such
               transaction  as  having  been  incurred  by such  Person  or such
               Subsidiary at the time of such transaction),  no Default or Event
               of Default  shall have  occurred and be  continuing;  and

Company,  and will be  substituted  for, and may exercise every right and power
and  become  the  obligor  on the  Debentures  with  the same  effect  as if the
Successor  had been  named as the  Company  herein  but,  in the case of a sale,
conveyance,  transfer or lease of all or substantially  all of the assets of the
Company, the predecessor Company will not be released from its obligation to pay
the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Debentures.

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

                         SECTION 6.01 Events of Default

                                    An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to
the Debentures of any series if one of the following  shall have occurred and be
continuing:

          (1)  The Company defaults in the payment, when due and payable, of (a)
               interest  on  any  Debenture  of  that  series  and  the  default
               continues  for a period  of 30 days;  provided,  that  during  an
               Extension  Period for the  Debentures of that series,  failure to
               pay  interest  on  the   Debentures  of  that  series  shall  not
               constitute  a Default or Event of Default  hereunder,  or (b) the
               principal of or premium, if any, on any Debentures of that series
               when the same becomes due and payable on the Stated Maturity Date
               thereof, upon acceleration, on any Redemption Date, or otherwise;

          (2)  The  Company  defaults in the  performance  of or fails to comply
               with any of its other  covenants or agreements in the  Debentures
               of that series or this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture
               under  which the  Debentures  of that series may have been issued
               and such  failure  continues  for 60 days  after  receipt  by the
               Company of a "Notice of Default";

          (3)  The Company,  pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy
               Law:

               (a)  commences a voluntary case or proceeding;

               (b)  consents  to the entry of an order for relief  against it in
                    an involuntary case or proceeding;

               (c)  consents to the  appointment of a Custodian of it or for all
                    or substantially all of its property,  and such Custodian is
                    not discharged within 60 days;

               (d)  makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors;
                    or

               (e)  admits in writing its  inability to pay its debts  generally
                    as they become due; or

          (4)  A court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under
               any Bankruptcy Law that:

               (a)  is for relief against the Company in an involuntary  case or
                    proceeding;

               (b)  appoints a Custodian of the Company for all or substantially
                    all of its properties;

               (c)  orders the liquidation of the Company;

               (d)  and in each case the order or decree remains unstayed and in
                    effect for 60 days.

                                    The  foregoing  will  constitute an Event of
Default  whatever  the reason for any such  Event of Default  and  whether it is
voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any
judgment,  decree or order of any court or any order,  rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body.

                                    The term  "Bankruptcy Law" means Title 11 of
the United  States Code,  or any similar  federal or state law for the relief of
debtors. "Custodian" means any receiver, trustee, assignee, liquidator,
sequestrator, custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.

                                    A Default  under  clause (2) above is not an
Event of Default  until (i) the  Trustee  provides a "Notice of  Default" to the
Company or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures  of that  series  at the  time  outstanding  or,  if that  series  of
Debentures  is held  by a  Trust,  the  holders  of at  least  25% in  aggregate
liquidation amount of the outstanding Preferred Securities of that Trust provide
a "Notice of Default"  to the Company and the Trustee and (ii) the Company  does
not cure such  Default  within  the time  specified  in clause  (2) above  after
receipt of such notice. Any such notice must specify the Default, demand that it
be remedied and state that such notice is a "Notice of Default."

                            SECTION 6.02 Acceleration

                                    If any Event of Default  with respect to the
Debentures  of any series other than an Event of Default under clause (3) or (4)
of Section 6.01 hereof occurs and is  continuing,  the Trustee or the Holders of
at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures of that series then
outstanding  may declare the principal of all the  Debentures of that series due
and payable,  provided that in the case of a series of Debentures then held by a
Trust, if upon an Event of Default with respect to the Debentures of that series
the Trustee has, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the  Debentures  of that series  have,  failed to declare the  principal  of the
Debentures of that series to be immediately  due and payable,  the holders of at
least  25%  in  aggregate   liquidation  amount  of  the  outstanding  Preferred
Securities  of that  Trust  shall  have such right by a notice in writing to the
Company and the Trustee.  If an Event of Default  specified in clause (3) or (4)
of  Section  6.01  hereof  occurs,  the  principal  of and  interest  on all the
Debentures  shall ipso facto become and be immediately  due and payable  without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Debentureholders.
Upon such an  acceleration,  such principal,  together with all interest accrued
thereon, shall be due and payable immediately.

                                    The  Holders  of  at  least  a  majority  in
aggregate  principal  amount  of the  Debentures  of  that  series  at the  time
outstanding,  in each  case,  by  notice to the  Trustee,  may  rescind  such an
acceleration  and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any
judgment or decree and if all  existing  Events of Default  with respect to such
series of Debentures have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or
interest that has become due solely  because of  acceleration,  provided that if
the principal of a series of Debentures has been declared due and payable by the
holders of the Preferred  Series of a Trust, no rescission of acceleration  will
be  effective  unless  consented  to by the  holders of at least a  majority  in
aggregate  liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of that Trust. No such
rescission  shall affect any subsequent  Default or impair any right  consequent
thereto.

                           SECTION 6.03 Other Remedies

                                    If  an  Event  of  Default   occurs  and  is
continuing,  the Trustee may, in its own name or as trustee of an express trust,
institute, pursue and prosecute any proceeding, including, without limitation,
any  action  at law or  suit in  equity  or  other  judicial  or  administrative
proceeding  to collect  the  payment of  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  or
interest on the  Debentures  of the series  that is in  default,  to enforce the
performance  of any provision of the Debentures of that series or this Indenture
or to obtain any other available remedy.

                                    The Trustee may maintain a  proceeding  even
if it does not  possess  any of the  Debentures  or does not  produce any of the
Debentures in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee, any
Debentureholder  or the holders of Preferred  Securities in exercising any right
or remedy  accruing  upon an Event of  Default  shall not  impair  such right or
remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, such Event of Default.  No
remedy is exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.

                      SECTION 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults

                                    If  a  Default  or  Event  of  Default  with
respect to a series of Debentures has occurred and is continuing, the Holders of
at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures of that
series at the time  outstanding,  or, if that series of  Debentures is held by a
Trust, the holders of at least a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the
Preferred  Securities  of that Trust,  in each case by notice to the Trustee and
the  Company,  may  waive  an  existing  Default  or Event  of  Default  and its
consequences  except a  Default  or  Event  of  Default  in the  payment  of the
principal  of or premium,  if any, or interest on any  Debenture of that series.
When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is deemed cured and shall cease
to exist,  but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or
Event of Default or impair any consequent right.

                        SECTION 6.05 Control by Majority

                                    The  Holders  of  at  least  a  majority  in
aggregate  principal amount of the Debentures of each series affected (with each
such series voting as a class) or, if that series of Debentures is held by a
Trust, the holders of at least a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of the
Preferred  Securities  of that Trust,  may direct the time,  method and place of
conducting  any  proceeding  for  any  remedy  available  to the  Trustee  or of
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the Trustee may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture or that
the  Trustee  determines  in good faith is unduly  prejudicial  to the rights of
other  Debentureholders  or may involve the Trustee in personal  liability.  The
Trustee may take any other  action  deemed  proper by the  Trustee  which is not
inconsistent with such direction, including withholding notice to the Holders of
the Debentures of continuing  default (except in the payment of the principal of
(other than any mandatory sinking fund payment) or premium,  if any, or interest
on any Debentures) if the Trustee considers it in the interest of the Holders of
the Debentures to do so.

                        SECTION 6.06 Limitation on Suits

                                    Except as provided in Section  6.07  hereof,
no Holder of Debentures or holder of Preferred  Securities of the Trust which is
the Holder of that series of Debentures may pursue any remedy with respect
to this Indenture or the Debentures unless:

          (1)  the  Holders  of  Debentures  or the  holders  of such  Preferred
               Securities  give to the Trustee  written  notice  stating that an
               Event of Default with respect to the corresponding  Debentures is
               continuing;

          (2)  the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate  principal amount of the
               Debentures  of that  series  or the  holders  of at least  25% in
               aggregate  liquidation amount of such Preferred Securities make a
               written request to the Trustee to pursue a remedy;

          (3)  the  Holders  of  Debentures  or the  holders  of such  Preferred
               Securities  provide  to  the  Trustee  reasonable   security  and
               indemnity against any loss,  liability or expense satisfactory to
               the Trustee;

          (4)  the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after
               receipt of the notice,  the request and the offer of security and
               indemnity; and

          (5)  during such 60 day period,  the Holders of at least a majority in
               aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures of that series or
               the  holders  of at least a  majority  in  aggregate  liquidation
               amount of such  Preferred  Securities  do not give the  Trustee a
               direction inconsistent with the request.

                                    A  Holder  of  Debentures  or  a  holder  of
Preferred  Securities  may not use this  Indenture  to  prejudice  the rights of
another  Debentureholder  or a holder  of  Preferred  Securities  or to obtain a
preference  or priority  over  another  Debentureholder  or holder of  Preferred
Securities.

                SECTION 6.07 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment

                                    Notwithstanding  any other provision of this
Indenture,  the right of any Holder to receive  payment of the  principal of and
premium (if any) or interest on the Debentures held by such Holder,  on or after
the respective  due dates  expressed in the Debentures (in the case of interest,
as the  same  may  be  extended  pursuant  to  Section  4.01(b)  hereof)  or any
Redemption Date, is absolute and  unconditional  and such right and the right to
bring suit for the  enforcement of any such payment on or after such  respective
dates shall not be impaired  or affected  adversely  without the consent of such
Holder.  If the Debentures of a series are then held by a Trust,  each holder of
Preferred  Securities  of such Trust shall have the right to bring suit directly
against the Company for the  enforcement of payment to such holder in respect of
Debentures  of  such  series  in a  principal  amount  equal  to  the  aggregate
liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities of such holder.

                   SECTION 6.08 Collection Suit by the Trustee

                                    If an Event of Default  described in Section
6.01(1) hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its
own name and as trustee of an express  trust  against the Company or any obligor
on the  Debentures for the whole amount owing with respect to the Debentures and
the amounts provided for in Section 7.07 hereof.

               SECTION 6.09 The Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

                                    In case of the pendency of any receivership,
insolvency, liquidation,  bankruptcy,  reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment,
composition  or  other  judicial  proceeding  relative  to  the  Company  or its
properties  or  assets,  the  Trustee  shall  be  entitled  and  empowered,   by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

          (1)  to file and prove a claim for the whole  amount of the  principal
               of and premium,  if any, and  interest on the  Debentures  and to
               file  such  other  papers or  documents  as may be  necessary  or
               advisable  in order to have the claims of the Trustee  (including
               any   claim   for   the   reasonable   compensation,    expenses,
               disbursements  and  advances  of  the  Trustee,  its  agents  and
               counsel) and of the Holders allowed in such judicial  proceeding;
               and

          (2)  to collect and receive  any moneys or other  property  payable or
               deliverable  on any such claims and to distribute  the same;  and
               any  Custodian  in  any  such   judicial   proceeding  is  hereby
               authorized  by each  Holder to make such  payments to the Trustee
               and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of
               such  payments  directly to the  Holders,  to pay the Trustee any
               amount  due  it  for  the  reasonable   compensation,   expenses,
               disbursements  and  advances  of  the  Trustee,  its  agents  and
               counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07
               hereof.

                                    Nothing herein  contained shall be deemed to
authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition  affecting the Debentures or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to
authorize  the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such
proceeding.

                             SECTION 6.10 Priorities

                                    If the Trustee  collects any money  pursuant

the following order:

          FIRST: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07 hereof;

          SECOND: to  Holders  of  Debentures  in  respect  of  which or for the
               benefit of which such money has been  collected  for  amounts due
               and  unpaid  on  such   Debentures  for  the  principal   amount,
               Redemption  Price  or  interest,  if  any,  as the  case  may be,
               ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to
               such amounts due and payable on such Debentures; and

          THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company.

                                    Except  as   otherwise   set  forth  in  the
Debentures,  the Trustee may fix a Record Date and payment  date for any payment
to Debentureholders pursuant to this Section 6.10.

                       SECTION 6.11 Undertaking for Costs

                                    In any suit for the enforcement of any right
or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action
taken or omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may
require the filing by any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of
an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the court in its discretion may
assess  reasonable  costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses,
against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to the merits and good
faith of the claims or defenses  made by the party  litigant.  This Section 6.11
does not apply to a suit by the  Trustee,  a suit by a Holder of  Debentures  or
holder of  Preferred  Securities  pursuant  to Section  6.07 hereof or a suit by
Holders of  Debentures  of more than 10% in  aggregate  principal  amount of the
Debentures of any series or, if a series of  Debentures is held by a Trust,  the
holders  of more  than 10% in  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of the  Preferred
Securities of that Trust.

              SECTION 6.12 WAIVER OF STAY; Extension or Usury Laws

                                    The Company covenants (to the extent that it
may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay
or extension law or any usury or other law wherever enacted,  now or at any time
hereafter in force,  that would  prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all
or any  portion of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  or  interest on the
Debentures as contemplated  herein or affect the covenants or the performance by
the Company of its  obligations  under this  Indenture;  and the Company (to the
extent  that it may  lawfully  do so) hereby  expressly  waives  all  benefit or
advantage  of any such law,  and  covenants  that it will not  hinder,  delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer
and  permit  the  execution  of every  such power as though no such law had been
enacted.


                                    ARTICLE 7
                                   THE TRUSTEE

                       SECTION 7.01 Duties of the Trustee

          (a)  If an Event of Default  occurs and is continuing  with respect to
               the  Debentures  of any series,  the Trustee  shall  exercise the
               rights and powers vested in it by this  Indenture with respect to
               that  series  and use the same  degree  of care and  skill in its
               exercise  as a  prudent  man  would  exercise  or use  under  the
               circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

          (b)  Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect
               to the  Debentures  of any series,  (i) the Trustee  need perform
               only  those   duties  with   respect  to  that  series  that  are
               specifically  set  forth  in  this  Indenture  or the  TIA and no
               others;  and (ii) in the  absence  of bad faith on its part,  the
               Trustee may conclusively  rely, as to the truth of the statements
               and the  correctness  of the  opinions  expressed  therein,  upon
               certificates or opinions  furnished to the Trustee and conforming
               to the  requirements of this Indenture.  However,  in the case of
               any  certificates  or opinions which by any provision  hereof are
               specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
               shall examine the certificates and opinions to determine  whether
               or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

          (c)  The  Trustee  may  not be  relieved  from  liability  for its own
               negligent  action,  its own  negligent  failure to act or its own
               willful misconduct, except that:

               (i)  this  Section  7.01(c)  does not limit the effect of Section
                    7.01(b) hereof;

               (ii) the  Trustee  shall not be liable for any error of  judgment
                    made in good  faith by a Trust  Officer  unless it is proved
                    that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
                    facts; and

               (iii)the Trustee  shall not be liable with  respect to any action
                    it takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a
                    direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof.

          (d)  Every  provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the
               Trustee  is  subject to  Section  7.01(a),  (b),  (c) and (e) and
               Section 7.02 hereof.

          (e)  The Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise  any right
               or power or extend or risk its own funds or  otherwise  incur any
               financial  liability  unless it receives  security and  indemnity
               reasonably  satisfactory  to it against  any loss,  liability  or
               expense (including reasonable counsel fees).

          (f)  Money  held  by  the  Trustee  in  trust  hereunder  need  not be
               segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
               Except as  otherwise  provided in Section  3.05 and Section  8.01
               hereof, the Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money
               held by it hereunder.

                       SECTION 7.02 Rights of the Trustee

          (a)  The Trustee may rely on any document believed by it to be genuine
               and to have been signed or  presented by the proper  person.  The
               Trustee  need not  investigate  any fact or matter  stated in the
               document.

          (b)  Before the Trustee acts or refrains  from acting,  it may require
               an  Officer's  Certificate  and,  if  appropriate,  an Opinion of
               Counsel.  The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes
               or omits  to take in good  faith in  reliance  on such  Officer's
               Certificate and Opinion of Counsel.

          (c)  The Trustee may act through  agents and shall not be  responsible
               for the misconduct or negligence of any agent  appointed with due
               care.

          (d)  The Trustee  shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits
               to  take  in  good  faith  which  it  reasonably  believes  to be
               authorized or within its rights or powers.

          (e)  The Trustee may consult  with  counsel of its  selection  and the
               advice of such  counsel or any  Opinion of Counsel  shall be full
               and  complete  authorization  and  protection  in  respect of any
               action  taken,  suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith
               and in  reliance  thereon.

          (f)  The Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of the
               rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or
               direction  of any of the  Holders  pursuant  to  this  Indenture,
               unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee  reasonable
               security   and   indemnity   against  the  costs,   expenses  and
               liabilities  (including  reasonable  counsel fees) which might be
               incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.

                  SECTION 7.03 Individual Rights of the Trustee

                                    The Trustee in its  individual  or any other
capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Debentures  and may  otherwise  deal
with the Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it
were not Trustee.  Any Paying Agent,  Registrar or co-registrar  may do the same
with like rights.  However,  the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11
hereof.

                      SECTION 7.04 The Trustee's Disclaimer

                                    The Trustee  makes no  representation  as to
the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Debentures.  The Trustee shall
not be accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the
Debentures,  and the Trustee shall not be responsible  for any statement in this
Indenture or the Debentures or any report or  certificate  issued by the Company
hereunder or any registration  statement  relating to the Debentures (other than
the Trustee's  Certificate  of  Authentication  and the  Trustee's  Statement of
Eligibility on Form T-1), or the determination as to which beneficial owners are
entitled to receive any notices hereunder.

                         SECTION 7.05 Notice of Defaults

                                    If a Default  occurs and is continuing  with
respect to the  Debentures of any series and if it is known to the Trustee,  the
Trustee shall mail to each Holder of a Debenture of that series notice of
the Default  within 90 days after it becomes  known to the  Trustee  unless such
Default  shall  have  been  cured or  waived.  Except  in the case of a  Default
described in Section 6.01(1) hereof, the Trustee may withhold such notice if and
so long as a  committee  of Trust  Officers  in good faith  determines  that the
withholding  of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Debentures
of that series.  The Trustee shall not be charged with  knowledge of any Default
(except  in the  case of a  Default  under  Section  6.01(1)  hereof)  unless  a
responsible  Trust  Officer  assigned to the Corporate  Trust  Department of the
Trustee shall have actual knowledge of the Default.  The second sentence of this
Section 7.05 shall be in lieu of the proviso to TIA Section 315(b). Said proviso
is hereby expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

                   SECTION 7.06 Reports by Trustee to Holders

                                    Within 60 days after each May 31,  beginning
with the May 31 next  following  the date of this  Indenture,  the Trustee shall
mail to each Debentureholder, and such other holders that have submitted
their names to the Trustee for such purpose, a brief report dated as of such May
31 in accordance with and to the extent required under TIA Section 313.

                                    A copy of  each  report  at the  time of its
mailing to  Debentureholders  shall be filed with the  Company,  the SEC and any
securities exchange on which the Debentures are listed. The Company agrees to
promptly  notify  the  Trustee  whenever  the  Debentures  become  listed on any
securities exchange and of any listing thereof.

                     SECTION 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity

                                    The Company agrees:

          (1)  to pay to the  Trustee  from  time to time such  compensation  as
               shall be agreed in writing  between  the  Company and the Trustee
               for all  services  rendered by it hereunder  (which  compensation
               shall not be  limited  by any  provision  of law in regard to the
               compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

          (2)  to  reimburse  the  Trustee  upon  its  request  for   reasonable
               expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  incurred  or made by the
               Trustee  in  accordance  with  any  provision  of this  Indenture
               (including  the  reasonable  compensation  and the expenses,  and
               advances of its agents and  counsel,  provided  that prior to any
               Event of  Default,  the  Trustee  shall  only have one  counsel),
               including all reasonable  expenses and advances  incurred or made
               by the  Trustee  in  connection  with any Event of Default or any
               membership on any creditors'  committee,  except any such expense
               or advance as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith;
               and

          (3)  to  indemnify   the  Trustee,   its   officers,   directors   and
               shareholders,  for, and to hold it harmless against,  any and all
               loss,  liability  or  expense,  incurred  without  negligence  or
               willful  misconduct on its part,  arising out of or in connection
               with the acceptance or  administration  of this trust,  including
               the costs and expenses of defending  itself  against any claim or
               liability in connection  with the exercise or  performance of any
               of its powers or duties hereunder.

                                    Before,  after or during an Event of Default
with respect to the  Debentures of a series,  the Trustee shall have a claim and
lien prior to the Debentures of that series as to all property and funds
held by it  hereunder  for any amount  owing it for its fees and expenses or any
predecessor  Trustee pursuant to this Section 7.07, except with respect to funds
held by the Trustee or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of principal of
or premium,  if any, or interest on  particular  Debentures  pursuant to Section
2.06 or Section 8.01 hereof.
                                    The Company's payment  obligations  pursuant
to this Section 7.07 are not subject to Article 10 of this  Indenture  and shall
survive the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee renders services
or incurs  expenses after the occurrence of a Default  specified in Section 6.01
hereof,  the  compensation  for services and expenses are intended to constitute
expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

                       SECTION 7.08 Replacement of Trustee

                                    The  Trustee  may resign at any time,  by so
notifying  the  Company  in  writing  at least 30 days  prior to the date of the
proposed resignation; provided, however, no such resignation shall be effective
until a successor Trustee has accepted its appointment  pursuant to this Section
7.08.  The Holders of at least a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the
Debentures  at the time  outstanding  may remove the Trustee by so notifying the
Trustee in writing and may appoint a successor  Trustee,  which shall be subject
to the consent of the Company  unless an Event of Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing. The Trustee shall resign if:

          (1)  the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

          (2)  the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

          (3)  a receiver or public  officer  takes charge of the Trustee or its
               property; or

          (4)  the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable to act.

                                   If the Trustee resigns or is  removed or if a
vacancy  exists in the office of  Trustee  for any  reason,  the  Company  shall
promptly  appoint a successor  Trustee.  A  successor  Trustee  shall  deliver a
written  acceptance  of its  appointment  to  the  retiring  Trustee  and to the
Company.  Thereupon  the  resignation  or removal of the retiring  Trustee shall
become effective,  and the successor  Trustee shall have all the rights,  powers
and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail
a notice of its  succession  to  Debentureholders.  Subject  to  payment  of all
amounts owing to the Trustee  under  Section 7.07 hereof and subject  further to
its lien under Section 7.07, the retiring  Trustee shall  promptly  transfer all
property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee.  If a successor Trustee
does not take office  within 30 days after the  retiring  Trustee  resigns or is
removed,  the  Company  or the  Holders  of at  least a  majority  in  aggregate
principal  amount of the  Debentures  at the time  outstanding  may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                                    If the Trustee  fails to comply with Section
7.10  hereof,   any   Debentureholder   may  petition  any  court  of  competent
jurisdiction for its removal and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                    SECTION 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger

                                    If the Trustee  consolidates with, merges or
converts  into,  or  transfers  all or  substantially  all its  corporate  trust
business or assets to another corporation, the resulting, surviving or
transferee corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

                   SECTION 7.10 Eligibility; Disqualification

                                    The Trustee  shall at all times  satisfy the
requirements  of TIA  Sections  310(a)(1)  and  310(a)(2).  The  Trustee (or any
Affiliate thereof which has unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of the
Trustee  hereunder)  shall  have a  combined  capital  and  surplus  of at least
$50,000,000  as set  forth in its  most  recently  published  annual  report  of
condition.  The Trustee  shall comply with TIA Section  310(b).  In  determining
whether  the  Trustee  has  conflicting  interests  as  defined  in TIA  Section
310(b)(1),  the provisions contained in the proviso to TIA Section 310(b)(1) and
the Trustee's  Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 shall be deemed incorporated
herein.

       SECTION 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company

                                    If and when the Trustee shall be or become a
creditor of the Company,  the Trustee shall be subject to the  provisions of the
TIA regarding the collection of claims against the Company.


                                    ARTICLE 8
                    SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE;
               DEFEASANCE OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS; UNCLAIMED MONEYS

              SECTION 8.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture

                                    The Company shall be deemed to have paid and
discharged the entire  indebtedness on any series of the Debentures  outstanding
on the date the Company has  irrevocably  deposited or caused to be  irrevocably
deposited  with  the  Trustee  or any  Paying  Agent as  trust  funds in  trust,
specifically  pledged as security for, and  dedicated  solely to, the benefit of
the Holders of the  Debentures  of such series (1) cash (which may be held in an
interest bearing account insured by the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation)
in an amount, or (2) U.S. Government  Obligations,  maturing as to principal and
interest at such times and in such  amounts as will ensure the  availability  of
cash,  or (3) a  combination  thereof,  sufficient  to pay the  principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on all Debentures of such series then outstanding,
provided that in the case of  redemption,  notice of redemption  shall have been
given or the Company shall have irrevocably  instructed the Trustee to give such
notice; and further provided that the following conditions shall have been met:

          (A)  no Default or Event of Default with respect to the  Debentures of
               such series has  occurred and is  continuing  on the date of such
               deposit or occurs as a result of such deposit;

          (B)  the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate
               certifying that there does not exist (i) a default in the payment
               of all or any  portion  of any  Senior  Indebtedness  or (ii) any
               other  default  affecting  Senior  Indebtedness   permitting  its
               acceleration  as the  result  of which  the  maturity  of  Senior
               Indebtedness has been accelerated;

          (C)  the  Company  has  delivered  to the Trustee (i) either a private
               Internal  Revenue  Service ruling or an Opinion of Counsel to the
               effect that the Holders of the Debentures of such series will not
               recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as
               a result of such  deposit,  defeasance  and discharge and will be
               subject  to  federal  income  tax on the same  amount  and in the
               manner  and at the same times as would have been the case if such
               deposit,  defeasance  and  discharge  had  not  occurred,  and an
               Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (A) the  deposit  shall not
               result in the Company,  the Trustee or, if the Debentures of such
               series  are held by a Trust,  such  Trust  being  deemed to be an
               "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
               amended,  and (B) such deposit creates a valid trust in which the
               Holders of the Debentures of such series have the sole beneficial
               interest  or that the  Holders of the  Debentures  of such series
               have a  nonavoidable  first  priority  security  interest in such
               trust; and

          (D)  the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate
               and an Opinion  of  Counsel,  each  stating  that all  conditions
               precedent  relating  to  the  defeasance   contemplated  by  this
               provision have been complied with.

Upon such deposit,  provisions of this  Indenture with respect to such series of
Debentures  shall  no  longer  be in  effect  (except  as to (1) the  rights  of
registration  of transfer and  exchange of  Debentures  of such series,  (2) the
replacement  of  apparently  mutilated,   defaced,  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Debentures  of such series,  (3) the rights of the Holders of the  Debentures of
such series to receive  payments of the principal  thereof and premium,  if any,
and interest  thereon,  (4) the rights of the Holders of the  Debentures of such
series as  beneficiaries  hereof with respect to the property so deposited  with
the Trustee  payable to all or any of them, (5) the obligation of the Company to
maintain an office or agency for payments on and registration of transfer of the
Debentures of such series,  (6) the rights,  obligations  and  immunities of the
Trustee  hereunder,  and (7) the  obligations  of the Company to the Trustee for
compensation and indemnity under Section 7.07 hereof;  and the Trustee shall, at
the request and expense of the Company, execute proper instruments acknowledging
the same.

SECTION 8.02 Application by Trustee of Funds Deposited for Payment of Debentures

                                    Subject to Section 8.04  hereof,  all moneys
deposited  with the  Trustee  pursuant to Section  8.01 hereof  shall be held in
trust and applied by it to the payment, either directly or through any Paying
Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent),  to the Holders of
the  Debentures of the series for the payment or redemption of which such moneys
have been deposited with the Trustee,  of all sums due and to become due thereon
for  principal and  interest;  but such money need not be segregated  from other
funds except to the extent required by law.

              SECTION 8.03 Repayment of Moneys Held by Paying Agent

                                    In  connection  with  the  satisfaction  and

Indenture  shall,  upon  demand of the  Company,  be repaid to it or paid to the
Trustee,  and  thereupon  such Paying  Agent shall be released  from all further
liability with respect to such moneys.

               SECTION 8.04 Return of Moneys Held by the Trustee
                   and Paying Agent Unclaimed for Three Years

                                    Any  moneys  deposited  with  or paid to the
Trustee or any Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of and premium,  if
any, or interest on the  Debentures  of any series and not applied but remaining
unclaimed for three years after the date when such principal,  premium,  if any,
or interest shall have become due and payable shall,  unless otherwise  required
by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property
law,  be repaid to the  Company by the  Trustee or such  Paying  Agent,  and the
Holders  of such  Debentures  shall,  unless  otherwise  required  by  mandatory
provisions  of  applicable  escheat or  abandoned or  unclaimed  property  laws,
thereafter  look only to the Company  for any  payment  which such Holder may be
entitled to collect,  and all  liability of the Trustee or any Paying Agent with
respect to such moneys shall thereupon cease.

                                   AMENDMENTS

                     SECTION 9.01 Without Consent of Holders

                                    From  time to  time,  when  authorized  by a
resolution  of the Board of  Directors,  the  Company and the  Trustee,  without
notice  to or the  consent  of any  Holders  of the  Debentures,  may  amend  or
supplement this Indenture:

          (1)  to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

          (2)  to comply with Article 5 hereof;

          (3)  to provide  for  uncertificated  Debentures  in addition to or in
               place of certificated Debentures;

          (4)  to make any other change that does not in the reasonable judgment
               of   the   Company   adversely   affect   the   rights   of   any
               Debentureholder;

          (5)  to comply with any  requirement of the SEC in connection with the
               qualification of this Indenture under the TIA; or

          (6)  to set  forth  the  terms  and  conditions,  which  shall  not be
               inconsistent  with this  Indenture,  of any series of  Debentures
               (other  than the  Series  A  Debentures)  that  are to be  issued
               hereunder and the form of Debentures of such series.

                      SECTION 9.02 With Consent of Holders

                                   The Company  and the Trustee may amend this 
Indenture  in any manner not  permitted  by  Section  9.01 or may waive  future
compliance by the Company with any provisions of this Indenture with the consent
of the  Holders  of at least a majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount of the
Debentures of each series affected thereby. Such an amendment or waiver may not,
without the consent of each Holder of the Debentures affected thereby:

          (1)  reduce the principal amount of such Debentures;

          (2)  reduce the  principal  amount of such  Debentures  the Holders of
               which must consent to an amendment of this Indenture or a waiver;

          (3)  change the stated maturity of the principal of or the interest on
               or rate of interest of such Debentures;

          (4)  change  adversely  to the Holders the  redemption  provisions  of
               Article 3 hereof;

          (5)  change the  currency  in respect  of which the  payments  on such
               Debentures are to be made;

          (6)  make any change in Article 10 hereof that  adversely  affects the
               rights of the  Holders  of the  Debentures  or any  change to any
               other Section  hereof that  adversely  affects their rights under
               Article 10 hereof; or

          (7)  change Section 6.07 hereof;

provided that, in the case of the  outstanding  Debentures of a series then held
by a Trust, no such amendment  shall be made that adversely  affects the holders
of the Preferred Securities of that Trust, and no waiver of any Event of Default
with respect to the  Debentures of that series or  compliance  with any covenant
under  this  Indenture  shall be  effective,  without  the prior  consent of the
holders  of at least a  majority  of the  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of the
outstanding  Preferred  Securities  of that  Trust or the  holder  of each  such
Preferred Security, as applicable.

                                    A  supplemental  indenture  that  changes or
eliminates any covenant or other  provision of this Indenture that has expressly
been  included  solely  for the  benefit  of one or more  particular  series  of
Debentures,  or which  modifies the rights of the Holders of  Debentures of such
series with respect to such covenant or other provision,  shall be deemed not to
affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Debentures of any other
series.

                                    It shall not be necessary for the consent of
the Holders of Debentures or holders of Preferred  Securities under this Section
9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed  amendment,  but it shall be
sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof.

                                    If certain  Holders  agree to defer or waive
certain  obligations of the Company hereunder with respect to Debentures held by
them, such deferral or waiver shall not affect the rights of any other Holder to
receive the payment or performance required hereunder in a timely manner.

                                    After an  amendment  or  waiver  under  this
Section 9.02 becomes  effective,  the Company shall mail to each Holder a notice
briefly describing the amendment or waiver. Any failure of the Company to mail
such notices,  or any defect therein,  shall not, however,  in any way impair or
affect the validity of such amendment or waiver.

                SECTION 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act

                                    Every   supplemental    indenture   executed
pursuant to this Article 9 shall comply with the TIA.

       SECTION 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents; Waivers and Actions

                                    Until an  amendment,  waiver or other action
by Holders becomes effective, a consent to it or any other action by a Holder of
a Debenture hereunder is a continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent
Holder of that  Debenture or portion of the  Debenture  that  evidences the same
obligation  as the  consenting  Holder's  Debenture,  even  if  notation  of the
consent,  waiver  or  action is not made on such  Debenture.  However,  any such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent,  waiver or action as to such
Holder's  Debenture  or portion of the  Debenture  if the Trustee  receives  the
notice of  revocation  before the consent of the requisite  aggregate  principal
amount of such  Debentures  then  outstanding has been obtained and not revoked.
After an  amendment,  waiver or action  becomes  effective,  it shall bind every
Holder of the  Debentures of the related  series,  except as provided in Section
9.02 hereof.

                                    The Company  may, but shall not be obligated
to, fix a Record Date for the  purpose of  determining  the Persons  entitled to
consent  to  any  amendment  or  waiver.  If  a  Record  Date  is  fixed,  then,
notwithstanding the first two sentences of the immediately  preceding paragraph,
only Holders of Debentures or holders of Preferred Securities, as applicable, on
such Record Date or their duly designated proxies, and only those Persons, shall
be entitled to consent to such amendment,  supplement or waiver or to revoke any
consent previously given,  whether or not such Persons continue to be such after
such Record Date.  No such consent  shall be valid or effective for more than 90
days after such Record Date.

               SECTION 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Debentures

                                    Debentures    of    the    related    series
authenticated  and made  available  for  delivery  after the  execution  of any
supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article 9 may, and shall, if required by
the  Trustee,  bear a notation in form  approved by the Trustee as to any matter
provided for in such supplemental  indenture. If the Company shall so determine,
new Debentures so modified as to conform,  in the opinion of the Trustee and the
Board of  Directors,  to any such  supplemental  indenture  may be prepared  and
executed by the Company and authenticated and made available for delivery by the
Trustee in exchange for outstanding Debentures.

             SECTION 9.06 Trustee to Execute Supplemental Indentures

                                    The Trustee shall  execute any  supplemental
indenture  authorized  pursuant to this Article 9 if the supplemental  indenture
does not adversely affect the rights,  duties,  liabilities or immunities of the
Trustee.  If it does,  the Trustee may,  but need not,  execute it. In executing
such supplemental  indenture the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and shall
be fully  protected in relying  upon,  an Officer's  Certificate  and Opinion of
Counsel stating that such  supplemental  indenture is authorized or permitted by
this Indenture.

                 SECTION 9.07 Effect of Supplemental Indentures

                                    Upon  the  execution  of  any   supplemental
indenture  under this Article 9, this Indenture  shall be modified in accordance
therewith, and such supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture
for  all  purposes  and  every  Holder  of  Debentures  of  the  related  series
theretofore  or  thereafter   authenticated  and  made  available  for  delivery
hereunder shall be bound thereby.

                                  SUBORDINATION

                                    Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section
6.10 hereof or any other provision  herein or in any Debenture,  the Company and
the Trustee and, by their acceptance thereof, the Holders of the Debentures
(a)  covenants  and agrees that all payments by the Company of the  principal of
and premium, if any, and interest on the Debentures (other than Debentures which
have been discharged  pursuant to Article 8) shall be subordinated in accordance
with the  provisions of this Article 10 to the prior payment in full, in cash or
cash equivalents,  of all amounts payable on, under or in connection with Senior
Indebtedness,  and (b) acknowledges  that holders of Senior  Indebtedness are or
shall be relying on this Article 10.

        SECTION 10.02 Priority and Payment of Proceeds in Certain Events;
                              Remedies Standstill

          (a)  Upon any payment or  distribution  of assets or securities of the
               Company, as the case may be, of any kind or character, whether in
               cash, property or securities,  upon any dissolution or winding up
               or total or partial liquidation or reorganization of the Company,
               whether voluntary or involuntary,  or in bankruptcy,  insolvency,
               receivership or other proceedings,  all amounts payable on, under
               or in connection with Senior Indebtedness (including any interest
               accruing  on  such   Senior   Indebtedness   subsequent   to  the
               commencement of a bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar  proceeding)
               shall first be paid in full in cash,  or payment  provided for in
               cash or cash  equivalents,  before the  Holders or the Trustee on
               behalf of the  Holders  or the  holders of  Preferred  Securities
               shall be  entitled  to receive  from the  Company  any payment of
               principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Debentures or
               distribution of any assets or securities.

          (b)  No direct or  indirect  payment by or on behalf of the Company of
               principal  of or premium,  if any, or interest on the  Debentures
               (other than  Debentures  which have been  discharged  pursuant to
               Article 8),  whether  pursuant to the terms of the  Debentures or
               upon acceleration or otherwise, shall be made if, any the time of
               such payment, there exists (i) a default in the payment of all or
               any  portion  of any  Senior  Indebtedness  and the  Trustee  has
               received written notice thereof from the Company, from holders of
               Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee,  representative or agent
               therefor, or (ii) any other default affecting Senior Indebtedness
               as a result of which the maturity of Senior Indebtedness has been
               accelerated and the Trustee has received  written notice from the
               Company, from holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee,
               representative or agent therefor, and such default shall not have
               been  cured or  waived by or on  behalf  of the  holders  of such
               Senior Indebtedness.

          (c)  If,  notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions  prohibiting such
               payment or  distribution,  the  Trustee or any Holder  shall have
               received  any payment on account of the  principal of or premium,
               if any,  or  interest  on the  Debentures  when such  payment  is
               prohibited by this Section  10.02 and before all amounts  payable
               on, under or in connection with Senior  Indebtedness  are paid in
               full in cash or cash equivalents, then and in such event (subject
               to the  provisions  of  Section  10.08  hereof)  such  payment or
               distribution  shall be received and held in trust for the holders
               of Senior  Indebtedness  and,  at the  written  direction  of the
               trustee,  representative  or agent for the  holders of the Senior
               Indebtedness,  shall  be  paid  to  the  holders  of  the  Senior
               Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such
               Senior Indebtedness in full in cash or cash equivalents.

                                    Upon any payment or  distribution  of assets
or securities  referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders shall
be entitled to rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction   in  which  such   dissolution,   winding   up,   liquidation   or
reorganization  proceedings are pending, and upon a certificate of the receiver,
trustee in  bankruptcy,  liquidating  trustee,  agent or other Person making any
such  payment or  distribution,  delivered  to the  Trustee  for the  purpose of
ascertaining  the Persons  entitled to  participate  in such  distribution,  the
holders of Senior Indebtedness and other Indebtedness of the Company, the amount
thereof or payable  thereon,  the amount or amounts paid or distributed  thereon
and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article 10.

            SECTION 10.03 Payments which May Be Made Prior to Notice

                                    Nothing in this  Article 10 or  elsewhere in
this  Indenture  shall  prevent (i) the  Company,  except  under the  conditions
described in Section 10.02 hereof, from making payments of principal of or
premium,  if any, or  interest on the  Debentures  or from  depositing  with the
Trustee any monies for such payments,  or (ii) the application by the Trustee of
any  monies  deposited  with it for the  purpose  of  making  such  payments  of
principal of or premium,  if any, or interest on the Debentures,  to the Holders
entitled  thereto,  unless at least one Business Day prior to the date when such
payment would otherwise (except for the prohibitions  contained in Section 10.02
hereof)  become due and  payable  the Trustee  shall have  received  the written
notice provided for in Section 10.02(b)(i) or (ii) hereof.

    SECTION 10.04 Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness Not to Be Impaired

                                    No right of any present or future  holder of
any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any
time or in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to
act in good faith by any such  holder,  or by any  noncompliance  by the Company
with the terms and provisions and covenants  herein  regardless of any knowledge
thereof any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

                                    The   provisions  of  this  Article  10  are
intended  to be for the benefit of, and shall be  enforceable  directly  by, the
holders of Senior Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article 10, to the extent any Holders or the Trustee have paid over or delivered
to any holder of Senior  Indebtedness  any payment or  distribution  received on
account of the principal of or premium (if any) or interest on the Debentures to
which any other  holder of Senior  Indebtedness  shall be  entitled  to share in
accordance  with Section 10.02 hereof,  no holder of Senior  Indebtedness  shall
have a claim or right  against any Holders or the  Trustee  with  respect to any
such payment or  distribution  or as a result of the failure to make payments or
distributions to such other holder of Senior Indebtedness.

        SECTION 10.05 Trustee May Take Action to Effectuate Subordination

                                    Each   Holder   of  a   Debenture,   by  his
acceptance  thereof,  authorizes  and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take
such  action as may be  required  by the  trustee,  representative  or agent for
holders of Senior  Indebtedness or by the Company to effectuate,  as between the
holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Holders, the subordination as provided in
this Article 10 and appoints  the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact  for any and all
such purposes.

                            SECTION 10.06 Subrogation

                                    Upon the  payment  in full,  in cash or cash
equivalents,  of all Senior Indebtedness,  any Holder shall be subrogated to the
rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or
distributions  of assets of the Company made on such Senior  Indebtedness  until
the Debentures shall be paid in full; and for the purposes of such  subrogation,
no payments or distributions to holders of such Senior  Indebtedness of any cash
property or securities to which such Holders of the Debentures would be entitled
except  for this  Article  10,  and no payment  pursuant  to this  Article 10 to
holders of such Senior Indebtedness by such Holders of the Debentures, shall, as
between  the  Company,   its  creditors   other  than  holders  of  such  Senior
Indebtedness  and such Holders of the  Debentures,  be deemed to be a payment by
the Company to or on account of such Senior  Indebtedness,  it being  understood
that the  provisions  of this  Article 10 are solely for the purpose of defining
the relative rights of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, on the one hand,
and such Holders of the Debentures, on the other hand.

                                    If any  payment  or  distribution  to  which
Holders of Debentures  would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions
of this Article 10 shall have been applied, pursuant to this Article 10, to
the payment of all Senior Indebtedness then and in such case such Holders of the
Debentures  shall be  entitled  to  receive  from  the  holders  of such  Senior
Indebtedness at the time outstanding any payments or  distributions  received by
such holders of Senior  Indebtedness in excess of the amount  sufficient to pay,
in cash or cash equivalents, all such Senior Indebtedness in full.

        SECTION 10.07 Obligations of Company Unconditional; Reinstatement

                                    Nothing in this  Article 10 or  elsewhere in
this  Indenture or in any Debenture is intended to or shall  impair,  as between
the Company and Holders of the Debentures, the obligations of the Company, which
are absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay to such  Holders the  principal of and
premium,  if any,  and  interest  on the  Debentures  as and when the same shall
become due and  payable in  accordance  with their  terms,  or is intended to or
shall affect the relative rights of such Holders of the Debentures and creditors
of the  Company  other than the  holders of the Senior  Indebtedness,  nor shall
anything  herein or therein  prevent the Trustee or any Holder of  Debentures or
holder of Preferred  Securities,  as  applicable,  from  exercising all remedies
otherwise  permitted  by  applicable  law under this  Indenture,  subject to the
rights, if any, under this Article 10 of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness
in respect of cash,  property or  securities  of the Company  received  upon the
exercise of any such remedy.

                                    The failure to make a scheduled payment of
principal  of or premium,  if any, or  interest on the  Debentures  by reason of
Section 10.02 shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of
Default under Section 6.01 hereof; provided, however, that if (i) the conditions
preventing the making of such payment no longer exist,  and (ii) such Holders of
the Debentures are made whole with respect to such omitted  payments,  the Event
of Default  relating  thereto  (including  any  failure  to pay any  accelerated
amounts)  shall be  automatically  waived,  and the  provisions of the Indenture
shall be reinstated as if no such Event of Default had occurred.

                    SECTION 10.08 Trustee Entitled to Assume
                  Payments Not Prohibited in Absence of Notice

                                    The  Trustee  or Paying  Agent  shall not be
charged with the knowledge of the existence of any default in the payment of all
or a portion of any Senior  Indebtedness or any other default  affecting  Senior
Indebtedness  as a result of which the maturity of the Senior  Indebtedness  has
been  accelerated,  unless  and until the  Trustee  or Paying  Agent  shall have
received  written  notice  thereof  from the  Company or one or more  holders of
Senior  Indebtedness  or from any trustee,  representative  or agent therefor or
unless the Trustee or Paying Agent otherwise had actual knowledge thereof;  and,
prior to the  receipt  of any such  written  notice  or  actual  knowledge  of a
responsible  Trust Officer in the Corporate  Trust  Department of the Trustee or
Paying Agent, the Trustee or Paying Agent may  conclusively  assume that no such
facts exist.

                                    Unless  at least one  Business  Day prior to
the date when by the terms of this  Indenture  any monies are to be deposited by
the Company with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for any purpose (including,
without  limitation,  the payment of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or
interest on any Debenture), the Trustee or Paying Agent shall have received with
respect to such monies the notice provided for in Section 10.02 or a responsible
Trust Officer in the Corporate  Trust  Department of the Trustee or Paying Agent
shall have actual knowledge of default in the payment of all or a portion of any
Senior  Indebtedness or any other default  affecting Senior  Indebtedness as the
result of which the maturity of the Senior  Indebtedness  has been  accelerated,
the Trustee or Paying  Agent shall have full power and  authority to receive and
apply such monies to the purpose for which they were  received.  Neither of them
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, which may be received by either
on or after such date. The foregoing  shall not apply to the Paying Agent if the
Company is acting as Paying Agent. Nothing in this Section 10.08 shall limit the
right of the holders of Senior  Indebtedness to recover payments as contemplated
by Section 10.02  hereof.  The Trustee or Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely
on the delivery to it of a written  notice by a Person  representing  himself or
itself to be a holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee,  representative
or agent on behalf of such holder) to establish  that such notice has been given
by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee, representative or agent on
behalf of any such holder.  The Trustee  shall not be deemed to have any duty to
the holders (and shall be fully protected in relying upon such notice) of Senior
Indebtedness.

           SECTION 10.09 Right of Trustee to Hold Senior Indebtedness

                                    The  Trustee  and any Paying  Agent shall be
entitled  to all of the  rights  set forth in this  Article 10 in respect of any
Senior Indebtedness at any time held by them to the same extent as any other
holder of such  Senior  Indebtedness,  and  nothing in this  Indenture  shall be
construed  to deprive  the  Trustee or any Paying  Agent of any of its rights as
such holder.

                                   ARTICLE 11
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                   SECTION 11.01 Trust Indenture Act Controls

                                    If any provision of this  Indenture  limits,
qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by operation of subsection (c) of
Section 318 of the TIA, the imposed duties shall control. The provisions
of Sections 310 to 317,  inclusive,  of the TIA that impose duties on any Person
(including  provisions  automatically deemed included in an indenture unless the
indenture  provides that such  provisions are excluded) are a part of and govern
this Indenture,  except as, and to the extent,  they are expressly excluded from
this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

to the other,  may designate  additional or different  addresses for  subsequent

Debentureholder  shall be  mailed or  delivered  to the  Debentureholder  at the
Debentureholder's  address as it appears on the  Register of the  Registrar  and
shall be sufficiently given if mailed within the time prescribed.

                                    Failure to mail a notice or communication to
a  Debentureholder  or any defect in it shall not affect  its  sufficiency  with
respect to other Debentureholders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner  provided  above,  it is  duly  given,  whether  or not  received  by the
addressee.

                                    If   the   Company   mails   a   notice   or
communication to the  Debentureholders,  it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and
each Registrar, Paying Agent or co-Registrar.

           SECTION 11.03 Communication by Holders with Other Holders

                                    Debentureholders may communicate, pursuant
to TIA Section 312(b), with other  Debentureholders with respect to their rights
under this Indenture or the Debentures. The Company, the Trustee, the Registrar,
the Paying  Agent and  anyone  else shall  have the  protection  of TIA  Section
312(c).

        SECTION 11.04 Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent

Company to the  Trustee to take any action  under this  Indenture,  the  Company
shall furnish to the Trustee:

          (1)  an Officer's  Certificate  (complying  with Section 11.05 hereof)
               stating  that,  in the opinion of such  Officer,  all  conditions
               precedent to the taking of such action have been  complied  with;
               and

          (2)  if  appropriate,  an Opinion of Counsel  (complying  with Section
               11.05  hereof)  stating  that, in the opinion of such counsel all
               such conditions  precedent to the taking of such action have been
               complied with.

           SECTION 11.05 Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion

                                    Each  Officer's  Certificate  and Opinion of
Counsel with respect to compliance with a covenant or condition  provided for in
this Indenture shall include:

          (1)  a statement that each Person making such Officer's Certificate or
               Opinion of Counsel has read such covenant or condition;

          (2)  a brief  statement as to the nature and scope of the  examination
               or investigation  upon which the statements or opinions contained
               in such Officer's Certificate or Opinion of Counsel are based;

          (3)  a statement that, in the opinion of each such Person, such Person
               has made such  examination  or  investigation  as is necessary to
               enable such  Person to express an informed  opinion as to whether
               or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and

          (4)  a statement that, in the opinion of such Person, such covenant or
               condition has been complied with;  provided,  however,  that with
               respect to matters of fact not involving any legal conclusion, an
               Opinion  of  Counsel  may  rely on an  Officer's  Certificate  or
               certificates of public officials.

                        SECTION 11.06 Severability Clause

                                    If any provision in this Indenture or in the
Debentures shall be invalid,  illegal or unenforceable,  the validity,  legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

           SECTION 11.07 Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent and Registrar

                                    The  Trustee may make  reasonable  rules for
action by or a meeting of  Debentureholders.  The Registrar and Paying Agent may
make reasonable rules for their functions.

                          SECTION 11.08 Legal Holidays

                                    A "Legal  Holiday"  is any day other  than a
Business Day. If any specified  date  (including a date for giving  notice) is a
Legal Holiday, the action to be taken on such date shall be taken on the next
succeeding day that is not a Legal  Holiday,  and if such action is a payment in
respect of the Debentures,  unless otherwise  specified pursuant to Section 2.01
hereof no principal,  premium (if any) or interest  installment shall accrue for
the intervening  period;  except that if any interest  payment is due on a Legal
Holiday and the next  succeeding  day is in the next  succeeding  calendar year,
such payment shall be made on the Business Day immediately  preceding such Legal
Holiday.

                           SECTION 11.09 Governing Law

                                    This Indenture and the  Debentures  shall be

Jersey, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.

                    SECTION 11.10 No Recourse Against Others

                                    No    director,    officer,    employee   or
stockholder,  as  such,  of  the  Company  shall  have  any  liability  for  any
obligations  of the Company under the  Debentures  or this  Indenture or for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such  obligations  their creation.
By accepting a Debenture,  each Debentureholder shall waive and release all such
liability.  The waiver and release  shall be part of the  consideration  for the
issue of the Debentures.

                            SECTION 11.11 Successors

                                    All   agreements  of  the  Company  in  this
Indenture and Debentures  shall bind its successors and assigns.  All agreements
of the Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successors and assigns.

            SECTION 11.12 Multiple Original Copies of this Indenture

                                    The parties may sign any number of copies of
this Indenture.  Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of them together
represent the same agreement. Any signed copy shall be sufficient proof
of this Indenture.

           SECTION 11.13 No Adverse Interpretation of Other Agreements

                                    This  Indenture may not be used to interpret

such indenture, loan or debt agreement may not be used to interpret this
Indenture.

                    SECTION 11.14 Table of Contents: Headings, Etc.

                                    The  Table  of   Contents,   Cross-Reference
Table,  and headings of the Articles  and Sections of this  Indenture  have been
inserted for  convenience  of reference  only,  are not to be  considered a part

                     PUBLIC SERVICE ELECTRIC AND GAS COMPANY
               8.625% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture,
                                    Series A


No. 1

                                    Public Service  Electric and Gas Company,  a
New Jersey  corporation  (the  "Company",  which  term  includes  any  successor
corporation under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value received,
hereby  promises to pay to PSE&G  Capital  Trust I or  registered  assigns,  the
principal sum of  $214,433,000  Dollars on June 26, 2045, and to pay interest on
said principal sum from June 26, 1996 or from the most recent  Interest  Payment
Date (as defined  below) to which  interest has been paid or duly  provided for,
quarterly  in  arrears  on March 31,  June 30,  September  30 and  December  31,
commencing  June 30, 1996 (each,  an "Interest  Payment  Date"),  at the rate of
8.625% per annum until the  principal  hereof shall have become due and payable,
and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue  installment of interest at the
same rate per annum. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve  30-day  months,  and
for any period shorter than thirty days,  interest will be computed on the basis
of the  actual  number of days  elapsed  in such  period.  In the event that any
Interest  Payment Date is not a Business  Day,  then interest will be payable on
the next  succeeding  day which is a Business  Day (and  without any interest or
other  payment in respect of any such delay),  except that, if such Business Day
is in the next  succeeding  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall be made on the
immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect
as if made on such date.  The interest  installment  so payable,  and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the
Indenture,  be paid to the Person in whose name this  Debenture is registered at
the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest  installment,
which shall be the 15th day (whether or not a Business Day) of the last month of
each  calendar  quarter,  provided  that if all of the Series A  Debentures  (as
defined  below)  are then held by PSE&G  Capital  Trust I (the  "Trust")  or the
Series A Debentures  are held in  book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date
shall be the close of business on the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such
Interest Payment Date. Any such interest installment not punctually paid or duly
provided for shall  forthwith  cease to be payable to the Holder on such Regular
Record  Date,  and may be paid to the  Person in whose  name this  Debenture  is
registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date to be fixed by the
Trustee (as defined  below) for the payment of such defaulted  interest,  notice
whereof shall be given to the Holders of the Series A Debentures not less than 7
calendar days prior to such Special  Record Date, as more fully  provided in the
Indenture.

                                    Payment of the  principal of and interest on
this  Debenture  will be made in such coin or currency  of the United  States of
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debts.  Payments of interest on an Interest Payment Date will be made by
check  mailed to the Holder  hereof at the address  shown in the Register or, at
the option of the Holder  hereof,  to such other  place in the United  States of
America as the Holder hereof shall  designate to the Trustee in writing.  At the
request of a Holder of at least $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series
A  Debentures,  interest  on such  Debentures  will be payable by wire  transfer
within the continental United States in immediately  available funds to the bank
account number specified in writing by such Holder to the Registrar prior to the
Regular Record Date.

                                    The principal amount hereof and any interest
due on the Stated  Maturity  Date or a  Redemption  Date (other than an Interest
Payment Date) will be paid only upon surrender of this Debenture at the
principal  corporate  office of First Union  National  Bank,  Paying  Agent,  in
Newark, New Jersey, or at such other office or agency of the Paying Agent as the
Company shall designate by written notice to the Holder of this Debenture.

                                    The indebtedness evidenced by this Debenture
is, to the extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and
this Debenture is issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect
thereto. The Holder of this Debenture,  by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and
shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his
behalf to take such action as may be necessary or  appropriate to acknowledge or
effectuate  the  subordination  so  provided  and (c)  appoints  the Trustee his
attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. The Holder of this Debenture, by
his  acceptance  hereof,  hereby  waives  all  notice of the  acceptance  of the
subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of
Senior Indebtedness,  whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives
reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

                                    This  Debenture is one of a duly  authorized
series of Debentures of the Company (herein sometimes referred to as the "Series
A Debentures"), specified in the Indenture, limited in aggregate
principal  amount to  $214,433,000,  issued  under and  pursuant to an Indenture
dated as June 1, 1996 (the  "Indenture")  executed  and  delivered  between  the
Company and First Union National Bank, as trustee (the "Trustee").  The Series A
Debentures are initially  being issued to the Trust, to be held on behalf of the
Trust by its property trustee (the "Property  Trustee").  Concurrently  with the
issuance of the Series A Debentures,  the Trust is issuing its trust securities,
representing  undivided  beneficial  interests  in the  assets  of the Trust and
having an  aggregate  liquidation  amount equal to the  principal  amount of the
Series A Debentures,  including the Trust's 8.625%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities, Series A (the "Preferred Securities"). By the terms of the
Indenture,  Debentures are issuable in series which may vary as to amount,  date
of  maturity,  rate  of  interest  and in  other  respects  as in the  Indenture
provided.  Reference is made to the Indenture  for a description  of the rights,
limitations  of rights,  obligations,  duties and  immunities  thereunder of the
Trustee,  the  Company  and  Holders of the  Debentures.  Each term used in this
Debenture  which is defined in the Indenture  and not defined  herein shall have
the meaning assigned to it in the Indenture.

                                    At the option of the  Company,  the Series A
Debentures are redeemable prior to maturity (i) at any time on or after June 26,
2001, in whole or in part, and (ii) if a Special Event shall occur and be
continuing,  in whole (but not in part),  in each case at 100% of the  principal
amount thereof plus accrued  interest to the Redemption  Date. A "Special Event"
shall mean either a "Tax Event" or an  "Investment  Company  Event." "Tax Event"
shall mean that the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel (which may
be regular counsel to the Company or an Affiliate,  but not an employee  thereof
and which must be acceptable to the Property  Trustee of the Trust)  experienced
in such matters to the effect that,  as a result of any  amendment to, or change
(including any announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any  regulations
thereunder)  of  the  United  States  or any  political  subdivision  or  taxing
authority thereof or therein affecting taxation,  or as a result of any official
administrative  pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such
laws  or   regulations,   which   amendment  or  change  is  effective  or  such
interpretation  or  pronouncement  is announced on or after the date of original
issuance of Preferred Securities,  there is more than an insubstantial risk that
(i) the Trust is subject to United  States  Federal  income tax with  respect to
interest received on the Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Company to the
Trust on the  Series A  Debentures  will not be  deductible  for  United  States
Federal  income  tax  purposes  or (iii) the Trust is  subject to more than a de
minimis  amount  of other  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or  other  governmental
charges. "Investment Company Event" shall mean the occurrence of a change in law
or regulation or a change in  interpretation or application of law or regulation
by any legislative body, court,  governmental agency or regulatory  authority (a
"Change in 1940 Act Law") to the effect that the Trust is or will be  considered
an "investment  company" that is required to be registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended,  which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective
on or after the date of original issuance of the Preferred Securities.

                                    At least  30 days but not more  than 60 days
before the  Redemption  Date,  the  Trustee  shall mail or caused to be mailed a
notice of redemption by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of
Series A Debentures to be redeemed.

                                    In the event of redemption of this Debenture
in part only, a new Series A Debenture or Debentures for the unredeemed  portion
hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
cancellation hereof.

                                    In case an Event of Default  with respect to
the Series A Debentures occurs and is continuing,  the principal of and interest
on the Series A Debentures may (and, in certain circumstances, shall) be
declared,  and upon such  declaration  shall  become,  due and  payable,  in the
manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

                                    The  Indenture   contains   provisions   for
defeasance  at any  time  of the  entire  indebtedness  of this  Debenture  upon
compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.

                                    Subject   to  certain   exceptions   in  the
Indenture which require the consent of every Holder, the Company and the Trustee
may amend the Indenture or may waive future compliance by the Company with any
provisions  of the  Indenture,  with the  consent  of the  Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures of each series affected
thereby, provided that if the Series A Debentures are held by the Trust, no such
amendment  or  waiver  that  adversely  affects  the  holders  of the  Preferred
Securities  shall be  effective  without the prior  consent of the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate  liquidation  amount of the outstanding  Preferred
Securities.  Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture, without the consent
of any  Debentureholder,  the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to
cure  any  ambiguity,  defect  or  inconsistency,  to  bind a  successor  to the
obligations  of the  Indenture,  to provide  for  uncertificated  Debentures  in
addition to  certificated  Debentures,  to comply with any  requirements  of the
Debentures  and the Securities  and Exchange  Commission in connection  with the
qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or to make any change that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company,  does not adversely affect the rights of any
Debentureholder. Amendments bind all Holders and subsequent Holders.

                                    No reference  herein to the Indenture and no
provision  of  this  Debenture  or the  Indenture  shall  alter  or  impair  the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal  of and  interest on this  Debenture  at the time and place and at the
rate and in the money herein prescribed.

                                    So long as no Event of Default  with respect
to the Series A Debentures  has occurred and is  continuing,  the Company  shall
have the right at any time and from time to time to extend the interest
payment period of the Series A Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters (the
"Extension  Period"),  provided that no Extension Period shall extend beyond the
Stated Maturity Date or Redemption Date of any Series A Debenture. At the end of
the Extension Period, the Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid
(together  with  interest  thereon  at the  rate  specified  for  the  Series  A
Debentures, compounded quarterly, to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law). During such Extension Period, the Company may
not  declare  or pay  any  dividend  on,  redeem,  purchase,  acquire  or make a
liquidation  payment  with  respect to, any of its capital  stock.  Prior to the
termination  of any such Extension  Period,  the Company may further extend such
Extension Period,  provided that such Extension  Period,  together with all such
previous and further  extensions,  shall not exceed 20 consecutive  quarters and
shall not extend  beyond  the Stated  Maturity  Date or  Redemption  Date of any
Series A Debenture. At the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the
payment of all amounts then due, the Company may elect to begin a new  Extension
Period, subject to the foregoing restrictions.

                                    Series A  Debentures  are  issuable  only in
registered  form  without  coupons  in  denominations  of $25 and any  integral
multiple  thereof.   As  provided  in  the  Indenture  and  subject  to  certain
limitations  therein  set  forth,  this  Debenture  is  exchangeable  for a like
aggregate  principal  amount of Series A  Debentures  of a different  authorized
denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

                                    As provided in the  Indenture and subject to
certain  limitations  therein set forth,  this Debenture is  transferable by the
Holder hereof upon surrender of this Debenture for registration of transfer
at the office or agency of the Registrar  accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer  inform  satisfactory  to the Registrar duly executed by
the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one
or more new Series A Debentures  of  authorized  denominations  and for the same
aggregate  principal  amount  will be issued  to the  designated  transferee  or
transferees.  No  service  charge  will be made for any such  transfer,  but the
Company  may  require  payment  of a sum  sufficient  to cover  any tax or other
governmental charge payable in relation thereto.

                                    Prior to  presentment  for  registration  of
transfer of this Debenture,  the Company,  the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any
Registrar may deem and treat the Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof
(whether or not this Debenture shall be overdue and  notwithstanding  any notice
of ownership or writing  hereon made by anyone other than the Registrar) for the
purpose  of  receiving  payment of or on  account  of the  principal  hereof and
interest due hereon and for all other purposes,  and neither the Company nor the
Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor any  Registrar  shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary.

                                    No recourse  shall be had for the payment of
the  principal  of or the  interest  on this  Debenture,  or for any claim based
hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the
Indenture,  against any  incorporator,  stockholder  officer or director,  past,
present or future,  as such, of the Company or of any  predecessor  or successor
corporation,  whether by virtue of any constitution,  statute or rule of law, or
by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability
being,  by the  acceptance  hereof  and as  part  of the  consideration  for the
issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.

                                    This  Debenture  shall not be valid until an
authorized  signatory  of the  Trustee  manually  signs and dates the  Trustee's

                                    Exhibit A

                     PUBLIC SERVICE ELECTRIC AND GAS COMPANY

           8.125% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture, Series B
No. 1

                  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company,   a  New  Jersey
corporation (the "Company",  which term includes any successor corporation under
the Indenture  hereinafter referred to), for value received,  hereby promises to
pay to PSE&G  Capital  Trust II or  registered  assigns,  the  principal  sum of
$97,938,150  on February 7, 2046, and to pay interest on said principal sum from
February  7, 1997 or from the most  recent  Interest  Payment  Date (as  defined
below)  to which  interest  has been paid or duly  provided  for,  quarterly  in
arrears on March 31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31 commencing March 31,
1997 (each,  an "Interest  Payment  Date") at the rate of 8.125% per annum until
the  principal  hereof  shall have  become due and  payable,  and on any overdue
principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable  under
applicable  law) on any  overdue  installment  of  interest at the same rate per
annum.  The amount of interest  payable on any  Interest  Payment  Date shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve  30-day  months.  In the event
that any Interest  Payment Date is not a Business  Day,  then  interest  will be
payable on the next  succeeding  day which is a Business  Day (and  without  any
interest or other  payment in respect of any such delay),  except that,  if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made
on the immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect  as if made on such  date.  The  interest  installment  so  payable,  and
punctually  paid or duly  provided  in the  Indenture,  be paid to the Person in
whose name this  Debenture is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest installment,  which shall be the 15th day (whether
or not a Business Day) of the last month of each calendar quarter, provided that
if all of the  Series B  Debentures  (as  defined  below) are then held by PSE&G
Capital  Trust  II  (the  "Trust")  or the  Series  B  Debentures  are  held  in
book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on
the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such Interest  Payment Date.  Any such
interest  installment  not punctually  paid or duly provided for shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular  Record Date, and may be paid
to the  Person  in whose  name  this  Debenture  is  registered  at the close of
business on a Special  Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below)
for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the
Holders of the Series B Debentures  not less than 7 calendar  days prior to such
Special Record Date, as more fully provided in the Indenture.
<PAGE>

                  Payment of the  principal  of and  interest on this  Debenture
will be made in such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at the
time of  payment  is legal  tender for  payment  of public  and  private  debts.
Payments of interest on an Interest Payment Date will be made by check mailed to
the Holder  hereof at the address shown in the Register or, at the option of the
Holder  hereof,  to such other  place in the United  States of America as Holder
hereof shall designate to the Trustee in writing.  At the request of a Holder of
at least $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series B Debentures, interest
on such  Debentures  will be payable  by wire  transfer  within the  continental
United  States  in  immediately  available  funds  to the  bank  account  number
specified in writing by such Holder to the Registrar prior to the Regular Record
Date.

                  The principal amount hereof and any interest due on the Stated
Maturity Date or a Redemption Date (other than an Interest Payment Date) will be
paid only upon  surrender of this  Debenture at the  principal  corporate  trust
office of First Union National Bank, Paying Agent, in Newark,  New Jersey, or at
such other office or agency of the Paying Agent as the Company  shall  designate
by written notice to the Holder of this Debenture.

                  The indebtedness evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent
provided in the  Indenture,  subordinate  and subject in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior  Indebtedness,  and this Debenture is issued
subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect  thereto.  The Holder of
this Debenture,  by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions,  (b)  authorizes  and directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such
action as may be necessary or  appropriate  to  acknowledge  or  effectuate  the
subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact for
any and all such  purposes.  The  Holder of this  Debenture,  by his  acceptance
hereof,  hereby  waives  all  notice  of the  acceptance  of  the  subordination
provisions  contained  herein  and in the  Indenture  by each  holder  of Senior
Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives reliance
by each such holder upon said provisions.

                  This  Debenture  is  one  of  a  duly  authorized   series  of
Debentures  of the  Company  (herein  sometimes  referred  to as the  "Series  B
Debentures"),  specified in the Indenture, limited in aggregate principal amount
to  $97,938,150  issued under and  pursuant to an Indenture  dated as of June 1,
1996 executed and delivered  between the Company and First Union  National Bank,
as trustee (the "Trustee"),  as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture
dated as of  February  1,  1997  between  the  Company  and the  Trustee  (as so
supplemented  being hereinafter  referred to as the  "Indenture").  The Series B
Debentures are initially  being issued to the Trust, to be held on behalf of the
Trust by its property trustee (the "Property  Trustee").  Concurrently  with the
issuance of the Series B Debentures,  the Trust is issuing its trust securities,
representing  undivided  beneficial  interests  in the  assets  of the Trust and
having an  aggregate  liquidation  amount equal to the  principal  amount of the
Series B Debentures,  including the Trust's 8.125%  Cumulative  Quarterly Income
Preferred Securities, Series B (the "Preferred Securities"). By the terms of the
Indenture,  Debentures are issuable in series which may vary as to amount,  date

<PAGE>

of  maturity,  rate  of  interest  and in  other  respects  as in the  Indenture
provided.  Reference is made to the  Indenture and all  indentures  supplemental
thereto for a description  of the rights,  limitations  of rights,  obligations,
duties and immunities  thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of
the  Debentures.  Each  term  used in this  Debenture  which is  defined  in the
Indenture  and not defined  herein shall have the meaning  assigned to it in the
Indenture.

                  At the  option of the  Company,  the Series B  Debentures  are
redeemable  prior to maturity (i) at any time on or after  February 7, 2002,  in
whole or in part, and (ii) if a Special Event shall occur and be continuing,  in
whole (but not in part),  in each case at 100% of the principal  amount  thereof
plus  accrued  interest to the  Redemption  Date.  A "Special  Event" shall mean
either a "Tax Event" or an  "Investment  Company  Event." "Tax Event" shall mean
that the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel (which may be regular
counsel to the Company or an  Affiliate,  but not an employee  thereof and which
must be acceptable  to the Property  Trustee of the Trust)  experienced  in such
matters  to the  effect  that,  as a  result  of any  amendment  to,  or  change
(including any announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any  regulations
thereunder)  of  the  United  States  or any  political  subdivision  or  taxing
authority thereof or therein affecting taxation,  or as a result of any official
administrative  pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such
laws  or   regulations,   which   amendment  or  change  is  effective  or  such
interpretation  or  pronouncement  is announced on or after the date of original
issuance of Preferred Securities,  there is more than an insubstantial risk that
(i) the Trust is subject to United  States  Federal  income tax with  respect to
interest received on the Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Company to the
Trust on the  Series B  Debentures  will not be  deductible  for  United  States
Federal  income  tax  purposes  or (iii) the Trust is  subject to more than a de
minimis  amount  of other  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or  other  governmental
charges. "Investment Company Event" shall mean the occurrence of a change in law
or regulation or a change in  interpretation or application of law or regulation
by any legislative body, court,  governmental agency or regulatory  authority (a
"Change in 1940 Act Law") to the effect that the Trust is or will be  considered
an "investment  company" that is required to be registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended,  which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective
on or after the date of original issuance of the Preferred Securities.

                  At  least  30 days  but not  more  than  60  days  before  the
Redemption  Date,  the  Trustee  shall  mail or  caused to be mailed a notice of
redemption by  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to each Holder of Series B
Debentures to be redeemed.

                  In the event of redemption  of this  Debenture in part only, a
new Series B Debenture or Debentures for the  unredeemed  portion hereof will be
issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

                  In case an Event  of  Default  with  respect  to the  Series B
Debentures occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest on all of the
Series B Debentures may (and, in certain  circumstances shall) be declared,  and
upon such declaration  shall become,  due and payable,  in the manner,  with the
effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
<PAGE>
                  The Indenture  contains  provisions for defeasance at any time
of the entire indebtedness of this Debenture upon compliance by the Company with
certain conditions set forth therein.

                  Subject to certain  exceptions in the Indenture  which require
the consent of every Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture
or may  waive  future  compliance  by the  Company  with any  provisions  of the
Indenture  with the consent of the  Holders of at least a majority in  aggregate
principal amount of the Debentures of each series affected thereby provided that
if the Series B Debentures  are held by the Trust,  no such  amendment or waiver
that  adversely  affects  the  holders  of the  Preferred  Securities  shall  be
effective  without  the prior  consent of the  holders of at least a majority in
aggregate liquidation amount of the outstanding Preferred Securities. Subject to
certain  exceptions  in the  Indenture,  without  the  consent of any  Debenture
Holder,  the  Company  and the  Trustee  may  amend  the  Indenture  to cure any
ambiguity,  defect or  inconsistency,  to bind a successor to the obligations of
the  Indenture,  to  provide  for  uncertificated   Debentures  in  addition  to
certificated  Debentures,  to comply with any requirements of the Debentures and
the Securities and Exchange  Commission in connection with the  qualification of
the  Indenture  under the TIA,  or to make any change  that,  in the  reasonable
judgment of the Company,  does not adversely  affect the rights of any Debenture
Holder. Amendments bind all Holders and subsequent Holders.

                  No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Debenture or the Indenture  shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,
which is absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay the  principal of and interest on
this  Debenture  at the time and place  and at the rate and in the money  herein
prescribed.

                  So long as no Event of  Default  with  respect to the Series B
Debentures has occurred and is  continuing,  the Company shall have the right at
any time and from  time to time to extend  the  interest  payment  period of the
Series B Debentures for up to 20 consecutive  quarters (the "Extension Period"),
provided that no Extension  Period shall extend beyond the Stated  Maturity Date
or  Redemption  Date of any  Series  B  Debenture.  At the end of the  Extension
Period,  the Company  shall pay all interest  then accrued and unpaid  (together
with  interest  thereon  at the rate  specified  for the  Series  B  Debentures,
compounded quarterly, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable
under applicable law). During such Extension Period, the Company may not declare
or pay any dividend on, redeem, purchase,  acquire or make a liquidation payment
with respect to, any of its capital stock.  Prior to the termination of any such
Extension Period, the Company may further extend such Extension Period, provided
that  such  Extension  Period  together  with  all  such  previous  and  further
extensions thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters and shall not extend
beyond the Stated Maturity Date or Redemption Date of any Series B Debenture. At
the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment of all amounts
then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period,  subject to the
foregoing restrictions.
<PAGE>
                  Series B  Debentures  are  issuable  only in  registered  form
without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral  multiple  thereof.  As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
this Debenture is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series B
Debentures of a different  authorized  denomination,  as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same.

                  As   provided  in  the   Indenture   and  subject  to  certain
limitations  therein set forth,  this  Debenture is  transferable  by the Holder
hereof upon  surrender of this  Debenture  for  registration  of transfer at the
office  or agency  of the  Registrar  accompanied  by a  written  instrument  or
instruments of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Registrar duly executed by
the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one
or more new Series B Debentures  of  authorized  denominations  and for the same
aggregate  principal  amount  will be issued  to the  designated  transferee  or
transferees.  No  service  charge  will be made for any such  transfer,  but the
Company  may  require  payment  of a sum  sufficient  to cover  any tax or other
governmental charge payable in relation thereto.

                  Prior to  presentment  for  registration  of  transfer of this
Debenture, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Registrar may deem
and treat the Holder  hereof as the absolute  owner hereof  (whether or not this
Debenture  shall be  overdue  and  notwithstanding  any notice of  ownership  or
writing  hereon  made by anyone  other than the  Registrar)  for the  purpose of
receiving  payment of or on account of the  principal  hereof and  interest  due
hereon and for all other  purposes,  and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor
any  Paying  Agent nor any  Registrar  shall be  affected  by any  notice to the
contrary.

                  No recourse  shall be had for the payment of any  principal of
or interest on this  Debenture,  or for any claim based hereon,  or otherwise in
respect  hereof,  or  based  on or in  respect  of the  Indenture,  against  any
incorporator,  stockholder,  officer or director,  past,  present or future,  as
such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation,  whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability being, by the acceptance
hereof  and as part of the  consideration  for the  issuance  hereof,  expressly
waived and released.

                  This  Debenture   shall  not  be  valid  until  an  authorized
signatory of the Trustee  manually signs and dates the Trustee's  Certificate of
Authentication below.

                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused this Debenture to
be  signed  manually  or by  facsimile  by its  duly  authorized  officer  and a
facsimile of its corporate seal to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon.

entitled  to  give  such  request,  demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice,
consent, waiver or other Act, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so.

notice,  consent,  waiver or other Act may be given  before or after such Record

consented to such request, demand,  authorization,  direction,  notice, consent,
waiver or other Act, and for that purpose the  outstanding  Debentures  shall be
computed as of such Record Date.

     (l) provisions, if any, for any sinking or analogous fund; and

     (m) any other  provisions  expressing or referring to
         the  terms   and   conditions   upon   which  the

book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on
the Business Day immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Date or from the most recent  Interest  Payment Date to which  interest has been
paid or duly provided for with respect to such Series A Debenture;  except that,
so long as there is no existing  Defaulted  Interest (as defined in Section 2.03

registered  form  without  coupons  and  only  in  denominations  of $25 and any

such period.

Debentures,

                              America as at the time of payment is legal tender
                              for the payment of public and private debts;

                    (ii)      the  principal  and   Redemption   Price  of  any

                              for such Interest  Payment Date,  interest accrued

                              within   the   continental    United   States   in

                              number of such Holder  specified  in such  request
                              and entered on the Register by the  Registrar  and
                              (2) payments made in respect of global  Debentures
                              shall be made in  immediately  available  funds to
                              the Depositary.

                     Except as  specified  pursuant  to Section  2.01 or Section
4.01(b) hereof,  interest on any Debenture  which is payable,  and is punctually
paid or duly  provided  for, on any  Interest  Payment Date shall be paid to the
Person in whose name that Debenture (or one or more  Predecessor  Debentures) is
registered  at the  close  of  business  on the  Regular  Record  Date  for such
interest.  Any interest on any Debenture which is payable, but is not punctually
paid  or  duly  provided  for,  on any  Interest  Payment  Date  (herein  called
"Defaulted  Interest")  shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the
relevant  Regular  Record  Date by virtue of having been such  Holder,  and such
Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company,  at its election in each case, as
provided in Clause (1) and (2) below:

                     (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any  Defaulted
Interest  to the  Persons in whose  names the  Debentures  (or their  respective
Predecessor  Debentures)  are  registered  at the close of business on a Special
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest,  which shall be fixed in
the following manner. The Company shall, not less than 15 Business Days prior to
the date of the  proposed  payment,  notify the Trustee and the Paying  Agent in
writing  of the  amount  of  Defaulted  Interest  proposed  to be  paid  on each
Debenture and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company
shall  deposit with the Paying  Agent an amount of money equal to the  aggregate
amount  proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted  Interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date
of the proposed  payment,  such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the  Persons  entitled to such  Defaulted  Interest as in this Clause
provided.  The Special  Record Date for the payment of such  Defaulted  Interest
shall be the close of  business on the tenth  calendar  day prior to the date of
the proposed  payment.  The Trustee shall, in the name and at the expense of the
Company, cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor to be given to the Holders thereof, not less than 7
calendar days prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment
of such  Defaulted  Interest and the Special  Record Date  therefor  having been
given,  such Defaulted  Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the
Debentures (or their  respective  Predecessor  Debentures) are registered at the
close of  business  on such  Special  Record Date and shall no longer be payable
pursuant to the following Clause (2).

                     (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted  Interest
on the  Debentures  in  any  other  lawful  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the
requirements of any securities  exchange on which such Debentures may be listed,
and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given
by the  Company to the  Trustee  and the Paying  Agent of the  proposed  payment
pursuant to this Clause,  such manner of payment shall be deemed  practicable by
the Paying Agent.

                     Subject to the foregoing  provisions of this Section,  each
Debenture  delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in
exchange  for or in lieu of any  other  Debenture  shall  carry  the  rights  to
interest  accrued and unpaid,  and to accrue,  which were  carried by such other
Debenture.

               SECTION 2.04 Execution, Authentication and Delivery

                     (a) The  Debentures  shall be  executed  on  behalf  of the
Company by its Chairman, its President or one of its Vice Presidents,  under its
corporate seal imprinted or reproduced  thereon and attested by its Secretary or
one of its  Assistant  Secretaries.  The  signature  of any such  Officer on the
Debentures may be manual or facsimile.

                     (b) Debentures  bearing the manual or facsimile  signatures
of  individuals  who were at any time the proper  Officers of the Company  shall
bind the  Company,  notwithstanding  that such  individuals  or any of them have
ceased to hold such  offices  prior to the  authentication  and delivery of such
Debentures or did not hold such offices at the date of such Debentures.

                     (c) No  Debenture  shall be entitled  to any benefit  under
this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on
such Debenture a Certificate of  Authentication  duly executed by the Trustee by
manual signature of a Trust Officer, and such Certificate of Authentication upon
any Debenture  shall be conclusive  evidence,  and the only evidence,  that such
Debenture has been duly authenticated and made available for delivery hereunder.

                     (d) The Trustee shall  authenticate and deliver  Debentures
of a series,  for original issue, at one time or from time to time in accordance

                          (1) a Board Resolution approving the form or forms and
terms of such Debentures;

                          (2) a Company Order requesting the  authentication and

aggregate  liquidation amount of the Trust Securities to be issued  concurrently
with such Debentures;

                          (3) unless previously  delivered,  this Indenture or a
supplemental  indenture  hereto  setting forth the form of such  Debentures  and
establishing the terms thereof;

                          (4) the Debentures of such series,  executed on behalf
of the Company in accordance with Section 2.04(a) hereof;

                          (5) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that:

                              (i) the form or forms of such Debentures have been
duly authorized by the Company and have been  established in conformity with the
provisions of this Indenture; and

                              (ii)  such  Debentures,   when  authenticated  and
delivered  by the Trustee and issued and  delivered by the Company in the manner
and subject to any  conditions  specified in such Opinion of Counsel,  will have
been duly issued  under this  Indenture  and will  constitute  valid and legally
binding  obligations of the Company,  entitled to the benefits  provided by this
Indenture,  and  enforceable  in  accordance  with their terms,  subject,  as to
enforcement  to laws  relating to or  affecting  generally  the  enforcement  of
creditors' rights, including, without limitation, bankruptcy and insolvency laws
and to general principles of equity  (regardless of whether such  enforceability
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and

                              (iii)  that  this  Indenture  or any  supplemental
indenture referred to in clause (3) above has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered  by the Company and is a valid  instrument  legally  binding  upon the
Company,  enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject as to enforcement to
laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, including,  without limitation,
bankruptcy and insolvency laws and to general  principles of equity  (regardless
of whether such  enforceability  is  considered  in a proceeding in equity or at
law); and

                              (iv) that all  consents,  approvals  and orders of
any commission, governmental authority or agency required in connection with the
issuance and delivery of such Debentures have been obtained.

                     (e) an Officer's Certificate  certifying that no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

                     (f) The  Trustee  shall act as the  initial  authenticating
agent.  Thereafter,   the  Trustee  may  appoint  an  authenticating  agent.  An
authenticating agent may authenticate Debentures whenever the Trustee may do so.
Each  reference in this  Indenture  to  authentication  by the Trustee  includes
authentication  by such agent.  The Trustee shall pay any  authenticating  agent
appointed  by the  Trustee  reasonable  compensation  for its  services  and the
Trustee shall be reimbursed for such payment by the Company  pursuant to Section
7.07 hereof.  The  provisions set forth in Section 7.02,  Section 7.03,  Section
7.04 and Section 7.07 hereof shall be applicable to any authenticating agent.

                     SECTION 2.05 Registrar and Paying Agent

                     The  Company  shall  maintain  or cause  to be  maintained,
within or  outside  the  State of New  Jersey,  an  office  or agency  where the
Debentures  may be  presented  for  registration  of  transfer  or for  exchange
("Registrar"), a Paying Agent at whose office the Debentures may be presented or
surrendered for payment, and an office or agency where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the  Debentures and this Indenture may be served.
The Registrar  shall keep a register (the  "Register")  of the Debentures and of
their transfer and exchange.  The Company may have one or more co-Registrars and
one or more additional Paying Agents. The term Registrar includes any additional
registrar and the term Paying Agent  includes any additional  paying agent.  The
corporate  office of the Trustee in Newark,  New Jersey,  shall initially be the
Registrar for the Series A Debentures and agent for service of notice or demands
on the  Company,  and the Trustee  shall  initially  be the Paying Agent for the
Series A Debentures.

                     The  Company  shall  enter  into  an   appropriate   agency
agreement with any Registrar,  Paying Agent or co-Registrar  (if not the Company
or the Trustee or an affiliate of the Trustee).  The agreement  shall  implement
the provisions of this  Indenture  that relate to such agent.  The Company shall
give  prompt  written  notice to the Trustee and to the Holders of any change of
location  of such  office or agency.  If at any time the  Company  shall fail to
maintain or cause to be maintained  any such required  office or agency or shall
fail to furnish  the  Trustee  with the  address  thereof,  such  presentations,
surrenders,  notices  and  demands  may be made or served at the  address of the
Trustee set forth in Section 11.02 hereof.  The Company shall notify the Trustee
of the name and  address of any such agent.  If the Company  fails to maintain a
Registrar,  Paying Agent or agent for service of notices or demands, the Trustee
shall act as such and shall be entitled  to  appropriate  compensation  therefor
pursuant to Section 7.07 hereof. The Company or any Affiliate of the Company may
act Paying Agent,  Registrar or co-Registrar or agent for service of notices and
demands.

                     The  Company  may also from time to time  designate  one or
more  other  offices  or  agencies  where the  Debentures  may be  presented  or
surrendered  for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee and to
the Holders of any such  designation or rescission and of any change in location
of any such other office or agency.

                SECTION 2.06 Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust


                     Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  prior to or on each
due date of the principal of and premium (if any) and interest on any Debenture,
the Company shall deposit with the Paying Agent a sum of money sufficient to pay
such principal, premium (if any) and interest so becoming due. The Company shall
require  each Paying  Agent  (other than the Trustee or the Company) to agree in
writing that such Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or
the Trustee all money held by the Paying  Agent for the payment of  principal of
and premium (if any) and interest on the Debentures and shall notify the Trustee
of any Default by the Company in making any such payment. At any time during the
continuance of any such Default, the Paying Agent shall, upon the request of the
Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all money so held in trust and account for
any money  disbursed  by it. The Company at any time may require as Paying Agent
to pay all  money  held  by it to the  Trustee  and to  account  for  any  money
disbursed by it. Upon doing so, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability
for the money so paid over to the Trustee.  If the Company,  a Subsidiary  or an
Affiliate of either of them acts as Paying Agent,  it shall  segregate the money
held by it as Paying Agent and hold it as a separate trust fund.

                       SECTION 2.07 Debentureholder Lists

                     The  Trustee  shall  preserve  in as  current  a form as is
reasonably  practicable  the most recent list  available  to it of the names and
addresses of Debentureholders.  If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company
shall cause to be furnished to the Trustee on or before the Record Date for each
Interest  Payment  Date and at such other  times as the  Trustee  may request in
writing,  within five Business Days of such request, a list, in such form as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Debentureholders.

                       SECTION 2.08 Transfer and Exchange

                     When  Debentures  are  presented  to  the  Registrar  or  a
co-Registrar  with a request to register the transfer or to exchange them for an
equal  principal  amount of  Debentures  of the same series of other  authorized
denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange as
requested  if its  reasonable  requirements  for such  transactions  are met. To
permit  registrations  of transfer and exchanges,  the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate Debentures, all at the Registrar's request.

                     Every Debenture  presented or surrendered for  registration
of  transfer  or for  exchange  shall  (if so  required  by the  Company  or the
Registrar)  be duly  endorsed,  or be  accompanied  by a written  instrument  of
transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Registrar  duly executed by the Holder or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

                     The Company shall not require  payment of a service  charge
for any registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures,  but the Company may
require  payment  of a sum  sufficient  to pay all taxes,  assessments  or other
governmental  charges that may be imposed in connection with the registration of
the transfer or exchange of Debentures from the Debentureholder  requesting such
transfer or exchange  (other than any  exchange of a temporary  Debenture  for a
definitive Debenture not involving any change in ownership).

                     The  Company  shall  not  be  required  to  make,  and  the
Registrar  need not register,  transfers or exchanges of (a) any Debenture for a
period  beginning  at the  opening of  business  15 days before the mailing of a
notice of redemption  of  Debentures  and ending at the close of business on the
day of such mailing or (b) any  Debenture  selected,  called or being called for
redemption,  except,  in the case of any  Debenture to be redeemed in part,  the
portion thereof not to be redeemed.

                       SECTION 2.09 Replacement Debentures

                     If  (a)  any  mutilated  Debenture  is  surrendered  to the
Company or the Trustee,  or (b) the Company and the Trustee receive  evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Debenture, and there
is delivered  to the Company and the Trustee such  Debenture or indemnity as may
be  required  by them to save each of them  harmless,  then,  in the  absence of
notice to the Company or the Trustee that such  Debenture has been acquired by a
bona  fide  purchaser,  the  Company  shall  execute  in  exchange  for any such
mutilated Debenture or in lieu of any such destroyed,  lost or stolen Debenture,
a new  Debenture  of the same  series  and of like tenor and  principal  amount,
bearing  a number  not  contemporaneously  outstanding,  and the  Trustee  shall
authenticate and make such new Debenture available for delivery.

                     In case  any  such  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or  stolen
Debenture  has become or is about to become due and  payable,  or is about to be
redeemed  by the  Company  pursuant  to  Article 3 hereof,  the  Company  in its
discretion  may,  instead  of  issuing a new  Debenture,  pay or  purchase  such
Debenture, as the case may be.

                     Upon the issuance of any new Debentures  under this Section
2.09,  the Company may require the payment of a sum  sufficient to cover any tax
or other  governmental  charge that may be imposed in  relation  thereto and any
other  expenses  (including  the fees and expenses of the Trustee) in connection
therewith.

                     Every new Debenture issued pursuant to this Section 2.09 in
lieu of any mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen Debenture shall constitute an
original  additional  contractual  obligation of the Company (whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall be at any time enforceable)
and shall be entitled to all benefits of this Indenture equally and ratably with
any and all other Debentures duly issued hereunder.

                     The provisions of this Section 2.09 are exclusive and shall
preclude (to the extent  lawful) all other  rights and remedies  with respect to
the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures.

     SECTION 2.10 Outstanding Debentures; Determinations of Holders' Action

                     Debentures  outstanding  at any time are all the Debentures
authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to
it for  cancellation,  those  mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen  Debentures
referred to in Section 2.09 hereof,  those  redeemed by the Company  pursuant to
Article 3 hereof, and those described in this Section 2.10 as not outstanding. A
Debenture does not cease to be  outstanding  because the Company or a Subsidiary
or Affiliate thereof holds the Debenture; provided, however, that in determining
whether the Holders of the requisite  principal  amount of Debentures have given
or concurred in any request, demand,  authorization,  direction, notice, consent
or  waiver  hereunder,  Debentures  owned  by the  Company  or a  Subsidiary  or
Affiliate  (other than any Trust so long as any of the  Preferred  Securities of
such  Trust  are  outstanding)  shall  be  disregarded  and  deemed  not  to  be
outstanding.

                     Subject to the foregoing,  only  Debentures  outstanding at
the time of such  determination  shall be considered  in any such  determination
(including determinations pursuant to Articles 3, 6 and 9).

                     If a Debenture is replaced pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof,
it ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it
that the replaced Debenture is held by a bona fide purchaser.

                     If the Paying  Agent  (other than the  Company)  holds,  in
accordance with this  Indenture,  at the Stated Maturity Date or on a Redemption
Date,  money  sufficient  to pay  the  Debentures  payable  on that  date,  then
immediately on the Stated Maturity Date or such Redemption Date, as the case may
be, such Debentures shall cease to be outstanding, and interest, if any, on such
Debentures shall cease to accrue.

                        SECTION 2.11 Temporary Debentures

                     The Company may execute temporary Debentures,  and upon the
Company's  Order,  the  Trustee  shall  authenticate  and  make  such  temporary
Debentures  available  for  delivery.  Temporary  Debentures  shall be  printed,
lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized
denomination,  in the same series and principal  amount and of like tenor as the
definitive Debentures in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate
insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Officers of the
Company  executing such Debentures may determine,  as conclusively  evidenced by
their execution of such Debentures.

                     After  the  preparation  of  definitive   Debentures,   the
temporary Debentures shall be exchangeable for definitive Debentures of the same
series upon surrender of the temporary Debentures at the office or agency of the
Company  designated  for such purpose  pursuant to Section 2.05 hereof,  without
charge to the Holders  thereof.  Upon surrender for  cancellation  of any one or
more temporary Debentures,  the Company shall execute a like principal amount of
definitive  Debentures of the same series of authorized  denominations,  and the
Trustee,  upon  receipt of a Company  Order,  shall  authenticate  and make such
Debentures available for delivery in exchange therefor.  Until so exchanged, the
temporary  Debentures  shall in all  respects be  entitled to the same  benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Debentures.

                         SECTION 2.12 Book-Entry System

                     In order to utilize a book-entry-only system for all or any
portion of the  Debentures of any series,  all or a portion of the Debentures of
any series may be issued in the form of one or more fully registered  Debentures
of the same series for the aggregate principal amount of such Debentures of each
Issue Date, interest rate and Stated Maturity Date (a "global Debenture"), which
global  Debenture  shall  be  registered  in the  name  of the  depositary  (the
"Depositary")  selected  by the  Company  or in the  name of  such  Depositary's
nominee.  Each  global  Debenture  shall  be  delivered  by the  Trustee  to the
Depositary or pursuant to the  Depositary's  instruction and shall bear a legend
substantially to the following effect:  "Except as otherwise provided in Section
2.12 of the Indenture,  this Debenture may be  transferred,  in whole but not in
part, only to another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor  Depositary or
to a nominee of such successor Depositary."

                     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.12 or
of Section 2.08 hereof,  a global  Debenture may be transferred in whole but not
in part and in the manner provided in Section 2.08 hereof,  only by a nominee of
the  Depositary  for such series,  or by the Depositary or any such nominee of a
successor Depositary for such series selected or approved by the Company or to a
nominee of such successor Depositary.

                     If (i) at any time the Depositary for global  Debentures of
any series of Debentures  notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue  as  Depositary  for  such  global  Debentures  or if at any  time  the
Depositary for such global  Debentures  shall no longer be registered or in good
standing under the Exchange Act or other applicable statute or regulation, and a
successor  Depositary for such global Debentures is not appointed by the Company
within 90 days after the Company  receives  such notice or becomes aware of such
condition,  as the  case  may  be,  (ii)  the  Company  determines  in its  sole
discretion,  that the Debentures of any series shall no longer be represented by
one or  more  global  Debentures  and  delivers  to  the  Trustee  an  Officer's
Certificate  evidencing such  determination  or (iii) an Event of Default occurs
and is  continuing,  then the  provisions  of this  Section 2.12 shall no longer
apply to the Debentures of such series.  In such event, the Company will execute
and the  Trustee,  upon  receipt of an  Officer's  Certificate  evidencing  such
determination by the Company,  will authenticate and deliver  Debentures of such
series  and  of  like  tenor  in  definitive   registered  form,  in  authorized
denominations,  and in aggregate  principal amount equal to the principal amount
of the global Debentures of such series in exchange for such global  Debentures.
Upon the  exchange  of  global  Debentures  for such  Debentures  in  definitive
registered  form  without  coupons,  in  authorized  denominations,  the  global
Debentures  shall be cancelled by the Trustee.  Such  Debentures  in  definitive
registered  form  issued in  exchange  for global  Debentures  pursuant  to this
Section  2.12  shall  be  registered  in  such  names  and  in  such  authorized
denominations  as the Depositary,  pursuant to  instructions  from its direct or
indirect  participants  or otherwise,  shall  instruct the Trustee.  The Trustee
shall deliver such  Debentures to the Persons in whose names such Debentures are
so registered.

                     Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in
a global  Debenture  shall not be  entitled  to  receive  physical  delivery  of
Debentures in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders thereof for
any purpose under this Indenture.

                     Members of or participants in the Depositary  shall have no
rights under this Indenture  with respect to any global  Debenture held on their
behalf by the Depositary,  and such  Depositary or its nominee,  as the case may
be, may be treated by the Company,  the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or
the Trustee as the Holder of such global Debentures for all purposes whatsoever.
Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  nothing  herein shall prevent the Company,  the
Trustee,  or any agent of the Company or the Trustee,  from giving effect to any
written  certification proxy or other authorization  furnished by the Depositary
or impair,  as between  the  Depositary  and its  members or  participants,  the
operation of customary practices governing exercise of the rights of a Holder of
any  Debenture,  including  without  limitation the granting of proxies or other
authorization   of   participants   to  give  or  take  any   request,   demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action which a Holder
is entitled to give or take under this Indenture.

                     SECTION 2.13 Cancellation

                     All Debentures  surrendered for payment,  redemption by the
Company  pursuant  to Article 3 hereof or  registration  of transfer or exchange
shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee,  be delivered to the
Trustee and shall be promptly  canceled by the  Trustee.  The Company may at any
time  deliver  to  the  Trustee  for  cancellation  any  Debentures   previously
authenticated  and made available for delivery  hereunder  which the Company may
have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Debentures so delivered shall be
promptly  canceled  by the  Trustee.  The  Company  may not reissue or issue new
Debentures  to replace  Debentures  it has paid or  delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation. No Debentures shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for
any  Debentures  canceled as provided in this Section 2.13,  except as expressly
permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled  Debentures held by the Trustee shall
be destroyed by the Trustee,  and the Trustee  shall  deliver a  certificate  of
destruction to the Company.


                                    ARTICLE 3
                                   REDEMPTION

                   SECTION 3.01 Redemption: Notice to Trustee

                     (a) The Series A Debentures are subject to redemption prior
to maturity as provided therein.

                     (b) The  redemption  terms  for any  additional  series  of
Debentures  shall be as specified in the  supplemental  indenture  creating such
series of Debentures.

                     (c) If any or  all  of the  Debentures  are to be  redeemed
pursuant to Section  3.01 (a) or (b) hereof,  the Company  shall  deliver to the
Trustee at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date a Company Order specifying
the series and principal  amount of Debentures to be redeemed and the Redemption
Date and  Redemption  Price for such  Debentures.  Such  Company  Order shall be
accompanied by a Board Resolution authorizing such redemption. If the Debentures
of a series are held by a Trust,  the Company  shall also deliver a copy of such
Company Order to the Property Trustee for such Trust.

               SECTION 3.02 Selection of Debentures to be Redeemed


                     If less than all the outstanding Debentures of a series are
to be redeemed at any time,  the Trustee  shall  select the  Debentures  of such
series to be redeemed by lot or by any other method the Trustee  considers  fair
and  appropriate.  The Trustee shall make the selection at least 30 but not more
than 60 days before the  Redemption  Date from  outstanding  Debentures  of such
series not previously  called for redemption.  Provisions of this Indenture that
apply to Debentures  called for redemption  also apply to portions of Debentures
called for  redemption.  The Trustee  shall  notify the Company  promptly of the
Debentures or portions of Debentures to be redeemed.

                        SECTION 3.03 Notice of Redemption

                     At  least  30 days but not  more  than 60 days  before  the
Redemption  Date,  the  Trustee,  in the  Company's  name  and at the  Company's
expense,  shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of redemption by first-class
mail,  postage  prepaid,  to each  Holder of  Debentures  to be redeemed at such
Holder's last address as it appears in the Register.

                     The notice of redemption  shall  identify the Debentures to
be redeemed, the provision of the Debentures or this Indenture pursuant to which
the Debentures called for redemption are being redeemed and shall state:

                     (1) the Redemption Date;

                     (2) the Redemption Price;

                     (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

                     (4) that  payment  of the  Redemption  Price of  Debentures
called for redemption will be made only upon surrender of such Debentures to the
Paying Agent;

                     (5) if fewer  than all the  outstanding  Debentures  of any
series are to be  redeemed,  the  identification  and  principal  amounts of the
particular Debentures to be redeemed and that, on and after the Redemption Date,
upon  surrender of such  Debentures,  a new  Debenture or Debentures of the same
series  and of like  tenor and in a  principal  amount  equal to the  unredeemed
portion thereof will be issued; and

                     (6)  that,  unless  the  Company  defaults  in  paying  the
Redemption Price of the Debentures called for redemption,  plus accrued interest
thereon to the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on such Debentures
on and after the Redemption Date.

                     Any  notice  of  redemption  given in the  manner  provided
herein shall be  conclusively  presumed to have been given,  whether or not such
notice is actually received.  Failure to mail any notice or defect in the mailed
notice or the mailing  thereof in respect of any Debenture  shall not affect the
validity of the redemption of any other Debenture.

                   SECTION 3.04 Effect of Notice of Redemption

                     After  notice  of  redemption  has been  given,  Debentures
called for redemption shall become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at
the Redemption  Price and from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Company
shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest), such
Debentures  shall cease to bear interest.  Upon the later of the Redemption Date
and  the  date  such  Debentures  are  surrendered  to the  Paying  Agent,  such
Debentures shall be paid at the Redemption  Price,  plus accrued interest to the
Redemption  Date,  provided that  installments of interest on Debentures with an
Interest  Payment  Date  which is on or prior to the  Redemption  Date  shall be
payable  to  the  Holders  of  such  Debentures,  or  one  or  more  Predecessor
Debentures,  registered  as such at the close of business on the Regular  Record
Dates therefor according to their terms and provisions.

                    SECTION 3.05 Deposit of Redemption Price

                     On or prior  to the  Redemption  Date,  the  Company  shall
deposit  with the Paying  Agent (or if the Company or an Affiliate is the Paying
Agent,  shall  segregate and hold in trust or cause such  Affiliate to segregate
and hold in trust) money  sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and accrued
interest on, all Debentures to be redeemed on that  Redemption  Date. The Paying
Agent shall  return to the Company any money in excess of the amount  sufficient
to pay the  Redemption  Price of, and accrued  interest on, all Debentures to be
redeemed  and any  interest  accrued on the amount  deposited  pursuant  to this

                     Upon surrender of a Debenture that is redeemed in part, the

                                    COVENANTS

                       SECTION 4.01 Payment of Debentures

any, and interest (including interest accruing during an Extension Period and/or
on or after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy or reorganization relating to
the Company,  whether or not a claim for post-filing interest is allowed in such
proceeding)  on the  Debentures  on or  prior  to the  dates  and in the  manner
provided in such  Debentures or pursuant to this  Indenture.  An  installment of
principal,  premium,  if  any,  or  interest  shall  be  considered  paid on the
applicable  due date if on such date the Trustee or the Paying Agent  holds,  in
accordance with this Indenture,  money sufficient to pay all of such installment
then due.  With  respect to any  Debenture,  the Company  shall pay  interest on
overdue  principal and interest on overdue  installments of interest  (including
interest  accruing during an Extension Period and/or on or after the filing of a
petition in bankruptcy or reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not
a claim for post-filing  interest is allowed in such proceeding),  to the extent
lawful,  at the rate per annum borne by such  Debenture,  compounded  quarterly.
Interest on overdue  interest  shall  accrue from the date such  amounts  become
overdue.

hereof or any other provision herein to the contrary, the Company shall have the
right in its  sole and  absolute  discretion  at any time and from  time to time
while the  Debentures  of any  series  are  outstanding,  so long as no Event of
Default  with  respect  to  such  series  of  Debentures  has  occurred  and  is
continuing,  to defer  payments of interest by extending  the  interest  payment
period for such series of Debentures for the Extension  Period, if any, for such
series of  Debentures,  provided  that such  Extension  Period  shall not extend
beyond the Stated  Maturity  Date or  Redemption  Date of any  Debenture of such
series,  and  provided  further  that at the end of each  Extension  Period  the
Company shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid  (together  with interest
thereon to the extent permitted by applicable law at the rate per annum borne by
such Debentures).  Prior to the termination of an Extension Period,  the Company
may shorten or may further extend the interest payment period for such series of
Debentures,  provided that such Extension Period together with all such previous
and  further  extensions  may not exceed the maximum  duration of the  Extension
Period for such series of Debentures  or extend beyond the Stated  Maturity Date
or Redemption  Date of any Debenture of such series.  The Company shall give the
Trustee  notice of the Company's  election to begin an Extension  Period for any
series of  Debentures  and any  shortening  or  extension  thereof  at least one
Business  Day prior to the date the notice of the record or payment  date of the
related  distribution on the Preferred  Securities  issued by the Trust which is

applicable  self-regulatory  organization,  but in any  event  not less than two
Business  Days prior to the Record  Date fixed by the Company for the payment of
such  interest.  The  Company  shall give or cause the Trustee to give notice (a
form of which shall be provided by the Company to the Trustee) of the  Company's
election  to begin an  Extension  Period to the  Holders  by first  class  mail,
postage prepaid.

                SECTION 4.02 Prohibition Against Dividends, etc.

redeem, purchase,  acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of
its Capital  Stock (i) during an  Extension  Period,  (ii) if at such time there
shall have occurred and is continuing any Default or Event of Default,  or (iii)
if the  Company  shall  be in  default  with  respect  to its  payment  or other
obligations under any Guarantee Agreement.

                            SECTION 4.03 SEC Reports

                     The  Company  shall file with the  Trustee,  within 15 days
after it  files  them  with the SEC,  copies  of its  annual  report  and of the
information,  documents  and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of
the  foregoing  as the SEC may by rules  and  regulations  prescribe)  which the
Company is required to file with the SEC  pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange  Act. If the Company is not subject to the  reporting  requirements  of
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company shall file with the Trustee
such information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any
of the foregoing as the SEC may by rules and  regulations  prescribe)  which are
specified  in Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange  Act. The Company  shall also
comply with the provisions of Section 314(a) of the TIA.

                      SECTION 4.04 Compliance Certificates

                     (a) The Company  shall  deliver to the  Trustee,  within 90
days  after  the  end of  each  of the  Company's  fiscal  years,  an  Officer's
Certificate  stating  whether or not the signer knows of any Default or Event of
Default.  Such  certificate  shall  contain a  certification  from the principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer or principal  accounting officer
of the Company as to his or her knowledge of the Company's  compliance  with all
conditions  and  covenants  under this  Indenture.  For purposes of this Section
4.04(a),  such  compliance  shall be determined  without regard to any period of
grace or requirement of notice  provided under this  Indenture.  If such Officer
does know of such a Default or Event of Default, the Officer's Certificate shall
describe any such Default or Event of Default,  and its status.  Such  Officer's
Certificate need not comply with Sections 11.04 and 11.05 hereof.

                     (b)  The   Company   shall   deliver  to  the  Trustee  any
information   reasonably  requested  by  the  Trustee  in  connection  with  the
compliance by the Trustee or the Company with the TIA.

                    SECTION 4.05 Further Instruments and Acts

                     Upon request of the Trustee,  the Company shall execute and
deliver such further  instruments  and do such further acts as may be reasonably

Indenture.

                       SECTION 4.06 Payments for Consents

interest,  fee or  otherwise,  to any  Holder  of  any  Debentures  for or as an
inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions
of this Indenture or the Debentures  unless such  consideration is offered to be
paid or agreed to be paid to all Holders of the Debentures who so consent, waive
or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the documents  soliciting  such
consent, waiver or agreement.

                   SECTION 4.07 Payment of Expenses of Trust I

                     The Company covenants for the benefit of the Holders of the
Series A Debentures to pay all of the obligations, costs and expenses of Trust I
in accordance with Section 2.03(b) of the Trust I Agreement and to pay the taxes
of Trust I in accordance  with Section 2.03(c) of the Trust I Agreement in order

                              SUCCESSOR CORPORATION

                  SECTION 5.01 When the Company May Merge, Etc.

                     The Company may not consolidate with or merge with or into,
or sell,  convey,  transfer or lease its properties and assets as an entirety or
substantially  as  an  entirety  (either  in  one  transaction  or a  series  of
transactions) to, any Person unless:

                     (1) the Person formed by or surviving such consolidation or
merger or to which such sale, conveyance, transfer or lease shall have been made
(the "Successor") if other than the Company, (a) is organized and existing under
the laws of the United States of America or any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, and (b) shall expressly assume by a supplemental  indenture,  executed
and  delivered  to the Trustee,  in form  satisfactory  to the Trustee,  all the
obligations of the Company under the Debentures and the Indenture;

                     (2)  immediately  prior to and after giving  effect to such
transaction  (and treating any  Indebtedness  which becomes an obligation of the
Successor  Person or any  Subsidiary as a result of such  transaction  as having
been  incurred  by  such  Person  or  such   Subsidiary  at  the  time  of  such
transaction),  no  Default  or Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing; and

                     (3)  the  Company  delivers  to the  Trustee  an  Officer's
Certificate  and an Opinion of Counsel,  each stating  that such  consolidation,
merger,  sale,  conveyance,  transfer or lease and such  supplemental  indenture
comply with this Indenture.

                     The  Successor  will be the  successor to the Company,  and
will be  substituted  for, and may exercise every right and power and become the
obligor on the  Debentures  with the same  effect as if the  Successor  had been
named as the Company herein but, in the case of a sale, conveyance,  transfer or
lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company,  the predecessor
Company will not be released  from its  obligation  to pay the  principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on the Debentures.

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

                         SECTION 6.01 Events of Default

                     An "Event of Default" occurs with respect to the Debentures
of any series if one of the following shall have occurred and be continuing:

                     (1) The  Company  defaults  in the  payment,  when  due and
payable,  of (a)  interest  on any  Debenture  of that  series  and the  default
continues for a period of 30 days; provided, that during an Extension Period for
the Debentures of that series, failure to pay interest on the Debentures of that
series shall not constitute a Default or Event of Default hereunder,  or (b) the
principal of or premium,  if any, on any Debentures of that series when the same
becomes due and payable on the Stated Maturity Date thereof,  upon acceleration,
on any Redemption Date, or otherwise;

                     (2) The Company  defaults in the performance of or fails to
comply with any of its other  covenants or agreements in the  Debentures of that
series  or this  Indenture  or in any  supplemental  indenture  under  which the
Debentures of that series may have been issued and such failure continues for 60
days after receipt by the Company of a "Notice of Default";

                     (3) The  Company  pursuant  to or within the meaning of any
Bankruptcy Law:

                          (a) commences a voluntary case or proceeding;

                          (b)  consents  to the  entry  of an order  for  relief
against it in an involuntary case or proceeding;

                          (c) consents to the  appointment  of a Custodian of it
or for all or  substantially  all of its property,  and such  Custodian is  not 
discharged within 60 days;

                          (d) makes a general  assignment for the benefit of its
creditors; or

                          (e) admits in writing its  inability  to pay its debts
generally as they become due; or

                     (4) A court of  competent  jurisdiction  enters an order or
decree under any Bankruptcy Law that:

                          (a)  is  for  relief   against   the   Company  in  an
involuntary case or proceeding;

                          (b)  appoints a  Custodian  of the  Company for all or
substantially all of its properties;

                          (c) orders the liquidation of the Company;

                          (d) and in each  case  the  order  or  decree  remains
unstayed and in effect for 60 days.

                     The foregoing will constitute an Event of Default  whatever
the  reason  for any such  Event of  Default  and  whether  it is  voluntary  or
involuntary  or is effected  by  operation  of law or pursuant to any  judgment,
decree  or  order  of  any  court  or  any  order,  rule  or  regulation  of any
administrative or governmental body.

                     The term  "Bankruptcy  Law"  means  Title 11 of the  United
States  Code,  or any  similar  federal or state law for the relief of  debtors.
"Custodian" means any receiver,  trustee,  assignee,  liquidator,  sequestrator,
custodian or similar official under any Bankruptcy Law.

                     A Default under clause (2) above is not an Event of Default
until (i) the  Trustee  provides a "Notice  of  Default"  to the  Company or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate  principal amount of the Debentures of that
series at the time  outstanding  or, if that series of  Debentures  is held by a
Trust,  the  holders  of at least  25% in  aggregate  liquidation  amount of the
outstanding  Preferred Securities of that Trust provide a "Notice of Default" to
the Company and the  Trustee  and (ii) the  Company  does not cure such  Default
within the time specified in clause (2) above after receipt of such notice.  Any
such notice must specify the Default,  demand that it be remedied and state that
such notice is a "Notice of Default."

                            SECTION 6.02 Acceleration

                     If any Event of Default with respect to the  Debentures  of
any series  other than an Event of  Default  under  clause (3) or (4) of Section
6.01 hereof occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate  principal amount of the Debentures of that series then outstanding
may declare the principal of all the  Debentures of that series due and payable,
provided  that in the case of a series of  Debentures  then held by a Trust,  if
upon an Event of Default  with  respect  to the  Debentures  of that  series the
Trustee has, or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures  of  that  series  have,  failed  to  declare  the  principal  of the
Debentures of that series to be immediately  due and payable,  the holders of at
least  25%  in  aggregate   liquidation  amount  of  the  outstanding  Preferred
Securities  of that  Trust  shall  have such right by a notice in writing to the
Company and the Trustee.  If an Event of Default  specified in clause (3) or (4)
of  Section  6.01  hereof  occurs,  the  principal  of and  interest  on all the
Debentures  shall ipso facto become and be immediately  due and payable  without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Debentureholders.
Upon such an  acceleration,  such principal,  together with all interest accrued
thereon, shall be due and payable immediately.

                     The Holders of at least a majority in  aggregate  principal
amount of the Debentures of that series at the time  outstanding,  in each case,
by notice to the Trustee,  may rescind such an acceleration and its consequences
if the  rescission  would not  conflict  with any  judgment or decree and if all
existing  Events of Default with respect to such series of Debentures  have been
cured or waived  except  nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due
solely  because of  acceleration,  provided that if the principal of a series of
Debentures  has been  declared  due and payable by the holders of the  Preferred
Series of a Trust,  no  rescission  of  acceleration  will be  effective  unless
consented  to by the  holders of at least a majority  in  aggregate  liquidation
amount of the  Preferred  Securities  of that Trust.  No such  rescission  shall
affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

                           SECTION 6.03 Other Remedies

                     If an  Event  of  Default  occurs  and is  continuing,  the
Trustee  may,  in its own name or as  trustee of an  express  trust,  institute,
pursue and prosecute any proceeding,  including,  without limitation, any action
at law or suit in equity  or other  judicial  or  administrative  proceeding  to
collect  the  payment of  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or interest on the
Debentures of the series that is in default,  to enforce the  performance of any
provision of the  Debentures  of that series or this  Indenture or to obtain any
other available remedy.

                     The Trustee may maintain a  proceeding  even if it does not
possess any of the  Debentures or does not produce any of the  Debentures in the
proceeding.  A delay or  omission by the  Trustee,  any  Debentureholder  or the
holders of Preferred  Securities in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon
an Event of Default shall not impair such right or remedy or constitute a waiver
of, or  acquiescence  in, such Event of Default.  No remedy is  exclusive of any
other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative.

                     SECTION 6.04 Waiver of Past Defaults

                     If a Default or Event of Default  with  respect to a series
of Debentures has occurred and is continuing, the Holders of at least a majority
in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures  of that  series at the time
outstanding, or, if that series of Debentures is held by a Trust, the holders of
at least a majority in aggregate  liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities
of that Trust, in each case by notice to the Trustee and the Company,  may waive
an existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences except a Default or
Event of Default in the  payment of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  or
interest on any Debenture of that series.  When a Default or Event of Default is
waived,  it is deemed  cured and shall cease to exist,  but no such waiver shall
extend to any  subsequent  or other  Default  or Event of  Default or impair any
consequent right.

                        SECTION 6.05 Control by Majority

                     The Holders of at least a majority in  aggregate  principal
amount of the  Debentures of each series  affected (with each such series voting
as a class) or, if that series of Debentures is held by a Trust,  the holders of
at least a majority in aggregate  liquidation amount of the Preferred Securities
of that  Trust,  may  direct  the  time,  method  and  place of  conducting  any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power  conferred on the Trustee.  However,  the Trustee may refuse to follow any
direction  that  conflicts  with  law or  this  Indenture  or that  the  Trustee
determines  in  good  faith  is  unduly  prejudicial  to  the  rights  of  other
Debentureholders or may involve the Trustee in personal  liability.  The Trustee
may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not inconsistent
with  such  direction,  including  withholding  notice  to  the  Holders  of the
Debentures  of  continuing  default  (except in the payment of the  principal of
(other than any mandatory sinking fund payment) or premium,  if any, or interest
on any Debentures) if the Trustee considers it in the interest of the Holders of
the Debentures to do so.

                        SECTION 6.06 Limitation on Suits

                     Except as provided  in Section  6.07  hereof,  no Holder of
Debentures or holder of Preferred Securities of the Trust which is the Holder of
that series of Debentures  may pursue any remedy with respect to this  Indenture
or the Debentures unless:

                     (1)  the  Holders  of  Debentures  or the  holders  of such
Preferred Securities give to the Trustee written notice stating that an Event of
Default with respect to the corresponding Debentures is continuing;

                     (2) the  Holders  of at least  25% in  aggregate  principal
amount  of the  Debentures  of that  series  or the  holders  of at least 25% in
aggregate liquidation amount of such Preferred Securities make a written request
to the Trustee to pursue a remedy;

                     (3)  the  Holders  of  Debentures  or the  holders  of such
Preferred  Securities provide to the Trustee  reasonable  security and indemnity
against any loss, liability or expense satisfactory to the Trustee;

                     (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request  within 60
days after  receipt of the notice,  the  request  and the offer of security  and
indemnity; and

                     (5) during  such 60 day  period,  the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures of that series or the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate liquidation amount of such Preferred
Securities do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.

                     A Holder of Debentures or a holder of Preferred  Securities
may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Debentureholder or
a holder of  Preferred  Securities  or to obtain a preference  or priority  over
another Debentureholder or holder of Preferred Securities.

                SECTION 6.07 Rights of Holders to Receive Payment

                     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture,  the
right of any Holder to receive  payment of the principal of and premium (if any)
or interest on the  Debentures  held by such Holder,  on or after the respective
due dates expressed in the Debentures (in the case of interest,  as the same may
be extended  pursuant to Section  4.01(b)  hereof) or any  Redemption  Date,  is
absolute  and  unconditional  and such right and the right to bring suit for the
enforcement of any such payment on or after such  respective  dates shall not be
impaired  or affected  adversely  without  the  consent of such  Holder.  If the
Debentures  of a series  are then  held by a Trust,  each  holder  of  Preferred
Securities of such Trust shall have the right to bring suit directly against the
Company for the  enforcement  of payment to such holder in respect of Debentures
of such series in a principal amount equal to the aggregate  liquidation  amount
of the Preferred Securities of such holder.

                   SECTION 6.08 Collection Suit by the Trustee

                     If an Event of Default  described in Section 6.01(1) hereof
occurs and is continuing,  the Trustee may recover  judgment in its own name and
as  trustee of an  express  trust  against  the  Company  or any  obligor on the
Debentures  for the whole amount owing with  respect to the  Debentures  and the
amounts provided for in Section 7.07 hereof.

                SECTION 6.09 The Trustee May File Proofs of Claim

                     In case of the  pendency of any  receivership,  insolvency,
liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other judicial  proceeding  relative to the Company or its properties or assets,
the Trustee shall be entitled and empowered,  by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise:

                     (1) to file and prove a claim  for the whole  amount of the
principal of and premium,  if any,  and interest on the  Debentures  and to file
such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable  compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and
of the Holders allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

                     (2) to collect  and  receive  any moneys or other  property
payable or  deliverable  on any such claims and to distribute  the same; and any
Custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to
make such  payments  to the Trustee  and,  in the event that the  Trustee  shall
consent to the  making of such  payments  directly  to the  Holders,  to pay the
Trustee  any  amount  due  it  for  the   reasonable   compensation,   expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof.

                     Nothing herein  contained  shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee  to  authorize  or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Debentures or the rights of any Holder  thereof,  or to authorize the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

                             SECTION 6.10 Priorities

                     If the Trustee  collects any money pursuant to this Article
6, it shall,  subject to Article 10 hereof,  pay out the money in the  following
order:

                  FIRST: to the Trustee for  amounts  due under  Section  7.07
                         hereof;

                 SECOND: to Holders of  Debentures in respect of which or for
                         the benefit of which such money has been  collected for
                         amounts  due  and  unpaid  on such  Debentures  for the
                         principal amount, Redemption Price or interest, if any,
                         as the  case may be,  ratably,  without  preference  or
                         priority of any kind, according to such amounts due and
                         payable on such Debentures; and

                  THIRD: the balance, if any, to the Company.

     Except as  otherwise  set forth in the  Debentures,  the  Trustee may fix a
Record Date and payment  date for any  payment to  Debentureholders  pursuant to
this Section 6.10.

                       SECTION 6.11 Undertaking for Costs

                     In any  suit for the  enforcement  of any  right or  remedy
under this  Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or
omitted by it as Trustee,  a court in its  discretion  may require the filing by
any party litigant (other than the Trustee) in the suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of the suit,  and the court in its  discretion  may assess  reasonable
costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and expenses,  against any party
litigant  in the suit,  having  due  regard to the  merits and good faith of the
claims or defenses made by the party litigant.  This Section 6.11 does not apply
to a suit  by the  Trustee,  a suit by a  Holder  of  Debentures  or  holder  of
Preferred  Securities  pursuant  to Section  6.07 hereof or a suit by Holders of
Debentures of more than 10% in aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures of
any series or, if a series of Debentures is held by a Trust, the holders of more
than 10% in aggregate  liquidation  amount of the  Preferred  Securities of that
Trust.

              SECTION 6.12 Waiver of Stay; Extension or Usury Laws

                     The Company  covenants  (to the extent that it may lawfully
do so) that it will  not at any  time  insist  upon,  or plead or in any  manner
whatsoever  claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law
or any usury or other law  wherever  enacted,  now or at any time  hereafter  in
force, that would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion
of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or  interest  on the  Debentures  as
contemplated herein or affect the covenants or the performance by the Company of
its obligations under this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby  expressly  waives all benefit or  advantage  of any such
law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.


                                    ARTICLE 7
                                   THE TRUSTEE

                       SECTION 7.01 Duties of the Trustee

                     (a) If an Event of Default  occurs and is  continuing  with
respect to the  Debentures of any series,  the Trustee shall exercise the rights
and powers  vested in it by this  Indenture  with respect to that series and use
the same  degree  of care and  skill in its  exercise  as a  prudent  man  would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

                     (b) Except  during the  continuance  of an Event of Default
with respect to the Debentures of any series,  (i) the Trustee need perform only
those duties with respect to that series that are specifically set forth in this
Indenture or the TIA and no others;  and (ii) in the absence of bad faith on its
part, the Trustee may  conclusively  rely, as to the truth of the statements and
the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions
furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the  requirements  of this Indenture.
However,  in the case of any  certificates  or opinions  which by any  provision
hereof are  specifically  required to be furnished  to the Trustee,  the Trustee
shall  examine the  certificates  and opinions to determine  whether or not they
conform to the requirements of this Indenture.

                     (c) The Trustee may not be relieved from  liability for its
own  negligent  action,  its own  negligent  failure  to act or its own  willful
misconduct, except that:

                          (i) this Section  7.01(c) does not limit the effect of
Section 7.01(b) hereof;

                          (ii) the Trustee  shall not be liable for any error of
judgment  made in good  faith by a Trust  Officer  unless it is proved  that the
Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

                          (iii) the Trustee  shall not be liable with respect to
any  action  it  takes  or omits  to take in good  faith  in  accordance  with a
direction received by it pursuant to Section 6.05 hereof.

                     (d)Every  provision  of  this  Indenture  that  in any  way
relates to the  Trustee is subject  to  Section  7.01(a),  (b),  (c) and (e) and
Section 7.02 hereof.

                     (e)The  Trustee  may refuse to perform any duty or exercise
any  right or power or  extend  or risk its own  funds or  otherwise  incur  any
financial  liability  unless  it  receives  security  and  indemnity  reasonably
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense (including  reasonable
counsel fees).

                     (f)Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be
segregated  from other funds  except to the extent  required  by law.  Except as
otherwise  provided in Section 3.05 and Section 8.01 hereof,  the Trustee  shall
not be liable for interest on any money held by it hereunder.

                       SECTION 7.02 Rights of the Trustee

                     (a) The Trustee may rely on any document  believed by it to
be  genuine  and to have been  signed or  presented  by the proper  person.  The
Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

                     (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may
require an Officer's Certificate and, if appropriate, an Opinion of Counsel. The
Trustee  shall  not be liable  for any  action it takes or omits to take in good
faith in reliance on such Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel.

                     (c) The  Trustee  may act  through  agents and shall not be
responsible  for the  misconduct or negligence of any agent  appointed  with due
care.

                     (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes
or omits to take in good faith which it reasonably  believes to be authorized or
within its rights or powers.

                     (e) The Trustee may consult with  counsel of its  selection
and the  advice of such  counsel or any  Opinion  of  Counsel  shall be full and
complete  authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,  suffered
or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

                     (f) The Trustee  shall be under no  obligation  to exercise
any of the rights or powers  vested in it by this  Indenture  at the  request or
direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture,  unless such Holders
shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable  security and indemnity against the
costs, expenses and liabilities  (including reasonable counsel fees) which might
be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction.

                  SECTION 7.03 Individual Rights of the Trustee

                     The Trustee in its  individual  or any other  capacity  may
become  the owner or  pledgee  of  Debentures  and may  otherwise  deal with the
Company  or its  Affiliates  with the same  rights it would  have if it were not
Trustee.  Any Paying Agent,  Registrar or co-registrar may do the same with like
rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.

                      SECTION 7.04 The Trustee's Disclaimer

                     The Trustee makes no  representation  as to the validity or
adequacy  of  this  Indenture  or  the  Debentures.  The  Trustee  shall  not be
accountable for the Company's use of the proceeds from the  Debentures,  and the
Trustee  shall not be  responsible  for any  statement in this  Indenture or the
Debentures or any report or certificate  issued by the Company  hereunder or any
registration  statement  relating to the  Debentures  (other than the  Trustee's
Certificate of Authentication and the Trustee's Statement of Eligibility on Form
T-1), or the determination as to which beneficial owners are entitled to receive
any notices hereunder.

                         SECTION 7.05 Notice of Defaults

                     If a Default  occurs and is continuing  with respect to the
Debentures  of any series and if it is known to the Trustee,  the Trustee  shall
mail to each Holder of a Debenture of that series  notice of the Default  within
90 days after it becomes  known to the Trustee  unless such  Default  shall have
been  cured or  waived.  Except in the case of a Default  described  in  Section
6.01(1)  hereof,  the  Trustee  may  withhold  such  notice  if and so long as a
committee of Trust  Officers in good faith  determines  that the  withholding of
such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Debentures of that series.
The Trustee  shall not be charged with  knowledge of any Default  (except in the
case of a Default  under Section  6.01(1)  hereof)  unless a  responsible  Trust
Officer  assigned to the  Corporate  Trust  Department of the Trustee shall have
actual knowledge of the Default.  The second sentence of this Section 7.05 shall
be in  lieu of the  proviso  to TIA  Section  315(b).  Said  proviso  is  hereby
expressly excluded from this Indenture, as permitted by the TIA.

                   SECTION 7.06 Reports by Trustee to Holders

                     Within 60 days after each May 31, beginning with the May 31
next  following  the date of this  Indenture,  the  Trustee  shall  mail to each
Debentureholder,  and such other holders that have submitted  their names to the
Trustee for such  purpose,  a brief report dated as of such May 31 in accordance
with and to the extent required under TIA Section 313.

                     A copy  of  each  report  at the  time  of its  mailing  to
Debentureholders  shall be filed with the  Company,  the SEC and any  securities
exchange  on which the  Debentures  are listed.  The Company  agrees to promptly
notify the Trustee  whenever  the  Debentures  become  listed on any  securities
exchange and of any listing thereof.

                     SECTION 7.07 Compensation and Indemnity

                     The Company agrees:

                     (1)  to  pay  to  the  Trustee   from  time  to  time  such
compensation  as shall be agreed in writing  between the Company and the Trustee
for all  services  rendered by it  hereunder  (which  compensation  shall not be
limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an
express trust);

                     (2)  to   reimburse   the  Trustee  upon  its  request  for
reasonable expenses,  disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee
in accordance  with any provision of this  Indenture  (including  the reasonable
compensation and the expenses, and advances of its agents and counsel,  provided
that prior to any Event of Default,  the Trustee  shall only have one  counsel),
including all reasonable  expenses and advances  incurred or made by the Trustee
in  connection  with any Event of Default or any  membership  on any  creditors'
committee,  except any such  expense or  advance as may be  attributable  to its
negligence or bad faith; and

                     (3) to indemnify the Trustee,  its officers,  directors and
shareholders,  for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss, liability
or expense,  incurred  without  negligence  or willful  misconduct  on its part,
arising out of or in connection  with the acceptance or  administration  of this
trust, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
duties hereunder.

                     Before, after or during an Event of Default with respect to
the Debentures of a series, the Trustee shall have a claim and lien prior to the
Debentures  of that series as to all property and funds held by it hereunder for
any  amount  owing it for its  fees  and  expenses  or any  predecessor  Trustee
pursuant to this Section 7.07,  except with respect to funds held by the Trustee
or any Paying Agent in trust for the payment of principal of or premium, if any,
or interest on  particular  Debentures  pursuant to Section 2.06 or Section 8.01
hereof.

                     The Company's payment obligations  pursuant to this Section
7.07 are not  subject to  Article 10 of this  Indenture  and shall  survive  the
discharge  of this  Indenture.  When the  Trustee  renders  services  or  incurs
expenses after the occurrence of a Default specified in Section 6.01 hereof, the
compensation  for services and expenses are intended to  constitute  expenses of
administration under any Bankruptcy Law.

                       SECTION 7.08 Replacement of Trustee

                     The Trustee  may resign at any time,  by so  notifying  the
Company  in  writing  at  least  30  days  prior  to the  date  of the  proposed
resignation;  provided,  however, no such resignation shall be effective until a
successor  Trustee has accepted its  appointment  pursuant to this Section 7.08.
The  Holders  of at  least a  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount  of the
Debentures  at the time  outstanding  may remove the Trustee by so notifying the
Trustee in writing and may appoint a successor  Trustee,  which shall be subject
to the consent of the Company  unless an Event of Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing. The Trustee shall resign if:

        (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

        (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

        (3) a receiver or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its
            property; or

        (4) the Trustee otherwise becomes incapable of acting.

If the  Trustee  resigns or is  removed or if a vacancy  exists in the office of
Trustee for any reason,  the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee.
A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the
retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal of the
retiring Trustee shall become  effective,  and the successor  Trustee shall have
all the  rights,  powers and duties of the  Trustee  under this  Indenture.  The
successor  Trustee shall mail a notice of its  succession  to  Debentureholders.
Subject to payment of all amounts owing to the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof
and subject  further to its lien under Section 7.07, the retiring  Trustee shall
promptly  transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor  Trustee.
If a successor  Trustee  does not take office  within 30 days after the retiring
Trustee resigns or is removed, the Company or the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures at the time  outstanding  may
petition any court of competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee.

                     If the Trustee  fails to comply with  Section  7.10 hereof,
any  Debentureholder  may petition any court of competent  jurisdiction  for its
removal and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                    SECTION 7.09 Successor Trustee by Merger

                     If the Trustee  consolidates with, merges or converts into,
or transfers all or substantially  all its corporate trust business or assets to
another corporation, the resulting,  surviving or transferee corporation without
any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

                   SECTION 7.10 Eligibility: Disqualification

                     The Trustee shall at all times satisfy the  requirements of
TIA Sections  310(a)(1) and  310(a)(2).  The Trustee (or any  Affiliate  thereof
which has  unconditionally  guaranteed the obligations of the Trustee hereunder)
shall have a combined  capital and surplus of at least  $50,000,000 as set forth
in its most recently  published  annual  report of condition.  The Trustee shall
comply  with  TIA  Section  310(b).  In  determining  whether  the  Trustee  has
conflicting  interests  as  defined in TIA  Section  310(b)(1),  the  provisions
contained in the proviso to TIA Section 310(b)(1) and the Trustee's Statement of
Eligibility on Form T-1 shall be deemed incorporated herein.

       SECTION 7.11 Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Company

                     If and when the  Trustee  shall be or become a creditor  of
the Company, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the TIA regarding
the collection of claims against the Company.

               DEFEASANCE OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS; UNCLAIMED MONEYS

              SECTION 8.01 Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture

                     The Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the
entire indebtedness on any series of the Debentures  outstanding on the date the
Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the
Trustee or any Paying  Agent as trust  funds in trust,  specifically  pledged as
security  for,  and  dedicated  solely  to, the  benefit  of the  Holders of the
Debentures  of such series (1) cash  (which may be held in an  interest  bearing
account insured by the Federal Deposit  Insurance  Corporation) in an amount, or
(2) U.S. Government  Obligations,  maturing as to principal and interest at such
times and in such  amounts as will  ensure the  availability  of cash,  or (3) a
combination thereof, sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on all Debentures of such series then outstanding, provided that in the
case of  redemption,  notice of redemption  shall have been given or the Company

provided that the following conditions shall have been met:

                     (A) no  Default  or Event of  Default  with  respect to the
Debentures  of such series has  occurred and is  continuing  on the date of such
deposit or occurs as a result of such deposit;

                     (B) the Company has  delivered  to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate certifying that there does not exist (i) a default in the payment of
all or any  portion  of any  Senior  Indebtedness  or  (ii)  any  other  default
affecting Senior Indebtedness permitting its acceleration as the result of which
the maturity of Senior Indebtedness has been accelerated;

                     (C) the Company has  delivered  to the Trustee (i) either a
private  Internal  Revenue Service ruling or an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that the Holders of the  Debentures  of such series will not  recognize  income,
gain or loss for  federal  income  tax  purposes  as a result  of such  deposit,
defeasance  and discharge and will be subject to federal  income tax on the same
amount  and in the  manner  and at the same times as would have been the case if
such deposit,  defeasance  and  discharge  had not  occurred,  and an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that (A) the deposit shall not result in the Company,  the
Trustee or, if the  Debentures  of such  series are held by a Trust,  such Trust
being deemed to be an "investment  company" under the Investment  Company Act of
1940,  as  amended,  and (B) such  deposit  creates  a valid  trust in which the
Holders of the  Debentures of such series have the sole  beneficial  interest or

priority security interest in such trust; and

                     (D) the Company has  delivered  to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate  and an  Opinion  of  Counsel,  each  stating  that  all  conditions

respect to such series of Debentures  shall no longer be in effect (except as to
(1) the rights of  registration  of transfer and exchange of  Debentures of such
series, (2) the replacement of apparently mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or
stolen  Debentures  of  such  series,  (3)  the  rights  of the  Holders  of the
Debentures  of such  series to receive  payments  of the  principal  thereof and
premium,  if any,  and  interest  thereon,  (4) the rights of the Holders of the
Debentures of such series as  beneficiaries  hereof with respect to the property
so deposited with the Trustee  payable to all or any of them, (5) the obligation
of the Company to maintain an office or agency for payments on and  registration
of transfer of the Debentures of such series,  (6) the rights,  obligations  and
immunities of the Trustee  hereunder,  and (7) the obligations of the Company to
the Trustee for  compensation  and indemnity under Section 7.07 hereof;  and the
Trustee  shall,  at the  request  and  expense of the  Company,  execute  proper
instruments acknowledging the same.

Indenture,  all moneys then held by any Paying Agent under this Indenture shall,
upon  demand  of the  Company,  be  repaid  to it or  paid to the  Trustee,  and
thereupon  such Paying Agent shall be released from all further  liability  with
respect to such moneys.

          SECTION 8.04 Return of Moneys Held by the Trustee and Paying

                      SECTION 9.02 With Consent of Holders

                     The Company and the Trustee may amend this Indenture in any
manner not  permitted  by Section  9.01 or may waive  future  compliance  by the
Company with any provisions of this Indenture with the consent of the Holders of
at least a majority in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures  of each
series  affected  thereby.  Such an  amendment  or waiver may not,  without  the
consent of each Holder of the Debentures affected thereby:

               (1)  reduce the principal amount of such Debentures;

               (2)  reduce the principal  amount of such  Debentures the Holders
                    of which must consent to an amendment of this Indenture or a
                    waiver;

               (3)  change  the  stated  maturity  of  the  principal  of or the
                    interest on or rate of interest of such Debentures;

               (4)  change adversely to the Holders the redemption provisions of
                    Article 3 hereof;

               (5)  change the currency in respect of which the payments on such
                    Debentures are to be made;

               (6)  make any change in Article 10 hereof that adversely  affects
                    the rights of the Holders of the Debentures or any change to
                    any other Section hereof that adversely affects their rights
                    under Article 10 hereof; or

               (7)  change Section 6.07 hereof;

provided that, in the case of the  outstanding  Debentures of a series then held
by a Trust, no such amendment  shall be made that adversely  affects the holders
of the Preferred Securities of that Trust, and no waiver of any Event of Default
with respect to the  Debentures of that series or  compliance  with any covenant
under  this  Indenture  shall be  effective,  without  the prior  consent of the
holders  of at least a  majority  of the  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of the
outstanding  Preferred  Securities  of that  Trust or the  holder  of each  such
Preferred Security, as applicable.

                     A  supplemental  indenture  that changes or eliminates  any
covenant or other  provision of this  Indenture that has expressly been included
solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Debentures,  or which
modifies the rights of the Holders of  Debentures of such series with respect to
such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under
this Indenture of the Holders of Debentures of any other series.

                     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of
Debentures or holders of Preferred Securities under this Section 9.02 to approve
the  particular  form of any proposed  amendment,  but it shall be sufficient if
such consent approves the substance thereof.

                     If  certain   Holders  agree  to  defer  or  waive  certain
obligations of the Company  hereunder  with respect to Debentures  held by them,
such  deferral  or waiver  shall not affect  the  rights of any other  Holder to
receive the payment or performance required hereunder in a timely manner.

                     After an  amendment  or  waiver  under  this  Section  9.02
becomes  effective,  the  Company  shall  mail to each  Holder a notice  briefly
describing  the  amendment  or waiver.  Any  failure of the Company to mail such
notices, or any defect therein,  shall not, however, in any way impair or affect
the validity of such amendment or waiver.

                SECTION 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act

                     Every  supplemental  indenture  executed  pursuant  to this
Article 9 shall comply with the TIA.

       SECTION 9.04 Revocation and Effect of Consents; Waivers and Actions

                     Until an  amendment,  waiver  or other  action  by  Holders
becomes  effective,  a  consent  to it or any  other  action  by a  Holder  of a
Debenture  hereunder is a continuing  consent by the Holder and every subsequent
Holder of that  Debenture or portion of the  Debenture  that  evidences the same
obligation  as the  consenting  Holder's  Debenture,  even  if  notation  of the
consent,  waiver  or  action is not made on such  Debenture.  However,  any such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent,  waiver or action as to such
Holder's  Debenture  or portion of the  Debenture  if the Trustee  receives  the
notice of  revocation  before the consent of the requisite  aggregate  principal
amount of such  Debentures  then  outstanding has been obtained and not revoked.
After an  amendment,  waiver or action  becomes  effective,  it shall bind every
Holder of the  Debentures of the related  series,  except as provided in Section
9.02 hereof.

                     The  Company  may,  but shall not be  obligated  to,  fix a
Record Date for the purpose of  determining  the Persons  entitled to consent to
any amendment or waiver. If a Record Date is fixed,  then,  notwithstanding  the
first two  sentences of the  immediately  preceding  paragraph,  only Holders of
Debentures or holders of Preferred  Securities,  as  applicable,  on such Record
Date or their duly designated proxies, and only those Persons, shall be entitled
to  consent to such  amendment,  supplement  or waiver or to revoke any  consent
previously  given,  whether or not such  Persons  continue to be such after such
Record Date.  No such consent  shall be valid or effective for more than 90 days
after such Record Date.

               SECTION 9.05 Notation on or Exchange of Debentures

                     Debentures  of the related  series  authenticated  and made
available  for  delivery  after  the  execution  of any  supplemental  indenture
pursuant to this  Article 9 may, and shall,  if required by the Trustee,  bear a
notation in form  approved by the Trustee as to any matter  provided for in such
supplemental  indenture.  If the Company shall so determine,  new  Debentures so
modified  as to  conform,  in the  opinion  of the  Trustee  and  the  Board  of
Directors,  to any such  supplemental  indenture may be prepared and executed by
the Company and  authenticated and made available for delivery by the Trustee in
exchange for outstanding Debentures.

             SECTION 9.06 Trustee to Execute Supplemental Indentures

                     The  Trustee  shall  execute  any  supplemental   indenture
authorized  pursuant to this Article 9 if the  supplemental  indenture  does not
adversely affect the rights,  duties,  liabilities or immunities of the Trustee.
If it does,  the  Trustee  may,  but need not,  execute  it. In  executing  such
supplemental  indenture the Trustee  shall be entitled to receive,  and shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel
stating  that such  supplemental  indenture is  authorized  or permitted by this
Indenture.

                 SECTION 9.07 Effect of Supplemental Indentures

                     Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this
Article 9, this Indenture  shall be modified in accordance  therewith,  and such
supplemental  indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes and
every Holder of  Debentures  of the related  series  theretofore  or  thereafter
authenticated and made available for delivery hereunder shall be bound thereby.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                  SUBORDINATION

          SECTION 10.01 Debentures Subordinated to Senior Indebtedness

                     Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of Section 6.10 hereof or
any other provision herein or in any Debenture, the Company and the Trustee and,
by their  acceptance  thereof,  the Holders of the  Debentures (a) covenants and
agrees that all payments by the Company of the principal of and premium, if any,
and interest on the Debentures (other than Debentures which have been discharged
pursuant to Article 8) shall be  subordinated  in accordance with the provisions
of this Article 10 to the prior payment in full, in cash or cash equivalents, of
all amounts payable on, under or in connection with Senior Indebtedness, and (b)
acknowledges that holders of Senior Indebtedness are or shall be relying on this
Article 10.

        SECTION 10.02 Priority and Payment of Proceeds in Certain Events:
                               Remedies Standstill

                     (a)  Upon  any  payment  or   distribution   of  assets  or
securities of the Company, as the case may be, of any kind or character, whether
in cash, property or securities,  upon any dissolution or winding up or total or
partial  liquidation  or  reorganization  of the Company,  whether  voluntary or
involuntary,  or in bankruptcy,  insolvency,  receivership or other proceedings,
all  amounts  payable  on,  under  or in  connection  with  Senior  Indebtedness
(including any interest accruing on such Senior  Indebtedness  subsequent to the
commencement of a bankruptcy,  insolvency or similar  proceeding) shall first be
paid in full in  cash,  or  payment  provided  for in cash or cash  equivalents,
before the  Holders or the  Trustee on behalf of the  Holders or the  holders of
Preferred  Securities  shall be entitled to receive from the Company any payment
of  principal  of  or  premium,  if  any,  or  interest  on  the  Debentures  or
distribution of any assets or securities.

                     (b) No direct or  indirect  payment  by or on behalf of the
Company of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Debentures (other
than  Debentures  which have been  discharged  pursuant to Article  8),  whether
pursuant to the terms of the Debentures or upon acceleration or otherwise, shall
be made if, at the time of such  payment,  there  exists  (i) a  default  in the
payment of all or any  portion of any Senior  Indebtedness  and the  Trustee has
received  written  notice  thereof  from the  Company,  from  holders  of Senior
Indebtedness or from any trustee,  representative or agent therefor, or (ii) any
other default affecting Senior Indebtedness as a result of which the maturity of
Senior  Indebtedness  has been  accelerated and the Trustee has received written
notice  from the  Company,  from  holders  of  Senior  Indebtedness  or from any
trustee,  representative or agent therefor, and such default shall not have been
cured or waived by or on behalf of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

                     (c)   If,    notwithstanding   the   foregoing   provisions
prohibiting such payment or  distribution,  the Trustee or any Holder shall have
received  any  payment on account of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any, or
interest on the Debentures when such payment is prohibited by this Section 10.02
and  before  all  amounts  payable  on,  under  or  in  connection  with  Senior
Indebtedness  are  paid in full in cash or cash  equivalents,  then  and in such
event  (subject to the  provisions  of Section  10.08  hereof)  such  payment or
distribution  shall be  received  and held in trust  for the  holders  of Senior
Indebtedness  and, at the written  direction of the trustee,  representative  or
agent for the holders of the Senior  Indebtedness,  shall be paid to the holders
of the Senior Indebtedness  remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay such
Senior Indebtedness in full in cash or cash equivalents.

                     Upon any payment or  distribution  of assets or  securities
referred to in this Article 10, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to
rely upon any order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in which such
dissolution,  winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending,
and upon a  certificate  of the  receiver,  trustee in  bankruptcy,  liquidating
trustee,  agent  or  other  Person  making  any such  payment  or  distribution,
delivered to the Trustee for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such distribution,  the holders of Senior  Indebtedness and other
Indebtedness of the Company,  the amount thereof or payable thereon,  the amount
or amounts paid or distributed  thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or
to this Article 10.

            SECTION 10.03 Payments which May Be Made Prior to Notice

                     Nothing in this Article 10 or  elsewhere in this  Indenture
shall prevent (i) the Company,  except under the conditions described in Section
10.02  hereof,  from making  payments  of  principal  of or premium,  if any, or
interest on the  Debentures or from  depositing  with the Trustee any monies for
such payments,  or (ii) the  application by the Trustee of any monies  deposited
with it for the purpose of making such  payments of principal of or premium,  if
any, or interest on the Debentures,  to the Holders entitled thereto,  unless at
least one  Business  Day prior to the date when  such  payment  would  otherwise
(except for the  prohibitions  contained in Section 10.02 hereof) become due and
payable the Trustee  shall have  received  the written  notice  provided  for in
Section 10.02(b)(i) or (ii) hereof.

    SECTION 10.04 Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness Not to Be Impaired

                     No right of any  present  or future  holder  of any  Senior
Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time or in
any way be  prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act in good faith by
any such  holder,  or by any  noncompliance  by the  Company  with the terms and
provisions  and covenants  herein  regardless of any knowledge  thereof any such
holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

                     The  provisions  of this  Article 10 are intended to be for
the  benefit  of, and shall be  enforceable  directly  by, the holders of Senior
Indebtedness.  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in this Article 10, to
the extent any Holders or the Trustee  have paid over or delivered to any holder
of Senior  Indebtedness  any payment or distribution  received on account of the
principal  of or premium  (if any) or interest  on the  Debentures  to which any
other  holder of Senior  Indebtedness  shall be entitled to share in  accordance
with Section 10.02 hereof, no holder of Senior  Indebtedness  shall have a claim
or right  against any Holders or the Trustee with respect to any such payment or
distribution or as a result of the failure to make payments or  distributions to
such other holder of Senior Indebtedness.

       SECTION 10.05 Trustee May Take Action to Effectuate Subordination

                     Each  Holder of a  Debenture,  by his  acceptance  thereof,
authorizes  and  directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
required  by  the  trustee,  representative  or  agent  for  holders  of  Senior
Indebtedness  or by the Company to effectuate,  as between the holders of Senior
Indebtedness and the Holders,  the  subordination as provided in this Article 10
and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

                     SECTION 10.06 Subrogation

                     Upon the payment in full, in cash or cash  equivalents,  of
all Senior  Indebtedness,  any Holder shall be  subrogated  to the rights of the
holders of such Senior  Indebtedness  to receive  payments or  distributions  of
assets of the Company  made on such  Senior  Indebtedness  until the  Debentures
shall be paid in full; and for the purposes of such subrogation,  no payments or
distributions  to holders of such Senior  Indebtedness  of any cash  property or
securities to which such Holders of the Debentures  would be entitled except for
this  Article 10, and no payment  pursuant to this Article 10 to holders of such
Senior  Indebtedness  by such Holders of the  Debentures,  shall, as between the
Company,  its creditors other than holders of such Senior  Indebtedness and such
Holders of the  Debentures,  be deemed to be a payment  by the  Company to or on
account of such Senior Indebtedness,  it being understood that the provisions of
this Article 10 are solely for the purpose of defining  the  relative  rights of
the holders of such Senior  Indebtedness,  on the one hand,  and such Holders of
the Debentures, on the other hand.

                     If  any  payment  or   distribution  to  which  Holders  of
Debentures  would  otherwise  have been entitled but for the  provisions of this
Article 10 shall have been applied,  pursuant to this Article 10, to the payment
of all Senior  Indebtedness then and in such case such Holders of the Debentures
shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Senior Indebtedness at the
time  outstanding  any  payments or  distributions  received by such  holders of
Senior  Indebtedness in excess of the amount  sufficient to pay, in cash or cash
equivalents, all such Senior Indebtedness in full.

       SECTION 10.07 Obligations of Company Unconditional; Reinstatement

                     Nothing in this Article 10 or  elsewhere in this  Indenture
or in any Debenture is intended to or shall  impair,  as between the Company and
Holders of the Debentures,  the  obligations of the Company,  which are absolute
and unconditional,  to pay to such Holders the principal of and premium, if any,
and interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable
in accordance  with their terms,  or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of such Holders of the Debentures and creditors of the Company other than
the holders of the Senior  Indebtedness,  nor shall  anything  herein or therein
prevent  the  Trustee  or any  Holder  of  Debentures  or  holder  of  Preferred
Securities,  as applicable,  from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by
applicable law under this Indenture,  subject to the rights,  if any, under this
Article  10 of the  holders  of such  Senior  Indebtedness  in  respect of cash,
property or  securities  of the Company  received  upon the exercise of any such
remedy.

                     The failure to make a scheduled  payment of principal of or
premium,  if any, or interest on the Debentures by reason of Section 10.02 shall
not be construed  as  preventing  the  occurrence  of an Event of Default  under
Section 6.01 hereof;  provided,  however,  that if (i) the conditions preventing
the  making of such  payment  no longer  exist,  and (ii)  such  Holders  of the
Debentures  are made whole with respect to such omitted  payments,  the Event of
Default relating thereto (including any failure to pay any accelerated  amounts)
shall be  automatically  waived,  and the  provisions of the Indenture  shall be
reinstated as if no such Event of Default had occurred.

             SECTION 10.08 Trustee Entitled to Assume Payments Not
                           Prohibited in Absence of Notice


                     The Trustee or Paying  Agent shall not be charged  with the
knowledge of the  existence of any default in the payment of all or a portion of
any Senior  Indebtedness or any other default affecting Senior Indebtedness as a
result of which the maturity of the Senior  Indebtedness  has been  accelerated,
unless and until the Trustee or Paying Agent shall have received  written notice
thereof from the Company or one or more holders of Senior  Indebtedness  or from
any trustee,  representative  or agent  therefor or unless the Trustee or Paying
Agent otherwise had actual knowledge  thereof;  and, prior to the receipt of any
such written  notice or actual  knowledge of a responsible  Trust Officer in the
Corporate Trust Department of the Trustee or Paying Agent, the Trustee or Paying
Agent may conclusively assume that no such facts exist.

                     Unless at least one  Business Day prior to the date when by
the terms of this  Indenture  any monies are to be deposited by the Company with
the Trustee or any Paying Agent for any purpose (including,  without limitation,
the  payment  of the  principal  of or  premium,  if  any,  or  interest  on any
Debenture), the Trustee or Paying Agent shall have received with respect to such
monies the notice  provided for in Section 10.02 or a responsible  Trust Officer
in the  Corporate  Trust  Department  of the Trustee or Paying  Agent shall have
actual  knowledge  of default  in the  payment of all or a portion of any Senior
Indebtedness or any other default affecting Senior Indebtedness as the result of
which the maturity of the Senior Indebtedness has been accelerated,  the Trustee
or Paying  Agent shall have full power and  authority  to receive and apply such
monies to the  purpose  for which they were  received.  Neither of them shall be
affected  by any notice to the  contrary,  which may be received by either on or
after  such  date.  The  foregoing  shall not apply to the  Paying  Agent if the
Company is acting as Paying Agent. Nothing in this Section 10.08 shall limit the
right of the holders of Senior  Indebtedness to recover payments as contemplated
by Section 10.02  hereof.  The Trustee or Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely
on the delivery to it of a written  notice by a Person  representing  himself or
itself to be a holder of such Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee,  representative
or agent on behalf of such holder) to establish  that such notice has been given
by a holder of such Senior Indebtedness or a trustee, representative or agent on
behalf of any such holder.  The Trustee  shall not be deemed to have any duty to
the holders (and shall be fully protected in relying upon such notice) of Senior
Indebtedness.

           SECTION 10.09 Right of Trustee to Hold Senior Indebtedness

                     The Trustee  and any Paying  Agent shall be entitled to all
of the rights set forth in this Article 10 in respect of any Senior Indebtedness
at any time held by them to the same  extent as any other  holder of such Senior
Indebtedness,  and nothing in this  Indenture  shall be construed to deprive the
Trustee or any Paying Agent of any of its rights as such holder.

                                   ARTICLE 11
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                   SECTION 11.01 Trust Indenture Act Controls

     If any provision of this Indenture limits,  qualifies or conflicts with the
duties  imposed by  operation of  subsection  (c) of Section 318 of the TIA, the
imposed duties shall control.  The provisions of Sections 310 to 317, inclusive,
of the TIA that impose duties on any Person (including provisions  automatically
deemed  included  in an  indenture  unless  the  indenture  provides  that  such
provisions are excluded) are a part of and govern this Indenture, except as, and
to the extent, they are expressly excluded from this Indenture,  as permitted by
the TIA.

                     The Company or the Trustee,  by giving notice to the other,
may  designate  additional  or different  addresses  for  subsequent  notices of

Indebtedness of any such additional or different  addresses of which the Company
receives notice from the Trustee.

                     Any  notice  or  communication  given to a  Debentureholder
shall be mailed or delivered  to the  Debentureholder  at the  Debentureholder's
address as it appears on the Register of the Registrar and shall be sufficiently
given if mailed within the time prescribed.

                     Failure   to  mail  a   notice   or   communication   to  a
Debentureholder  or any  defect  in it shall not  affect  its  sufficiency  with
respect to other Debentureholders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner  provided  above,  it is  duly  given,  whether  or not  received  by the
addressee.

                     If the  Company  mails a  notice  or  communication  to the
Debentureholders, it shall mail a copy to the Trustee and each Registrar, Paying
Agent or co-Registrar.

312(b),  with other  Debentureholders  with  respect to their  rights under this

                         all  conditions  precedent to the taking of such action
                         have been complied with; and

                    (2)  if appropriate,  an Opinion of Counsel  (complying with

                         such  counsel  all  such  conditions  precedent  to the
                         taking of such action have been complied with.

          SECTION 11.05 Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion

                     Each  Officer's  Certificate  and  Opinion of Counsel  with
respect  to  compliance  with a  covenant  or  condition  provided  for in  this
Indenture shall include:

                    (1)  a  statement  that each Person  making  such  Officer's
                         Certificate   or  Opinion  of  Counsel  has  read  such
                         covenant or condition;

                         Opinion of Counsel are based;

                    (3)  a statement  that,  in the opinion of each such Person,
                         such Person has made such  examination or investigation
                         as is  necessary  to enable  such  Person to express an
                         informed  opinion as to whether or not such covenant or
                         condition has been complied with; and

                    (4)  a statement  that, in the opinion of such Person,  such

                         involving any legal  conclusion,  an Opinion of Counsel
                         may rely on an Officer's Certificate or certificates of
                         public officials.

                       SECTION 11.06 Severability Clause

     If any provision in this Indenture or in the  Debentures  shall be invalid,

     A "Legal  Holiday" is any day other than a Business  Day. If any  specified
date  (including a date for giving notice) is a Legal Holiday,  the action to be
taken on such date shall be taken on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal
Holiday,  and if such action is a payment in respect of the  Debentures,  unless
otherwise  specified  pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof no principal,  premium (if
any) or interest  installment  shall accrue for the intervening  period;  except
that if any interest  payment is due on a Legal Holiday and the next  succeeding
day is in the next  succeeding  calendar year, such payment shall be made on the
Business Day immediately preceding such Legal Holiday.

                           SECTION 11.09 Governing Law

     This  Indenture  and the  Debentures  shall be governed by and construed in

                    SECTION 11.10 No Recourse Against Others

     No director,  officer,  employee or  stockholder,  as such,  of the Company
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the Debentures
or this  Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such
obligations their creation. By accepting a Debenture, each Debentureholder shall
waive and release all such  liability.  The waiver and release  shall be part of
the consideration for the issue of the Debentures.

                            SECTION 11.11 Successors

            SECTION 11.12 Multiple Original Copies of this Indenture

     The  parties may sign any number of copies of this  Indenture.  Each signed
copy  shall  be an  original,  but  all of  them  together  represent  the  same
agreement. Any signed copy shall be sufficient proof of this Indenture.

          SECTION 11.13 No Adverse Interpretation of Other Agreements

     This Indenture may not be used to interpret another indenture, loan or debt
agreement of the Company or any  subsidiary.  Any such  indenture,  loan or debt

                                    Exhibit A

                  PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED
                7.44% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture,
                                    Series A


No. 1

                     Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated,  a New Jersey
corporation (the "Company",  which term includes any successor corporation under
the Indenture  hereinafter referred to), for value received,  hereby promises to
pay to Enterprise  Capital Trust I or registered  assigns,  the principal sum of
$231,958,775 Dollars on March 31, 2047 and to pay interest on said principal sum
from January 20, 1998 or from the most recent Interest  Payment Date (as defined
below)  to which  interest  has been paid or duly  provided  for,  quarterly  in
arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, commencing March 31,
1998 (each, an "Interest  Payment  Date"),  at the rate of 7.44% per annum until
the  principal  hereof  shall have  become due and  payable,  and on any overdue
principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable  under
applicable  law) on any  overdue  installment  of  interest at the same rate per
annum.  The amount of interest  payable on any  Interest  Payment  Date shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve  30-day  months.  In the event
that any Interest  Payment Date is not a Business  Day,  then  interest  will be
payable on the next  succeeding  day which is a Business  Day (and  without  any
interest or other  payment in respect of any such delay),  except that,  if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made
on the immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect  as if made on such  date.  The  interest  installment  so  payable,  and
punctually  paid or duly  provided  in the  Indenture,  be paid to the Person in
whose name this  Debenture is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest installment,  which shall be the 15th day (whether
or not a Business Day) of the last month of each calendar quarter, provided that
if all of the Series A Debentures (as defined below) are then held by Enterprise
Capital  Trust  I  (the  "Trust")  or  the  Series  A  Debentures  are  held  in
book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on
the Business Day  immediately  preceding  such Interest  Payment Date.  Any such
interest  installment  not punctually  paid or duly provided for shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holders on such Regular  Record Date, and may be paid
to the  Person  in whose  name  this  Debenture  is  registered  at the close of
business on a Special  Record Date to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined below)
for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be given to the
Holders of the Series A Debentures  not less than 7 calendar  days prior to such
Special Record Date, as more fully provided in the Indenture.

                     Payment of the principal of and interest on this  Debenture
will be made in such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at the
time of  payment  is legal  tender for  payment  of public  and  private  debts.
Payments of interest on an Interest Payment Date will be made by check mailed to
the Holder  hereof at the address shown in the Register or, at the option of the
Holder hereof, to such other place in the United States of America as the Holder
hereof shall designate to the Trustee in writing.  At the request of a Holder of
at least $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series A Debentures, interest
on such  Debentures  will be payable  by wire  transfer  within the  continental
United  States  in  immediately  available  funds  to the  bank  account  number
specified in writing by such Holder to the Registrar prior to the Regular Record
Date.

                     The  principal  amount  hereof and any  interest due on the
Stated Maturity Date or a Redemption Date (other than an Interest  Payment Date)
will be paid only upon  surrender of this  Debenture at the principal  corporate
office of First Union National Bank, Paying Agent, in Newark,  New Jersey, or at
such other office or agency of the Paying Agent as the Company  shall  designate
by written notice to the Holder of this Debenture.

                     The  indebtedness  evidenced by this  Debenture  is, to the
extent provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment to
the prior  payment in full of all Senior  Indebtedness,  and this  Debenture  is
issued  subject to the  provisions of the Indenture  with respect  thereto.  The
Holder of this  Debenture,  by  accepting  the same,  (a) agrees to and shall be
bound by such  provisions,  (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his behalf
to take  such  action as may be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  acknowledge  or
effectuate  the  subordination  so  provided  and (c)  appoints  the Trustee his
attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. The Holder of this Debenture, by
his  acceptance  hereof,  hereby  waives  all  notice of the  acceptance  of the
subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of
Senior Indebtedness,  whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives
reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

                     This  Debenture  is  one  of a duly  authorized  series  of
Debentures  of the  Company  (herein  sometimes  referred  to as the  "Series  A
Debentures"),  specified in the Indenture, limited in aggregate principal amount
to  $231,958,775,  issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as January 1,
1998 (the  "Indenture")  executed  and  delivered  between the Company and First
Union  National  Bank, as trustee (the  "Trustee").  The Series A Debentures are
initially  being  issued to the Trust,  to be held on behalf of the Trust by its
property trustee (the "Property Trustee"). Concurrently with the issuance of the
Series A  Debentures,  the Trust is issuing its trust  securities,  representing
undivided  beneficial  interests  in the  assets  of the  Trust  and  having  an
aggregate  liquidation  amount  equal to the  principal  amount of the  Series A
Debentures,  including the Trust's 7.44% Trust Originated  Preferred  Securities
(the  "Preferred  Securities").  By the terms of the  Indenture,  Debentures are
issuable  in  series  which may vary as to  amount,  date of  maturity,  rate of
interest and in other respects as in the Indenture  provided.  Reference is made
to the  Indenture  for a  description  of the  rights,  limitations  of  rights,
obligations,  duties and immunities  thereunder of the Trustee,  the Company and
Holders of the Debentures.  Each term used in this Debenture which is defined in
the  Indenture and not defined  herein shall have the meaning  assigned to it in
the Indenture.

                     At the option of the Company,  the Series A Debentures  are
redeemable prior to maturity (i) at any time on or after March 31, 2003 in whole
or in part, and (ii) if a Special Event shall occur and be continuing,  in whole
(but not in part),  in each case at 100% of the  principal  amount  thereof plus
accrued  interest to the Redemption  Date. A "Special Event" shall mean either a
"Tax Event" or an  "Investment  Company  Event." "Tax Event" shall mean that the
Company shall have received an opinion of counsel (which may be regular  counsel
to the Company or an  Affiliate,  but not an employee  thereof and which must be
acceptable to the Property Trustee of the Trust)  experienced in such matters to
the effect  that,  as a result of any  amendment  to, or change  (including  any
announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any regulations  thereunder) of
the United States or any political  subdivision or taxing  authority  thereof or
therein  affecting  taxation,  or as a  result  of any  official  administrative
pronouncement  or  judicial  decision  interpreting  or  applying  such  laws or
regulations,  which amendment or change is effective or such  interpretation  or
pronouncement  is  announced  on or  after  the  date of  original  issuance  of
Preferred  Securities,  there is more  than an  insubstantial  risk that (i) the
Trust is subject to United  States  Federal  income tax with respect to interest
received on the Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Company to the Trust on
the Series A Debentures  will not be deductible for United States Federal income
tax  purposes or (iii) the Trust is subject to more than a de minimis  amount of
other taxes,  duties,  assessments or other  governmental  charges.  "Investment
Company  Event" shall mean the  occurrence of a change in law or regulation or a
change in  interpretation or application of law or regulation by any legislative
body, court,  governmental agency or regulatory authority (a "Change in 1940 Act
Law") to the  effect  that the  Trust is or will be  considered  an  "investment
company" that is required to be registered  under the Investment  Company Act of
1940, as amended, which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective on or after the
date of original issuance of the Preferred Securities.

                     At  least  30 days but not  more  than 60 days  before  the
Redemption  Date,  the  Trustee  shall  mail or  caused to be mailed a notice of
redemption by  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to each Holder of Series A
Debentures to be redeemed.

                     In the event of redemption of this  Debenture in part only,
a new Series A Debenture or Debentures for the unredeemed portion hereof will be
issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

                     In case an Event of  Default  with  respect to the Series A
Debentures occurs and is continuing, the principal of and interest on the Series
A Debentures may (and, in certain  circumstances,  shall) be declared,  and upon
such declaration shall become, due and payable,  in the manner,  with the effect
and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

                     The Indenture  contains  provisions  for  defeasance at any
time of the entire indebtedness of this Debenture upon compliance by the Company
with certain conditions set forth therein.

                     Subject  to  certain  exceptions  in  the  Indenture  which
require the consent of every  Holder,  the Company and the Trustee may amend the
Indenture or may waive future  compliance by the Company with any  provisions of
the  Indenture,  with the  consent  of the  Holders  of at least a  majority  in
aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures of each series affected  thereby,
provided  that  if the  Series  A  Debentures  are  held by the  Trust,  no such
amendment  or  waiver  that  adversely  affects  the  holders  of the  Preferred
Securities  shall be  effective  without the prior  consent of the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate  liquidation  amount of the outstanding  Preferred
Securities.  Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture, without the consent
of any  Debentureholder,  the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture to
cure  any  ambiguity,  defect  or  inconsistency,  to  bind a  successor  to the
obligations  of the  Indenture,  to provide  for  uncertificated  Debentures  in
addition to  certificated  Debentures,  to comply with any  requirements  of the
Debentures  and the Securities  and Exchange  Commission in connection  with the
qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or to make any change that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company,  does not adversely affect the rights of any
Debentureholder. Amendments bind all Holders and subsequent Holders.

                     No reference  herein to the  Indenture  and no provision of
this  Debenture or the  Indenture  shall alter or impair the  obligation  of the
Company,  which is  absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay the  principal  of and
interest  on this  Debenture  at the time and  place  and at the rate and in the
money herein prescribed.

                     So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Series A
Debentures has occurred and is  continuing,  the Company shall have the right at
any time and from  time to time to extend  the  interest  payment  period of the
Series A Debentures for up to 20 consecutive  quarters (the "Extension Period"),
provided that no Extension  Period shall extend beyond the Stated  Maturity Date
or  Redemption  Date of any  Series  A  Debenture.  At the end of the  Extension
Period,  the Company  shall pay all interest  then accrued and unpaid  (together
with  interest  thereon  at the rate  specified  for the  Series  A  Debentures,
compounded quarterly, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable
under applicable law). During such Extension Period, the Company may not declare
or pay any dividend on, redeem, purchase,  acquire or make a liquidation payment
with respect to, any of its capital stock.  Prior to the termination of any such
Extension Period, the Company may further extend such Extension Period, provided
that  such  Extension  Period,  together  with all  such  previous  and  further
extensions, shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters and shall not extend beyond
the Stated  Maturity Date or Redemption  Date of any Series A Debenture.  At the
termination  of any such  Extension  Period and upon the  payment of all amounts
then due, the Company may elect to begin a new Extension Period,  subject to the
foregoing restrictions.

                     Series A Debentures  are issuable only in  registered  form
without coupons in denominations of $25 and any integral  multiple  thereof.  As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain  limitations therein set forth,
this Debenture is exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series A
Debentures of a different  authorized  denomination,  as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same.

                     As  provided  in  the  Indenture  and  subject  to  certain
limitations  therein set forth,  this  Debenture is  transferable  by the Holder
hereof upon  surrender of this  Debenture  for  registration  of transfer at the
office  or agency  of the  Registrar  accompanied  by a  written  instrument  or
instruments of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Registrar duly executed by
the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing,  and thereupon one
or more new Series A Debentures  of  authorized  denominations  and for the same
aggregate  principal  amount  will be issued  to the  designated  transferee  or
transferees.  No  service  charge  will be made for any such  transfer,  but the
Company  may  require  payment  of a sum  sufficient  to cover  any tax or other
governmental charge payable in relation thereto.

                     Prior to presentment  for  registration of transfer of this
Debenture, the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Registrar may deem
and treat the Holder  hereof as the absolute  owner hereof  (whether or not this
Debenture  shall be  overdue  and  notwithstanding  any notice of  ownership  or
writing  hereon  made by anyone  other than the  Registrar)  for the  purpose of
receiving  payment of or on account of the  principal  hereof and  interest  due
hereon and for all other  purposes,  and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor
any  Paying  Agent nor any  Registrar  shall be  affected  by any  notice to the
contrary.

                     No recourse  shall be had for the payment of the  principal
of or the  interest  on  this  Debenture,  or for any  claim  based  hereon,  or
otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against
any incorporator,  stockholder officer or director,  past, present or future, as
such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation,  whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability being, by the acceptance
hereof  and as part of the  consideration  for the  issuance  hereof,  expressly
waived and released.

                     This  Debenture  shall  not be valid  until  an  authorized
signatory of the Trustee  manually signs and dates the Trustee's  Certificate of
Authentication below.

                     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused this Debenture
to be signed  manually or by  facsimile  by its duly  authorized  officers and a
facsimile of its corporate seal to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon.
