                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Note 1.  Basis of Presentation/Organization

   The financial  statements  included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with the
Registrant's  Notes  contained  in the 1997  Annual  Report on Form 10-K and the
Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1998. These Notes
update and supplement  matters  discussed in the 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1998.

   The unaudited financial  information furnished reflects all adjustments which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly state the results for the
interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were derived
from the audited  consolidated  financial statements included in the 1997 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.  Certain  reclassifications  of the prior  year's data have
been made to conform with the current presentation.

   On June 12, 1998, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) renamed
certain  of  its  principal  non-utility  subsidiaries.  Enterprise  Diversified
Holdings  Incorporated was renamed PSEG Energy Holdings Inc. (Energy  Holdings);
Community  Energy  Alternatives   Incorporated  was  renamed  PSEG  Global  Inc.
(Global);  Energis Resources  Incorporated was renamed PSEG Energy  Technologies
Inc. (Energy  Technologies) and Public Service Resources Corporation was renamed
PSEG Resources Inc. (Resources).

Note 2.  Rate Matters

   New Jersey Energy Master Plan

   As  previously  reported,  on April 30, 1997,  the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities  (BPU)  issued its final  report  regarding  Phase II (final  Phase II
report) of the Energy  Master  Plan  addressing  wholesale  and retail  electric
competition in New Jersey. In accordance with the final Phase II report,  Public
Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) filed a proposal regarding  competition
and rates with the BPU on July 15, 1997.  The BPU is in the process of reviewing
filings of all New Jersey  electric  utilities.  The  decision of the BPU in the
Energy  Master Plan  proceedings,  which include  hearings  before the Office of
Administrative   Law  (OAL)   (stranded   costs  and  unbundling)  and  the  BPU
(restructuring),   including  management  audit  reports,  and  the  legislation
required to implement certain aspects of electric restructuring, if enacted into
law,  will  establish  the  industry  rules for the  future.  These  actions are
expected  to  fundamentally  change  the  electric  industry  in  the  State  by
introducing  retail  competition  to  replace  the  utilities'  former  monopoly
position and  potentially  requiring or resulting in the  separation  or sale of
generation  assets and the  establishment of generic rules regarding a regulated
utility's relationships with its affiliates.

   Also, as previously reported, by Order dated June 25, 1997, the BPU commenced
management audits of all New Jersey electric  utilities,  with the assistance of
certain  consulting firms, under the direction of its own audit staff. The audit
process included, but was not limited to, reviews of electric utility filings in
response to the Energy  Master  Plan.  The  management  audit  process for PSE&G
concluded  in December  1997 with a report of the BPU's  management  consultants
relating  to  issues  of  stranded  costs,   securitization  and  consumer  rate
reductions.  A second  report on  restructuring  was filed on February 27, 1998.
These  management  audit reports were approved for release by the BPU on January
29, 1998 and March 5, 1998, respectively, and are being considered by the BPU as
part of the proceedings discussed below. The BPU can adopt, reject or modify the
audit reports' results in its decision on PSE&G's proposal. PSE&G cannot predict
the extent to which the BPU will rely on the results of these  audit  reports in
evaluating its proposal.


<PAGE>



   The BPU requested the OAL to hold  evidentiary  hearings  regarding  stranded
costs and unbundling  issues.  These  hearings  concluded on March 18, 1998. The
management  audit report released in January 1998 is being considered as part of
this proceeding.  Briefs have been filed by the parties in these hearings and an
OAL decision is expected in August 1998.

   Hearings  at the BPU  addressing  other  restructuring  issues such as market
power,  functional separation and consumer protection concluded on May 28, 1998.
The management audit report released in March 1998, relating to these issues, is
being  considered  as part of this  proceeding.  Briefs  have been  filed by the
parties in these hearings and a decision is pending.

   The BPU has indicated its intent to submit draft  legislation to the Governor
by Fall 1998 to provide it requisite  authority to implement  certain aspects of
wholesale and retail electric competition in New Jersey.  Legislative leadership
has indicated its intent to consider passage of a legislative  package providing
such authority by year end 1998.

   PSEG and  PSE&G  cannot  predict  the  outcome  of these  administrative  and
legislative proceedings. However, such proceedings could have a material adverse
effect on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial condition,  results of operations and net
cash flows.

   Non-utility Generation Buydown

   As previously  reported,  PSE&G is seeking to restructure  certain of its BPU
approved contracts with Non-utility Generators (NUGs), which are estimated to be
$1.6 billion above assumed  future market  prices.  In June 1998,  PSE&G and the
Union County  Utilities  Authority  (UCUA) announced an agreement to amend their
Power Purchase and  Interconnection  Agreement  originally signed in 1990. Under
Federal  and State  regulations,  utilities  have been  required  to enter  into
long-term  power  purchase  agreements  with NUGs at prices  which  subsequently
proved to be above market.  In accordance  with a July 17, 1998 BPU Decision and
Order  and based on the  Amendment  to the Power  Purchase  and  Interconnection
Agreement,  PSE&G will pay UCUA a lump sum amount of $7.75  million in  exchange
for a $15.6 million  savings to  ratepayers  on a net present  value basis.  The
payment  of  $7.75  million  by  PSE&G  will be  recovered  through  the LEAC or
successor  mechanisms for recovery of NUG costs, to be determined by the outcome
of the Energy Master Plan proceedings.

   Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC)

   On November 14, 1997,  PSE&G filed a petition  with the BPU  requesting a $45
million  annual  increase in its LGAC for the period January 1, 1998 to December
31,  1998,  which,  as  filed,  would  increase  a typical  residential  bill by
approximately  4.8%. On February 18, 1998, the BPU approved a Stipulation agreed
to by the parties in the proceeding  providing for an interim increase in annual
LGAC revenues of approximately  $31 million,  excluding State sales and use tax,
or an increase of 3.5% on a typical residential bill. On June 26, 1998, an Order
was  executed  by the BPU making  the terms of the  interim  Stipulation  final,
without modification.

   On July 10, 1998,  PSE&G filed a motion with the BPU requesting a $27 million
annual  increase  in its LGAC for the period  October 1, 1998 to  September  30,
1999,  representing an increase on a typical  residential  bill of approximately
2.8%.  Also included in the revised LGAC rate is an increase in the  Remediation
Adjustment  Clause  (RAC)  component,  a decrease in the Demand Side  Adjustment
Factor  (DSAF) and a request  to  change,  on a monthly  basis,  the  over/under
collection  component of the LGAC rate for  residential  customers.  On July 28,
1998, the matter was transmitted to the OAL for review. PSE&G cannot predict the
outcome of this proceeding.


<PAGE>


   Gas Unbundling Pilot Program

   In April 1997,  the BPU  approved  PSE&G's  proposal  for a  residential  gas
unbundling  pilot  program   (SelectGas),   which  allows  approximately  65,000
residential natural gas customers, out of a total of 1.4 million residential gas
customers,  to participate in the competitive marketplace effective May 1, 1997.
To date,  none of these eligible  customers have  subscribed to the program.  On
April 30, 1998,  PSE&G filed a report with the BPU on SelectGas and its proposed
refinements for a permanent  residential gas unbundling program (Energy Choice).
Under Energy Choice, as proposed, a total of 300,000 residential customers could
be permitted to choose their gas supplier on a first-come,  first-served  basis.
This  expanded  program  would  commence  by the later of sixty days after a BPU
order  authorizing  this program or September 30, 1998.  PSE&G's  proposal would
permit its remaining  residential customers to choose their gas supplier by July
1, 1999 or such alternate date as may be established by the BPU.

   Electric  Levelized  Energy  Adjustment  Clause  (LEAC)/Demand  Side
Adjustment Factor (DSAF)

   As  previously  reported,  on April 1, 1998,  the BPU approved an  annualized
increase of $150.8 million in the DSAF component of the LEAC.  This increase was
effective  for service  rendered on or after April 3, 1998.  The Division of the
Ratepayer  Advocate has  appealed the BPU's order  seeking to overturn the BPU's
decision.  PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of the appeal process but the impact
on PSE&G's future financial condition,  results of operations and net cash flows
could be materially adverse if such an appeal is successful.

   As previously reported, while PSE&G's proposal in response to the final Phase
II report of the Energy  Master Plan  provides for a transition  period of seven
years with basic tariff rates being capped and the  discontinuation  of the LEAC
effective  December 31, 1998,  such  proposal  provides for recovery of mandated
societal costs,  including Demand Side Management (DSM), to be adjusted based on
changes in such costs. At June 30, 1998,  PSE&G had an  underrecovered  balance,
including  interest,  of  approximately  $156  million  related to electric  DSM
programs.  Such  amount is  included  in  Deferred  Debits on PSEG's and PSE&G's
Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  PSE&G estimates that the underrecovered  electric
DSM balance at December 31, 1998 will be  approximately  $135 million.  PSEG and
PSE&G cannot predict the final outcome of DSM and other mandated  societal costs
recovery  under the Energy  Master Plan but  inability  to recover  such amounts
could have a material adverse impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial  condition,
results  of  operations  and net  cash  flows.  For  further  discussion  of the
potential  impact on PSEG and PSE&G of the Energy Master Plan  proceedings,  see
New Jersey Energy Master Plan.

   Remediation Adjustment Charge (RAC)

   As  previously  reported,  on August 1, 1997,  PSE&G  requested  that the BPU
approve  recovery of $6.8 million through PSE&G's RAC for manufactured gas plant
remediation  costs. This request represents an increase in the amount of PSE&G's
recovery of such costs by approximately $2 million over current rate levels.  On
October 9, 1997, this matter was transferred to the OAL. The rates were approved
for recovery on June 26, 1998 (see LGAC).

   On July 10,  1998,  PSE&G  filed a motion  before the BPU  requesting  a $1.5
million  annual  increase  in its RAC for the period  August 1, 1997 to July 31,
1998,  representing an increase on a typical  residential  bill of approximately
0.03%. On July 28, 1998, the motion was transferred to the OAL for review. PSE&G
cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.

   Order Adopting Auction Standards

   On June  16,  1998,  the BPU  adopted  standards  applicable  to the  auction
processes  being  used by GPU  Energy and  Rockland  Electric  Company to divest
themselves of certain of their generating plants. At this time, PSE&G's strategy
is to retain  its  generation  assets.  The BPU  order  adopting  these  auction
standards  indicated that the standards would be reviewed and possibly modified,
if deemed appropriate.  If, at some time in the future,  PSE&G were to decide or
be required to sell its generation assets, PSE&G would determine whether to seek
such review or modification.

Note 3.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

   Electric  Energy and Gas Costs:  Recoveries of electric  energy and gas costs
are  determined  by the BPU  under  the LEAC and  LGAC.  PSE&G's  deferred  fuel
balances  as of June 30,  1998 and  December  31,  1997,  respectively,  reflect
underrecovered costs as follows:

                                                 June 30, December 31,
                                                   1998       1997
                                                --------  -----------
                                                (Millions of Dollars)
    Underrecovered Electric Energy Costs......     $8        $91
    Underrecovered Gas Fuel Costs.............     65         76
                                                -------    -------
       Total..................................    $73       $167
                                                =======    =======

   The BPU Order dated December 31, 1996 provides PSE&G the opportunity, but not
a guarantee,  during the period  January 1, 1997 through  December 31, 1998,  to
fully recover its December 31, 1996  underrecovered LEAC balance of $151 million
without  any  change  in  the  current  energy  component  of the  LEAC  charge.
Management  believes  that it will  recover this amount by December 31, 1998 and
continues to follow deferred accounting treatment for the LEAC.

Note 4.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

   Nuclear Operating Performance Standard (OPS)

   PECO Energy Company (PECO Energy),  Delmarva Power & Light Company (DP&L) and
PSE&G, three of the co-owners of the Salem Nuclear Generating  Station,  Units 1
and 2 (Salem) and the Peach Bottom  Atomic Power  Station,  Units 2 and 3 (Peach
Bottom),  have agreed to an OPS through  December 31, 2011 for Salem and through
December  31,  2007 for Peach  Bottom.  PSE&G is the  operator of Salem and PECO
Energy is the operator of Peach Bottom.  Under the OPS, the station  operator is
required to make payments to the non-operating  owners (excluding  Atlantic City
Electric  Company)  commencing  in  January  2001 if the  three-year  historical
average net maximum  dependable  capacity  factor (MDC) (defined below) for that
station,  calculated as of December 31 of each year commencing with December 31,
2000,  falls below 40%.  Any such payment is limited to a maximum of $25 million
per year.  MDC is the gross  electrical  output  for a station  measured  at the
output terminals of its turbine generators during the most restrictive  seasonal
conditions,  less the station's service load. The parties have further agreed to
forego litigation in the future,  except for limited cases in which the operator
would be responsible for damages of no more than $5 million per year.

   Year 2000

   Many of PSEG's and PSE&G's  systems,  which  include  information  technology
applications, plant control and telecommunications  infrastructure systems, must
be modified due to computer  program  limitations  in  recognizing  dates beyond
1999. During the six months ended June 30, 1998, $12 million of costs related to
Year 2000 readiness were incurred.  Management  estimates the total cost of this
effort to  approximate  $92 million,  to be incurred  from 1997 through 2001, of
which $37 million is  expected to be incurred in 1998.  A portion of these costs
is not likely to be incremental to PSEG or PSE&G,  but rather,  will represent a
redeployment of existing personnel/resources.

   PSEG and PSE&G are  continuing to work with their supplier base to assess the
Year 2000  status of  vendors  who  provide  critical  materials  and  services.
Sufficient  information  has not yet been received from all critical  vendors to
confirm the vendors' preparedness for Year 2000. PSEG and PSE&G are aggressively
pursuing the key vendors who have been unresponsive; however, PSEG and PSE&G are
not yet able to determine  whether all of their critical vendors will be able to
meet Year 2000 requirements.

   As previously reported,  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) had proposed
to issue a generic  letter which would  require all nuclear  plant  operators to
provide it with information  concerning their programs,  planned or implemented,
to address Year 2000 computer and systems issues at their facilities. On May 11,
1998, the NRC issued a Generic Letter requiring submission of a written response
within 90 days of the date of the Generic Letter  indicating  whether or not the
operators  have pursued and continue to pursue Year 2000 programs and addressing
the programs' scope,  assessment process, plans for corrective actions,  quality
assurance measures,  contingency plans and regulatory compliance.  Additionally,
the Generic Letter requires  submission of a written response upon completion of
the operators'  Year 2000 program or no later than July 1, 1999  confirming that
their  facilities are Year 2000 ready,  or will be Year 2000 ready, by 2000 with
regard to compliance  with the terms and  conditions  of their  licenses and NRC
regulations.  On July 23, 1998, PSE&G provided its written response to the first
requirement  noted above,  outlining for the NRC its Nuclear Business Unit (NBU)
Year 2000 program and indicating that planned  implementation will allow the NBU
to be Year  2000  ready and  compliant  with the  terms  and  conditions  of its
operating licenses and NRC regulations by January 1, 2000.

   If PSEG,  PSE&G,  their domestic and  international  subsidiaries,  the other
members  of the  Pennsylvania--New  Jersey--Maryland  Interconnection  (PJM)  or
PSEG's or PSE&G's  critical  vendors are unable to meet the Year 2000  deadline,
such  inability  could have a  material  adverse  impact on PSEG's  and  PSE&G's
operations, financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

  Hazardous Waste

  Certain  Federal and state laws  authorize the U.S.  Environmental  Protection
Agency (EPA) and the New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP),
among other agencies,  to issue orders and bring  enforcement  actions to compel
responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is
determined  to  present  an actual or  potential  threat to human  health or the
environment  because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous
substances.  Because of the nature of PSE&G's business, including the production
of electricity,  the distribution of gas and, formerly,  the manufacture of gas,
various by-products and substances are or were produced or handled which contain
constituents classified as hazardous.  PSE&G generally provides for the disposal
or processing  of such  substances  through  licensed  independent  contractors.
However,  these  statutory  provisions  impose joint and several  responsibility
without regard to fault on all responsible parties,  including the generators of
the hazardous  substances,  for certain  investigative  and remediation costs at
sites where these  substances  were  disposed  of or  processed.  PSE&G has been
notified  with  respect  to a number  of such  sites and the  investigation  and
remediation of these potentially hazardous sites is receiving attention from the
government agencies involved.  Generally,  actions directed at funding such site
investigations  and  remediation  include  all  suspected  or known  responsible
parties. Except as discussed below with respect to its Remediation Program, PSEG
and PSE&G do not  expect its  expenditures  for any such site to have a material
effect on their financial conditions, results of operations and net cash flows.

  The NJDEP has recently revised  regulations  concerning site investigation and
remediation.   These  regulations  will  require  an  ecological  evaluation  of
potential   injuries  to  natural   resources  in  connection  with  a  remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
utility  industry,  among others, to develop  procedures for implementing  these
regulations.  These regulations may substantially increase the costs of remedial
investigations and remediations, where necessary,  particularly at sites located
on surface water bodies.  PSE&G and predecessor  companies owned and/or operated
facilities  located on surface water bodies,  certain of which are currently the
subject of remedial  activities.  The financial  impact of these  regulations on
these projects is not currently  estimable.  PSE&G does not anticipate  that the
compliance  with these  regulations  will have a material  adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations and net cash flows.

  PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program (Remediation
Program)

   In 1988,  NJDEP  notified  PSE&G that it had  identified  the need for PSE&G,
pursuant  to  a  formal  arrangement,  to  systematically  investigate  and,  if
necessary,  resolve environmental concerns extant at PSE&G's former manufactured
gas plant sites. To date, NJDEP and PSE&G have identified 38 former manufactured
gas plant  sites.  PSE&G is  currently  working  with  NJDEP  under a program to
assess, investigate and, if necessary, remediate environmental concerns at these
sites.  The Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and revised by PSE&G
based on regulatory  requirements,  experience with the Remediation  Program and
available remediation  technologies.  The cost of the Remediation Program cannot
be  reasonably  estimated,  but  experience  to date  indicates  that  costs  of
approximately  $20 million per year could be incurred  over a period of about 30
years  and that the  overall  cost  could be  material  to  PSEG's  and  PSE&G's
financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Note 5.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

   PSEG's  operations  give rise to  exposure  to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices,  interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of
security  investments.  PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments
for the purpose of managing  market risk  consistent with its business plans and
prudent business practices.

   PSEG

   Interest Rate Swap

   PSEG entered into an interest rate swap on June 26, 1998 to hedge  Enterprise
Capital Trust II's $150 million of Floating Rate Capital  Securities,  Series B,
due 2028,  which were sold to a group of  institutional  investors in June 1998.
The  basis  for both  the  interest  rate  swap and the  Floating  Rate  Capital
Securities is the quarterly  London Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR).  Enterprise
Capital Trust II is a special  purpose  statutory  business trust  controlled by
PSEG.  This interest rate swap  effectively  hedges the  underlying  debt for 10
years at an effective rate of 7.2%.

   PSEG Energy Holdings Inc.

   Equity Securities

   Resources,  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Energy Holdings, has investments in
equity  securities  and  partnerships  which  invest in equity  securities.  The
aggregate  carrying value of Resource's  portfolio  approximated its fair market
value of $231  million  and $185  million as of June 30, 1998 and  December  31,
1997, respectively.

   PSE&G

   Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds

   Contributions made into the Nuclear  Decommissioning Trust Funds are invested
in debt and equity  securities.  The  carrying  value of $509  million  and $459
million of these funds  approximates their fair market value as of June 30, 1998
and December 31, 1997, respectively.


<PAGE>


Note 6.  Taxes

   As  previously  reported,  the New Jersey Gross  Receipts and  Franchise  Tax
(NJGRT) was eliminated effective January 1, 1998 and replaced with a combination
of the New Jersey Corporate  Business Tax which is a State income tax, the State
sales and use tax and a Transitional  Energy Facility Assessment (TEFA), with no
material impact on the financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash
flows of PSEG and  PSE&G.  The TEFA will be phased  out over five  years.  While
under NJGRT,  PSE&G was subject to an effective state tax on unit sales equal to
approximately 13% of receipts.  As a result of such tax reform,  after the phase
out of the TEFA,  the  effective  state  tax rate  applicable  to PSE&G  will be
substantially reduced. Interim rates were implemented with regard to the new tax
structure  effective with service rendered on and after January 1, 1998. The BPU
completed its  administrative  review of the filings of all New Jersey utilities
and approved  permanent  rates for 1998 on July 13, 1998 in a final Order.  As a
result  of the July 13,  1998 BPU  Order,  utilities  are  subject  to  mandated
adjustments  which  will be  incorporated  into their 1999  rates,  pending  BPU
approval.

   Therefore,  effective January 1, 1998, PSE&G became subject to the New Jersey
Corporate  Business  Tax.  Consequently,  the  effective  income  tax rate is as
follows:

                                  Quarter Ended    Six Months Ended
                                     June 30,           June 30,

Note 7.  Accounting Matters

   In  June  1997,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income" (SFAS 130), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15,  1997.  SFAS 130 dictates  that all items  required to be  recognized  under
accounting  standards as  components  of  comprehensive  income be reported in a
financial  statement  displayed  with the  same  prominence  as other  financial
statements.  It also  requires  that  an  enterprise  classify  items  of  other
comprehensive  income by their nature in a financial  statement  and display the
accumulated  balance of other  comprehensive  income  separately  from  retained
earnings and additional  paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of
financial  position.  PSEG and PSE&G adopted SFAS 130 effective January 1, 1998.
The effects of adoption of SFAS 130 are not material for PSEG or PSE&G.

   Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of
an  Enterprise  and Related  Information"  (SFAS 131),  which is  effective  for
financial  statements  for periods  beginning  after  December  15,  1997.  This
Statement  need not be applied to interim  financial  statements  in the initial
year of its application.  SFAS 131 supersedes SFAS 14, "Financial  Reporting for
Segments of a Business  Enterprise" and requires that companies disclose segment
data based on how  management  makes  decisions  about  allocating  resources to
segments  and  measuring  their  performance.  Since  SFAS  131  solely  revises
disclosure  requirements,  the  adoption  of SFAS 131  will not have a  material
impact on the financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash flows of
PSEG or PSE&G.



<PAGE>
   In February 1998,  the FASB issued SFAS 132,  "Employers'  Disclosures  about
Pensions and Other  Postretirement  Benefits" (SFAS 132), which is effective for
financial  statements  for periods  beginning  after  December  15,  1997.  This
statement revises and standardizes disclosure requirements for pension and other
postretirement  benefit plans but does not change the measurement or recognition
of those  plans.  Since SFAS 132 solely  revises  disclosure  requirements,  the
adoption of SFAS 132 will not have a material impact on the financial condition,
results of operations and net cash flows of PSEG and PSE&G.

   In  June  1998,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  133,   "Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133), which is effective for financial
statements  for all fiscal  quarters of fiscal  years  beginning  after June 15,
1999.  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting and reporting  standards for derivative
instruments and hedging activities. An entity is to recognize all derivatives as
assets or liabilities  on the balance sheet at fair value.  Accounting for gains
and losses  resulting from changes in the fair value of a derivative  depends on
the  intended  use of the  derivative  and  the  resulting  designation  of that
derivative. PSEG and PSE&G are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 133.

   In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
issued  Statement of Position  (SOP) 98-5,  "Reporting  on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities" (SOP 98-5),  which is effective for financial  statements for fiscal
years  beginning after December 15, 1998. SOP 98-5 requires the expensing of the
costs of start-up activities as incurred.  Additionally,  previously capitalized
start-up  costs  must  be  written  off as a  Cumulative  Change  in  Accounting
Principle.  PSEG and PSE&G are currently  evaluating the impact,  if any, of SOP
98-5.

Note  8.  Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interest in Subordinated Debentures

   The  Guaranteed  Preferred  Beneficial  Interest in  Subordinated  Debentures
includes  the  monthly  guaranteed  preferred  beneficial  interest  in  PSE&G's
subordinated  debentures  and  the  quarterly  guaranteed  preferred  beneficial
interest in PSEG's and PSE&G's subordinated debentures.  The balances as of June
30, 1998 and December 31, 1997 of these preferred securities are as follows:

                                                           =======    =======

   The increase in the Quarterly  Guaranteed  Preferred  Beneficial  Interest in
PSEG's Subordinated Debentures since December 31, 1997 is due to the issuance in
January 1998 and June 1998 of $225 million of 7.44% Trust  Originated  Preferred
Securities,  Series A and $150  million of  Floating  Rate  Capital  Securities,
Series B, respectively.  Additionally, Quarterly Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial
Interest in PSEG's  Subordinated  Debentures  increased  as a result of the July
1998 issuance of $150 million of 7.25% Trust  Originated  Preferred  Securities,
Series C by PSEG Capital Trust III.

                 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


   Following are the significant changes in or additions to information reported
in the Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) 1997 Annual Report on
Form 10-K and the Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31,
1998  affecting  the  consolidated   financial  condition  and  the  results  of
operations  of  PSEG  and  its  subsidiaries.  This  discussion  refers  to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and related Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements (Notes) of PSEG and should be read in conjunction with such
Statements and Notes.

Results of Operations

   Basic and diluted earnings per share of PSEG common stock (Common Stock) were
$0.53 for the quarter ended June 30, 1998,  representing an increase of $0.14 or
36% per share from the comparable  1997 period.  Basic and diluted  earnings per
share  were  $1.35 for the six  months  ended  June 30,  1998,  representing  an
increase of $0.36 or 36% per share from the comparable 1997 period.

   Public Service  Electric and Gas Company's  (PSE&G)  contribution to earnings
per share of Common  Stock for the  quarter  and six months  ended June 30, 1998
increased  $0.12 and $0.21 from the comparable 1997 periods,  respectively.  The
increases for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 1998 were  primarily due
to profits realized from energy trading and other wholesale power activities and
decreased operating and maintenance expenses related to the return to service of
PSE&G's Salem Nuclear Generating Station (Salem).  For a discussion of commodity
trading, see Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
The results of  operations  for the six months  ended June 30, 1998 were further
impacted  by the  one-time  charge to earnings of $55 million or $0.24 per share
recorded in the first quarter of 1997  resulting from the settlement of lawsuits
filed by the co-owners of Salem.  The increase for the six months ended June 30,
1998 was partially  offset by higher  operation  expenses,  including  Year 2000
readiness  (see Note 4.  Commitments  and  Contingent  Liabilities of Notes) and
depreciation expenses.

   PSEG Energy  Holdings Inc.'s (Energy  Holdings)  contribution to earnings per
share of  Common  Stock for the  quarter  and six  months  ended  June 30,  1998
increased  $0.02 and  $0.15  from the  comparable  1997  periods,  respectively,
primarily due to greater earnings of PSEG Resources Inc. (Resources). Resources'
earnings  increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 1998 primarily
due to higher income from investments in partnerships. The results of operations
for the six months ended June 30, 1998 were further impacted by a gain resulting
from the exercise of an early buyout  option in the first quarter of 1998 by the
lessee in a leveraged lease investment of Resources.

PSE&G -- Revenues

   Electric

   Revenues  increased  $248  million  or 26% and  $465  million  or 24% for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 1998 from the comparable  periods in 1997,
respectively, primarily due to an increase in energy trading activity and higher
sales to large industrial customers (see PSE&G -- Expenses -- Interchanged Power
and Fuel for Electric Generation).

   These increases were partially  offset by a decrease to revenue caused by New
Jersey  energy  tax  reform  in 1998  (see  Note 6.  Taxes of Notes and PSE&G --
Expenses -- Income Taxes). Collection of New Jersey Gross Receipts and Franchise
Tax (NJGRT) was  reflected in revenue and expense in 1997. As a result of energy
tax reform, the portion of NJGRT replaced by the New Jersey sales and use tax is
no longer reflected in revenue or expense on the income  statement.  State sales
and use tax is a liability of the  customer,  collected by PSE&G and remitted to
the State and is recorded in Tax Collections Payable, which is included in Other
Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

<PAGE>

   Gas

   Revenues decreased $51 million or 16% and $174 million or 16% for the quarter
and six  months  ended  June 30,  1998  from  the  comparable  periods  in 1997,
respectively.  The decreases  were primarily due to lower recovery of fuel costs
and  decreased  therm sales  resulting  from milder  winter  weather in 1998 and
energy tax reform (see PSE&G --Revenues -- Electric above).

PSE&G -- Expenses

   Interchanged Power and Fuel for Electric Generation

   Interchanged Power and Fuel for Electric Generation increased $204 million or
84% and $442  million or 90% for the quarter and six months  ended June 30, 1998
from the comparable 1997 periods, respectively,  primarily due to an increase in
energy trading  activity.  Effective  January 1, 1998,  the amount  included for
Electric Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause (LEAC) under/overrecovery represents
the difference between fuel-related revenues and fuel-related expenses which are
comprised of the cost of  generation  and  interchanged  power at the PJM market
clearing  price.  Effective  April 1, 1998,  the PJM  locational  marginal price
replaced the PJM market  clearing  price. To the extent fuel revenue and expense
flow through the LEAC mechanism,  variances in fuel revenues and expenses offset
and thus have no direct effect on earnings.

   Gas Purchased

   Gas  purchased  decreased  $11  million  or 6% and $41  million or 7% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 1998 from the  comparable  1997  periods,
respectively.  The decreases  were primarily due to the milder winter weather in
1998.  Due to the  operation  of the  Levelized  Gas  Adjustment  Clause  (LGAC)
mechanism,  variances in fuel  revenues  and expenses  offset and have no direct
effect on earnings.

   Operation and Maintenance

   Operation  and  maintenance  expenses  increased  $29  million  or 9% and $45
million  or 7% for the  quarter  and six  months  ended  June 30,  1998 from the
comparable  1997  periods,  respectively.  The increases  were  primarily due to
higher demand side management  recovery,  resulting in a greater  recognition of
previously  deferred  expenses,  and  higher  expenses  related  to  information
technology, including Year 2000 readiness. These increases were partially offset
by lower  operation  and  maintenance  expenses  related  to  Salem's  return to
service.  Demand side  management  costs are currently  recoverable  through the
demand side  adjustment  factor of the LEAC,  are  recorded in both  expense and
revenue and therefore, have no direct effect on earnings (see Note 2.
Rate Matters of Notes).

   Income Taxes

   PSE&G became  subject to New Jersey State  income tax,  effective  January 1,
1998,  due to energy tax reform in the State of New Jersey (see Note 6. Taxes of
Notes). Income Taxes increased $34 million or 74% and $49 million or 33% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 1998 from the  comparable  1997  periods,
respectively. These increases are primarily due to the inclusion of State income
tax of $25 million and $56 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30,
1998, respectively. In the quarter ended June 30, 1998, there was an increase of
$9 million in Federal income taxes due to higher pre-tax operating  income.  For
the six  months  ended  June 30,  1998,  there was a  decrease  of $7 million in
Federal income taxes due to lower pre-tax operating income.

   Transitional  Energy Facility  Assessment  (TEFA) / New Jersey Gross
Receipts and Franchise Tax (NJGRT)

   TEFA/NJGRT  decreased  $79  million  or 67% and $202  million  or 70% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 1998 from the  comparable  1997  periods,
respectively,  due to New  Jersey  energy  tax  reform.  For  1998,  the  amount
represents  TEFA  unit-based  taxes  while  the  1997  amount  represents  NJGRT
unit-based  taxes.  The TEFA unit tax rates are  approximately  30% of the NJGRT
unit tax rates. See PSE&G --Revenues and Income Taxes,  above, and Note 6. Taxes
of Notes for other impacts of New Jersey energy tax reform.

                                            =====         =======

   Energy  Holdings'  earnings  were $14 million and $49 million for the quarter
and six months ended June 30, 1998, respectively,  an increase of $4 million and
$35 million,  respectively.  These  increases  were  primarily due to Resources'
higher income from  investments  in  partnerships  and a gain resulting from the
exercise of an early buyout option in the first quarter of 1998 by the lessee in
a leveraged lease.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   PSEG

   PSEG is a public  utility  holding  company and as such, has no operations of
its own. The following  discussion of PSEG's liquidity and capital  resources is
on a consolidated  basis, noting the uses and contributions of PSEG's two direct
subsidiaries, PSE&G and Energy Holdings.

   Cash  generated  from  PSE&G's  operations  is  expected to provide the major
source of funds for PSE&G's  business.  Energy  Holdings'  growth will be funded
through external financings, cash generated from operations and equity capital.

   Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock  were $1.08 per share and  totaled  $251
million for the six months ended June 30, 1998.  PSE&G paid common  dividends of
$251  million  to PSEG  during  the six  months  ended  June 30,  1998 and 1997,
respectively.  Due to the growth in Energy Holdings' investment  activities,  no
dividends on Energy  Holdings'  common stock were paid or anticipated in the six
months  ended June 30, 1998 and 1997 or are  anticipated  for the  remainder  of
1998.  Energy  Holdings  paid $6 million of dividends  related to its  preferred
stock issued to PSEG for the six months ended June 30, 1998. Energy Holdings had
no preferred  stock  outstanding in the period ended June 30, 1997.  Amounts and
dates of such  dividends  on Common  Stock as may be declared in the future will
necessarily be dependent upon PSEG's future earnings, financial requirements and
other factors including the receipt of dividend payments from its subsidiaries.

   PSEG and PSE&G,  respectively,  have issued Deferrable Interest  Subordinated
Debentures in connection  with the issuance of their  respective  tax deductible
preferred  securities.  If,  and for as long as,  payments  on those  Deferrable
Interest  Subordinated   Debentures  have  been  deferred,  or  PSEG  or  PSE&G,
respectively,  has  defaulted on an indenture  related  thereto or its guarantee
thereof,  neither  PSEG nor PSE&G,  respectively,  may pay any  dividends on its
common and preferred stock.

   As of June 30, 1998, PSEG's capital structure consisted of 48% common equity,
42% long-term debt and 10% preferred stock and other preferred securities.


<PAGE>


   As a  result  of the 1992  focused  audit of  PSEG's  non-utility  businesses
(Focused Audit),  the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) approved a plan
which,  among  other  things,  provides  that:  (1) PSEG will not permit  Energy
Holdings'  non-utility  investments to exceed 20% of PSEG's  consolidated assets
without  prior  notice  to the BPU  (such  investments  at June  30,  1998  were
approximately  17% of assets);  (2) the PSE&G Board of Directors will provide an
annual  certification  that the business and financing  plans of Energy Holdings
will not adversely  affect PSE&G;  (3) PSEG will (a) limit debt supported by the
minimum net worth maintenance agreement between PSEG and Capital to $750 million
and (b) make a  good-faith  effort to  eliminate  such support over a six to ten
year  period  from  April  1993;  and (4)  Energy  Holdings  will  pay  PSE&G an
affiliation  fee of up to $2 million a year to be applied by PSE&G  through  its
LGAC and its LEAC to reduce utility rates. Beginning in 1995, the debt supported
by such minimum net worth maintenance  agreement was limited to $650 million and
the affiliation fee has been  proportionately  reduced as such supported debt is
reduced.  PSEG and Energy  Holdings and its  subsidiaries  continue to reimburse
PSE&G for the cost of all services provided to them by employees of PSE&G.

   As a result  of PSEG's  intent  that  Energy  Holdings  and its  subsidiaries
provide  growth  vehicles for PSEG,  financing  requirements  connected with the
continued  growth of Energy Holdings,  changes to the utility industry  expected
from the final  outcome of the Energy  Master  Plan  proceedings  and  potential
accounting  impacts  resulting  from  the  deregulation  of  the  generation  of
electricity,  modifications  will be  required  to certain  of the  restrictions
agreed to by PSEG with the BPU in response to the Focused  Audit.  Inability  to
achieve  satisfactory  resolution  of these  matters  could  impact  the  future
relative size and financing of Energy  Holdings and  accordingly,  PSEG's future
prospects,  including  financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash
flows (see Note 2. Rate Matters of Notes).

   PSE&G

   For the six months ended June 30, 1998,  PSE&G had utility  plant  additions,
including  Allowance for Funds Used During  Construction of $196 million,  a $41
million decrease from the corresponding  1997 period. The decrease was primarily
due to the replacement of Salem 1 steam  generators in 1997.  PSE&G expects that
it will be able to generate  all of its  construction  and capital  requirements
over the next five years  internally,  assuming  adequate and timely recovery of
costs,  as to which no  assurances  can be given  (see Note 2. Rate  Matters  of
Notes).

   PSEG Energy Holdings Inc.

   In June and July 1998,  PSEG  invested  $147  million and $145  million,  the
proceeds of the sale of Capital  Securities and Trust  Securities  (see External
Financings),  in Energy Holdings, which issued to PSEG like amounts of its 4.80%
and 4.875% Cumulative  Preferred Stock and made additional equity investments in
Global and Resources.

   In April 1998,  Resources closed on its investment in the lease of a domestic
gas-fired steam electric  generating  station to a domestic utility.  Resource's
equity investment was approximately $39 million.

   In May 1998,  Global  sold its 50%  interests  in two  domestic  cogeneration
plants,  resulting in proceeds to Energy Holdings of $70 million, which resulted
in an after-tax gain of approximately $5 million.

   In June 1998,  Enterprise Group Development  Corporation  (EGDC) sold its 75%
interest in one of its properties for  approximately $5 million,  resulting in a
minimal loss which had been previously reserved through a valuation allowance.

   In July 1998,  Resources purchased a 33.3% interest in a leveraged lease of a
natural gas-fired generating station in the United Kingdom for approximately $40
million.

   For a  discussion  of the  source of Energy  Holdings'  funds,  see  External
Financings.  Over the next several years,  Energy Holdings and its  subsidiaries
will be required to refinance  their maturing debt and provide  additional  debt
and equity  financing for growth.  Any inability to obtain  required  additional
external  capital  or  to  extend  or  replace  maturing  debt  and/or  existing
agreements at current levels and interest rates may affect future earnings.

External Financings

   PSEG

   On June 30,  1998,  PSEG had a $25 million line of credit with a bank with no
debt  outstanding  under this line of  credit.  Also,  at that date,  PSEG had a
committed $150 million  revolving credit facility which expires in December 2002
with no debt outstanding under this facility.

   In June  1998,  Enterprise  Capital  Trust  II, a special  purpose  statutory
business  trust  controlled  by PSEG,  issued $150 million of its Floating  Rate
Capital  Securities,  Series B.  Proceeds were lent to PSEG and are evidenced by
its deferrable interest subordinated debentures.  PSEG used the proceeds to make
a $147 million  preferred equity  investment in Energy Holdings.  The debentures
and their related  indenture  constitute a full and  unconditional  guarantee by
PSEG of the preferred  securities  issued by the trust.  If, and for as long as,
payments on PSEG's  debentures have been deferred,  or PSEG has defaulted on the
indenture  related  thereto  or its  guarantee  thereof,  PSEG  may  not pay any
dividends on its Common Stock (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- PSEG). At
the time of issuance,  PSEG's floating rate obligation  under its debentures was
swapped for a fixed rate payment  resulting  in an  effective  rate of 7.2% (see
Note 5. Financial Instruments and Risk Management of Notes).

   In July 1998,  Enterprise  Capital  Trust III,  a special  purpose  statutory
business  trust  controlled  by PSEG,  issued  $150  million of its 7.25%  Trust
Originated  Preferred  Securities,  Series C. Proceeds were lent to PSEG and are
evidenced by its  deferrable  interest  subordinated  debentures.  PSEG used the
proceeds to make a $145 million  preferred equity investment in Energy Holdings.
The debentures and their related  indenture  constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by PSEG of the preferred  securities  issued by the trust. If, and for
as long as,  payments  on  PSEG's  debentures  have been  deferred,  or PSEG has
defaulted on the indenture  related thereto or its guarantee  thereof,  PSEG may
not pay any dividends on its Common Stock (see  Liquidity and Capital  Resources
- -- PSEG).

   As  previously  disclosed,  both  PSEG  and  PSE&G  have  issued  a total  of
approximately  $525  million  and  $513  million,  respectively,  of  deferrable
interest  subordinated  debentures  which are  treated as debt to the issuer for
Federal income tax purposes and as preferred equity for financial accounting and
rating  agency  purposes.  In a case not involving  PSEG or PSE&G,  the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow  interest  deductions  claimed by
Enron Corp. (Enron) on two issues of similar long-term subordinated  debentures.
That issue is now in litigation (Enron Corp. v.  Commissioner,  Tax Court Docket
No.  6149-98).  There  can be no  assurance  that  Enron  will  prevail  in this
litigation  if it is not  settled  or,  if  Enron  does  prevail,  that  the IRS
nevertheless  may seek to disallow the deductions that PSEG and PSE&G have taken
and will claim for interest paid on such  debentures.  The  annualized  interest
expense for these  debentures for PSEG and PSE&G together is  approximately  $82
million.  In total for 1994 through 1997, PSEG and PSE&G took  approximately $89
million in interest deductions for these debentures,  which equates to about $31
million in tax  benefits.  If challenged by the IRS, PSEG and PSE&G would expect
to  vigorously  defend  the  deductibility  of the  interest  payments  taken as
deductions  on  previously  filed  Federal  tax  returns.  In the  event  of the
occurrence  of a Tax Event as defined in the  respective  debenture  indentures,
such  as the  receipt  of an  opinion  of  counsel  that  there  is a more  than
insubstantial  risk that  interest  payable  on the  debentures  will not be tax
deductible, PSEG and PSE&G have the right to redeem the preferred securities and
issue the  debentures to the preferred  securities  holders or to refinance such
obligations as allowed in the respective debenture indentures.

   PSE&G

   PSE&G has received  authority  from the BPU,  through  December 31, 1998,  to
opportunistically  refinance essentially all of its long-term debt and to refund
up to $250 million of matured debt.

   Under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage),  PSE&G may issue new First
and Refunding Mortgage Bonds (Bonds) against previous additions and improvements
and/or  retired Bonds provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges is at
least 2:1. At June 30,  1998,  the  coverage  ratio under  PSE&G's  Mortgage was
3.66:1. As of June 30, 1998, the Mortgage would permit up to approximately  $3.5
billion  aggregate  principal  amount of new Bonds to be issued against previous
additions and improvements.

   In April 1998, $8 million of PSE&G's 7.50% Bonds,  Series OO, were  purchased
in the open market. On August 3, 1998, the remaining outstanding $234 million of
the Series OO Bonds were redeemed.

   In May 1998,  PSE&G sold $250 million of its Bonds,  Remarketable  Series YY,
due 2023,  Mandatorily  Tendered 2008. The Series YY Bonds will bear interest at
the rate of 6.375%  per annum  until May 1,  2008.  PSE&G  also  entered  into a
Remarketing Agreement with a third party that granted the third party the option
to call and remarket the Series YY Bonds on May 1, 2008 for the  remaining  term
of the Series YY Bonds. If not called by the third party,  the Bonds must be put
by the holders to PSE&G.  The proceeds of the sale were used primarily to redeem
PSE&G's Series OO Bonds.

   On July 1, 1998, $18 million of PSE&G's 6% Debenture Bonds matured.

   To provide  liquidity  for its  commercial  paper  program,  PSE&G has a $650
million  revolving  credit  agreement  expiring in June 1999 and a $650  million
revolving  credit  agreement  expiring  in June 2002 with a group of  commercial
banks,  which provide for borrowings of up to one year. On June 30, 1998,  there
were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.

   The BPU has  authorized  PSE&G to issue and have  outstanding at any one time
through  January 2, 1999, not more than $1.3 billion of short-term  obligations,
consisting of commercial  paper and other  unsecured  borrowings  from banks and
other  lenders.  On June 30,  1998,  PSE&G had $888 million of  short-term  debt
outstanding,  including $124 million borrowed against its uncommitted bank lines
of credit which lines of credit totaled $250 million at June 30, 1998.

   PSE&G Fuel Corporation  (Fuelco),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PSE&G, has a
$125  million  commercial  paper  program to finance  its 42.49%  share of Peach
Bottom  nuclear  fuel,  which  program is supported by a $125 million  revolving
credit  facility  expiring on June 28, 2001.  PSE&G has guaranteed  repayment of
Fuelco's  obligations  under  this  program.  At June 30,  1998,  Fuelco had $67
million of commercial paper outstanding under this program.

   PSEG Energy Holdings Inc.

   At  June  30,  1998,  PSEG  Capital  Corporation  (Capital),  a  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Energy  Holdings,  had total debt  outstanding  of $596  million,
including  $573  million of Medium  Term Notes  (MTNs) and $23 million of Senior
Notes. In July 1998, $75 million of Capital's 9.00% MTNs matured. As a result of
the  Focused  Audit,  Capital  debt is being  phased  out over a six to ten year
period from April 1993 (see Liquidity and Capital Resources).

   As of June 30, 1998,  Enterprise  Capital Funding  Corporation  (Funding),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of Energy  Holdings,  had $300 million and $150 million
revolving   credit   facilities   expiring  in  July  1999  and  November  1998,
respectively,  with two  groups  of banks  under  which  facilities  no debt was
outstanding.  On June 1, 1998,  $83 million of  Funding's  Series E 9.95% Senior
Notes  matured.  Funding  had  $45  million  of  privately-placed  Senior  Notes
outstanding  as of June 30, 1998. As of June 30, 1998,  Funding had $159 million
of total debt outstanding.

   Energy Holdings, Resources and Global are subject to restrictive business and
financial  covenants  contained in existing debt agreements.  Energy Holdings is
required  to  maintain  a debt to  equity  ratio of no more  than  2.00:1  and a
twelve-months  earnings  before  interest and taxes to interest  (EBIT) coverage
ratio  of  at  least  1.50:1.  As  of  June  30,  1998,  Energy  Holdings  had a
consolidated  debt to equity ratio of 1.00:1.  For the twelve  months ended June
30, 1998,  the EBIT coverage  ratio,  as defined to exclude the effects of EGDC,
was 2.61:1.  Compliance  with  applicable  financial  covenants will depend upon
future financial  position and levels of earnings,  as to which no assurance can
be given. In addition, Energy Holdings' ability to continue to grow its business
will depend to a significant  degree on PSEG's and Energy  Holdings'  ability to
obtain  additional  financing  beyond  current levels (see Liquidity and Capital
Resources).

Nuclear Operations

   As previously reported,  PSE&G's Salem Units 1 and 2 (Salem 1 and 2) returned
to service on April 17,  1998 and August  30,  1997,  respectively.  On June 30,
1998, the Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission (NRC) closed its  Confirmatory  Action
Letter (CAL)  concerning  Salem noting that all  commitments of the CAL had been
satisfactorily addressed. For a discussion of the operating performance standard
applicable to Salem,  see Note 4.  Commitments  and  Contingent  Liabilities  of
Notes.

   At the July 1998 semi-annual NRC Senior Management  Meeting,  the NRC removed
Salem 1 and 2 from  the NRC  Watch  List.  The NRC  noted  that  plant  material
condition,  safety  culture  and  management  oversight  and  effectiveness  had
substantially  improved.  The NRC also  observed  that,  while  the  maintenance
backlog  resulting from discovery  efforts during the outage remains high, PSE&G
is  effectively  managing  the  prioritization  and  resolution  of those items.
Additionally,  the NRC noted that PSE&G's  management team has instituted robust
safety oversight and self-assessment at the site and that Salem has demonstrated
sustained successful plant performance.

Competitive Environment

   Rate Matters

   For discussions of the New Jersey Energy Master Plan,  non-utility generation
buydown,  the LGAC,  the Gas  Unbundling  Pilot Program,  the  LEAC/Demand  Side
Adjustment Factor,  the RAC and other rate matters,  see Note 2. Rate Matters of
Notes. The outcome of these  proceedings could have a material adverse impact on
PSEG's and  PSE&G's  financial  condition,  results of  operations  and net cash
flows.

   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 888 (Order No. 888)

   As  previously  reported,  numerous  parties,  including  PSE&G,  have  filed
petitions for judicial review of Orders No. 888, 888A and 888B before the Courts
of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Second Circuits.  In March 1998,
all of these appeals were  consolidated in the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  On April 30, 1998, the D.C. Circuit entered
an order  permitting  certain  additional  parties to intervene and establishing
certain procedural guidelines for the hearing of these appeals.

   Pennsylvania--New Jersey--Maryland Interconnection (PJM)

   Effective April 1, 1998, PJM implemented  locational  marginal  pricing (LMP)
for congestion costs within the PJM control area pursuant to FERC  requirements.
LMP provides for an allocation of congestion costs to transmission  users within
the PJM control area.  Sufficient data is not yet available to determine whether
LMP will  ultimately  result  in  increases  or  decreases  in  PSE&G's  cost of
Interchanged Power and Fuel for Electric Generation or whether such increases or
decreases will be material.

     Currently, the PJM Operating Agreement dictates that energy sold in the PJM
interchange  energy market from  generation  located within the PJM control area
shall not exceed the variable cost of producing such energy.  Transactions  that
are bid into the PJM pool from  generation  located outside the PJM control area
are  capped  at $1,000  per  megawatt  hour.  In the  event  that all  available
generation  within the PJM control area is  insufficient  to cover  demand,  PJM
could institute  emergency  purchases from adjoining  regions.  The cost of such
emergency  purchases is dependent upon market  conditions and not subject to any
PJM price cap.  Certain of the PJM member  companies  have requested the FERC to
revise the PJM Operating  Agreement to allow  submission of market based bids to
the PJM interchange energy market.  PSEG and PSE&G cannot predict the outcome of
this  request or the impact on PSEG's and PSE&G's  future  financial  condition,
results of  operations  and net cash flows if such  request is  successful.  For
further  discussion of price volatility of electricity,  see Item 3. Qualitative
and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Future Outlook

   PSEG continues to pursue its  strategies to grow its business.  As previously
reported,  more emphasis will be placed on finding  opportunities  for expansion
outside of traditional utility services and markets. PSE&G's strategy is to size
its electric generation fleet in New Jersey to meet its anticipated needs, while
seeking to increase its value through wholesale trading. PSE&G will also seek to
capitalize  on  synergies  which may exist with its natural gas  purchasing  and
trading activities. PSE&G's transmission and distribution strategy, both gas and
electric, is to provide cost-effective,  high quality service, while considering
opportunities  for expansion of this  business  through  business  combinations.
Global's  strategy  is  to  invest  in  both  generation  and  transmission  and
distribution  facilities  worldwide with the goal of creating  long-term  value.
Resources' strategy is to continue focusing on passive investments in the energy
sector  worldwide  seeking  to  provide  earnings  and  economic  value.  Energy
Technologies'  strategy is to expand upon the current energy related services it
provides to industrial and commercial customers to create long-term value.

   Successful implementation of these strategies, coupled with the restructuring
of the electric industry,  could significantly  change PSEG's earnings mix. Most
significant  among  the  changes  would be the shift in  earnings  away from the
domestic generation business into the international generation, transmission and
distribution  businesses,  and to a  lesser  extent,  into the  energy  services
business.

Forward Looking Statements

   The Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995 (the Act)  provides a
"safe  harbor" for  forward-looking  statements  to encourage  such  disclosures
without the threat of litigation  providing  those  statements are identified as
forward-looking  and  are  accompanied  by  meaningful,   cautionary  statements
identifying  important  factors  that could  cause the actual  results to differ
materially  from those  projected in the statement.  Forward-looking  statements
have been made in this report. Such statements are based on management's beliefs
as  well  as  assumptions  made  by  and  information   currently  available  to
management.  When used  herein,  the  words  "will",  "anticipate",  "estimate",
"expect", "objective",  "hypothetical",  "potential" and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking  statements. In addition to any assumptions
and  other  factors   referred  to   specifically   in   connection   with  such
forward-looking  statements,  factors that could cause actual  results to differ
materially from those contemplated in any  forward-looking  statements  include,
among others, the following:  deregulation and the unbundling of energy supplies
and services;  an increasingly  competitive energy marketplace;  sales retention
and growth potential in a mature service  territory and a need to contain costs;
ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief, cost recovery,  including the
potential  impact of stranded costs, and other necessary  regulatory  approvals;
Federal  and  State  regulatory  actions;   costs  of  construction;   operating
restrictions;   increased  cost  and   construction   delays   attributable   to
environmental  regulations;  nuclear  decommissioning  and the  availability  of
reprocessing  and storage  facilities  for spent  nuclear  fuel;  licensing  and
regulatory approval necessary for nuclear and other operating  stations;  market
risk;  and credit  market  concerns.  PSEG and PSE&G  undertake no obligation to
publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new  information,  future events or otherwise.  The foregoing  review of factors
pursuant to the Act should not be construed as  exhaustive  or as any  admission
regarding  the  adequacy  of  disclosures  made by PSEG and  PSE&G  prior to the
effective date of the Act.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Commodities

   The availability and price of energy  commodities are subject to fluctuations
from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in demand, changes
in supply and state and Federal regulatory policies. To reduce price risk caused
by market fluctuations, PSE&G enters into physical forward and options contracts
and financial  derivatives including forwards,  futures,  swaps and options with
approved  counterparties,  to hedge its anticipated demand. These contracts,  in
conjunction  with owned  electric  generating  capacity,  are  designed to cover
estimated electric and gas customer commitments. Gains and losses resulting from
physical forward and options contracts and financial  derivatives are recognized
as a component  of fuel revenue and expense  upon  maturity of these  contracts.
Additionally,  PSE&G enters into physical forward and options contracts that are
speculative in nature which are  immaterial to PSE&G's  market  portfolio and do
not have a material impact on PSE&G's financial condition, results of operations
and net cash flows.

   PSE&G uses a  value-at-risk  model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load   requirements,   physical   contracts  and  financial   derivative
instruments.   Value-at-risk  represents  the  potential  gains  or  losses  for
instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time
period and confidence level. PSE&G estimates  value-at-risk across its commodity
business  using a model  with  historical  volatilities  and  correlations.  The
measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 97.5 percent
confidence  level  and  assuming  a one  week  horizon  at  June  30,  1998  was
approximately $18 million.  PSE&G's calculated value-at-risk exposure represents
an estimate of potential net losses that could be recognized on its portfolio of
physical and financial  derivative  instruments assuming historical movements in
future market rates. These estimates, however, are not necessarily indicative of
actual results which may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ
from those historical  estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates,
operating exposures, and the timing thereof, and changes in PSE&G's portfolio of
hedging instruments during the year.

   PSE&G is generally in a short (or deficit)  position when  comparing  average
on-peak demand to its average  expected  economic  generating  capability.  As a
result of  unseasonably  warm  weather  increasing  the demand for  electricity,
coupled with scheduled and unscheduled  generating  plant outages in the Midwest
in June 1998,  forward prices of electricity rose to  unprecedented  high levels
for the summer months of 1998 and 1999. In addition,  the volatility  factor for
those months increased sharply.  The value-at-risk at June 30, 1998 increased by
approximately  $11 million from  December 31, 1997 due to the large net long (or
surplus) position (created by anticipated economic generation) multiplied by the
increased volatility rate.

   As discussed in Results of Operations of Item 2. Management's  Discussion and
Analysis,  energy trading operations at PSE&G positively impacted the results of
operations  for the six months ended June 30, 1998.  Other  utilities  and power
marketers have experienced significant losses in their energy trading operations
during that period.  These losses were primarily  attributable  to  counterparty
defaults as a result of extreme market volatility, as noted above.

   PSEG  is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event  of  non-performance  or
non-payment by counterparties.  PSEG has a Risk Management  Committee made up of
executive  officers and an independent  risk  oversight  function to enhance its
risk management  practices.  PSEG also has a credit management  process which is
used to assess,  monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure for PSE&G and Energy
Holdings.  In the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by a major counterparty,
there  may  be a  material  adverse  impact  on  PSEG's  and  PSE&G's  financial
conditions, results of operations and net cash flows.


   There  are no other  material  changes  in or  additions  to the  information
reported  in the PSEG and the PSE&G 1997  Annual  Report on Form 10-K  regarding
qualitative and  quantitative  disclosures  about market risk of PSEG, PSE&G and
their subsidiaries.

                            ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   Certain  information  reported  under  Item  3 of  Part I of  Public  Service
Enterprise  Group  Incorporated's  (PSEG) and Public  Service  Electric  and Gas
Company's  (PSE&G) 1997 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the  Quarterly  Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1998 is updated below.

  (1) Form 10-K, Pages 19-20. As previously reported,  PSE&G has been named as a
      potentially  responsible  party and alleged to be liable for contamination
      at the Metal Bank Cottman  Avenue  Superfund  Site,  a former  non-ferrous
      scrap reclamation  facility located in Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania.  PSE&G
      estimates that its share of the cost of performing the remedy  selected by
      the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) could be $4 to $8 million.
      On June 26,  1998,  EPA  Region  III  issued an  Administrative  Order For
      Remedial Design And Remedial Action, Docket No. III-98-082-DC, to thirteen
      Respondents  including  PSE&G,  other  utilities,  and other  persons  and
      entities, ordering the Respondents to implement the remedy selected in the
      Record of  Decision  (ROD)  issued by EPA  Region III in  December,  1997.
      Additionally,  with  respect  to this site,  on July 1,  1998,  the United
      States of America moved in the matter  entitled  United States of America,
      et. al., v. Union Corporation,  et. al., Civil Action No. 80-1589,  United
      States District Court for the Eastern  District of  Pennsylvania,  seeking
      leave  of court to file an  amended  complaint  adding  claims  under  the
      Federal Comprehensive  Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability
      Act of 1980  (CERCLA).  PSE&G  and  one  other  utility  are  third  party
      defendants in the foregoing  captioned matter. On July 28, 1998, PSE&G and
      seven  other  utilities  named  as  Respondents  in  the  above-referenced
      Administrative  Order  filed  with EPA  Region  III a Notice  of Intent to
      Comply With Administrative  Order for Remedial Design and Remedial Action,
      Metal Bank Cottman Avenue Site, Docket No. III-98-082-DC.

   (2)Form 10-K,  Page 27 and March 31, 1998 Form 10-Q,  Page 24. As  previously
      reported, in October 1995, PSEG received a letter from a representative of
      a purported  shareholder  demanding  that it commence legal action against
      certain of its officers and directors with regard to nuclear operations of
      Salem and Hope Creek Nuclear  Generating  Stations (Salem and Hope Creek).
      The Board of Directors promptly commenced an investigation and advised the
      purported  shareholder  thereof.  While the investigation was pending, the
      purported  shareholder  nevertheless  commenced,  by  complaint  filed  in
      December 1995, a shareholder  derivative action against the then incumbent
      directors,  except Dr. Remick. Similar derivative complaints were filed by
      two profit  sharing  plans and one  individual  in February and March 1996
      against Messrs. Ferland, Codey, Eliason and others. On March 19, 1996, the
      Board's  investigation  was concluded,  and the Board determined that this
      litigation  should not have been  instituted and should be terminated.  On
      July 3, 1996,  another  individual  purported  shareholder filed a similar
      complaint naming the same defendants as the first derivative lawsuit.  The
      four  complaints  generally  seek  recovery of damages for alleged  losses
      purportedly  arising  out of PSE&G's  operation  of Salem and Hope  Creek,
      together with certain other relief, including removal of certain executive
      officers  of PSE&G and PSEG and  certain  changes  in the  composition  of
      PSEG's  Board of  Directors.  On August 21,  1996,  all  defendants  filed
      motions to dismiss all four derivative actions,  which motions were denied
      and attempts to appeal were  unsuccessful.  Pursuant to a Court Order,  on
      December 31, 1997,  the defendants  filed motions for summary  judgment to
      dismiss two of the cases. In one of the other two cases,  separate motions
      for partial and complete  summary judgment were filed by the defendants on
      April 1, 1998. In the fourth case, on April 1, 1998 the defendants filed a
      motion for partial summary judgment. On May 21, 1998, the defendants filed
      additional  motions for complete  summary judgment in the third and fourth
      cases. All of these motions are pending.  By stipulation filed on June 15,
      1998,  the  individual  plaintiff  in the  action  filed in March 1996 was
      voluntarily  dismissed as a plaintiff in the action.  The outcome of these
      matters cannot be predicted.

   (3)Form 10-K, Page 45. As previously reported,  in October 1997, Old Dominion
      Electric  Cooperative  (ODEC)  filed a  complaint  at the  Federal  Energy
      Regulatory  Commission  (FERC)  seeking to modify its 1992  agreement with
      PSE&G for a ten year sale of 150  megawatts  of capacity  and  energy.  On
      August 4, 1998, FERC dismissed ODEC's complaint,  determining that certain
      issues   relating  to  rate   "pancaking"  for   transmission   were  more
      appropriately  addressed  in the pending  FERC docket  relating to the PJM
      Interconnection and that ODEC had failed to show it was entitled to relief
      on the remaining  issues.  PSE&G cannot  predict  whether ODEC will appeal
      this ruling or the final outcome of these proceedings.

 New Matter

   On June 25, 1998, a complaint was filed  against the  directors of PSEG,  and
PSEG as a  nominal  defendant,  by the same  purported  shareholder  of PSEG who
instituted  the December 1995  shareholder  derivative  suit,  alleging that the
1996, 1997 and 1998 proxy statements provided to shareholders of PSEG were false
and  misleading by reason,  among other things,  of failure to disclose  certain
material facts relating to (i) the controls over and oversight of PSEG's nuclear
operations,  (ii) the  condition  of problems at and  reserves  with  respect to
PSEG's  nuclear  operations,  (iii) a  demand  letter  relating  to an  earlier
shareholder derivative suit, (iv) PSEG's liabilities to the Salem co-owners as a
result  of the  shutdown  of the Salem  plants  and (v) a  shareholder  proposal
relating to  operations of Salem 1 and 2 which was voted upon at the 1998 annual
meeting of shareholders.  The complaint seeks to have declared illegal the 1996,
1997 and 1998  elections  of  directors  of PSEG,  the vote  upon a  stockholder
proposal at the 1998 annual meeting, ratification of the selection of Deloitte &
Touche as PSEG's auditors at those annual meetings,  requiring PSEG to conduct a
special  meeting of shareholders  providing for election of directors  following
timely  dissemination  of a proxy  statement  approved by the court hearing this
matter,  which will include as nominees for election as directors persons having
no previous  relationship  with PSEG or the current  directors and other relief.
PSEG is currently  reviewing the  complaint.  PSEG cannot predict the outcome of
this matter.  G.E. Stricklin v. E. James Ferland,  et al, United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 98-3279.

                            ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

   Certain  information  reported under PSEG's and PSE&G's 1997 Annual and March
31, 1998  Quarterly  Report to the SEC is updated  below.  References are to the
related  pages of the Form  10-K and the  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 1998 as printed and distributed.

Discretionary Proxy Voting Authority

   New Matter

   The SEC has recently  amended its proxy rules regarding use of  discretionary
voting authority with respect to certain shareholder  proposals.  If PSEG is not
notified by January  23,  1999 of any  proposal  intended  to be  presented  for
consideration at the 1999 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, then the proxies named
by PSEG management with respect to the meeting shall have  discretionary  voting
authority with respect to such proposal if presented at the meeting.

Credit Ratings

   Form 10-K, Page 5

   During the second quarter of 1998, Standard and Poor's,  Moody's and Duff and
Phelps  reconfirmed  the credit  ratings for PSEG and PSE&G as  disclosed in the
1997 Form 10-K.  Additionally,  Moody's  changed  its outlook  from  negative to
stable.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

   Form 10-K, Page 12

   As  previously  reported,  in  accordance  with the Nuclear  Waste Policy Act
(NWPA), PSE&G has entered into contracts with the Department of Energy (DOE) for
the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  Payments made to the DOE for disposal costs
are based on nuclear  generation and are included in Interchanged Power and Fuel
for  Electric  Generation  in the  Statements  of Income.  These costs are being
recovered through the LEAC (see Note 2. Rate Matters of Notes).

   DOE construction of a permanent  disposal  facility has not begun and DOE has
announced  that it does not expect a facility to be available  until 2010 at the
earliest.  Accordingly,  legislation  which  would  have  the  DOE  establish  a
centralized interim spent fuel storage facility has been introduced in Congress.
In  cases  brought  by  PSE&G,  40 other  utilities  and many  state  and  local
governments,  the United  States  Court of Appeals for the  District of Columbia
Circuit reaffirmed DOE's unconditional obligation to begin spent fuel acceptance
by January 31, 1998.  In November  1997,  the court ruled that the utilities had
fulfilled  their  obligations  under  their  respective  contracts  with  DOE by
contributing  to the Nuclear  Waste  Fund.  The court  further  ruled that DOE's
argument of unavoidable delay to meet its obligation was without merit. However,
the court did not order DOE to  commence  spent fuel  acceptance  by January 31,
1998;  instead,  it decided that the standard  contract  provided a  potentially
adequate remedy in the form of payment of damages if DOE failed its obligations.
In May 1998 the court denied a petition by PSE&G, 40 other  utilities,  and many
states  and  state  agencies  to  order  DOE  to  begin  spent  fuel  acceptance
immediately  and declare that the  utilities are allowed to escrow their Nuclear
Waste Fund fees until DOE begins spent fuel acceptance. Following this decision,
DOE  proposed  a  settlement  of  issues  related  to its  failure  to meet  its
obligation,  which the utilities  unanimously  rejected.  PSE&G is continuing to
work with the utility industry to develop a methodology for determining  damages
incurred as a result of DOE's failure to meet its  obligation and a strategy for
its implementation.  PSE&G is presently studying options to recover damages from
DOE. No assurances  can be given as to the ultimate  availability  of a disposal
facility.

Nuclear Operations

   Form 10-K, Page 8

   On June 8, 1998, the NRC issued its latest Systematic  Assessment of Licensee
Performance (SALP) Report for Hope Creek for the period November 10, 1996 to May
16, 1998. In the areas of Operations,  Maintenance and  Engineering,  Hope Creek
was rated Category 2 or "good" performance.  In the area of Plant Support,  Hope
Creek  received a  "superior",  or Category 1,  rating.  The NRC noted  improved
performance in all functional areas during the period,  with marked  improvement
in the Plant  Support  area,  particularly  concerning  security  and  emergency
preparedness.  The NRC also noted that although several human performance issues
associated with procedure violations, attention to detail and work controls were
evident  during  the fall 1997  outage,  operation  since  then has been  nearly
event-free.

   On July 29, 1998,  the NRC notified PSE&G that Salem 1 and 2 had been removed
from the NRC's Watch List (see Item 2.  Management's  Discussion and Analysis --
Nuclear Operations).

   Form 10-K, Page 10

   PECO Energy has advised PSE&G that the NRC held a  predecisional  enforcement
conference on May 21, 1998 to discuss two apparent violations concerning failure
to maintain  the  operability  of a Peach  Bottom Unit 3 emergency  core cooling
system pump. On June 11, 1998,  the NRC issued an aggregate  Level III violation
and a civil penalty of $55,000. PECO will not dispute the violation.

Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW)

   Form 10-K, Page 12 and March 31, 1998 Form 10-Q, Page 27

   As a by-product of their  operations,  nuclear  generating  units,  including
those in which PSE&G owns an interest,  produce LLRW. Such wastes include paper,
plastics, protective clothing, water purification materials and other materials.
LLRW  materials are  accumulated  on site and disposed of at licensed  permanent
disposal facilities in Barnwell, South Carolina and Clive, Utah.

   PECO Energy has advised PSE&G that on June 18, 1998, the  Appalachian  States
LLRW Compact Commission unanimously agreed to suspend efforts to site a radwaste
storage facility in Pennsylvania.  The Secretary of the Pennsylvania  Department
of Environmental Protection had suggested ending the search due to the declining
amounts of radwaste  produced by  hospitals,  nuclear  power plants and research
facilities.  The other compact  members  (Delaware,  Maryland and West Virginia)
have asked  Pennsylvania  to make  provisions to resume the search if conditions
change.

Other State Regulatory Matters

   Form 10-K, Page 4 and March 31, 1998 Form 10-Q, Page 27

   As previously  reported,  on December 3, 1997 one of the interstate  pipeline
companies from which PSE&G obtains  service filed a declaratory  judgment action
with FERC  challenging  PSE&G's  interpretation  of the capacity  release rules.
Under the  interpretation  proposed by the interstate  pipeline  company,  PSE&G
would be required to guarantee the  performance of Public Service Energy Trading
Company  (PSETC) under the  transferred  agreements.  PSE&G disagreed with these
claims and filed a protest  challenging the December 3, 1997 filing. On February
11, 1998, FERC ruled in favor of the interstate pipeline company finding that it
was not unreasonable for the pipeline company to refuse to discharge PSE&G under
the  circumstances  addressed in the order.  On April 29,  1998,  FERC issued an
order on rehearing in which it denied PSE&G's  request for a rehearing.  On June
26, 1998,  PSE&G filed a petition for review of FERC's order with the U.S. Court
of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.

Air Pollution Control

   Form 10-K, Page 15

     As previously  reported,  in September 1997, the NJDEP proposed regulations
implementing a memorandum of understanding  among 11 Northeastern states and the
District of Columbia,  establishing  a regional  plan for reducing NOx emissions
from utility and large  industrial  boilers.  In June 1998,  NJDEP adopted final
regulations  implementing a NOx budget program and establishing the formulas for
NOx allocations. The extent of investment in control technologies or operational
changes  required to comply with these  regulations  will be directly related to
the number of allowances  PSE&G  receives.  PSE&G does not expect to receive its
final NOx  budget  allocation  under the rule until  early 1999 and thus  cannot
access the potential costs at this time, but such costs could be material.

                            Distributions; Redemption

Section 4.01. Distributions.

     (a)  Distributions on the Trust  Securities  shall be cumulative,  and will
accumulate whether or not there are funds of the Trust available for the payment
of Distributions.  Distributions shall accumulate from June 26, 1998 and, except
during an Extension Period for the Debentures  pursuant to the Indenture,  shall
be payable quarterly in arrears and reset on March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 31 of each year, commencing on September 30, 1998. If any date on which
Distributions  are otherwise  payable on the Trust  Securities is not a Business
Day, then the payment of such Distributions shall be made on the next succeeding
day which is a  Business  Day (and  without  any  interest  or other  payment in
respect of any such  delay),  except that,  if such  Business Day is in the next
succeeding  calendar year,  payment of such  Distributions  shall be made on the
immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect
as if made on such  date  (each  date on  which  Distributions  are  payable  in
accordance with this Section  4.01(a) is referred to as a "Distribution  Date").
Except as otherwise  permitted by Section  4.02(b)(v)  hereof,  Distributions in
arrears after the quarterly  payment date therefor shall  accumulate  additional
Distributions  (to the extent  permitted  by law)  compounded  quarterly  at the
Distribution Rate (as defined herein). The term "Distributions," as used herein,
shall include any such additional Distributions.
<PAGE>
     Within two Business Days after receipt by the Property Trustee of notice of
an  Extension  Period  pursuant to Section 4.01 of the  Indenture,  the Property
Trustee shall give notice  thereof to the  Securityholders  by first class mail,
postage prepaid.

     (b) The Trust Securities  represent undivided  beneficial  interests in the
Trust Property, and, subject to Sections 4.03 and 4.06 hereof, all Distributions
will be made  pro rata on each of the  Trust  Securities.  Distributions  on the
Trust  Securities  shall be at a  floating  rate  per  annum,  reset  quarterly,
determined by reference to 3-Month LIBOR, as described herein,  plus a margin of
1.22%.  "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank  offered rate for three-month
U.S.  dollar  deposits  and with  respect  to any  Distribution  Period  will be
calculated  by First  Union  National  Bank or any  successor  appointed  by the
Depositor as Calculation  Agent, as permitted by the Indenture (the "Calculation
Agent") as follows:

          (i)  On the  second  Market  Day  (as  defined  below)  preceding  the
               commencement of such Distribution  Period (each, a "Determination
               Date"),  3-Month  LIBOR  will be  determined  on the basis of the
               offered rate for deposits of not less than U.S.  $1,000,000 for a
               period of three months (the "Index Maturity"), commencing on such
               Market Day, which appears on the display  designated as Page 3750
               on the Dow  Jones  Markets  Limited  (or such  other  page as may
               replace Page 3750 on that service (or any successor  service) for
               the purpose of displaying London interbank offered rates of major
               banks)  ("Telerate  Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m.,  London time on
               such Market Day. If no such offered rate  appears,  3-Month LIBOR
               with respect to such  Distribution  Period will be  determined as
               described in (ii) below.

               The  term  "Distribution  Period"  means  each  period  beginning
               on, and  including, the date  of original issuance and ending on,
               but  excluding,  the first Distribution  Date and each successive
               period, so beginning on  an Distribution Date and  so ending  on,
               but excluding, the next successive Distribution Date.

          (ii) With  respect to a  Determination  Date on which no such  offered
               rate  appears on Telerate  Page 3750 as  described  in (i) above,
               3-Month  LIBOR  shall  be the  arithmetic  mean,  expressed  as a
               percentage, of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars for
               the Index  Maturity  which  appears on the display  designated as
               "LIBO" on the Reuter  Monitor Money Market Rates Service (or such
               other page as may replace  the LIBO page on that  service (or any
               successor service) for the purpose of displaying London interbank
               offered rates of major banks)  ("Reuters Screen LIBO Page") as of
               11:00 a.m.,  London time,  on such Market Day. If, in turn,  such
               rate is not  displayed  on the  Reuters  Screen LIBO Page at such
               time,  the  Calculation  Agent  will  obtain  from  each  of four
               reference banks in London selected by the Calculation  Agent (the
               "Reference Banks") such bank's offered quotation  (expressed as a
               percentage  per annum) as of  approximately  11:00  a.m.,  London
<PAGE>
               time,  on such Market Day for  deposits  in U.S.  dollars for the
               Index Maturity to prime banks in the London interbank  market. If
               two or more such  quotations  are  provided  as  requested,  then
               3-Month LIBOR for such Maturity Day shall be the arithmetic  mean
               of such  quotations.  If, in turn, fewer than two such quotations
               are provided as requested,  then 3-Month LIBOR for such date will
               be obtained from the  preceding  Market Day for which the Reuters
               Screen LIBO Page  displayed  an offered rate for deposits in U.S.
               dollars for the Index Maturity.

          (iii)If on any  Determination  Date, the Calculation Agent is required
               but unable to determine  3-Month LIBOR in the manner  provided in
               paragraphs   (i)  and  (ii)   above,   3-Month   LIBOR  for  such
               Distribution  Period shall be 3-Month  LIBOR as determined on the
               immediately preceeding Determination Date.

               The term  "Market Day" means any day on which  commercial  banks
               and  foreign  exchange  markets are open  for business (including
               dealings in  foreign  exchange and foreign currency  deposits) in
               The City of New York and The City of London.

          (iv) The Distribution Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time
               be higher than the maximum rate then permitted by applicable law.

          (v)  All percentages resulting from any calculations referred provided
               for herein will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 1/100 of 1%
               and all  U.S.  dollar  amounts  used in or  resulting  from  such
               calculations  will be rounded to the nearest cent (with  one-half
               cent or more being rounded upwards).

          (vi) During an Extension Period for the Debentures, the rate per annum
               at which  Distributions on the Trust Securities  accumulate shall
               be  increased  by an  amount  such that the  aggregate  amount of
               Distributions  that accumulate on all Trust Securities during any
               such  Extension  Period  is  equal  to the  aggregate  amount  of
               interest  (including  interest  payable on unpaid interest at the
               rate per  annum  set  forth  above,  compounded  quarterly)  that
               accrues during any such Extension Period on the Debentures.

          (vii)The Calculation  Agent shall, as soon as practicable  after 11:00
               a.m.,  London time,  on each  Determination  Date,  determine the
               Distribution  Rate and  calculate  the  amount  of  Distributions
               payable  in respect of the  Distribution  Period  related to such
               Determination Date (the "Distribution  Amount"). The Distribution
               Amount shall be calculated by applying the  Distribution  Rate to
               the liquidation amount of each Trust Security  outstanding at the
               commencement of the  Distribution  Period,  multiplying each such
               amount  by  the   actual   number  of  days  in  the   applicable
               Distribution  Period  divided by 360 and  rounding to the nearest
               cent (with  one-half  cent or more being  rounded  upwards).  The
               determination  of the  Distribution  Rate  and  the  Distribution
               Amount by the  Calculation  Agent will (in the absence of willful
<PAGE>
               default,  bad faith or manifest  error) be final,  conclusive and
               binding on all  concerned.  None of the  Trustees,  the Debenture
               Trustee,  the Calculation  Agent,  the Trust or the Depositor (or
               any   of   their   respective   officers,    directors,   agents,
               beneficiaries,  employees or affiliates) shall have any liability
               to any person for (a) the selection of any Reference  Bank or (b)
               any  inability  to retain  major  banks in the  London  interbank
               market, in the case of the Calculation  Agent, which is caused by
               circumstances beyond its reasonable control.

          (viii) The  Calculation  Agent will cause the  Distribution  Rate, the
               Distribution  Amount in respect of each  Trust  Security  and the
               Distribution Date for each Distribution Period to be given to the
               Property Trustee,  the Debenture Trustee, the Company and each of
               the Paying Agents appointed by the Trust in relation to the Trust
               Securities,  in  each  case  as soon  as  practicable  after  the
               determination  thereof  but in no event  later  than  the  second
               Business Day of the applicable  Distribution Period. The Property
               Trustee will cause the Distribution Rate, the Distribution Amount
               in respect of each Trust Security and the  Distribution  Date for
               each  Distribution  Period  to be given to each  Holder  of Trust
               Securities  at the  address  of  such  Holder  set  forth  in the
               Securities Register with respect to the Trust Securities. So long
               as the Trust  Securities are  represented by global  certificates
               registered  in the name of DTC or its  nominees,  notices  to the
               Holders  of Trust  Securities  will be given by  delivery  of the
               notice to DTC for  communication  by DTC to its  participants  in
               accordance with its customary procedures.

               Upon  the  request  of  a  Holder  of  a  Trust  Security,   the
               Calculation  Agent will  provide the  Distribution  Rate then in
               effect and, if determined,  the  Distribution  Rate for the next
               Distribution Period with respect to the Trust Securities.

          (c)  Distributions  on the  Trust  Securities  shall be made  from the
               Payment  Account by the Property  Trustee or any Paying Agent and
               shall be  payable  on each  Distribution  Date only to the extent
               that the Trust has funds then  available  in the Payment  Account
               for the payment of such Distributions.

          (d)  Distributions on the Trust Securities on each  Distribution  Date
               shall be payable  to the  Holders  thereof as they  appear on the
               Securities  Register  for the Trust  Securities  on the  relevant
               record  date,  which  shall  be one  Business  Day  prior to such
               Distribution Date; provided,  however, that in the event that the
               Preferred  Securities  are  not  in  book-entry-only   form,  the
               relevant  record  date shall be the 15th day of the last month of
               each calendar quarter, whether or not a Business Day.

Section 4.02. Redemption

     (a) Upon receipt by the Trust of a notice of redemption of Debentures,  the
Trust  will  call  for  redemption  a Like  Amount  of Trust  Securities  at the
Redemption  Price on the Debenture  Redemption Date and will call for redemption
all Outstanding Trust Securities on the stated maturity date of the Debentures.
<PAGE>
     (b)  Notice  of  redemption  shall  be  given by the  Property  Trustee  by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date to each Holder of Trust  Securities to be redeemed,
at such Holder's address  appearing in the Securities  Register.  All notices of
redemption shall state:

          (i)  the Redemption Date;

          (ii) the Redemption Price;

          (iii) the CUSIP number;

          (iv) the place or places where Trust Securities Certificates are to be
               surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;

          (v)  that on the  Redemption  Date the  Redemption  Price will  become
               payable  upon each such Trust  Security to be  redeemed  and that
               Distributions  thereon will cease to accumulate on and after such
               date; and

          (vi) if less than all of the  Outstanding  Trust  Securities are to be
               redeemed,  the identification and total Liquidation Amount of the
               particular Trust Securities to be redeemed.

     (c) The Trust Securities redeemed on each Redemption Date shall be redeemed
at the Redemption Price with the proceeds from the contemporaneous redemption or
payment at maturity of Debentures.  Redemptions of the Trust Securities shall be
made and the Redemption  Price shall be payable on each  Redemption Date only to
the extent that the Trust has funds then  available  in the Payment  Account for
the payment of such Redemption Price.

     (d) If the  Trust,  by action of the  Property  Trustee,  gives a notice of
redemption in respect of any Preferred Securities, then, on the Redemption Date,
subject to Section 4.02(c),  the Property Trustee will irrevocably  deposit with
the Paying Agent funds  sufficient to pay the Redemption Price for the Preferred
Securities  being  redeemed  on  such  date  and  will  give  the  Paying  Agent
irrevocable  instructions  and  authority  to pay the  Redemption  Price  to the
Holders  of  such  Preferred   Securities  upon  surrender  of  their  Preferred
Securities Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Distributions payable on
or prior to the Redemption Date for any Trust  Securities  called for redemption
shall be payable to the Holders of such Trust  Securities  as they appear on the
Securities Register for the Trust Securities on the record dates for the related
Distribution  Dates.  If notice of  redemption  shall  have been given and funds
<PAGE>
irrevocably  deposited  as  required,  then upon the date of such  deposit,  all
rights of Securityholders holding Trust Securities so called for redemption will
cease, except the right of such Securityholders to receive the Redemption Price,
but without interest, and such Trust Securities will cease to be Outstanding. In
the  event  that any date on which  any  Redemption  Price is  payable  is not a
Business Day, then payment of the Redemption  Price payable on such date will be
made on the next  succeeding  day  which is a  Business  Day  (and  without  any
interest or other  payment in respect of any such delay),  except that,  if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding  calendar year, such payment will be made
on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case, with the same force and
effect as if made on such  date.  In the event that  payment  of the  Redemption
Price in respect of any Trust  Securities  called for  redemption  is improperly
withheld  or  refused,  and not paid  either  by the  Trust or by the  Depositor
pursuant to the Guarantee,  Distributions on such Trust Securities will continue
to accumulate,  at the then applicable rate, from the Redemption Date originally
established by the Trust for such Trust  Securities to the date such  Redemption
Price is actually  paid, in which case the actual  payment date will be the date
fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Redemption Price.

     (e) If less than all the Outstanding Trust Securities are to be redeemed on
a Redemption Date, then the aggregate  Liquidation Amount of Trust Securities to
be  redeemed  shall be  allocated  3% to the  Common  Securities  and 97% to the
Preferred  Securities.  The particular Preferred Securities to be redeemed shall
be selected by the Property  Trustee from the Outstanding  Preferred  Securities
not previously  called for  redemption,  by such method as the Property  Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate.  The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the
Securities  Registrar  in  writing  of the  Preferred  Securities  selected  for
redemption.  If fewer than all of the Trust  Securities  represented  by a Trust
Securities  Certificate are redeemed,  the Administrative  Trustee shall execute
for the Holder a new Trust  Securities  Certificate  representing the unredeemed
Trust Securities.  For all purposes of this Trust Agreement,  unless the context
otherwise  requires,  all  provisions  relating to the  redemption  of Preferred
Securities shall relate, in the case of any Preferred  Securities redeemed or to
be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the Liquidation  Amount of Preferred
Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

Section 4.03.  Subordination of Common Securities

     (a) Payment of  Distributions  on, and the  Redemption  Price of, the Trust
Securities,  as  applicable,  shall be made pro  rata  based on the  Liquidation
Amount of the Trust Securities;  provided,  however, that if on any Distribution
Date or Redemption Date, a Debenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing,  no  payment of any  Distribution  on, or  Redemption  Price of, any
Common  Security,  and no other payment on account of the  liquidation of Common
Securities,  shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all accumulated and
unpaid   Distributions   on  all  Outstanding   Preferred   Securities  for  all

<PAGE>

Distribution  Periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment
of the  Redemption  Price,  the  full  amount  of such  Redemption  Price on all
Outstanding  Preferred  Securities then being redeemed,  shall have been made or
provided for, and all funds immediately  available to the Property Trustee shall
first be applied to the payment in full in cash of all  Distributions on, or the
Redemption Price of, Preferred Securities then due and payable.

     (b) In the case of the  occurrence of any Debenture  Event of Default,  the
Holder of Common  Securities will be deemed to have waived any right to act with
respect to any  related  Event of Default  under this Trust  Agreement  and such
Debenture Event of Default until the effect of such related Event of Default and
such Debenture Event of Default has been cured, waived or otherwise  eliminated.
Until any such Event of Default under this Trust  Agreement  and such  Debenture
Event of Default has been so cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property
Trustee  shall act solely on behalf of the Holders of the  Preferred  Securities
and not the  Holder  of the  Common  Securities,  and  only the  Holders  of the
Preferred  Securities will have the right to direct the Property  Trustee to act
on their behalf.

     Section 4.04. Payment Procedures.  Payments of Distributions,  if the Trust
Securities are held by a Clearing  Agency,  shall be made to the Clearing Agency
by wire  transfer in  immediately  available  funds.  Payments of  Distributions
pursuant to Section  4.01 in respect of the Common  Securities  shall be made in
such manner as shall be mutually  agreed  between the  Property  Trustee and the
Holder of the Common Securities.  Payment of the Redemption Price or Liquidation
Distribution of the Trust Securities and payments of  Distributions  pursuant to
Section 4.01 in respect of Trust  Securities held in certificated  form shall be
made in  immediately  available  funds upon  surrender  of the Trust  Securities
Certificate  representing such Trust Securities at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Property Trustee.

     Section 4.05.  Tax Returns and Reports.  The  Administrative  Trustee shall
prepare (or cause to be  prepared),  at the  Depositor's  expense,  and file all
Federal,  State and local tax and information returns and reports required to be
filed by or in respect of the Trust. In this regard, the Administrative  Trustee
shall (a) prepare  and file (or cause to be  prepared or filed) the  appropriate
Internal  Revenue  Service Form  required to be filed in respect of the Trust in
each  taxable  year of the Trust and (b)  prepare  and  furnish  (or cause to be
prepared and  furnished) to each  Securityholder  the related  Internal  Revenue
Service Form 1099 OID, or any successor form or the  information  required to be
provided on such form.  The  Administrative  Trustee shall provide the Depositor
and the Property Trustee with a copy of all such returns,  reports and schedules
promptly after such filing or furnishing.  The Trustees shall comply with United
States  Federal  withholding  and backup  withholding  tax laws and  information
reporting requirements with respect to any payments to Securityholders under the
Trust Securities.
<PAGE>

     Section 4.06. Payments under Indenture. Any amount payable hereunder to any
Holder  of  Preferred   Securities  shall  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of  any
corresponding payment such Holder has directly received pursuant to Section 6.07
of the Indenture or pursuant to the  Guarantee.  Notwithstanding  the provisions
hereunder  to the  contrary,  Securityholders  acknowledge  that any  Holder  of
Preferred  Securities that receives  payment under Section 6.07 of the Indenture
may  receive  amounts  greater  than the amount  such  Holder may be entitled to
receive pursuant to the other provisions of this Trust Agreement.

effective until the appointment of a successor. The Paying Agent shall initially
be the Property Trustee,  and any co-paying agent chosen by the Property Trustee
and  acceptable  to the  Administrative  Trustee and the  Depositor.  Any Person
acting as Paying  Agent  shall be  permitted  to resign as Paying  Agent upon 30
days' written notice to the  Administrative  Trustee and the Depositor,  and, if
applicable, the Property Trustee, provided that such resignation with respect to
the sole Paying  Agent shall not become  effective  until the  appointment  of a
successor.  In the event that the Property Trustee shall no longer be the Paying
Agent or a  successor  Paying  Agent  shall  resign or its  authority  to act be
revoked, the Administrative Trustee shall appoint a successor that is acceptable

shall agree with the Trustees that as Paying Agent,  such successor Paying Agent
or additional Paying Agent will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to
the  Securityholders  in trust for the benefit of the  Securityholders  entitled
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Securityholders.  The Paying Agent
shall return all of such sums  remaining  unclaimed to the Property  Trustee and

its possession to the Property  Trustee.  The provisions of Sections 7.01,  7.03
and 7.06 shall apply to the Property  Trustee also in its role as Paying  Agent,
for so long as the Property Trustee shall act as Paying Agent and, to the extent
applicable, to any other Paying Agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this
Trust Agreement to the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the
context requires otherwise.
<PAGE>
     Section 5.10. No Transfer of Common Securities by Depositor. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, any attempted  transfer of the Common  Securities shall
be  void.  The  Administrative   Trustee  shall  cause  each  Common  Securities

the nominee of the initial Clearing Agency.

     (b)  A  single  Common  Securities  Certificate   representing  the  Common
Securities  shall be issued to the Depositor in the form of a definitive  Common
Securities Certificate.

or in good standing  under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  or
other applicable statute or regulation,  and the Depositor is unable to locate a
qualified  successor within 90 days, (b) the Depositor at its option advises the
Trustees in writing that it elects to terminate the  book-entry  system  through
the Clearing  Agency or (c) an Event of Default occurs and is  continuing,  then
the  Administrative   Trustee  shall  issue  Definitive   Preferred   Securities
Certificates.  Upon  surrender to the  Administrative  Trustee of the Book-Entry
Preferred  Securities  Certificates  by  the  Clearing  Agency,  accompanied  by
registration instructions,  the Administrative Trustee shall execute and deliver
the  Definitive  Preferred  Securities   Certificates  in  accordance  with  the
instructions of the Clearing  Agency.  Neither the Securities  Registrar nor the
Trustees shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such  instructions and may
conclusively  rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such  instructions.

any right or title to the Trust  Property  other than the  undivided  beneficial
interest in the assets of the Trust conferred by their Trust Securities and they
shall have no right to call for any  partition or division of property,  profits
or rights of the Trust except as described  below. The Trust Securities shall be
personal  property giving only the rights  specifically set forth therein and in
this Trust  Agreement.  The Trust Securities shall have no preemptive or similar
rights and when issued and delivered to  Securityholders  against payment of the
purchase price therefor will be fully paid and  nonassessable  by the Trust. The
Holders of the Trust Securities,  in their capacities as such, shall be entitled
to the same  limitation  of  personal  liability  extended  to  stockholders  of
corporations for profit organized under the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware.

required by law, no Holder of Trust  Securities  shall have any right to vote or
in any manner otherwise control the administration,  operation and management of
the Trust or the  obligations of the parties  hereto,  nor shall anything herein
set forth, or contained in the terms of the Trust  Securities  Certificates,  be
construed so as to constitute the Securityholders  from time to time as partners
or members of an association.

     (b) The  Trustees  shall  not (i)  direct  the  time,  method  and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy  available to the Debenture  Trustee or
executing any trust or power conferred on the Debenture  Trustee with respect to
such  Debentures,  (ii) waive any past default which may be waived under Section

acceleration  of the  principal  of all the  Debentures  or (iv)  consent to any
amendment  or  modification  of the  Indenture,  where  such  consent  shall  be
required,  without, in each case,  obtaining the prior consent of the Holders of
at least a majority in aggregate Liquidation Amount of all Outstanding Preferred
Securities; provided, however, that where such consent under the Indenture would
require the  consent of each  holder of  Debentures  affected  thereby,  no such
consent shall be given by the Property Trustee without the prior written consent
of each Holder of  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities.  The  Trustees  shall not
revoke any action previously  authorized or approved by a vote of the Holders of
Preferred  Securities,  except by a subsequent  vote of the Holders of Preferred
Securities.  The  Property  Trustee  shall  notify all Holders of the  Preferred
Securities of any notice received from the Debenture  Trustee as a result of the
Trust being the holder of the  Debentures.  In addition to obtaining the consent
of the Holders of the Preferred Securities, prior to taking any of the foregoing

<PAGE>

actions, the Trustees shall, at the expense of the Depositor,  obtain an Opinion
of Counsel  experienced in such matters to the effect that the Trust will not be
classified as an association  taxable as a corporation or partnership for United
States  Federal  income tax purposes on account of such action and will continue
to be  classified  as a grantor  trust for  United  States  Federal  income  tax
purposes.

     (c) Subject to Section  10.02(c) hereof,  if any proposed  amendment to the
Trust Agreement  provides for, or the Trustees  otherwise propose to effect, (i)
any action  that would  adversely  affect in any  material  respect  the powers,
preferences  or special  rights of the Preferred  Securities,  whether by way of
amendment  to this Trust  Agreement or  otherwise,  or (ii) the  dissolution  or
liquidation  of the  Trust,  other  than  pursuant  to the  terms of this  Trust
Agreement, then the Holders of Outstanding Preferred Securities will be entitled
to vote on such  amendment or proposal and such  amendment or proposal shall not
be  effective  except with the approval of the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities.

     Section 6.02.  Notice of Meetings.  Notice of all meetings of the Preferred
Securityholders,  stating the time,  place and purpose of the meeting,  shall be
given by the  Property  Trustee  pursuant  to  Section  10.08 to each  Preferred
Securityholder of record, at his/her  registered  address,  at least 15 days and
not more than 90 days before the  meeting.  At any such  meeting,  any  business
properly  before the meeting may be so  considered  whether or not stated in the
notice of the meeting.  Any adjourned  meeting may be held as adjourned  without
further notice.

     Section 6.03. Meetings of Preferred  Securityholders.  No annual meeting of
Securityholders  is required to be held. The  Administrative  Trustee,  however,
shall call a meeting of  Securityholders  to vote on any matter upon the written
request of the Holders of at least 25% of the  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount of
the  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities  and the  Administrative  Trustee or the
Property  Trustee  may,  at any  time in their  discretion,  call a  meeting  of
Preferred  Securityholders  to vote on any  matters  as to which  the  Preferred
Securityholders are entitled to vote.

     Holders  of at  least  50%  of  the  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount  of the
Outstanding  Preferred  Securities,   present  in  person  or  by  proxy,  shall
constitute a quorum at any meeting of Preferred Securityholders.

     If a quorum is present at a meeting,  an affirmative vote of the Holders of
at least a  majority  of the  aggregate  Liquidation  Amount of the  Outstanding
Preferred  Securities  present,  either in person or by proxy,  at such  meeting
shall constitute the action of the Preferred Securityholders,  unless this Trust
Agreement requires a greater number of affirmative votes.
<PAGE>
     Section 6.04. Voting Rights. A Securityholder shall be entitled to one vote
for each Trust Security in respect of any matter as to which such Securityholder
is entitled to vote.

     Section  6.05. Proxies,  etc.  At  any  meeting  of  Securityholders,   any
Securityholder  entitled  to vote  thereat may vote by proxy,  provided  that no
proxy  shall be voted at any  meeting  unless it shall have been  placed on file
with the  Administrative  Trustee,  or with such  other  officer or agent of the
Trust as the  Administrative  Trustee may direct,  for verification prior to the
time at which such vote shall be taken. Pursuant to a resolution of the Property
Trustee,  proxies may be solicited in the name of the Property Trustee or one or
more officers of the Property Trustee.  Only  Securityholders of record shall be
entitled to vote. When Trust Securities are held jointly by several Persons, any
one of them may vote at any  meeting  in person or by proxy in  respect  of such
Trust Securities,  but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting
in  person or by proxy,  and such  joint  owners  or their  proxies  so  present
disagree  as to any vote to be cast,  such vote shall not be received in respect
of such Trust Securities. A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a
Securityholder  shall  be  deemed  valid  unless  challenged  at or prior to its
exercise, and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.  No
proxy shall be valid more than three years after its date of execution.

     Section 6.06.  Securityholder  Action by Written Consent.  Any action which
may be taken by  Securityholders  at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if
Holders of the proportion of the Outstanding Securities required to approve such
action shall consent to the action in writing.

     Section 6.07.  Record Date for Voting and Other Purposes.  For the purposes
of determining the  Securityholders who are entitled to notice of and to vote at
any meeting or by written consent,  or for the purpose of any other action,  the
Administrative  Trustee may from time to time fix a date,  not more than 90 days
prior to the date of any  meeting of  Securityholders,  as a record date for the
determination of the identity of the Securityholders for such purposes.

     Section 6.08. Acts of Securityholders. Any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this
Trust Agreement to be given, made or taken by Securityholders may be embodied in
and evidenced by one or more instruments of  substantially  similar tenor signed
by such Securityholders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and,
except  as  otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  such  action  shall  become
effective   when  such   instrument   or   instruments   are  delivered  to  the
Administrative  Trustee. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied
therein and evidenced  thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of
the Securityholders  signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution
of any such  instrument  or of a  writing  appointing  any such  agent  shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Trust Agreement and (subject to Section 7.02)
conclusive, if made in the manner provided in this Section.
<PAGE>
     The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such  instrument or
writing may be proved by the  affidavit  of a witness of such  execution or by a
certificate  of a notary  public  or  other  officer  authorized  by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument
or writing  acknowledged to him/her the execution thereof.  Where such execution
is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his/her individual capacity, such
certificate  or  affidavit  shall also  constitute  sufficient  proof of his/her
authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing,
or the  authority of the Person  executing  the same,  may also be proved in any
other manner which any Trustee receiving the same deems sufficient.

     The  ownership  of Trust  Securities  shall  be  proved  by the  Securities
Register.

     Any request, demand,  authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or
other act of the  Securityholder  of any Trust  Security shall bind every future
Securityholder of the same Trust Security and the  Securityholder of every Trust
Security  issued  upon the  registration  of  transfer  thereof  or in  exchange
therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything done,  omitted or suffered to
be done by the  Trustees  or the  Trust  in  reliance  thereon,  whether  or not
notation of such action is made upon such Trust Security.

     Without limiting the foregoing, a Securityholder entitled hereunder to take
any action hereunder with regard to any particular Trust Security may do so with
regard to all or any part of the Liquidation Amount of such Trust Security or by
one or more duly  appointed  agents,  each of which may do so  pursuant  to such
appointment with regard to all or any part of such Liquidation Amount.

     If  any  dispute   shall  arise   between  the   Securityholders   and  the
Administrative Trustee or among such Securityholders or Trustees with respect to
the   authenticity,   validity  or  binding  nature  of  any  request,   demand,
authorization, direction, consent, waiver or other Act of such Securityholder or
Trustee  under this  Article  VI, then the  determination  of such matter by the
Property Trustee shall be conclusive with respect to such matter.

     Section  6.09.  Inspection  of  Records.  Upon  reasonable  notice  to  the
Administrative  Trustee and the Property Trustee, the records of the Trust shall
be open to inspection by  Securityholders  during normal  business hours for any
purpose   reasonably   related   to   such   Securityholder's   interest   as  a
Securityholder.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                  The Trustees

     Section 7.01. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.

     (a) The duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as provided by
this Trust Agreement and, in the case of the Property Trustee, also by the Trust
Indenture  Act.  The  Property  Trustee,  other than during the  occurrence  and
continuance  of an Event of Default,  undertakes  to perform only such duties as
are  specifically  set  forth  in this  Trust  Agreement  and,  upon an Event of
Default,  must  exercise  the same degree of care and skill as a prudent  person
would exercise or use in the conduct of his/her own affairs.  The Trustees shall
have all the privileges, rights and immunities provided by the Delaware Business
Trust Act.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no provision of this Trust Agreement
shall require the Trustees to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise  incur
any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder,  or
in the exercise of any of their rights or powers,  if they shall have reasonable
grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against
such risk or liability is not  reasonably  assured to it. Whether or not therein
expressly so provided,  every provision of this Trust Agreement  relating to the
conduct or affecting  the  liability of or affording  protection to the Trustees
shall be  subject  to the  provisions  of this  Section.  Nothing  in this Trust
Agreement shall be construed to release the Property  Trustee from liability for
its own negligent  action,  its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful
misconduct.  To the extent that, at law or in equity, the Administrative Trustee
has duties (including  fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Trust or to the Securityholders,  the Administrative Trustee shall not be liable
to the Trust or to any  Securityholder  for the  Administrative  Trustee's  good
faith reliance on the provisions of this Trust Agreement. The provisions of this
Trust Agreement,  to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of
the Administrative Trustee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the  Depositor  and  the  Securityholders  to  replace  such  other  duties  and
liabilities of the Administrative Trustee.

     (b) All payments made by the Property  Trustee or any other Paying Agent in
respect of the Trust  Securities shall be made only from the income and proceeds
from the Trust  Property.  Each  Securityholder,  by its  acceptance  of a Trust
Security,  agrees that (i) it will look solely to the income and  proceeds  from
the Trust  Property to the extent  available  for  distribution  to it as herein
provided and (ii) the Trustees  are not  personally  liable to it for any amount
distributable  in respect of any Trust  Security or for any other  liability  in
respect of any Trust Security. This Section 7.01(b) does not limit the liability
of the Trustees expressly set forth elsewhere in this Trust Agreement or, in the
case of the Property Trustee, in the Trust Indenture Act.
<PAGE>

     Section 7.02. Notice of Defaults;  Direct Action by Securityholers.  Within
90 days  after the  occurrence  of any Event of  Default  actually  known to the
Property Trustee, the Property Trustee shall transmit,  in the manner and to the
extent  provided  in  Section  10.08,  notice of such  Event of  Default  to the
Securityholders, the Administrative Trustee and the Depositor, unless such Event
of Default shall have been cured or waived.  If the Property  Trustee has failed
to enforce its rights under this Trust Agreement or the Indenture to the fullest
extent permitted by law and subject to the terms of this Trust Agreement and the
Indenture,  any Securityholder may institute a legal proceeding directly against
any Person to enforce the Property  Trustee's  rights under this Trust Agreement
or the Indenture with respect to Debentures  having a principal  amount equal to
the  aggregate   Liquidation   Amount  of  the  Preferred   Securities  of  such
Securityholder without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Property
Trustee or any other  Person.  To the extent that any action under the Indenture
is entitled to be taken by the holders of at least a specified percentage of the
principal  amount of the  outstanding  Debentures,  Holders of at least the same
percentage of the Liquidation Amount of the Outstanding Preferred Securities may
also take such action in the name of the Trust if such action has not been taken
by the Property Trustee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Debenture Event of
Default relating to the Depositor's  failure to pay the principal of or interest
on the Debentures has occurred and is continuing  thereby  resulting in an Event
of Default hereunder,  then each Holder of Preferred  Securities may institute a
legal  proceeding  directly  against the Depositor for enforcement of payment to
such Holder, as provided in Section 6.07 of the Indenture.

     Section 7.03. Certain Rights of Property Trustee. Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.01:

     (a) the  Property  Trustee  may rely and  shall be  protected  in acting or
refraining  from acting in good faith upon any  resolution,  Opinion of Counsel,
certificate,  written  representation of a Holder or transferee,  certificate of
auditors  or any other  certificate,  statement,  instrument,  opinion,  report,
notice,  request,  consent,  order,  appraisal,  bond,  debenture,  note,  other
evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

     (b) if, other than during the  occurrence  and  continuance  of an Event of
Default,  (i) in performing its duties under this Trust Agreement,  the Property
Trustee is required to decide between  alternative  courses of action or (ii) in
construing any of the provisions in this Trust  Agreement,  the Property Trustee
finds the same ambiguous or  inconsistent  with any other  provisions  contained
herein or (iii)  the  Property  Trustee  is  unsure  of the  application  of any

<PAGE>

provision of this Trust Agreement, then, except as to any matter as to which the
Preferred  Securityholders  are  entitled  to vote under the terms of this Trust
Agreement,  the  Property  Trustee  shall  deliver  a  notice  to the  Depositor
requesting  written  instructions of the Depositor as to the course of action to
be taken.  The Property  Trustee shall take such action,  or refrain from taking
such action,  as the Property Trustee shall be instructed in writing to take, or
to  refrain  from  taking,  by the  Depositor;  provided,  however,  that if the
Property Trustee does not receive such  instructions of the Depositor within ten
Business Days after it has delivered  such notice,  or such  reasonably  shorter
period of time set forth in such notice (which to the extent  practicable  shall
not be less than two Business Days), it may, but shall be under no duty to, take
or refrain from taking such action not inconsistent with this Trust Agreement as
it shall deem  advisable and in the best  interests of the  Securityholders,  in
which event the  Property  Trustee  shall have no  liability  except for its own
negligent  action,  its  own  negligent  failure  to  act  or  its  own  willful
misconduct;

     (c) the Property  Trustee may consult with counsel or other  experts of its
selection  and the  advice or  opinion of such  counsel  or other  experts  with
respect to legal  matters or advice  within the scope of such  experts'  area of
expertise shall be full and complete  authorization and protection in respect of
any action  taken,  suffered  or omitted  by it  hereunder  in good faith and in
reliance thereon;

     (d) the Property  Trustee  shall be under no  obligation to exercise any of
the rights or powers  vested in it by this  Trust  Agreement  at the  request or
direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to this Trust Agreement, unless
such  Securityholders  shall have  offered to the  Property  Trustee  reasonable
security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be
incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;

     (e) the Property Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation  into
the  facts  or  matters  stated  in  any  resolution,   certificate,  statement,
instrument,   opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  direction,  consent,  order,
approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
or document, but the Property Trustee, in its discretion,  may make such further
inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit; and

     (f) the Property  Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder
or perform any duties  hereunder  either directly or by or through its agents or
attorneys and the Property  Trustee shall not be responsible  for any misconduct
or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it
hereunder.

     Section 7.04. Not Responsible  for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.  The
recitals  contained  herein and in the Trust  Securities  Certificates  shall be
taken as the  statements  of the  Trust,  and the  Trustees  do not  assume  any
responsibility for their correctness.  The Trustees shall not be accountable for
the use or application by the Depositor of the proceeds of the Debentures.
<PAGE>

     Section 7.05.  May Hold  Securities.  Any Trustee or any other agent of any
Trustee or the Trust,  in its individual or any other  capacity,  may become the
owner or pledgee of Trust Securities and, subject to Sections 7.08 and 7.13 and,
except as provided in the  definition of the term  Outstanding in Article I, may
otherwise  deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were not
a Trustee or such other agent.

     Section 7.06. Compensation; Indemnity; Fees. The Depositor agrees:

     (a) to pay to the  Trustees  from time to time such  compensation  as shall
have been agreed in writing with the Depositor for all services rendered by them
hereunder  (which  compensation  shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

     (b)  except as  otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  to  reimburse  the
Trustees upon request for all reasonable  expenses,  disbursements  and advances
incurred or made by the Trustees in accordance  with any provision of this Trust
Agreement   (including  the  reasonable   compensation   and  the  expenses  and
disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such expense,  disbursement
or advance as may be attributable to its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure  to  act  or  its  own  wilful  misconduct  (or,  in  the  case  of  the
Administrative  Trustee,  any such  expense,  disbursement  or advance as may be
attributable to his/her gross negligence); and

     (c) to indemnify each of the Trustees or any  predecessor  Trustee for, and
to hold  the  Trustees  harmless  against,  any and all  loss,  damage,  claims,
liability,  penalty or expense  including  taxes  (other than taxes based on the
income of such  Trustee)  incurred  without its own  negligent  action,  its own
negligent  failure  to act or its  wilful  misconduct  (or,  in the  case of the
Administrative  Trustees,  incurred  without  gross  negligence  or bad  faith),
arising out of or in connection  with the acceptance or  administration  of this
Trust  Agreement,  including the costs and expenses of defending  itself against
any claim or liability in connection  with the exercise or performance of any of
its powers or duties hereunder.

     No Trustee  may claim any Lien or charge on any Trust  Property as a result
of any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.06.

     The  provisions of this Section 7.06 shall survive the  termination of this
Trust Agreement.
<PAGE>
     Section 7.07. Corporate Property Trustee Required; Eligibility of Trustees

     (a) There shall at all times be a Property Trustee hereunder.  The Property
Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible  pursuant to the Trust  Indenture Act
to act as such and has a combined  capital and surplus of at least  $50,000,000.
If any such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to
law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining  authority,  then for
the purposes of this  Section,  the combined  capital and surplus of such Person
shall be deemed to be its combined  capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent  report of condition so  published.  If at any time the Property  Trustee
with respect to the Trust  Securities  shall cease to be eligible in  accordance
with the provisions of this Section,  it shall resign  immediately in the manner
and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

     (b)  There  shall  at all  times  be one or  more  Administrative  Trustees
hereunder.  Each Administrative  Trustee shall be either a natural person who is
at least 21 years of age or a legal  entity  that shall act  through one or more
persons authorized to bind that entity.

     (c) There shall at all times be a Delaware  Trustee.  The Delaware  Trustee
shall  either  be (i) a  natural  person  who is at  least 21 years of age and a
resident  of the State of Delaware  or (ii) a legal  entity  with its  principal
place  of  business  in the  State of  Delaware  and that  otherwise  meets  the
requirements  of  applicable  Delaware  law that shall act  through  one or more
persons authorized to bind such entity.

     Section 7.08. Conflicting  Interests.  If the Property Trustee has or shall
acquire a conflicting  interest  within the meaning of the Trust  Indenture Act,
the Property  Trustee shall either  eliminate  such  interest or resign,  to the
extent and in the manner  provided  by, and  subject to the  provisions  of, the
Trust Indenture Act and this Trust Agreement.

     Section 7.09. Co-Trustees and Separate Trustee.  Unless an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing,  at any time or times, for the purpose of
meeting the legal requirements of the Trust Indenture Act or of any jurisdiction
in  which  any  part of the  Trust  Property  may at the  time be  located,  the
Depositor and the  Administrative  Trustee (and if more than one  Administrative
Trustee, by agreed action of the majority of such Trustees) shall have power (i)
to  appoint,  and upon the  written  request of the  Administrative  Trustee the
Depositor  shall for such  purpose join with the  Administrative  Trustee in the
execution,  delivery and performance of all instruments and agreements necessary
or proper to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Property Trustee either
to act as co-trustee,  jointly with the Property Trustee,  of all or any part of
such Trust Property, or to the extent required by law to act as separate trustee
of any such property,  in either case with such powers as may be provided in the
instrument  of  appointment,  and (ii) to vest in such  Person or Persons in the
capacity  aforesaid,  any property,  title,  right or power deemed  necessary or
desirable,  subject to the other  provisions of this  Section.  If the Depositor
does not join in such  appointment  within 15 days after the  receipt by it of a

<PAGE>
request so to do, or in case a Debenture  Event of Default has  occurred  and is
continuing,   the  Property   Trustee  alone  shall  have  power  to  make  such
appointment.  Any  co-trustee  or separate  trustee  appointed  pursuant to this
Section shall either be (i) a natural person who is at least 21 years of age and
a resident of the United States or (ii) a legal entity with its principal  place
of  business in the United  States  that shall act  through one or more  persons
authorized to bind such entity.

     Should  any  written  instrument  from the  Depositor  be  required  by any
co-trustee or separate  trustee so appointed  for more fully  confirming to such
co-trustee or separate trustee such property, title, right or power, any and all
such instruments shall, on request, be executed,  acknowledged, and delivered by
the Depositor.

     Every co-trustee or separate trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law,
but to such extent only, be appointed subject to the following terms, namely:

     (a) The Trust  Securities  shall be executed and  delivered and all rights,
powers,   duties  and  obligations  hereunder  in  respect  of  the  custody  of
securities,  cash and  other  personal  property  held  by,  or  required  to be
deposited or pledged with, the Trustees specified hereunder, shall be exercised,
solely by such Trustees and not by such co-trustee or separate trustee.

     (b) The rights,  powers, duties and obligations hereby conferred or imposed
upon the Property Trustee in respect of any property covered by such appointment
shall be conferred  or imposed  upon and  exercised or performed by the Property
Trustee or by the  Property  Trustee and such  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee
jointly,  as shall be provided in the instrument  appointing  such co-trustee or
separate trustee, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in
which any  particular  act is to be  performed,  the Property  Trustee  shall be
incompetent  or  unqualified  to perform  such act, in which event such  rights,
powers,  duties  and  obligations  shall  be  exercised  and  performed  by such
co-trustee or separate trustee.

     (c) The Property  Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed
by it, with the written concurrence of the Depositor, may accept the resignation
of or remove any co-trustee or separate  trustee  appointed  under this Section,
and, in case a Debenture  Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing,  the
Property  Trustee shall have power to accept the resignation of, or remove,  any
such  co-trustee or separate  trustee  without the concurrence of the Depositor.
Upon the written request of the Property Trustee,  the Depositor shall join with
the  Property  Trustee  in  the  execution,  delivery  and  performance  of  all
instruments and agreements necessary or proper to effectuate such resignation or
removal.  A  successor  to any  co-trustee  or  separate  trustee so resigned or
removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section.
<PAGE>
     (d) No co-trustee or separate trustee  hereunder shall be personally liable
by reason of any act or omission of the Property  Trustee,  or any other trustee
hereunder.

     (e) The  Property  Trustee  shall  not be  liable by reason of any act of a
co-trustee or separate trustee.

     (f) Any Act of Holders delivered to the Property Trustee shall be deemed to
have been delivered to each such co-trustee and separate trustee.

     Section  7.10.  Resignation  and  Removal;  Appointment  of  Successor.  No
resignation or removal of any Trustee and no appointment of a successor  Trustee
pursuant  to this  Article  shall  become  effective  until  the  acceptance  of
appointment  by  the  successor   Trustee  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
requirements of Section 7.11.

     Subject to the immediately  preceding paragraph,  any Trustee may resign at
any time with respect to the Trust  Securities by giving  written notice thereof
to the Securityholders.

     Unless an Event of  Default  shall have  occurred  and be  continuing,  any
Trustee  may  be  removed  at any  time  by Act  of  the  Holder  of the  Common
Securities.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing,  the
Property  Trustee or the Delaware  Trustee,  or both of them,  may be removed at
such time  only by Act of the  Holders  of at least a  majority  in  Liquidation
Amount of the Outstanding  Preferred  Securities,  delivered to such Trustee (in
its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust). The Administrative  Trustee
may only be removed by the Holder of Common Securities at any time.

     If the  instrument  of  acceptance  by the  successor  Trustee  required by
Section 7.11 shall not have been  delivered to the Trustee  within 30 days after
the giving of such notice of resignation  or removal,  the Trustee may petition,
at the expense of the  Depositor,  any court of competent  jurisdiction  for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

     If any Trustee  shall resign,  be removed or become  incapable of acting as
Trustee, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of any Trustee for any cause,
at a time when no Event of Default  shall have occurred and be  continuing,  the
Holder of Common Securities, by Act of the Holder of Common Securities delivered
to the retiring Trustee,  shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees
and the  Trust,  and the  retiring  Trustee  shall  comply  with the  applicable
requirements  of Section 7.11. If the Property  Trustee or the Delaware  Trustee
shall  resign,  be  removed  or become  incapable  of  continuing  to act as the
Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee,  as the case may be, at a time when an
Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the  Holders of  Preferred
Securities,  by Act of the Securityholders of at least a majority in Liquidation

<PAGE>
Amount  of the  Outstanding  Preferred  Securities  delivered  to  the  retiring
Trustee,  shall  promptly  appoint a  successor  Trustee or  Trustees,  and such
successor Trustee shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 7.11.
If any  Administrative  Trustee shall resign,  be removed or become incapable of
acting as  Administrative  Trustee at a time when an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be  continuing,  the Holder of Common  Securities  shall  appoint a
successor  Administrative  Trustee.  If no successor  Trustee shall have been so
appointed  by the  Holder of  Common  Securities  or the  Holders  of  Preferred

the execution and delivery of such  amendment the  resignation or removal of the
retiring  Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each
such  successor  Trustee,  without any further act,  deed or  conveyance,  shall
become  vested with all the rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the  retiring
Trustee and the Trust;  but, on request of the Trust or any  successor  Trustee,
such retiring Trustee shall duly assign,  transfer and deliver to such successor
Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring
Trustee hereunder.

all instruments  for more fully and certainly  vesting in and confirming to such
successor  Trustee  all  such  rights,  powers  and  trusts  referred  to in the

parties hereto.

     Section 7.13. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Depositor or Trust.

including  under the terms of Section 7.05 hereof,  the Property  Trustee or the
Delaware  Trustee,  as the case may be,  shall be  subject to and shall take all
actions  necessary in order to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture

such other obligor).

     Each  Officer's   Certificate  and  Opinion  of  Counsel  with  respect  to
compliance  with a covenant or condition  provided  for in this Trust  Agreement

          covenant or condition has been complied with; and

     (4)  a statement  that,  in the opinion of such  Person,  such  covenant or

          officials.

the Trust shall  automatically  dissolve on December  22, 2051 (the  "Expiration
Date").
<PAGE>

     Section  8.02.  Early  Dissolution.  The  earliest  to  occur of any of the

          or liquidation of the Depositor or an  acceleration of the maturity of
          the Debentures pursuant to Section 6.02 of the Indenture;

     (c)  the redemption of all of the Trust Securities; and

     (d)  an order for  dissolution  of the Trust  shall have been  entered by a

     The election of the Depositor  pursuant to Section 8.02(b) shall be made by
the Depositor  giving written notice to the Trustees not less than 30 days prior
to the date of  distribution  of the  Debentures.  Such notice shall specify the
date of distribution of the Debentures and shall be accompanied by an Opinion of
Counsel that such event will not be a taxable  event to the Holders of the Trust
Securities for Federal income tax purposes.

     Section 8.03. Dissolution.  The respective obligations and responsibilities
of the Trustees and the Trust  continued  hereby shall terminate upon the latest
to occur of the  following:  (a) the  distribution  by the  Property  Trustee to
Securityholders  upon the  liquidation of the Trust pursuant to Section 8.04, or

all amounts  required to be distributed  hereunder upon the final payment of the
Trust Securities; (b) the payment of any expenses owed by the Trust; and (c) the
discharge of all administrative duties of the Administrative Trustee,  including

     (a) If an Early  Dissolution  Event  specified in clause (a), (c) or (d) of
Section 8.02 occurs or upon the  Expiration  Date, the Trust shall be liquidated
by the Trustees as  expeditiously  as the  Trustees  determine to be possible by
distributing,  after  satisfaction  of  liabilities to creditors of the Trust as
provided by applicable law, to each  Securityholder a Like Amount of Debentures,
subject to Section 8.04(d).  If an Early  Dissolution  Event specified in clause
(b)  occurs,  the  Trust  shall  be  liquidated  by the  Trustee  on the date of
distribution  of the  Debentures  specified  by  the  Depositor  in  its  notice
delivered  pursuant to Section 8.02. Notice of liquidation shall be given by the
Property Trustee by first-class mail, postage prepaid,  mailed not later than 30
nor more  than 60 days  prior to the  Liquidation  Date to each  Holder of Trust
Securities at such Holder's address  appearing in the Securities  Register.  All
notices of liquidation shall:
<PAGE>
     (i)  state the Liquidation Date;

     (ii) state that from and after the Liquidation  Date, the Trust  Securities
          will no longer be deemed to be  Outstanding  and any Trust  Securities
          Certificates  not surrendered for exchange will be deemed to represent
          a Like Amount of Debentures; and

     (iii)provide  such  information  with  respect  to the  mechanics  by which
          Holders may exchange Trust  Securities  Certificates  for certificates
          evidencing  Debentures,  or, if  Section  8.04(d)  applies,  receive a
          Liquidation  Distribution,   as  the  Administrative  Trustee  or  the
          Property Trustee shall deem appropriate.

     (b) In order to effect the liquidation of the Trust and distribution of the
Debentures to  Securityholders,  the Property  Trustee,  either itself acting as
exchange agent or through the appointment of a separate  exchange  agent,  shall
establish  such   procedures  as  it  shall  deem   appropriate  to  effect  the
distribution  of Debentures  in exchange for the  Outstanding  Trust  Securities
Certificates.

     (c)  Except  where  Section  8.02(c) or  8.04(d)  applies,  on or after the
Liquidation  Date,  (i) the  Trust  Securities  will no  longer  be deemed to be
Outstanding,  (ii) certificates representing a Like Amount of Debentures will be
issued to Holders  of Trust  Securities  Certificates,  upon  surrender  of such
certificates to the Administrative Trustee or its agent for exchange,  (iii) the
Depositor  shall use its best efforts to have the  Debentures  listed on the New
York Stock Exchange or such other exchange as the Preferred  Securities are then
listed and shall take any reasonable action necessary to effect the distribution
of the Debentures, (iv) any Trust Securities Certificates not so surrendered for
exchange  will be deemed to  represent  a Like  Amount of  Debentures,  accruing
interest at the rate provided for in the Debentures  from the last  Distribution
Date on which a  Distribution  was made on such  Trust  Securities  Certificates
until such  certificates are so surrendered (and until such  certificates are so
surrendered,  no payments of  interest or  principal  will be made to Holders of
Trust  Securities  Certificates  with  respect to such  Debentures)  and (v) all
rights of Securityholders  holding Trust Securities will cease, except the right
of such Securityholders to receive Debentures upon surrender of Trust Securities
Certificates.

     (d) In the event that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section
8.04,  whether  because  of an  order  for  dissolution  entered  by a court  of
competent  jurisdiction  or  otherwise,  distribution  of the  Debentures in the
manner  provided  herein  is  determined  by  the  Property  Trustee  not  to be
practical,  the Trust  Property  shall be  liquidated,  and the  Trust  shall be

<PAGE>

dissolved,  by the  Property  Trustee  in such  manner as the  Property  Trustee
determines.  In  such  event,  on the  date  of the  dissolution  of the  Trust,
Securityholders  will be  entitled  to  receive  out of the  assets of the Trust
available for distribution to Securityholders, after satisfaction of liabilities
to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable  law, an amount equal to the
Liquidation Amount per Trust Security plus accumulated and unpaid  Distributions
thereon  to  the  date  of  payment   (such   amount   being  the   "Liquidation
Distribution").  If, upon any such dissolution, the Liquidation Distribution can
be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient  assets available to pay
in full  the  aggregate  Liquidation  Distribution,  then,  subject  to the next
succeeding  sentence,  the amounts payable by the Trust on the Trust  Securities
shall be paid on a pro rata basis (based upon Liquidation  Amounts).  The Holder
of the Common Securities will be entitled to receive  Liquidation  Distributions
upon any such  dissolution  pro rata  (determined as aforesaid)  with Holders of
Preferred Securities,  except that, if a Debenture Event of Default has occurred
and is  continuing,  the  Preferred  Securities  shall have a priority  over the
Common Securities,  and no Liquidation  Distribution will be paid to the Holders
of the  Common  Securities  unless  and  until  receipt  by all  Holders  of the
Preferred  Securities of the entire Liquidation  Distribution payable in respect
thereof.

replaced  by, or  convey,  transfer  or lease its  properties  and  assets as an
entirety or  substantially  as an entirety  to any Person,  except as  described
below or under  Article  VIII.  The Trust may, at the request of the  Depositor,
with the  consent of the  Administrative  Trustee and without the consent of the
Holders  of  the  Preferred  Securities,   merge  with  or  into,   consolidate,
amalgamate,  or be replaced by, a trust  organized as such under the laws of any
State; provided, that (i) such successor entity either (a) expressly assumes all
of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the Preferred  Securities or (b)
substitutes for the Preferred  Securities other securities having  substantially
the same terms as the Preferred Securities (the "Successor  Securities") so long
as the Successor  Securities rank the same as the Preferred Securities rank with
respect to the  payment of  Distributions  and  payments  upon  liquidation  and
redemption,  (ii) the Depositor  expressly  appoints a trustee of such successor
entity  possessing  the same  powers and  duties as the  Property  Trustee  with
respect to the  Debentures,  (iii) the Successor  Securities are listed,  or any
Successor  Securities  will be listed  upon  notification  of  issuance,  on any
national  securities  exchange  or other  organization  on which  the  Preferred
Securities are then listed,  (iv) such merger,  consolidation,  amalgamation  or

<PAGE>

replacement  does not cause the Preferred  Securities  (including  any Successor
Securities) to be downgraded by any  nationally  recognized  statistical  rating
organization,  (v) such merger, consolidation,  amalgamation or replacement does
not adversely  affect the rights,  preferences  and privileges of the Holders of
the Preferred  Securities  (including any Successor  Securities) in any material
respect,  (vi) such successor entity has a purpose substantially similar to that
of the  Trust,  (vii)  prior  to such  merger,  consolidation,  amalgamation  or
replacement, the Depositor has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
(a) such merger,  consolidation,  amalgamation or replacement does not adversely
affect the rights,  preferences  and  privileges of the Holders of the Preferred
Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any material respect, and (b)
following such merger, consolidation,  amalgamation or replacement,  neither the
Trust nor such  successor  entity will be required to register as an  investment
company under the 1940 Act and (viii) the  Depositor or any permitted  successor
assignee  owns  all of the  common  securities  of  such  successor  entity  and
guarantees  the  obligations  of  such  successor  entity  under  the  Successor
Securities  at least to the  extent  provided  by the  Guarantee  and this Trust
Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Trust shall not, except with the
consent  of all  Holders  of the  Preferred  Securities,  merge  with  or  into,
consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, any other entity or permit any other
entity to  consolidate,  amalgamate,  merge with or into,  or replace it if such
consolidation,  amalgamation, merger or replacement would cause the Trust or the
successor  entity not to be  classified  as a grantor  trust for  United  States
Federal income tax purposes.

Depositor  or any of the  Trustees  takes  action in  violation  of this Section
10.09, the Property Trustee agrees, for the benefit of Securityholders,  that at
the expense of the Depositor,  it shall file an answer with the bankruptcy court

of the  provisions of the Trust  Indenture  Act, such required  provision  shall
control.  If any  provision  of this Trust  Agreement  modifies or excludes  any
provision of the Trust  Indenture Act which may be so modified or excluded,  the
latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this Trust Agreement as so modified

                             THE SERIES B DEBENTURES

SECTION 2.01 Terms and Form of the Series B Debentures

     (a) The Series B Debentures shall be designated  "Public Service Enterprise
Group Incorporated  Floating Rate Deferrable Interest  Subordinated  Debentures,
Series  B."  The  Series  B  Debentures   and  the  Trustee's   Certificate   of
Authentication  shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto.
The  Series B  Debentures  shall  initially  be issued as global  Debentures  in

Depository  Trust Company as Depositary.  The terms and provisions  contained in
the Series B Debentures shall constitute,  and are hereby expressly made, a part
of this First  Supplemental  Indenture.  The Company and the  Trustee,  by their
execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture,  expressly agree to
such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby.
<PAGE>
     (b) The aggregate  principal  amount of Series B Debentures  outstanding at
any time may not exceed  $154,640,000  except as provided in Section 2.09 of the
Indenture.  The Series B Debentures  shall be  authenticated  and delivered from
time to time upon  delivery  to the  Trustee of the items  specified  in Section
2.04(d) of the Indenture.

     (c) The Stated Maturity Date of the Series B Debentures is June 30, 2028.

     (d) The interest  rate of the Series B Debentures  will be a floating  rate
per annum  determined  quarterly by reference to 3-Month  LIBOR,  determined  as
described herein, plus a margin of 1.22%.

     "3-Month  LIBOR" means the London  interbank  offered rate for  three-month
U.S.  dollar deposits and with respect to any Interest Period (as defined below)
will be  calculated by First Union  National Bank or any successor  appointed by
the  Company as  Calculation  Agent,  as  permitted  by this First  Supplemental
Indenture (the "Calculation Agent") as follows:

     i. On the second Market Day (as defined below)  preceding the  commencement
of such Interest Period (each, a  "Determination  Date"),  3-Month LIBOR will be
determined  on the basis of the offered  rate for deposits of not less than U.S.
$1,000,000  for a period of three months (the "Index  Maturity"),  commencing on
such Market Day, which appears on the display designated as Page 3750 on the Dow
Jones  Markets  Limited  (or such  other page as may  replace  Page 3750 on that
service  (or  any  successor  service)  for the  purpose  of  displaying  London
interbank offered rates of major banks) ("Telerate Page 3750") as of 11:00 a.m.,
London time on such Market Day. If no such offered rate  appears,  3-Month LIBOR
with respect to such  Interest  Period will be  determined  as described in (ii)
below.

     The term "Interest  Period" means each period  beginning on, and including,
the date of original  issuance and ending on, but excluding,  the first Interest
Payment Date (as defined below) , and each successive period, so beginning on an
Interest  Payment  Date and so ending  on,  but  excluding  the next  successive
Interest Payment Date.

     ii. With  respect to a  Determination  Date on which no such  offered  rate
appears on Telerate Page 3750 as described in (i) above,  3-Month LIBOR shall be
the  arithmetic  mean,  expressed  as a  percentage,  of the  offered  rates for
deposits in U.S.  dollars for the Index  Maturity  which  appears on the display
designated  as "LIBO" on the Reuter  Monitor Money Market Rates Service (or such
other  page as may  replace  the LIBO  page on that  service  (or any  successor
service) for the purpose of displaying  London interbank  offered rates of major
banks)  ("Reuters  Screen  LIBO Page") as of 11:00 a.m.,  London  time,  on such
Market Day. If, in turn,  such rate is not displayed on the Reuters  Screen LIBO
Page at such time, the Calculation Agent will obtain from each of four reference
banks in London selected by the Calculation  Agent (the "Reference  Banks") such
bank's  offered   quotation   (expressed  as  a  percentage  per  annum)  as  of

<PAGE>
approximately  11:00 a.m.,  London time, on such Market Day for deposits in U.S.
dollars for the Index Maturity to prime banks in the London interbank market. If
two or more such  quotations  are provided as requested,  then 3-Month LIBOR for
such Market Day shall be the arithmetic  mean of such  quotations.  If, in turn,
fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested, then 3-Month LIBOR for
such Market Day will be  obtained  from the  preceding  Market Day for which the
Reuters Screen LIBO Page displayed an offered rate for deposits in U.S.  dollars
for the Index Maturity.

     iii. If on any  Determination  Date, the Calculation  Agent is required but
unable to determine  3-Month LIBOR in the manner  provided in paragraphs (i) and
(ii) above,  3-Month  LIBOR for such  Interest  Period shall be 3-Month LIBOR as
determined on the immediately preceding Determination Date.

     The term "Market Day" means any day on which  commercial  banks and foreign
exchange markets are open for business  (including  dealings in foreign exchange
and foreign currency deposits) in The City of New York and The City of London.

     The interest  rate for any  Interest  Period will at no time be higher than
the maximum rate then permitted by applicable law.

     All percentages  resulting from any calculations referred to herein will be
rounded,  if  necessary,  to the  nearest  multiple  of 1/100 of 1% and all U.S.
dollar  amounts used in or resulting from such  calculations  will be rounded to
the nearest cent (with one-half cent or more being rounded upwards).

     The  Calculation  Agent  shall,  as soon as  practicable  after 11:00 a.m.,
London  time,  on each  Determination  Date,  determine  the  interest  rate and
calculate  the amount of  interest  payable in  respect of the  Interest  Period
related to such Determination Date (the "Interest Amount").  The Interest Amount
shall be calculated  by applying the interest  rate to the  principal  amount of
each Series B Debenture  outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,
multiplying such amount by the actual number of days in the applicable  Interest
Period  divided by 360 and  rounding  the  resultant  figure to the nearest cent
(with one-half cent or more being rounded  upwards).  The  determination  of the
interest  rate and the  Interest  Amount by the  Calculation  Agent will (in the
absence of willful  default,  bad faith or manifest error) be final,  conclusive
and binding on all concerned.  Neither the Calculation Agent nor the Company (or
any of their respective officers, directors, agents, beneficiaries, employees or
affiliates)  shall have any liability to any person for (i) the selection of any
Reference  Bank or (ii) any  inability  to  retain  major  banks  in the  London
interbank  market,  in the case of the  Calculation  Agent,  which is  caused by
circumstances beyond its reasonable control.
<PAGE>
     All certificates,  communications, opinions, determinations,  calculations,
quotations and decisions given, expressed,  made or obtained for the purposes of
the provisions hereof relating to the payment and calculation of interest on the
Series B  Debentures,  whether  by the  Reference  Banks (or any of them) or the
Calculation  Agent,  will (in the  absence  of  willful  default,  bad  faith or
manifest  error)  be  binding  on  Trust  II,  the  Company,  the  Trustee,  the
Calculation  Agent and all of the  holders  of the  Series B  Debentures  and no
liability will (in the absence of willful default,  bad faith or manifest error)
attach to the Calculation  Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise
by it of its powers, duties and discretion.

     (e) The "Interest  Payment Dates" for the Series B Debentures are March 31,
June 30,  September 30 and December 31 of each year,  commencing  September  30,
1998.  In the event that any date on which  interest  is payable on the Series B
Debentures is not a Business Day, then payment of interest  payable on such date
will be made on the next  succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any
interest  or other  payment in respect of any such  delay),  except that if such
Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made
on the immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and
effect  as if made on such  date.  The  Regular  Record  Date for each  Interest
Payment Date for the Series B Debentures shall be the 15th day (whether or not a
Business  Day) of the last month of each  quarter,  provided that if Trust II is
the sole Holder of the Series B Debentures or the Series B Debentures are issued
in book-entry-only  form, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business
on the Business Day next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

     Each Series B Debenture shall bear interest from its Issue Date or from the
most  recent  Interest  Payment  Date to which  interest  has been  paid or duly
provided for with respect to such Series B  Debenture;  except that,  so long as
there is no  existing  Defaulted  Interest or  Extension  Period on the Series B
Debentures,  any Series B Debenture  authenticated  by the  Trustee  between the
Regular Record Date for any Interest Payment Date and such Interest Payment Date
shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date.

     Overdue  principal of, and interest on, any Series B Debenture and interest
which has been deferred  pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Indenture shall bear
interest  (to the  extent  that the  payment of such  interest  shall be legally
enforceable) at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate per annum payable on
such Series B Debenture.

     The Calculation  Agent will cause the interest rate, the Interest Amount in
respect  of each  Series B  Debenture  and the  interest  payment  date for each
Interest Period to be given to the Trustee, the Property Trustee and the Company
as soon as  practicable  after the  determination  thereof but in no event later
than the second Business Day of the applicable Interest Period.

     (f) The Series B  Debentures  shall be  issuable  only in  registered  form
without coupons and only in  denominations  of $1,000 and any integral  multiple
thereof.
<PAGE>
     (g) The maximum  Extension  Period for the Series B Debentures  shall be 20
consecutive quarters.

     (h) First Union  National Bank shall  initially be the Paying Agent for the
Series B Debentures.

     (i) First Union National Bank shall initially be the Calculation  Agent for
the  Series B  Debenture.  In the event of the  resignation  or removal of First
Union National Bank as the Calculation  Agent, the Company will promptly appoint
a  successor  Calculation  Agent and such  successor  Calculation  Agent  shall,
without  any  further  act,  deed or  conveyance  become  vested with all of the
authority, rights, duties and obligations of the Calculation Agent with the like
effect as if originally appointed as Calculation Agent.

Section  2.03(b) of the Trust II  Agreement  and to pay the taxes of Trust II in
accordance  with  Section  2.03(c) of the Trust II  Agreement in order to permit

Securities in accordance with Article IV of the Trust II Agreement.

Exhibit A

PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED

Floating Rate Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture, Series B


No. R-1


     Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, a New Jersey corporation (the
"Company",  which term  includes any successor  corporation  under the Indenture
hereinafter  referred  to),  for  value  received,  hereby  promises  to  pay to
Enterprise  Capital  Trust II or  registered  assigns,  the principal sum of One
Hundred Fifty-Four Million Six Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars  ($154,640,000) on
June 30, 2028,  and to pay interest on said  principal sum from June 26, 1998 or
from the most recent Interest  Payment Date (as defined below) to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for,  quarterly in arrears and reset on March 31,
June 30,  September 30 and December 31 commencing  September 30, 1998 (each,  an
"Interest  Payment  Date") at floating  rate per annum  determined  quarterly by
reference to 3-Month  LIBOR,  determined  as provided in the  Indenture,  plus a
margin of 1.22% until the  principal  hereof  shall have become due and payable,
and on any overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue  installment of interest at the
same rate per annum. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment Date
shall be  calculated  by applying  the  interest  rate to the  principal  amount
outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period,  multiplying such amount
by the actual number of days in the  applicable  Interest  Period divided by 360
and rounding the  resultant  figure to the nearest cent (with  one-half  cent or
more being rounded upwards).  In the event that any Interest Payment Date is not
a Business Day, then interest will be payable on the next  succeeding  day which
is a Business Day (and  without any interest or other  payment in respect of any
such  delay),  except  that,  if such  Business  Day is in the  next  succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately  preceding Business
Day,  in each case with the same force and  effect as if made on such date.  The
interest  installment so payable,  and  punctually  paid or duly provided for as
provided  in the  Indenture,  shall be paid to the  Person  in whose  name  this
Debenture is registered at the close of business on the Regular  Record Date for
such  interest  installment,  which  shall  be the 15th  day  (whether  or not a
Business  Day) of the last month of each  quarter,  provided  that if all of the
Series B Debentures (as defined below) are then held by Enterprise Capital Trust
II (the "Trust") or the Series B Debentures  are held in  book-entry-only  form,
the Regular  Record Date shall be the close of business on the Business Day next
preceding  such  Interest  Payment  Date.  Any  such  interest  installment  not
punctually  paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name
this  Debenture is registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date
to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined  below) for the payment of such defaulted
interest,  notice  whereof  shall  be  given  to the  Holders  of the  Series  B
Debentures not less than 7 days prior to such Special Record Date, as more fully
provided in the Indenture.
<PAGE>
     Payment of the principal of and interest on this  Debenture will be made in
such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at the time of payment
is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest on
an Interest  Payment Date will be made by check  mailed to the Holder  hereof at
the address  shown in the  Register or, at the option of the Holder  hereof,  to
such  other  place in the  United  States  of  America  as Holder  hereof  shall
designate  to the  Trustee in  writing.  At the  request of a Holder of at least
$10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series B Debentures,  interest on such
Debentures will be payable by wire transfer within the continental United States
in immediately  available funds to the bank account number  specified in writing
by such Holder to the Registrar prior to the Regular Record Date.

     The principal amount hereof and interest due on the Stated Maturity Date or
a Redemption  Date (other than an Interest  Payment Date) will be paid only upon
surrender of this  Debenture at the  principal  corporate  trust office of First
Union National  Bank,  Paying Agent,  in Newark,  NJ, or at such other office or
agency of the Paying Agent as the Company shall  designate by written  notice to
the Holder of this Debenture.

     The indebtedness  evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided in
the Indenture,  subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of all Senior Indebtedness,  and this Debenture is issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  The Holder of this Debenture,
by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions,  (b)
authorizes  and  directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or  appropriate to  acknowledge  or effectuate  the  subordination  so
provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes. The Holder of this Debenture,  by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives
all notice of the acceptance of the  subordination  provisions  contained herein
and in the  Indenture  by  each  holder  of  Senior  Indebtedness,  whether  now
outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives reliance by each such holder upon
said provisions.

     This  Debenture is one of a duly  authorized  series of  Debentures  of the
Company (herein sometimes  referred to as the "Series B Debentures"),  specified
in  the  Indenture,  limited  in  aggregate  principal  amount  to  One  Hundred
Fifty-Four  Million,  Six Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars  ($154,640,000)  issued
under and  pursuant to an  Indenture  dated as of January 1, 1998  executed  and
delivered  between the Company and First Union  National  Bank,  as trustee (the
"Trustee"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June
1, 1998 between the Company and the Trustee (said  Indenture as so  supplemented
being hereinafter  referred to as the "Indenture").  The Series B Debentures are
initially  being  issued to the Trust,  to be held on behalf of the Trust by its
property trustee (the "Property Trustee"). Concurrently with the issuance of the
Series B  Debentures,  the Trust is issuing its trust  securities,  representing
<PAGE>
undivided  beneficial  interests  in the  assets  of the  Trust  and  having  an
aggregate  liquidation  amount  equal to the  principal  amount of the  Series B
Debentures,  including the Trust's  Floating Rate Capital  Securities,  Series B
(the  "Preferred  Securities").  By the terms of the  Indenture,  Debentures are
issuable  in  series  which may vary as to  amount,  date of  maturity,  rate of
interest and in other respects as provided in the  Indenture.  Reference is made
to the Indenture and all  indentures  supplemental  thereto for a description of
the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder
of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Debentures. Each term used in
this  Debenture  which is defined in the Indenture and not defined  herein shall
have the meaning assigned to it in the Indenture.

     The following redemption provisions shall apply to the Series B Debentures:

                             Regular Redemption

     The Series B  Debentures  may be redeemed in whole or part at the option of
the Company at any time on or after June 30, 2003 at a redemption price equal to
100% of the  principal  amount  thereof plus accrued and unpaid  interest to the
redemption date.

                             Special Event Redemption

     If a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event (each, a "Special Event") has
occurred and is continuing,  the Company may redeem the Series B Debentures,  in
whole but not in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal  amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date within 90 days following
the occurrence of such Special Event.

     "Tax  Event"  means  that the  Company  shall have  received  an opinion of
counsel (which may be counsel to the Company or an affiliate but not an employee
thereof and which must be acceptable  to the Property  Trustee)  experienced  in
such  matters to the effect  that,  as a result of any  amendment  to, or change
(including any announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any  regulations
thereunder)  of  the  United  States  or any  political  subdivision  or  taxing
authority thereof or therein affecting taxation,  or as a result of any official
administrative  pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such
laws  or   regulations,   which   amendment  or  change  is  effective  or  such
pronouncement or decision is announced on or after the date of original issuance
of the Series B Capital  Securities,  there is more than an  insubstantial  risk
that (i) the Trust is, or will be, subject to federal income tax with respect to
interest on the Series B Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Company on the
Series B  Debentures  is not,  or will not be,  deductible  by the  Company  for
federal  income tax purposes or (iii) the Trust is, or will be,  subject to more
than  a  de  minimis  amount  of  other  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or  other
governmental charges.
<PAGE>
     "Investment  Company  Event"  means  the  occurrence  of a change in law or
regulation or a change in  interpretation or application of law or regulation by
any legislative  body,  court,  governmental  agency or regulatory  authority (a
"Change in 1940 Act Law") to the effect that the Trust is or will be  considered
an "investment  company" that is required to be registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended,  which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective
on or after the date of original issuance of the Series B Capital Securities.

     At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption  Date, the
Trustee shall mail or caused to be mailed a notice of redemption by  first-class
mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Series B Debentures to be redeemed.

     In the event of redemption  of this  Debenture in part only, a new Series B
Debenture or Debentures for the unredeemed  portion hereof will be issued in the
name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Series B Debentures  occurs
and is  continuing,  the  principal  of and  interest  on  all of the  Series  B
Debentures may (and, in certain circumstances shall) be declared,  and upon such
declaration shall become,  due and payable,  in the manner,  with the effect and
subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

     The Indenture contains  provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire
indebtedness  of this  Debenture  upon  compliance  by the Company  with certain
conditions set forth therein.

     Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture which require the consent of
every  Holder,  the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or may waive
future  compliance by the Company with any  provisions of the Indenture with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of
the  Debentures of each series  affected  thereby  provided that if the Series B
Debentures  are held by the Trust,  no such  amendment or waiver that  adversely
affects the holders of the Preferred  Securities shall be effective  without the
prior  consent of the  holders of at least a majority in  aggregate  liquidation
amount of the outstanding Preferred Securities issued under the Indenture at the
time outstanding.  Subject to certain  exceptions in the Indenture,  without the
consent of any Holder of the Debentures issued under the Indenture,  the Company
and the  Trustee  may  amend  the  Indenture  to cure any  ambiguity,  defect or
inconsistency,  to bind a successor  to the  obligations  of the  Indenture,  to
provide for uncertificated Debentures in addition to certificated Debentures, to
comply with any  requirements  of the Debentures and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the  qualification of the Indenture under the TIA,
or to make any change that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,  does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder of the Debentures. Amendments bind all
Holders and subsequent Holders of Debentures.
<PAGE>

     No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or
the  Indenture  shall alter or impair the  obligation  of the Company,  which is
absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay  the  principal  of and  interest  on this
Debenture  at the  time  and  place  and at the  rate  and in the  money  herein
prescribed.

     So long as an Event of Default with respect to the Series B Debentures  has
not occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and
from  time to time to  extend  the  interest  payment  period  of the  Series  B
Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters (the "Extension Period"),  provided
that no  Extension  Period  shall  extend  beyond  the Stated  Maturity  Date or
Redemption Date of any Series B Debenture.  At the end of the Extension  Period,
the  Company  shall pay all  interest  then  accrued and unpaid  (together  with
interest  thereon at the rate  specified  on a quarterly  basis for the Series B
Debentures,  as described in the Indenture,  compounded quarterly, to the extent
that payment of such interest is enforceable  under applicable law). During such
Extension  Period,  the Company may not declare or pay any dividend on,  redeem,
purchase,  acquire or make a  liquidation  payment  with  respect to, any of its
capital  stock.  Prior to the  termination  of any such  Extension  Period,  the
Company may further  extend such Extension  Period,  provided that such Extended
Interest  Payment Period together with all such previous and further  extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters and shall not extend beyond the
Stated  Maturity  Date or  Redemption  Date of any  Series B  Debenture.  At the
termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of
all amounts  then due,  the Company may elect to begin a new  Extended  Interest
Payment Period, subject to the foregoing restrictions.

     Series B Debentures are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral  multiple  thereof.  As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain  limitations  therein set forth, this Debenture
is exchangeable for a like aggregate  principal amount of Series B Debentures of
a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same.

     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth,  this  Debenture is  transferable  by the Holder hereof upon surrender of
this  Debenture  for  registration  of  transfer  at the office or agency of the
Registrar accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series B Debentures of
authorized  denominations  and for the same aggregate  principal  amount will be
issued to the designated  transferee or  transferees.  No service charge will be
made for any  such  transfer,  but the  Company  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge  payable in relation
thereto.
<PAGE>

     Prior to presentment for  registration  of transfer of this Debenture,  the
Company,  the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Registrar may deem and treat the
Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof  (whether or not this Debenture shall
be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by
anyone other than the Registrar)  for the purpose of receiving  payment of or on
account  of the  principal  hereof  and  interest  due  hereon and for all other
purposes,  and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying  Agent nor any
Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

     No  recourse  shall  be had  for the  payment  of the  principal  of or the
interest on this  Debenture,  or for any claim based  hereon,  or  otherwise  in
respect  hereof,  or  based  on or in  respect  of the  Indenture,  against  any
incorporator,  stockholder,  officer or director,  past,  present or future,  as
such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation,  whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise,  all such liability being, by the acceptance
hereof  and as part of the  consideration  for the  issuance  hereof,  expressly
waived and released.

     This  Debenture  shall not be valid until an  authorized  signatory  of the
Trustee  manually signs and dates the Trustee's  Certificate  of  Authentication
below.


     IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Company has caused  this  Debenture  to be signed
manually or by  facsimile  by a duly  authorized  officer and a facsimile of its
corporate seal to be affixed hereto or imprinted hereon.

     WHEREAS,  the Company  executed and delivered a supplement to the Indenture
(the "First Supplemental  Indenture") dated as of June 1, 1998 providing for the
issuance of its  Floating  Rate  Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures,
Series B.

     WHEREAS,  pursuant to an Amended and Restated Trust  Agreement  dated as of

                  PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED

          7-1/4% Deferrable Interest Subordinated Debenture, Series C


No. R-1

     Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, a New Jersey corporation (the
"Company",  which term  includes any successor  corporation  under the Indenture
hereinafter  referred  to),  for  value  received,  hereby  promises  to  pay to
Enterprise  Capital  Trust III or registered  assigns,  the principal sum of One
Hundred Fifty-Four Million Six Hundred Thirty-Nine  Thousand Two Hundred Dollars
($154,639,200)  on June 30, 2047, and to pay interest on said principal sum from
July 6, 1998 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined below) to
which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly in arrears on March
31, June 30,  September 30 and December 31 commencing  September 30, 1998 (each,
an "Interest  Payment  Date") at a rate of 7-1/4% per annum until the  principal
hereof shall have become due and payable,  and on any overdue  principal and (to
the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on
any overdue  installment  of interest at the same rate per annum.  The amount of
interest  payable on any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In the event that any Interest  Payment
Date is not a Business Day, then interest will be payable on the next succeeding
day which is a  Business  Day (and  without  any  interest  or other  payment in
respect of any such  delay),  except that,  if such  Business Day is in the next
succeeding  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall  be  made  on the  immediately
preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on such date. The interest  installment so payable,  and punctually paid or duly
provided for as provided in the Indenture,  shall be paid to the Person in whose
name this Debenture is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record
Date for such interest installment,  which shall be the 15th day (whether or not
a Business Day) of the last month of each  quarter,  provided that if all of the
Series C Debentures (as defined below) are then held by Enterprise Capital Trust
III (the "Trust") or the Series C Debentures are held in  book-entry-only  form,
the Regular  Record Date shall be the close of business on the Business Day next
preceding  such  Interest  Payment  Date.  Any  such  interest  installment  not
punctually  paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holders on such Regular Record Date, and may be paid to the Person in whose name
this  Debenture is registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date
to be fixed by the Trustee (as defined  below) for the payment of such defaulted
interest,  notice  whereof  shall  be  given  to the  Holders  of the  Series  C
Debentures not less than 7 days prior to such Special Record Date, as more fully
provided in the Indenture.

     Payment of the principal of and interest on this  Debenture will be made in
such coin or currency of the United  States of America as at the time of payment
is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest on
an Interest  Payment Date will be made by check  mailed to the Holder  hereof at
the address  shown in the  Register or, at the option of the Holder  hereof,  to
such  other  place in the  United  States  of  America  as Holder  hereof  shall
designate  to the  Trustee in  writing.  At the  request of a Holder of at least
$10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Series C Debentures,  interest on such
Debentures will be payable by wire transfer within the continental United States
in immediately  available funds to the bank account number  specified in writing
by such Holder to the Registrar prior to the Regular Record Date.
<PAGE>
     The principal amount hereof and interest due on the Stated Maturity Date or
a Redemption  Date (other than an Interest  Payment Date) will be paid only upon
surrender of this  Debenture at the  principal  corporate  trust office of First
Union National  Bank,  Paying Agent,  in Newark,  NJ, or at such other office or
agency of the Paying Agent as the Company shall  designate by written  notice to
the Holder of this Debenture.

     The indebtedness  evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided in
the Indenture,  subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of all Senior Indebtedness,  and this Debenture is issued subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  The Holder of this Debenture,
by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions,  (b)
authorizes  and  directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or  appropriate to  acknowledge  or effectuate  the  subordination  so
provided and (c) appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes. The Holder of this Debenture,  by his acceptance hereof, hereby waives
all notice of the acceptance of the  subordination  provisions  contained herein
and in the  Indenture  by  each  holder  of  Senior  Indebtedness,  whether  now
outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives reliance by each such holder upon
said provisions.

     This  Debenture is one of a duly  authorized  series of  Debentures  of the
Company (herein sometimes  referred to as the "Series C Debentures"),  specified
in  the  Indenture,  limited  in  aggregate  principal  amount  to  One  Hundred
Fifty-Four  Million,  Six  Hundred  Thirty-Nine  Thousand  Two  Hundred  Dollars
($154,639,200)  issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated as of January 1,
1998 executed and delivered  between the Company and First Union  National Bank,
as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture
dated as of June 1, 1998 and the  Second  Supplemental  Indenture  dated July 1,
1998  between the Company and the Trustee  (said  Indenture  as so  supplemented
being hereinafter  referred to as the "Indenture").  The Series C Debentures are
initially  being  issued to the Trust,  to be held on behalf of the Trust by its
property trustee (the "Property Trustee"). Concurrently with the issuance of the
Series C  Debentures,  the Trust is issuing its trust  securities,  representing
undivided  beneficial  interests  in the  assets  of the  Trust  and  having  an
aggregate  liquidation  amount  equal to the  principal  amount of the  Series C
Debentures,  including the Trust's 7-1/4% Trust Originated Preferred Securities,
Series C (the "Preferred Securities"). By the terms of the Indenture, Debentures
are  issuable in series which may vary as to amount,  date of maturity,  rate of
interest and in other respects as provided in the  Indenture.  Reference is made
to the Indenture and all  indentures  supplemental  thereto for a description of
the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder
of the Trustee, the Company and the Holders of the Debentures. Each term used in
this  Debenture  which is defined in the Indenture and not defined  herein shall
have the meaning assigned to it in the Indenture.

     The following redemption provisions shall apply to the Series C Debentures:

     Regular Redemption
     ------------------

     The Series C  Debentures  may be redeemed in whole or part at the option of
the Company at any time on or after June 30, 2003 at a redemption price equal to
100% of the  principal  amount  thereof plus accrued and unpaid  interest to the
redemption date.

     Special Event Redemption
     ------------------------

     If a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event (each, a "Special Event") has
occurred and is continuing,  the Company may redeem the Series C Debentures,  in
whole but not in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal  amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date within 90 days following
the occurrence of such Special Event.
<PAGE>
     "Tax  Event"  means  that the  Company  shall have  received  an opinion of
counsel (which may be counsel to the Company or an affiliate but not an employee
thereof and which must be acceptable  to the Property  Trustee)  experienced  in
such  matters to the effect  that,  as a result of any  amendment  to, or change
(including any announced  prospective  change) in, the laws (or any  regulations
thereunder)  of  the  United  States  or any  political  subdivision  or  taxing
authority thereof or therein affecting taxation,  or as a result of any official
administrative  pronouncement or judicial decision interpreting or applying such
laws  or   regulations,   which   amendment  or  change  is  effective  or  such
pronouncement or decision is announced on or after the date of original issuance
of the Series C Preferred  Securities,  there is more than an insubstantial risk
that (i) the Trust is, or will be, subject to federal income tax with respect to
interest on the Series C Debentures, (ii) interest payable by the Company on the
Series C  Debentures  is not,  or will not be,  deductible  by the  Company  for
federal  income tax purposes or (iii) the Trust is, or will be,  subject to more
than  a  de  minimis  amount  of  other  taxes,  duties,  assessments  or  other
governmental charges.

     "Investment  Company  Event"  means  the  occurrence  of a change in law or
regulation or a change in  interpretation or application of law or regulation by
any legislative  body,  court,  governmental  agency or regulatory  authority (a
"Change in 1940 Act Law") to the effect that the Trust is or will be  considered
an "investment  company" that is required to be registered  under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended,  which Change in 1940 Act Law becomes effective
on or after the date of original issuance of the Series C Preferred Securities.

     At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption  Date, the
Trustee shall mail or caused to be mailed a notice of redemption by  first-class
mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder of Series C Debentures to be redeemed.

     In the event of redemption  of this  Debenture in part only, a new Series C
Debenture or Debentures for the unredeemed  portion hereof will be issued in the
name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Series C Debentures  occurs
and is  continuing,  the  principal  of and  interest  on  all of the  Series  C
Debentures may (and, in certain circumstances shall) be declared,  and upon such
declaration shall become,  due and payable,  in the manner,  with the effect and
subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

     The Indenture contains  provisions for defeasance at any time of the entire
indebtedness  of this  Debenture  upon  compliance  by the Company  with certain
conditions set forth therein.

     Subject to certain exceptions in the Indenture which require the consent of
every  Holder,  the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or may waive
future  compliance by the Company with any  provisions of the Indenture with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of
the  Debentures of each series  affected  thereby  provided that if the Series C
Debentures  are held by the Trust,  no such  amendment or waiver that  adversely
affects the holders of the Preferred  Securities shall be effective  without the
prior  consent of the  holders of at least a majority in  aggregate  liquidation
amount of the outstanding Preferred Securities issued under the Indenture at the
time outstanding.  Subject to certain  exceptions in the Indenture,  without the
consent of any Holder of the Debentures issued under the Indenture,  the Company
and the  Trustee  may  amend  the  Indenture  to cure any  ambiguity,  defect or
inconsistency,  to bind a successor  to the  obligations  of the  Indenture,  to
provide for uncertificated Debentures in addition to certificated Debentures, to
comply with any  requirements  of the Debentures and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the  qualification of the Indenture under the TIA,
or to make any change that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company,  does not
adversely affect the rights of any Holder of the Debentures. Amendments bind all
Holders and subsequent Holders of Debentures.
<PAGE>

     No reference  herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or
the  Indenture  shall alter or impair the  obligation  of the Company,  which is
absolute  and  unconditional,  to pay  the  principal  of and  interest  on this
Debenture  at the  time  and  place  and at the  rate  and in the  money  herein
prescribed.

     So long as an Event of Default with respect to the Series C Debentures  has
not occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time and
from  time to time to  extend  the  interest  payment  period  of the  Series  C
Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters (the "Extension Period"),  provided
that no  Extension  Period  shall  extend  beyond  the Stated  Maturity  Date or
Redemption Date of any Series C Debenture.  At the end of the Extension  Period,
the  Company  shall pay all  interest  then  accrued and unpaid  (together  with
interest  thereon at the rate  specified  on a quarterly  basis for the Series C
Debentures,  as described in the Indenture,  compounded quarterly, to the extent
that payment of such interest is enforceable  under applicable law). During such
Extension  Period,  the Company may not declare or pay any dividend on,  redeem,
purchase,  acquire or make a  liquidation  payment  with  respect to, any of its
capital  stock.  Prior to the  termination  of any such  Extension  Period,  the
Company may further  extend such Extension  Period,  provided that such Extended
Interest  Payment Period together with all such previous and further  extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarters and shall not extend beyond the
Stated  Maturity  Date or  Redemption  Date of any  Series C  Debenture.  At the
termination of any such Extended Interest Payment Period and upon the payment of
all amounts  then due,  the Company may elect to begin a new  Extended  Interest
Payment Period, subject to the foregoing restrictions.

     Series C Debentures are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations  of $25 and any  integral  multiple  thereof.  As  provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain  limitations  therein set forth, this Debenture
is exchangeable for a like aggregate  principal amount of Series C Debentures of
a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the
same.

     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth,  this  Debenture is  transferable  by the Holder hereof upon surrender of
this  Debenture  for  registration  of  transfer  at the office or agency of the
Registrar accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series C Debentures of
authorized  denominations  and for the same aggregate  principal  amount will be
issued to the designated  transferee or  transferees.  No service charge will be
made for any  such  transfer,  but the  Company  may  require  payment  of a sum
sufficient  to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge  payable in relation
thereto.

     Prior to presentment for  registration  of transfer of this Debenture,  the
Company,  the Trustee, any Paying Agent and any Registrar may deem and treat the
Holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof  (whether or not this Debenture shall
be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing hereon made by

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                  AGREEMENT,  by and between  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group
Incorporated,  a New Jersey Corporation ("Enterprise") and E. James Ferland (the
"Executive"), dated as of June 16, 1998.

                  WHEREAS, the Executive is currently serving as Chairman of the
Board,  President and Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise,  and as Chairman of
the  Board  and Chief  Executive  Officer  of its  subsidiaries  Public  Service
Electric and Gas Company ("PSE&G"),  a New Jersey  corporation,  and PSEG Energy
Holdings  Inc.  ("Energy  Holdings"),   a  New  Jersey  corporation,   all  such
corporations hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company".

                  WHEREAS,  the  Executive  is willing to commit  himself to  be
employed by the Company on the terms and conditions herein set forth; and

                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions for the  employment  relationship  of the
Executive  with  the  Company  during  the  Employment  Period  (as  hereinafter
defined):

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN  CONSIDERATION  of the  mutual  premises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.       General.

                  (a)  Employment.  The Company  agrees to employ the Executive,
and the Executive  agrees to be employed by the Company,  in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

                  (b) Term. The term of the  Executive's  employment  under this
Agreement  (the  "Employment  Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the
"Effective  Date") and shall  continue  until March 31, 2005.  If the  Executive
elects to retire prior to March 31, 2005, the Employment Period shall end on the
date of retirement.

                  2.       Position, Duties and Powers of the Executive.

                   (a) Position.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise.

                  (b) Reporting Duties and Powers. During the Employment Period,
the Executive shall report directly to the Board of Directors of Enterprise (the
"Board").  As Chief  Executive  Officer of  Enterprise,  he shall be the highest
ranking  officer  of  Enterprise  with  plenary  powers of the  supervision  and
direction of the business and affairs of  Enterprise  and its  subsidiaries  and
affiliates.

                  (c) End of  Employment  Period.  At the end of the  Employment
Period (the "Retirement  Date"), the Executive will retire from all offices held
with the  Company  and  shall be  entitled  to a  pension  unreduced  for  early
retirement  and calculated in accordance  with Section 3(f) hereof  (hereinafter
referred to as "Retirement").

                  (d) Board Membership. The Executive shall continue as a member
of and Chairman of the Board on the first day of the  Employment  Period through
the end of his current term ending with the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  in
2001. Thereafter,  the Board shall consider the Executive for re-election to the
Board throughout the Employment Period in accordance with its customary practice
for  nominations  to the Board,  and shall  elect him  Chairman  of the Board if
elected as a director by the shareholders.  At the end of the Employment Period,
the  Executive  may  continue  as a member of the Board  and be  considered  for
nomination for reelection to the Board thereafter on the same basis as the other
directors who are former CEOs, in accordance with the Board's customary practice
for nominations and its Retirement Policy.

                  (e) Other  Positions.  In addition to serving as Chairman  and
Chief Executive  Officer of Enterprise,  the Executive is also presently serving
as  President  of  Enterprise  and as Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive
Officer of PSE&G and Energy Holdings. The Executive agrees to serve, if elected,
at no  additional  compensation  in the  position  of officer or director of any
direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company.

                  (f) Attention. During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of  vacation  and sick leave to which the  Executive  is  entitled,  the
Executive  agrees to devote full attention and time during normal business hours
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and to use his  reasonable  best
efforts to perform such  responsibilities in a professional manner. It shall not
be a violation of this  Agreement  for the  Executive to (i) serve on corporate,
civic or  charitable  boards  or  committees,  (ii)  deliver  lectures,  fulfill
speaking  engagements  or teach at  educational  institutions  and (iii)  manage
personal  investments,  so long as such  activities  do not  interfere  with the
performance of the  Executive's  responsibilities  as an officer and director of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

                  3.       Compensation.

                  Except  as  modified  by  this   Agreement,   the  Executive's
compensation  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with the  Company's  standard
compensation and payroll practices as in effect from time to time. The aggregate
of Base Salary,  Annual  Incentive  Compensation  and  Long-Term  Incentives  in
paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive
practices  for chief  executive  officers of  companies of  comparable  size and
standing.

                  (a) Base Salary. The annual rate of base salary payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
established by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee").  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible  increase at least
annually.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced after any such increase,  and
the term "Annual Base Salary" shall  thereafter  refer to the Annual Base Salary
as so increased.

                  (b) Annual Incentive  Compensation.  The Board has established
and intends to continue an annual incentive compensation plan for the benefit of
the officers and other key employees of the Company,  including  the  Executive,
based on  competitive  practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.
The  performance  objectives for the Executive in respect of such incentive will
be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

                  (c)  Long-Term  Incentives.  The  Board  has  established  and
intends to continue a long-term  incentive  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices for companies of comparable size and standing.  Such plan
may, in the judgment of the Compensation  Committee,  provide for stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or
units and/or other type of long-term  incentive  awards.  The type and amount of
equity  and any other  long-term  incentive  grants  will be  determined  by the
Compensation Committee from time to time, and awards thereunder shall be payable
to the Executive in accordance  with the  long-term  incentive  plan or plans in
effect from time to time.

         (d) Stock Award.  In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will assume
during  the  Employment  Period,  the  Executive  shall be granted an award (the
"Stock  Award")  with  respect to 150,000  shares of the  Common  Stock  without
nominal or par value of  Enterprise  ("Stock"),  effective  as of the  Effective
Date,  the shares of which Stock Award shall be restricted  and shall be subject
to the following terms and conditions:

                  (i) The  shares  for the Stock  Award  shall be  purchased  by
         Enterprise  or its  agent on the open  market.  In the event any of the
         shares of the Stock Award shall be forfeited, Enterprise may apply such
         shares for its corporate purposes in its discretion.

                  (ii) The  Executive's  right to the Stock  Award shall vest in
         accordance with the following schedule, provided that the Executive has
         remained continuously employed by the Company, or its successor, during
         the Employment Period through the dates indicated below:

                       Date                     Number of Shares
                    3/31/2002                        60,000
                    3/31/2003                        20,000
                    3/31/2004                        30,000
                    3/31/2005                        40,000

         If,  during  the  Employment   Period,   the  Company   terminates  the
         Executive's  employment  for  Cause  or the  Executive  terminates  his
         employment without Good Reason, including Retirement prior to March 31,
         2005, the Executive  shall forfeit all right to all shares of the Stock
         Award that are not vested as of the Date of Termination. If, during the
         Employment   Period,   the  Company  shall  terminate  the  Executive's
         employment without Cause or the Executive terminates his employment for
         Good Reason,  or the  Executive's  Employment  terminates  by reason of
         death or Disability, the Executive's right to receive all shares of the
         Stock Award shall vest as of the Date of Termination.

         (iii)  Shares  of the  Stock  Award  will be  issued in the name of the
         Executive,  but  will be  held by  Enterprise  for the  account  of the
         Executive  together with a stock power that the Executive shall execute
         and deliver to Enterprise.  The shares shall bear a restrictive  legend
         indicating  that  they  are  subject  to  the  terms,   conditions  and
         limitations of this Agreement.

         (iv) Once  shares of the  Stock  Award  shall  vest,  Enterprise  shall
         promptly  issue to the Executive a certificate  for such shares without
         any  legend or  restriction  (other  than may be  required  by law) and
         Enterprise  shall return to the  Executive or shall destroy the related
         stock power previously executed by the Executive.

         (v) Shares of Stock held by Enterprise for the account of the Executive
         prior  to  distribution  to the  Executive  may not be  sold  assigned,
         transferred,  pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of, except by
         will or the laws of  descent  and  distribution.  Any  attempted  sale,
         assignment,   transfer,   pledge,   hypothecation   or  disposition  in
         contravention of the foregoing shall be null and void and of no effect.

         (vi) Except as otherwise  provided herein, the Executive shall have all
         of the rights of a stockholder  with respect to the shares of the Stock
         Award issued in his name,  including  the right to vote the shares,  to
         receive dividends and other distributions thereon and to participate in
         any change in capitalization of Enterprise.  In the event of any change
         in capitalization resulting in the issuance of additional shares to the
         Executive,  such shares shall be subject to the same terms,  conditions
         and restrictions as the shares in respect to which they are issued, and
         the Executive  shall execute and deliver to Enterprise  stock powers in
         respect thereto.  If the Executive elects to reinvest  dividends on the
         shares of the Stock Award, or if he shall receive rights or warrants in
         respect  to any  shares of the Stock  Award,  the  shares  acquired  by
         dividend  reinvestment  or through the  exercise of rights may be held,
         sold or otherwise  disposed of by the Executive,  free and clear of any
         restrictions created by this Agreement.

         (vii)  Unless  the  shares  of the  Stock  Award  to be  issued  to the
         Executive have been  registered  pursuant to a  Registration  Statement
         under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  prior to receiving such shares the
         Executive  shall  represent  in writing to the Company that such shares
         are being  acquired for  investment  purposes  only and not with a view
         towards  the further  sale or  distribution  thereof  and shall  supply
         Enterprise  with  such  other  documentation  as  may  be  required  by
         Enterprise,  unless in the  opinion of counsel to the  Enterprise  such
         representation,  agreement or  documentation is not necessary to comply
         with  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
         thereunder.

         (viii)  Enterprise  shall not be  required to deliver any shares of the
         Stock Award until they have been listed on each securities  exchange on
         which  shares  of  the  Stock  are  listed  or  until  there  has  been
         qualification  under or  compliance  with such state and federal  laws,
         rules or regulations  that Enterprise may deem  applicable.  Enterprise
         will use its best  efforts to obtain such  listing,  qualification  and
         compliance.

         (ix) The Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
         steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of
         any taxes that the  Company is  required  by law or  regulation  of any
         governmental  authority,  whether federal,  state or local, domestic or
         foreign, to withhold in connection with the Stock Award, including, but
         not limited to (1)  withholding  delivery of the certificate for shares
         of Stock until the Executive  reimburses  the Company for the amount it
         is required to withhold  with respect to such taxes,  (2) the canceling
         of any number of shares of Stock issuable to the Executive in an amount
         necessary to reimburse  the Company for the amount it is required to so
         withhold,  or (3) withholding the amount due from the Executive's other
         compensation.

                  (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment  Period,
(i) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement
plans,  practices,  policies  and  programs to the same  extent as other  senior
executives of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all
benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices,  policies and programs provided
by the Company, other than severance plans, practices, policies and programs but
including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary
continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and
as supplemented  hereby.  Following a Change in Control (as defined  below),  no
benefit coverage  available to the Executive and/or to his family under any such
plan, practice,  policy or program shall be materially reduced without the prior
written consent of the Executive.

                  (f)  Retirement  Benefit.  During the Employment  Period,  the
Executive shall participate in PSE&G's Pension Plan, and also in PSE&G's Limited
Supplemental  Benefits Plan,  Mid-Career Hire Plan,  Reinstatement Plan and such
other supplemental  executive  retirement plans as may be adopted and amended by
the Company from time to time  ("SERPs"),  such that the aggregate  value of the
retirement benefits that he and his beneficiaries will receive at the end of the
Employment  Period  under  all  pension  benefit  plans of the  Company  and its
affiliates  (whether  qualified  or not) will not be less than the  benefits  he
would have received had he continued,  through the end of the Employment Period,
to participate in such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof
and giving effect to the service  credits and payment terms set forth in Section
4 of the  employment  agreement  dated  April  16,  1986  between  PSE&G and the
Executive (the "PSE&G Employment  Agreement"),  the terms of which Section 4 are
incorporated herein by reference, and a copy of which PSE&G Employment Agreement
is attached hereto. It is agreed that the Stock Award and any dividends or other
distributions in respect of the Stock Award shall not be included in any pension
calculation.

                  (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable
expenses in carrying out his duties and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such expenses in accordance
with the  policies of the Company in effect from time to time for  reimbursement
of expenses for senior executives,  and subject to documentation provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

                  (h)  Fringe  Benefits.   During  the  Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall be furnished with such fringe  benefits and  perquisites as are
customary for the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer of a corporation of the
size and nature of the Company and shall  participate in all fringe benefits and
perquisites  available  to  senior  executives  of  the  Company  on  terms  and
conditions that are commensurate with his positions and  responsibilities at the
Company.

                  (i)  Vacation.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall be entitled to paid  vacation in  accordance  with Company  policy for its
most senior executives as in effect from time to time.

                  (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive  will retain all of
his rights in any  compensation  deferred prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Deferred  Compensation Plan,  including earnings thereon, and following
the date hereof the  obligations of PSE&G to pay such deferred  compensation  at
the times and in the manner  specified  in the Deferred  Compensation  Plan will
continue.



                  4.       Termination of Employment.

                  (a) Death or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable disability plan for senior executives.

                  (b)      By the Company.

                  (i) The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment
during the Employment  Period for Cause or without  Cause.  For purposes of this
Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (A) willful and continued failure by the Executive
to  substantially  perform  his duties  under this  Agreement,  (B) the  willful
engaging  by  the  Executive  in  gross   misconduct  which  is  materially  and
demonstrably injurious to the Company, or (C) the conviction of the Executive of
a  felony.  No act or  failure  to act on the  part of the  Executive  shall  be
considered  "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive
in bad  faith or  without  reasonable  belief  that the  Executive's  action  or
omission was in the best  interests  of the  Company.  Any act or failure to act
that is based upon authority  given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the
Board, or the advice of counsel for the Company,  shall be conclusively presumed
to be done,  or omitted to be done,  by the  Executive  in good faith and in the
best interests of the Company.

                  (ii) A termination  of the  Executive's  employment  for Cause
shall be effected in accordance with the following procedures. The Company shall
give the Executive  written notice  ("Notice of  Termination  for Cause") of its
intention to terminate the  Executive's  employment for Cause,  setting forth in
reasonable  detail the specific  conduct of the  Executive  that it considers to
constitute  Cause and the specific  provision(s)  of this  Agreement on which it
relies.  Such  notice  shall be given no  later  than 60 days  after  the act or
failure (or the last in a series of acts or failures)  that the Company  alleges
to constitute Cause. The Executive shall have 30 days after receiving the Notice
of  Termination  for Cause in which to cure such act or  failure,  to the extent
such cure is possible.  In the case of a termination under Section 4(b)(i)(A) or
Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to cure such act or failure to the
reasonable  satisfaction  of the Board,  the Company  shall give the Executive a
second written notice stating the date,  time and place of a special  meeting of
the Board  called  and held  specifically  for the  purpose of  considering  the
Executive's  termination  for Cause,  which special meeting shall take place not
less  than ten and not more  than  twenty  business  days  after  the  Executive
receives  notice  thereof,  and the  Executive  shall be  given an  opportunity,
together  with  counsel,  to be heard at the special  meeting of the Board.  The
Executive's termination for Cause shall be effective when and if a resolution is
duly adopted by the affirmative  vote of a majority of the Board stating that in
the good faith  opinion of the Board,  the  Executive  is guilty of the  conduct
described  in the  Notice  of  Termination  for  Cause  and  that  such  conduct
constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Good Reason.

                  (i) The Executive may terminate his employment for Good Reason
or without Good Reason. For purpose of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                  (A) any adverse change in the Executive's  titles,  authority,
         duties,  responsibilities  and reporting lines as specified in Sections
         2(a) and 2(b) of this Agreement,  or the assignment to the Executive of
         any duties or  responsibilities  inconsistent in any respect with those
         customarily  associated with the position of Chief Executive Officer of
         Enterprise to be held by the Executive pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (B) the  failure  by the Board to elect the  Executive  to the
         positions of Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer of Enterprise during
         the Employment Period;

                  (C) the failure by the Board to  nominate  the  Executive  for
         reelection  to  the  Board  at  any  annual  meeting  of   Enterprise's
         shareholders during the Employment Period at which the Executive's term
         as a director is scheduled to expire,  and if elected a director by the
         shareholders, to elect the Executive as Chairman of the Board;

                  (D) the  appointment at any time during the Employment  Period
         of any person other than the Executive to (x) the position specified in
         Section  2(a) or (y) any other  position  or title  conferring  similar
         status or authority;

                  (E) any  reduction in the  Executive's  salary,  target annual
         bonus, target long-term incentive or Retirement benefit;

                  (F)  any  requirement  by the  Company  that  the  Executive's
         services be rendered primarily at a location or locations other than in
         New Jersey;

                  (G) any purported termination of the Executive's employment by
         the Company for a reason or in a manner not expressly permitted by this
         Agreement;

                  (H) any failure by  Enterprise to comply with Section 10(c) of
this Agreement; or

                  (I) any other material breach of this Agreement by the Company
         that either is not taken in good faith or, even if taken in good faith,
         is not remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof
         from the Executive;

provided that following a Change in Control which is recommended to the Board by
the  Executive,  Sections  4(c)(i)(A),  (B),  (C) and (D) shall not  permit  the
Executive  to  terminate  his  employment  for Good Reason so long as during the
remainder of the  Employment  Period,  the Board  nominates  the  Executive as a
director of the  surviving  parent  corporation,  his office with the  surviving
parent  corporation is Chairman,  Vice Chairman or President,  and his executive
position with the surviving  parent  corporation is Chief  Executive  Officer or
Chief Operating Officer;  and the provisions of Sections 2(a), (b) and (d) shall
be deemed modified to reflect such offices,  positions and duties as are so held
by the Executive.

Following  a Change in Control,  the  Executive's  determination  that an act or
failure to act  constitutes  Good Reason  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be
valid unless such  determination  is decided to be unreasonable by an arbitrator
pursuant to Section 9.

                  (ii) A  termination  of  employment  by the Executive for Good
         Reason  shall be  effectuated  by giving  the  Company  written  notice
         ("Notice of Termination for Good Reason") of the  termination,  setting
         forth in  reasonable  detail  the  specific  acts or  omissions  of the
         Company that  constitute  Good Reason and the specific  provision(s) of
         this  Agreement  on  which  the  Executive  relies.  Unless  the  Board
         determines  otherwise,  a Notice of Termination  for Good Reason by the
         Executive  must be made  within 60 days after the  Executive  first has
         actual  knowledge  of the act or  omission  (or the last in a series of
         acts or  omissions)  that the  Executive  alleges  to  constitute  Good
         Reason,  and the  Company  shall have 30 days from the  receipt of such
         Notice  of  Termination  for  Good  Reason  to cure the  conduct  cited
         therein.  A termination  of employment by the Executive for Good Reason
         shall be effective  on the final day of such 30-day cure period  unless
         prior to such time the Company has cured the specific  conduct asserted
         by  the  Executive  to  constitute   Good  Reason  to  the   reasonable
         satisfaction of the Executive.

                  (iii)  A  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  by the
         Executive  without  Good Reason shall be effected by giving the Company
         written notice specifying the effective date of termination.

                  (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of Termination"  means the
date of the Executive's death, the Disability  Effective Date, the date on which
the  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  for Cause or
without Cause or by the  Executive  for Good Reason is effective,  the effective
date  specified in a notice of a termination  of employment  without Good Reason
from the Executive to the Company, or Retirement, as the case may be.

                  5. Obligations of the Company upon Termination.

                  (a)  Good  Reason;  Other  Than  for  Cause.  If,  during  the
Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's  employment other
than for Cause,  death or  Disability,  or the  Executive  shall  terminate  his
employment for Good Reason:

                  (i) the Company  shall pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in
         cash,  within 15 days after the Date of  Termination,  the aggregate of
         the amounts set forth in clauses A and B below:

                  A.       The sum of:

                           (1)      the Executive's Annual Base Salary through
                                    the Date of Termination;

                           (2)      the product of (x) the "target" annual bonus
                                    under Section 3(b) (the "Target  Bonus") and
                                    (y) a fraction,  the  numerator  of which is
                                    the number of days in the  current  calendar
                                    year  through the Date of  Termination,  and
                                    the denominator of which is 365; and

                           (3)      any accrued vacation pay;

                  in each case to the  extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of
                  the amounts  described  in clauses  (1),  (2) and (3) shall be
                  hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                  B.       the amount equal to the product of (1) two and (2)
                           the sum of (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and
                           (y) the Target Bonus.

                  (ii)     the Stock Award shall vest in accordance with
                           3(d)(ii);

                  (iii) any stock  awards,  other  than the Stock  Award,  stock
         options,  stock appreciation  rights or other equity-based  awards that
         were outstanding  immediately prior to the Date of Termination  ("Prior
         Equity  Awards")  shall remain  outstanding  and shall continue to vest
         and/or become exercisable as though the Executive's  employment had not
         terminated until the later of (x) the third  anniversary of the Date of
         Termination  and (y) 90 days from the date that a stock option or other
         award (or portion  thereof) first becomes  exercisable  but in no event
         beyond the original term  thereof,  and the Company shall take all such
         actions as may be necessary to effectuate the foregoing;

                  (iv) for two years after the  Executive's  Date of Termination
         or  such  longer  period  as  may  be  provided  by  the  terms  of the
         appropriate  plan,  program,  practice  or policy,  the  Company  shall
         continue  benefits to the Executive  and/or the  Executive's  family at
         least  equal  to  those  which  would  have  been  provided  to them in
         accordance  with the welfare  plans,  programs,  practices and policies
         described  in  Section  3(e)  of  this  Agreement  if  the  Executive's
         employment  had  not  been  terminated  or,  if more  favorable  to the
         Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with respect
         to other peer  executives of the Company and its  affiliated  companies
         and their families,  provided  however,  that if the Executive  becomes
         reemployed with another  employer and is eligible to receive medical or
         dental benefits under another  employer  provided plan, the medical and
         dental benefits  described  herein shall be secondary to those provided
         under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility.

                  (v) any compensation  previously deferred (other than pursuant
         to a  tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the  Executive  (together
         with any accrued  interest or  earnings  thereon),  whether or not then
         vested,  shall become  vested on the Date of  Termination  and shall be
         paid in accordance with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under
         which it was deferred;

                  (vi) the  Company  shall,  at its sole  expense  as  incurred,
         provide  the  Executive  with  outplacement  services  suitable  to the
         Executive's  position  for a period  not to  exceed  two  years  with a
         nationally recognized outplacement firm; and,

                  (vii) to the  extent not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the
         Company  shall pay or provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
         benefits  required  to be paid or provided  or which the  Executive  is
         entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract
         or agreement of the Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than
         medical  or dental  benefits  if the  Executive  is  eligible  for such
         benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer), including earned but
         unpaid stock and similar  compensation but excluding any severance plan
         or  policy  (such  other  amounts  and  benefits  shall be  hereinafter
         referred to as the "Other Benefits").

                  (b) Cause;  Other  than for Good  Reason.  If the  Executive's
         employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment  Period,
         or if  the  Executive  voluntarily  terminates  employment  during  the
         Employment  Period,  excluding  a  resignation  for Good  Reason,  this
         Agreement shall terminate without further  obligations to the Executive
         other  than  for  amounts  described  in  Sections   5(a)(i)(A)(1)  and
         5(a)(i)(A)(3) and the timely payment or provision of Other Benefits. In
         such case,  all such amounts  shall be paid to the  Executive in a lump
         sum within 30 days of the Date of Termination.

                  (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment terminates by reason
         of the  Executive's  death during the  Employment  Period,  all Accrued
         Obligations  as of the time of death  shall be paid to the  Executive's
         estate or beneficiary,  as applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within 30
         days  of  the  Date  of  Termination  and  the  Executive's  estate  or
         beneficiary  shall be entitled to any Other Benefits in accordance with
         their terms. In addition, the Stock Award shall vest in accordance with
         3(d)(ii). Any Prior Equity Awards shall vest and/or become exercisable,
         as the case may be, as of the Date of Termination  and the  Executive's
         estate  or  beneficiary,  as the case may be,  shall  have the right to
         exercise  any such  stock  option,  stock  appreciation  right or other
         exercisable  equity-based  award until the earlier of (A) one year from
         the Date of Termination (or such longer period as may be provided under
         the terms of any such stock option,  stock  appreciation right or other
         equity-based  award) and (B) the normal  expiration  date of such stock
         option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award.

                  (d) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
         reason  of  Disability  during  the  Employment   Period,  all  Accrued
         Obligations shall be paid to the Executive in a lump sum in cash within
         30 days of the Date of Termination, and the Executive shall be entitled
         to any Other Benefits in accordance with their terms. In addition,  the
         Stock Award shall vest in accordance  with  3(d)(ii).  Any Prior Equity
         Awards shall vest immediately  and/or become  exercisable,  as the case
         may be, and the  Executive  shall have the right to  exercise  any such
         stock   option,   stock   appreciation   right  or  other   exercisable
         equity-based  award  until the earlier of (A) one year from the Date of
         Termination  (or such longer period as may be provided  under the terms
         of  any  such  stock  option,   stock   appreciation   right  or  other
         equity-based  award) and (B) the normal  expiration  date of such stock
         option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award.

                  (e) Retirement.  If the Executive's  employment  terminates at
         the  expiration  of the  Employment  Period (or at any earlier  date at
         which  the  Executive  elects  to  retire  under  any  retirement  plan
         maintained  by the Company),  the  Executive  shall be paid the Accrued
         Obligations  in a lump  sum in  cash  within  30  days  of the  Date of
         Termination  and the Executive  shall be entitled to any Other Benefits
         in accordance with their terms. Upon the Executive's retirement, unless
         the Board  otherwise  determines,  there  shall be no  acceleration  of
         vesting of any portion of the Stock Award not yet earned. The Executive
         agrees not to retire  (except  for any  Disability)  prior to March 31,
         2002.

                  6.       Change in Control.

                  (a) Benefits Upon a Change in Control.  Upon the occurrence of
a Change in Control during the Employment Period, the Stock Award shall continue
in effect and vest (or be  forfeited)  in  accordance  with  provisions  of this
Agreement  as  though no  Change  in  Control  had  occurred,  except  that,  as
appropriate, the shares of Stock of the Stock Award shall be treated the same as
all  other  shares  of  Stock  of  Enterprise.  The  Executive's  rights  upon a
termination of employment that occurs  following a Change in Control shall be as
specified in Section 5 generally for  termination of employment,  except (i) the
amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall  be  three  times  the  sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period, and (iii) the Executive shall be paid within 15 days after the Date
of Termination, an amount equal to the excess of

                           (A) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the
                  Company's applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan
                  in which the Executive is participating  immediately  prior to
                  his Date of Termination (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing the
                  rate  used  to   determine   lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent
                  applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions no less favorable to
                  the Executive than those in effect under the  Retirement  Plan
                  immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement), any SERPs in
                  which  the   Executive   participates   and,   to  the  extent
                  applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement
                  between  the  Executive  and  the  Company   ("Other   Pension
                  Benefits")   which  the   Executive   would   receive  if  the
                  Executive's  employment  continued for three  additional years
                  beyond the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that
                  all accrued benefits are fully vested,  and, assuming that the
                  Executive's compensation for such deemed additional period was
                  the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect  immediately
                  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
                  year during such deemed  additional period equal to the Target
                  Bonus, over

                           (B)  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  Executive's
                  actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement
                  Plan,  the SERPs and Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of
                  Termination  (utilizing  the rate used to determine  lump sums
                  and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial assumptions no
                  less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
                  Retirement  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  date  of  this
                  Agreement).

                  (b) Definition.  For purposes of this Agreement,  a "Change in
Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events after the date
of this Agreement:

                  (i) any "person"  (within the meaning of Section  13(d) of the
         Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is or
         becomes the beneficial owner within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
         Exchange  Act  (a  "Beneficial  Owner"),  directly  or  indirectly,  of
         securities of Enterprise (not including in the securities  beneficially
         owned by such person any securities  acquired  directly from Enterprise
         or its  affiliates)  representing  25% or more of the  combined  voting
         power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities, excluding any person
         who becomes such a Beneficial  Owner in  connection  with a transaction
         described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

                  (ii)  the  following  individuals  cease  for  any  reason  to
         constitute  a majority of the number of directors  of  Enterprise  then
         serving: individuals who, on the date of this Agreement, constitute the
         Board  and  any new  director  (other  than a  director  whose  initial
         assumption  of office  is in  connection  with an actual or  threatened
         election contest,  including but not limited to a consent solicitation,
         relating to the election of directors of Enterprise)  whose appointment
         or election by the Board or  nomination  for  election by  Enterprise's
         stockholders  was  approved  or  recommended  by a  vote  of  at  least
         two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were
         directors  on  the  date  hereof  or  whose  appointment,  election  or
         nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

                  (iii)  there is  consummated  a  merger  or  consolidation  of
         Enterprise  or  any  direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
         Enterprise  with any  other  corporation,  other  than (A) a merger  or
         consolidation which would result in the voting securities of Enterprise
         outstanding   immediately   prior  to  such  merger  or   consolidation
         continuing to represent  (either by remaining  outstanding  or by being
         converted into voting  securities of the surviving entity or any parent
         thereof),  in  combination  with the  ownership of any trustee or other
         fiduciary  holding   securities  under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of
         Enterprise  or  any  subsidiary  of  Enterprise,  at  least  75% of the
         combined voting power of the securities of Enterprise or such surviving
         entity or any parent thereof outstanding  immediately after such merger
         or  consolidation,  or  (B)  a  merger  or  consolidation  effected  to
         implement a recapitalization of Enterprise (or similar  transaction) in
         which no  person  is or  becomes  the  Beneficial  Owner,  directly  or
         indirectly, of securities of Enterprise representing 25% or more of the
         combined voting power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

                  (iv) the shareholders of Enterprise approve a plan of complete
         liquidation  or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is  consummated an
         agreement  for  the  sale  or  disposition  by  Enterprise  of  all  or
         substantially  all  of  Enterprise's  assets,  other  than  a  sale  or
         disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of Enterprise's
         assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the combined  voting power of the
         voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders of Enterprise in
         substantially  the same  proportions  as their  ownership of Enterprise
         immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have
occurred  by  virtue  of  the  consummation  of any  transaction  or  series  of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

                  7.       Confidential Information; No competition.

                  (a) The Executive  shall hold in a fiduciary  capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information,  knowledge or data (defined
below)  relating to the Company or any of its  affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and
their  respective  businesses,  which shall have been  obtained by the Executive
during  the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  or any of its  affiliated
companies and which shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts
by the  Executive  or  representatives  of the  Executive  in  violation of this
Agreement).  Upon Termination of the Executive's employment,  he shall return to
the  Company all  Company  information.  After  termination  of the  Executive's
employment with the Company,  the Executive shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal  process,
communicate or divulge any such  information,  knowledge or data to anyone other
than the Company  and those  designated  by it,  except (x)  otherwise  publicly
available  information,  or (y) as may be  necessary to enforce his rights under
this Agreement or necessary to defend himself against a claim asserted  directly
or indirectly by the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination
has been made in  accordance  with  Section  7(d) or  Section 9 hereof  that the
Executive has violated this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the  provisions
of this Section 7 shall not constitute a basis for deferring or withholding  any
amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

                  (b)  As  used  herein,  the  term  "confidential  information,
knowledge  or data"  means  all  trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential
business information  belonging to, used by, or in the possession of the Company
or any of  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to
information,  knowledge  or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and
financial information, mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, purchase or sale
of  property,  leasing,  pricing,  sales  programs  or  tactics,  actual or past
sellers, purchasers,  lessees, lessors or customers, those with whom the Company
or its  affiliates and  subsidiaries  has begun  negotiations  for new business,
costs, employee  compensation,  marketing and development plans,  inventions and
technology,  whether such confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,
written or electronically  recorded or stored,  except information in the public
domain,  information  known by the Executive prior to employment with PSE&G, and
information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or its
affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

                  (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and  data,  as
defined in the previous paragraph,  gained in the performance of the Executive's
duties  hereunder  may be  valuable  to  those  who are now,  or  might  become,
competitors of the Company or its affiliates and subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
Executive  agrees  that he will not,  for the  period of two years  from Date of
Termination,  directly own, manage,  operate, join, control, become employed by,
consult  to or  participate  in the  ownership,  management,  or  control of any
business which is in direct  competition  with the Company and/or its affiliates
and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive agrees that, for two years following
the Date of Termination,  he will not, directly or indirectly,  solicit or hire,
or encourage  the  solicitation  or hiring of any person who was a managerial or
higher  level  employee  of the  Company  at any  time  during  the  term of the
Executive's employment by the Company by any employer other than the Company for
any position as an employee,  independent  contractor,  consultant or otherwise.
The foregoing  agreement of the Executive  shall not apply to any person after 6
months have elapsed subsequent to the date on which such person's  employment by
the Company has  terminated.  In the case of any such prohibited  activity,  the
Executive  shall not be  entitled to  post-employment  payments  (including  any
unpaid installments of the Stock Award), and the Executive shall return or repay
to the Company a portion of any installments of the Stock Award that have vested
in  accordance  with  Section  3(d)(ii)  during the two year period  immediately
preceding  such  prohibited  activity  which  is  equal  to the  amount  of such
installments paid within such two year period times a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of months from the commencement of such activity to the date
that is 24 months after the Date of Termination  and the denominator of which is
24.

                  (d) In the  event of a breach by the  Executive  of any of the
agreements set forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, it is agreed that the
Company  shall  suffer  irreparable  harm for  which  money  damages  are not an
adequate  remedy,  and that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company shall be
entitled to obtain an order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  for equitable
relief from such breach,  including,  but not limited to, temporary  restraining
orders and preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such
agreements by the Executive.  In the event that the Company should  initiate any
legal action for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in
this  Section 7 and the  Company  does not prevail in such  action,  the Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  the  Executive  the full amount of any court  costs,
filing  fees,  attorney's  fees which the  Executive  incurs in  defending  such
action, and any loss of income during the period of such litigation.

                  8.       Full Settlement.

                  (a) No Duty to Mitigate;  No Reduction.  Except as provided in
Section  7(c),  and except to the extent that a Court under  Section  7(d) or an
arbitrator  appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine  to permit an offset in
respect of a violation by the Executive of his obligations  under Section 7, the
Company's  obligation  to make the payments  provided for in this  Agreement and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

                  (b)  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section
7(c), nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify,
nor,  subject  to Section  12(g),  shall  anything  in this  Agreement  limit or
otherwise  affect such rights as the  Executive  may have under any  contract or
agreement with the Company or any or its affiliated  companies.  Vested benefits
and other amounts that the Executive is otherwise  entitled to receive under the
incentive  compensation  plans  referred to in Section 3(c),  the SERPs,  or any
other plan,  policy,  practice of program of, or any contract of agreement with,
the  Company  or any  of its  affiliated  companies  on or  after  the  Date  of
Termination  shall be  payable in  accordance  with the terms of each such plan,
policy, practice,  program, contract or agreement, as the case may be, except as
explicitly modified by this Agreement.

                  9.       Disputes

                  Except  with  respect  to  equitable  relief  provided  for in
Section 7(d), any dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged
violation  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  resolved  by   confidential   binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be held in Newark, New Jersey in accordance
with  the  Employment  Dispute  Resolution  Rules  of the  American  Arbitration
Association  and the United  States  Arbitration  Act.  Judgment  upon the award
rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.  All costs and expenses  incurred by the Company or the  Executive or
the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in  connection  with  any such  controversy  or
dispute, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne
by the Company as incurred,  except that the Executive  shall be responsible for
any such costs and expenses  incurred in connection with any claim determined by
the arbitrator to have been without  reasonable basis or to have been brought in
bad faith. The Executive shall be entitled to interest at the applicable Federal
rate  provided for in Section  7872 (f) (2)(A) of the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  on any delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator
determine he was entitled to under this Agreement.

                  10.      Successors.

                  (a) No Assignment by Executive.  This Agreement is personal to
the Executive and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be
assignable  by the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

                  (b)  Successors to Enterprise.  This Agreement  shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.

                  (c) Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will
require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or  substantially  all of the business and/or
assets of Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same  manner and to the same  extent  that  Enterprise  would be required to
perform it if no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,
"Enterprise" shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to
its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this
Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

                  11.      Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

                  (a)    Anything   in   this    Agreement   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid
or  payable  or  distributed  or  distributable  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 11) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the  Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise  Tax"),  then the  Executive  shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a  "Gross-Up  Payment")  in an amount  such that  after  payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including,  without limitation,  any income and employment taxes
(and any interest  and  penalties  imposed with respect  thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed  upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the  Executive  retains  an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b)  Subject  to  the   provisions  of  Section   11(c),   all
determinations  required to be made under this Section 11, including whether and
when a Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made
by the Company's  independent auditors or such other certified public accounting
firm  as may be  jointly  designated  by the  Executive  and  the  Company  (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to
the Company and the  Executive.  All fees and  expenses of the  Accounting  Firm
shall be borne  solely by the  Company.  Any  Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined
pursuant  to this  Section  11,  shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive
within  15 days of the  receipt  of the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
determination  by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
the  Code at the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  Accounting  Firm
hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Company  should  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the
calculations  required  to be made  hereunder.  In the  event  that the  Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is
required  to make a  payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the  Accounting  Firm  shall
determine  the  amount  of the  Underpayment  that  has  occurred  and any  such
Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

                  (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal  Revenue  Service that, if  successful,  would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period  ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim
is  due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior  to the
expiration  of such period that it desires to contest such claim,  the Executive
shall:

                  (i)      give the Company any information reasonably requested
                           by the Company relating to such claim,

                  (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim
     as the  Company  shall  reasonably  request in  writing  from time to time,
     including, without limitation,  accepting legal representation with respect
     to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                  (iii)  cooperate  with  the  Company  in good  faith  in order
effectively to contest such claim, and

                  (iv)     permit the Company to participate in any proceedings 
                           relating to such claim;

provided  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay  directly all costs and
expenses  (including  additional  interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall  indemnify  and hold the Executive  harmless,  on an
after-tax  basis,  for any  Excise  Tax or income tax  (including  interest  and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such  representation  and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this  Section  11(c),  the  Company  shall  control  all  proceedings  taken  in
connection  with such contest  and, at its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any
and all administrative appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the
taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole  option,  either
direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any  permissible  manner,  and the Executive  agrees to prosecute  such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties with respect  thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further  provided that any extension of the statute of limitations  relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which
such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's  control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment would be payable  hereunder and
the  Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any
other  issue  raised  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or any  other  taxing
authority.

                  (d) If,  after  the  receipt  by the  Executive  of an  amount
advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  11(c),  the  Executive  becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim,  the Executive  shall
(subject to the Company's  complying  with the  requirements  of Section  11(c))
promptly  pay to the  Company  the  amount  of such  refund  (together  with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section 11(c), a determination  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled
to any refund  with  respect to such claim and the  Company  does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration  of 30 days  after such  determination,  then such  advance  shall be
forgiven  and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such  advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
be paid.

                  12.      Miscellaneous.

                  (a)  Governing  Law. This  Agreement  shall be governed by and

any other provision of or right under this Agreement.

                  (f) No  Alienation.  The rights and benefits of the  Executive
under this Agreement may not be anticipated,  assigned,  alienated or subject to

                                           April 16, 1986


E. James Ferland, President
Northeast Utilities
P. O. Box 270
Hartford, Connecticut  06141

Dear Mr. Ferland:

         In conjunction  with your  employment as President and Chief  Operating
Officer of PSE&G effective June 1, 1986 and as Chairman of the Board,  President
and Chief  Executive  Officer  commencing  July 1,  1986,  the  agreed  terms of
employment are as follows:

         1.   Your salary shall  commence at the annual rate of $375,000 and may
              be  increased,  but shall not be  reduced,  thereafter  during the
              three-year period commencing June 1, 1986. In addition,  you shall
              be  entitled  to those  benefits  from time to time  available  to
              officers and employees of PSE&G generally.

         2.   If you should be discharged  without  cause during the  three-year
              period  commencing June 1, 1986,  PSE&G will pay to you the salary
              which would have been  payable  pursuant to  Paragraph 1 above for
              the remainder of such  three-year  period.  "Cause" shall mean (i)
              the  gross  dereliction  of,  and  continued  failure  by  you  to
              substantially perform, your duties with PSE&G (other than any such
              failure  resulting form your  incapacity due to physical or mental
              illness),  after a written demand for  substantial  performance is
              delivered to you by the Board which  specifically  identifies  the
              manner in which the Board  believes that you have not so performed
              your duties,  or (ii) any conduct  constituting  a felony or moral
              turpitude.

         3.   Your participation in the Management  Incentive  Compensation Plan
              will begin  effective June 1, 1986, and any award available to you
              with  respect to  calendar  year 1986 shall be prorated to reflect
              such  effective  date;  provided  that if for  any of the  periods
              indicated  below the amount of your award under the Plan as of the
              date it is established is less than the amount specified below for
              such period, PSE&G shall promptly pay to you as a lump sum in cash
              the difference  between the amount specified below for such period
              and the amount of your award  prorated  for such period  under the
              Plan.

              Period                                          Amount
              June 1, 1986 to December 31, 1986               $29,000
              January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1987            $50,000
              January 1, 1988 to May 31, 1988                 $21,000

         4.   Your credited service of 22 years at Northeast  Utilities shall be
              utilized in determining  the benefits to which you are and will be
              entitled under PSE&G's various benefit plans in a manner as if you
              had been a PSE&G employee for that entire 22-year  period;  except
              that you agree to forego until at least June 1, 1996,  election of
              the option to retire when the sum of your age  together  with your
              credited  service  (Northeast  Utilities and PSE&G combined) equal
              eighty.  In addition,  the amount of your pension or  survivorship
