                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1. Basis of Presentation

Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated's (PSEG)
and Public Service  Electric and Gas Company's  (PSE&G)  consolidated  financial
statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read
in conjunction with their 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports
on Form 10-Q for the  quarters  ended  March  31,  2000 and June 30,  2000,  the
Current  Reports on Form 8-K filed August 21, 2000,  September 5, 2000,  October
18, 2000 and October 27, 2000 and the Amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed
November 1, 2000.  PSEG Energy Holdings  Inc.'s (Energy  Holdings)  consolidated
financial   statements  and  Notes  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  its
Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed June 29, 2000, Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the quarter  ended June 30, 2000 and Current  Reports on Form 8-K filed
October 18, 2000 and October 27, 2000. These Notes update and supplement matters
discussed  in PSEG's  and  PSE&G's  1999  Annual  Report on Form 10-K and Energy
Holdings' Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed June 29, 2000.

     Effective  August 1,  2000,  the  presentation  of  Electric  Revenues  and
Electric Energy Costs in the  Consolidated  Statements of Income has changed due
to PSE&G's  transfer of its  electric  generating  facilities  to PSEG Power LLC
(Power) and wholesale power contracts to PSEG Energy  Resources and Trade (ER&T)
(see Note 2.  Regulatory  Issues  and  Accounting  Impacts of  Deregulation),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of Power.  Effective  with the transfer,  PSE&G entered
into a contract  with Power to obtain the energy and capacity  necessary to meet
PSE&G's basic generation service (BGS) obligation. As a result, PSE&G's Electric
Energy Costs will now reflect PSE&G's cost under the contracted price with Power
and Power's  Electric  Energy Costs will reflect the actual cost of  generation.
PSEG eliminates  these  intercompany  revenues and expenses in its  consolidated
financial statements.

     Under the BGS  contract,  PSE&G pays a fixed price for energy and  capacity
provided  by Power and  charges  such costs to its BGS  customers.  As a result,
PSE&G is no longer  subject to price risk  related to market  exposures  for its
estimated electric commitments.  Following the generation asset transfer,  Power
has entered  into  forwards,  futures,  swaps and  options to manage  price risk
exposure  for its  commitments  to meet  PSE&G's BGS  obligation  in addition to
Power's other supply contracts.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were
derived from the audited  consolidated  financial  statements included in PSEG's
and PSE&G's 1999 Annual  Report on Form 10-K and Energy  Holdings'  Registration
Statement on Form S-4 filed June 29, 2000.  Certain  reclassifications  of prior
period data have been made to conform with the current presentation.

New Jersey Energy Master Plan Proceedings and Related Orders

     Following  the  enactment  of the New Jersey  Electric  Discount and Energy
Competition  Act  (Energy  Competition  Act),  the New  Jersey  Board of  Public
Utilities  (BPU)  rendered  its  summary  decision   relating  to  PSE&G's  rate
unbundling,  stranded costs and  restructuring  proceedings  (Summary Order) and
subsequently  issued its Final Order in these  matters,  providing,  among other
things,  for the transfer to an affiliate of all of PSE&G's electric  generation
facilities,  plant and  equipment  for  $2.443  billion  and all  other  related
property, including materials,  supplies and fuel at the net book value thereof,
together with associated rights and liabilities.

     Also in the Final Order,  the BPU concluded that PSE&G should recover up to
$2.94 billion (net of tax) of its  generation-related  stranded  costs,  through
securitization  of $2.4 billion and an opportunity to recover up to $540 million
(net of tax) of its  unsecuritized  generation-related  stranded  costs on a net
present value basis.  The $540 million is subject to recovery by various  means,
including an explicit market transition charge (MTC).  Following the issuance of
the Final Order, the BPU issued its order approving PSE&G's petition relating to
the proposed securitization transaction (Finance Order) which authorized,  among
other  things,  the issuance  and sale of $2.525  billion of  transition  bonds,
including an estimated $125 million of transaction costs.

     The Energy Competition Act, the BPU's Summary Order and Final Order and the
related  BPU  proceedings,  referred to as the Energy  Master Plan  Proceedings,
opened the New Jersey energy  markets to  competition by allowing all New Jersey
retail electric customers to, among other things, select their electric supplier
commencing  August 1, 1999 and all New  Jersey  retail gas  customers  to select
their gas supplier commencing January 1, 2000.

     In October and  November  1999,  two appeals of certain  provisions  of the
Final Order and two appeals of certain  provisions of the related  Finance Order
were filed in the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court (Appellate
Division)  on behalf  of  several  customers  and the New  Jersey  Office of the
Ratepayer Advocate (Ratepayer Advocate). In a decision issued on April 13, 2000,
a three-judge  Appellate Division panel unanimously affirmed the Final Order and
Finance  Order.   Thereafter,   the  appellants  filed  a  Petition   requesting
Certification  and a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey  Supreme Court seeking
review of the  Appellate  Division  decision.  On July 14, 2000,  the New Jersey
Supreme Court granted Certification with respect to both matters. Oral arguments
for all parties were held on November 8, 2000.

     While PSE&G  continues to believe that the Appellate  Division's  unanimous
decision was  correct,  it can give no  assurances  with respect to the ultimate
timing or  disposition  of these  matters by the New Jersey  Supreme  Court.  An
adverse outcome to this review or substantial additional delays beyond the first
quarter of 2001,  could have a material  adverse  impact on PSEG's,  PSE&G's and
Energy Holdings' financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash flows
and could  require  revisions to financing  plans,  revisions to business  plans
delaying or restricting  current  growth  strategies and the imposition of other
operational and/or financial measures.

     As  a  result  of  the  Supreme  Court's  review,   PSE&G's  securitization
transaction has been delayed at least until the first quarter of 2001, causing a
delay in the implementation of the Securitization  Transition Charge (STC) which
would have  reduced the MTC. In order to  recognize  the recovery of the allowed
unsecuritized  stranded  costs over the transition  period,  PSEG has recorded a
charge to net income of $52 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2000 for
the  cumulative  amount  of  estimated  collections  in  excess  of the  allowed
unsecuritized stranded costs from August 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000. Any
such  collections in excess of the allowed  unsecuritized  stranded costs at the
end of the transition  period will be credited to the Societal  Benefits  Clause
(SBC) as required by the Final Order.

Asset Transfer to Power

     PSE&G,  pursuant to the Final Order,  transferred  its electric  generating
facilities  and  wholesale  power  contracts  to  Power,  an  unregulated  power
producing  affiliate,  on August 21, 2000 in exchange for a Promissory Note from
Power in an amount equal to the  purchase  price.  Until such note is paid,  the
assets  transferred  remain  subject to the lien of PSE&G's  First and Refunding
Mortgage.

     The generating  assets were  transferred at the price  specified in the BPU
order - $2.443 billion plus $343 million for other generating related assets and
liabilities.  Because  the  transfer  was  between  affiliates,  PSE&G and Power
recorded  the sale at the net book value of the assets  and  liabilities  rather
than the transfer price. The difference between the total transfer price and the
net book value of the generation-related  assets and liabilities was recorded as
a Basis  Adjustment on PSE&G's and Power's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  These
amounts are eliminated on PSEG's consolidated financial statements.

     The parties have agreed to execute a supplemental  agreement reflecting any
change in the value of the  assets,  if  required  as a result of the New Jersey
Supreme Court review discussed above.

Extraordinary Charge and Other Accounting Impacts of Deregulation

     In April 1999,  PSE&G  determined  that  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 71 "Accounting for the Effects of Regulation"  (SFAS 71) was no
longer  applicable  to  the  electric  generation  portion  of its  business  in
accordance  with the  requirements  of  Emerging  Issues  Task Force Issue 97-4,
"Deregulation  of the Pricing of Electricity - Issues Related to the Application
of FASB Statements No. 71 and No. 101" (EITF 97-4). Accordingly,  PSE&G recorded
an extraordinary charge to earnings of $804 million (after tax). PSE&G accounted
for  this  charge  consistent  with the  requirements  of SFAS  101,  "Regulated
Enterprises  -  Accounting  for  the  Discontinuation  of  Application  of  FASB
Statement  No.  71".  This  extraordinary  charge  consisted  primarily  of  the
write-down of PSE&G's nuclear and fossil generating  stations in accordance with
SFAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121).  PSE&G  performed a  discounted  cash flow
analysis on a unit-by-unit basis to determine the amount of the impairment. As a
result  of this  impairment  analysis,  the net  book  value  of the  generating
stations was reduced by  approximately  $5.0 billion  (pre-tax) or approximately
$3.1  billion  (net of tax).  This amount was offset by the creation of a $4.057
billion (pre-tax),  or $2.4 billion (net of tax) regulatory asset related to the
future receipt of securitization  proceeds, as provided for in the Summary Order
and affirmed in the Final Order and Finance Order.

     In addition to the impairment of PSE&G's electric generating stations,  the
extraordinary charge consisted of various accounting  adjustments to reflect the
absence of cost of service regulation in the electric  generation portion of its
business.  The adjustments primarily related to materials and supplies,  general
plant  items  and   liabilities  for  certain   contractual  and   environmental
obligations.

     Other  accounting  impacts  of the  discontinuation  of  SFAS  71  included
reclassifying the Accrued Nuclear  Decommissioning  Reserve and the Accrued Cost
of Removal  for  generation-related  assets  from  Accumulated  Depreciation  to
Long-Term   Liabilities.   In  accordance  with  the  Final  Order,  PSE&G  also
reclassified  a $569  million  excess  depreciation  reserve  related to PSE&G's
electric  distribution  assets from  Accumulated  Depreciation  to a  Regulatory
Liability.  Such amount will be  amortized in  accordance  with the terms of the
Final Order over the period from January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.

Note 3. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

     At September 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999,  respectively,  PSEG and PSE&G
had deferred the following regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets:

Generation Asset Purchase

     In  September  1999,  Power  announced  an  agreement  to  acquire  all  of
Conectiv's  interests in Salem Nuclear Generating Station (Salem) and Hope Creek
Nuclear Generating Station (Hope Creek) and half of Conectiv's interest in Peach
Bottom Atomic Power Station  (Peach  Bottom) for an aggregate  purchase price of
$15.4  million  plus the net book value of  Conectiv's  nuclear fuel at closing.
Payment of Power's  obligation under such agreement has been guaranteed by PSEG.
The majority of regulatory  approvals  necessary for this  acquisition have been
obtained,  including  the approval by the BPU. In order for Conectiv to complete
the sale, the BPU must issue a second order to address Conectiv's  stranded cost
recovery.  Conectiv has advised Power that it will not complete the  transaction
during the time that the appeal on PSE&G's Final Order remains pending. However,
on October 6, 2000, Power entered into Wholesale Transaction Confirmation letter
agreements  with  Conectiv  under which Power will  obtain  544MW of  generation
capacity and output  representing  the portion of Conectiv's  interest in Salem,
Hope Creek and Peach Bottom to be  acquired.  Under this  agreement,  Power will
receive  all  revenue  and  pay all  expenses  associated  with  this  544MW  of
generating  capacity and output  through the date that the purchase  transaction
closes.  Power has been  advised by Conectiv  that the  Ratepayer  Advocate,  by
letter to the BPU dated October 26, 2000,  has objected to and  challenged  this
financial transaction.

PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     PSE&G is currently  working  with New Jersey  Department  of  Environmental
Protection (NJDEP) under a program (Remediation Program) to assess,  investigate
and,  if  necessary,   remediate  environmental  conditions  at  PSE&G's  former
manufactured  gas plant  sites.  To date,  38 sites  have been  identified.  The
Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed  and  revised by PSE&G  based on
regulatory  requirements,  experience with the Remediation Program and available
remediation technologies.  The long-term costs of the Remediation Program cannot
be  reasonably  estimated,  but  experience  to date  indicates  that  costs  of
approximately  $20 million per year could be incurred  over a period of about 30
years  and  that  the  overall  cost  could  be  material.  The  costs  for this
remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

Passaic River Site

     The U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA) has determined that a six
mile stretch of the Passaic River in Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"  within
the meaning of that term under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation  and Liability  Act of 1980 and that,  to date,  at least  thirteen
corporations, including PSE&G, may be potentially liable for performing required
remedial  actions to address  potential  environmental  pollution at the Passaic
River  "facility".  PSE&G and certain of its  predecessors  operated  industrial
facilities at  properties  within the Passaic  River  "facility",  including the
former Harrison Gas Plant and the Essex Generating Station. PSE&G cannot predict
what action, if any, the EPA or any third party may take against PSE&G or Power,
as the transferee of PSE&G's generation assets and liabilities,  with respect to
these  matters,  or in such event,  what costs PSE&G  and/or  Power may incur to
address any such claims. However, such costs may be material.

PSEG Guarantees for ER&T

     As of November 1, 2000,  approximately $224 million in guarantees have been
either  provided  to  or  committed  for  trading   counter-parties  of  Power's
subsidiary,  ER&T,  following assignment of PSE&G's wholesale power contracts to
ER&T to assure ER&T's creditworthiness in the marketplace.

Energy Holdings

     Energy  Holdings  and/or its subsidiary,  PSEG Global Inc.  (Global),  have
guaranteed certain obligations of Global's affiliates,  including equity funding
for  projects,  performance  or other  obligations  related  to certain of their
projects in an aggregate  amount of  approximately  $368 million as of September
30, 2000. A  substantial  portion of such  guarantees  will be  eliminated  upon
funding of project equity commitments. In addition, a subscription agreement for
PSEG to purchase Global's capital stock secures approximately $3 million of such
guarantees.

Note 5.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     PSEG's  operations  give rise to exposure to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and securities
prices. PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments for the purpose
of managing market risk consistent with its business plans and prudent  business
practices.

Forward Purchase Agreement-PSEG

     In December 1999, as part of PSEG's share repurchase program,  PSEG entered
into a  Forward  Purchase  Agreement  with a third  party  which  has  purchased
approximately  6.4 million shares at a cost of approximately  $225 million.  The
transaction  may be  settled  in  cash or  with  shares  of  Common  Stock.  Any
repurchase  of these shares will not be reflected on PSEG's  balance sheet until
settlement of the  transaction.  PSEG does not expect to settle this transaction
prior to the  securitization  financing  which has been  delayed to at least the
first quarter of 2001 (See Note 2. Regulatory  Issues and Accounting  Impacts of
Deregulation).

Commodity-Related Instruments -- PSE&G and Power

     At September 30, 2000 and December 31, 1999, PSE&G and Power held or issued
commodity and financial  instruments that reduce exposure to price  fluctuations
from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in demand, changes
in  supply,  state and  Federal  regulatory  policies  and other  events.  These
instruments, in conjunction with owned electric generating capacity and physical
gas supply contracts,  are designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer
commitments.  PSE&G and Power use futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage
and hedge price risk related to these market exposures.

     At  September  30,  2000,   Power  had  outstanding   commodity   financial
instruments with a notional contract quantity of 55.6 million mWh of electricity
and  PSE&G had  outstanding  commodity  financial  instruments  with a  notional
contract  quantity of 58.2  million  MMBTU of natural gas. At December 31, 1999,
PSE&G had outstanding  commodity financial  instruments with a notional contract
quantity of 36.1 million mWh of  electricity  and 25.5 million  MMBTU of natural
gas.  Notional amounts are indicative only of the volume of activity and are not
a measure of market risk.

     PSE&G's and Power's energy  trading and related  contracts have been marked
to market and gains and losses from such  contracts  were  included in earnings.
PSE&G recorded $42 million and $3 million of unrealized gains in the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,  respectively,  and Power recorded $6 million
of unrealized gains through September 30, 2000 related to these contracts.

Commodity-Related Instruments -- Energy Holdings

     In June 2000, Energy Holdings'  subsidiary,  PSEG Energy  Technologies Inc.
(Energy  Technologies)  outsourced  certain supply services under its retail gas
service agreements.  With this transaction,  Energy Technologies has changed the
manner  in which it  operates  its  energy  and gas  commodity  business  and at
September 30, 2000 there were no electric or gas commodity financial instruments
outstanding.  Energy  Holdings  had  recorded  $1.7 million of gains in the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 related to these instruments.

Equity Securities -- Energy Holdings

     Energy   Holdings'   subsidiary,   PSEG  Resources  Inc.   (Resources)  has
investments in equity securities and limited partnerships. Resources carries its
investments  in equity  securities  at their  approximate  fair  value as of the
reporting  date.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value  of these  investments  is
affected by changes in the fair value of the underlying  securities.  Fair value
is determined by adjusting the market value of the  securities for liquidity and
market volatility factors, where appropriate.  The aggregate fair values of such
investments which had available market prices at September 30, 2000 and December
31, 1999 were $132 million and $131 million,  respectively. The potential change
in fair value  resulting from a hypothetical  10% change in quoted market prices
of these  investments  amounted  to $10  million at  September  30, 2000 and $11
million at December 31, 1999.

Foreign Currencies -- Energy Holdings

     In accordance with their growth strategies,  Global and Resources have made
international  investments  of  approximately  $1.5  billion  and $1.2  billion,
respectively, as of September 30, 2000.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets located in the Netherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, China
and New Zealand  with  associated  revenues  denominated  in U.S.  dollars,  and
therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

     Global's international  investments are primarily in projects that generate
or distribute  electricity in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  India, Italy,
Peru,  Poland and Venezuela.  Investing in foreign  countries  involves  certain
additional risks. Economic conditions that result in higher comparative rates of
inflation in foreign  countries are likely to result in declining values in such
countries' currencies. As currencies fluctuate against the U.S. dollar, there is
a corresponding change in Global's investment value in terms of the U.S. dollar.
Such change is reflected as an increase or decrease in the investment  value and
other  comprehensive  income,  a separate  component  of  stockholders'  equity.
Cumulatively through September 30, 2000, net foreign currency  devaluations have
reduced the  reported  amount of PSEG's  total  stockholders'  equity and Energy
Holdings' total stockholder's equity by approximately $188 million.

     Previously,  Global had  consolidated  project debt totaling  approximately
$94.5  million   associated   with  Global's  33%   investment  in  a  Brazilian
distribution company that was non-recourse to Global,  Energy Holdings and PSEG.
The debt was  denominated  in the Brazilian  Real and was indexed to a basket of
currencies,  including the U.S. dollar. The debt was refinanced in May 2000 with
funds from Energy  Holdings and a $190 million United States dollar  denominated
loan at the  Brazilian  distribution  company,  of which  Global's  share is $62
million.  The functional  currency of the distribution  company is the Brazilian
Real.  Therefore its debt is subject to exchange rate risk as the Brazilian Real
fluctuates with the United States dollar. Changes in the exchange rate cause the
loan amount,  as reported in the  functional  currency,  to be marked  upward or
downward, with an offset to the income statement.  Global has entered into a $60
million  currency collar expiring on December 29, 2000 to mitigate the potential
loss caused by a significant  devaluation of the functional currency against the
U.S. dollar.  By entering into the collar,  Global's maximum exposure related to
the loan is limited to approximately $10 million in 2000.

Interest Rates

     PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings  are  subject to the risk of  fluctuating
interest  rates in the normal course of business.  Their  policies are to manage
interest  rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt,  floating  rate debt and
interest  rate swaps.  As of September  30, 2000, a  hypothetical  10% change in
market  interest rates would result in a $9 million,  $12 million and $2 million
change in annual  interest costs related to short-term and floating rate debt at
PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings, respectively.

Note 6.  Income Taxes

PSEG's effective income tax rate is as follows:

Note 7.  Financial Information by Business Segments

Basis of Organization

     The reportable segments disclosed herein were determined based on a variety
of factors  including  the  regulatory  environment  of each of PSEG's  lines of
business  and the types of products  and services  offered.  Effective  with the
unbundling  of  PSE&G's  rates on  August 1,  1999 and the  deregulation  of the
electric generation portion of PSE&G's business,  the basis of segment reporting
changed.  Estimates have been used to separate  historical,  pre-August 1, 1999,
electric   segment  data  into  the  Generation,   ER&T  and   Transmission  and
Distribution segments of PSE&G's business.

     Information related to the segments of PSEG's business is detailed below:

Note 8.  Accounting Matters

     In December 1999, the SEC released Staff  Accounting  Bulletin No. 101 (SAB
101) which provides  guidance on the timing of revenue  recognition in financial
statements.  The basic  guidelines  on revenue  recognition  state that  revenue
should not be recognized until it is realized or realizable and earned.  SAB 101
provides  specific  criteria to assist in this  determination.  PSEG,  PSE&G and
Energy  Holdings are in the process of determining  the possible  effects of the
adoption of SAB 101 on existing revenue recognition  practices.  The adoption of
SAB 101 is not  expected  to have a  material  adverse  effect on the  financial
statements of PSEG, PSE&G or Energy Holdings.

     In June 1998,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities".  In June 1999, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 137,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities --
Deferral of the  Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133" (SFAS 137) to defer
the  effective  date of SFAS 133, for one year.  Consequently,  SFAS 133 will be
effective for all fiscal quarters beginning after January 1, 2001. The FASB also
decided to defer by one year the transition date regarding embedded  derivatives
in SFAS 133. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative  Instruments and Certain Hedging  Activities" (SFAS 138) which amends
certain  provisions  of SFAS 133 to clarify four areas causing  difficulties  in
implementation.  The amendment  included  expanding the normal purchase and sale
exemption  for  supply   contracts,   permitting   the   offsetting  of  certain
intercompany  foreign currency derivatives and thus reducing the number of third
party derivatives,  permitting hedge accounting for foreign-currency denominated
assets and liabilities,  and redefining  interest rate risk to reduce sources of
ineffectiveness. A team has been appointed to implement SFAS 133 for PSEG, PSE&G
and  Energy   Holdings.   This  team  has  been  educating  both  financial  and
non-financial  personnel,   inventorying  embedded  derivatives  and  addressing
various  other SFAS 133 related  issues.  PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings will
adopt  SFAS 133 and the  corresponding  amendments  under SFAS 138 on January 1,
2001.  Management  is  currently  determining  the impact of SFAS 133 on PSEG's,
PSE&G's and Energy  Holdings'  consolidated  results of operations and financial
position.  This statement  should have no impact on consolidated  cash flows. At
this  time,  the  impacts  of SFAS 133 and  SFAS  138 have not been  quantified;
however,  all derivatives will be recognized at fair value and the impact on the
financial statements could be material.  For derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge  accounting  treatment and for any  ineffectiveness  that will result from
hedging  transactions,  a  cumulative  amount  will be  recorded  in the  Income
Statement.  For cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting,  PSEG, PSE&G
and Energy Holdings will recognize the appropriate  amount in the equity section
of the balance sheet in Other  Comprehensive  Income.  Finally,  for derivatives
where gains or losses will be payable or recoverable  through regulated rates, a
regulatory liability or asset will be established.

Promissory  Note from Power in an amount  equal to the total  purchase  price of
$2.786  billion.  Interest  on the note is payable at an annual  rate of 14.23%,
which represents PSE&G's weighted average cost of capital.  From August 21, 2000
to September 30, 2000, Power has paid interest of  approximately  $44 million to
PSE&G.

     Effective  with the  transfer,  Power  charges  PSE&G  for the  energy  and
capacity provided to meet PSE&G's BGS requirements.  Through September 30, 2000,
Power has charged PSE&G approximately $386 million for PSE&G's BGS requirements.
As of September 30, 2000,  PSE&G's  payable to Power relating to these costs was
approximately  $161 million.  Also through September 30, 2000, PSE&G sold energy
and capacity to Power at the market price of  approximately  $29 million,  which
PSE&G purchased under various  non-utility  generation (NUG) contracts at a cost
of  approximately  $66  million.  PSE&G,  as a result  of the Final  Order,  has
established  an NTC to  recover  the above  market  costs  related  to these NUG
contracts.  The  difference  between  PSE&G's  cost and their  recovery of costs
through the NTC and sales to Power,  which are at the locational  marginal price
(LMP) for energy and at wholesale  market prices for capacity,  is deferred as a
regulatory asset (see Note 3. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities).


Energy Holdings

     Approximately  90% of the  electricity  generated  by the Eagle Point Power
Plant, a 50% owned equity investment of Global, is sold to PSE&G under a 25-year
power purchase contract  terminating in May 2016.  Global's share of partnership
revenues  received  from PSE&G  represented  approximately  $17  million and $48
million  for  the  quarter  and  nine  months  ended   September  30,  2000  and
approximately  $14 million and $40 million for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 1999.

Note 6.  Income Taxes

     Energy Holdings' effective tax rate was 28.5% and 35.4% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999, respectively.  Energy Holdings'
effective tax rate differs from the statutory  federal  income tax rate of 35.0%
primarily  due to the  imposition of state taxes and the accruals at the rate of
10% of Global's  foreign income due to the incremental  cost associated with the
repatriation of foreign earnings.  Energy Holdings does not consolidate  foreign
projects and there is no foreign  income tax  reflected in income tax expense in
Energy Holdings' consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2000.

                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Following  are the  significant  changes  in or  additions  to  information
reported in the Public Service Enterprise Group  Incorporated  (PSEG) and Public
Service  Electric  and Gas  Company  (PSE&G)  1999  Annual  Report on Form 10-K,

filed  October  18,  2000 and  October  27,  2000,  affecting  the  consolidated
financial  condition and the results of operations  of PSEG,  PSE&G,  and Energy
Holdings and their  subsidiaries.  This  discussion  refers to the  Consolidated
Financial  Statements  (Statements) and related Notes to Consolidated  Financial
Statements  (Notes)  of PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings  and should be read in
conjunction with such Statements and Notes.

Overview and Future Outlook

     Following  the  enactment  of the New Jersey  Electric  Discount and Energy
Competition  Act  (Energy  Competition  Act),  the New  Jersey  Board of  Public
Utilities  (BPU)  rendered  its  summary  decision   relating  to  PSE&G's  rate
unbundling,  stranded costs and  restructuring  proceedings  (Summary Order) and
subsequently issued PSEG's Final Order in these matters,  providing, among other
things,  for the  transfer to an  affiliate  of all of its  electric  generation
facilities,  plant and  equipment  for  $2.443  billion  and all  other  related
property, including materials,  supplies and fuel at the net book value thereof,
together with associated rights and liabilities.

     Also in the Final Order,  the BPU concluded that PSE&G should recover up to
$2.94 billion (net of tax) of its  generation-related  stranded  costs,  through
securitization  of $2.4 billion and an opportunity to recover up to $540 million
(net of tax) of its unsecuritized generation-related stranded costs on a present
value basis. The $540 million is subject to recovery by various means, including
an explicit market transition charge (MTC).  Following the issuance of the Final
Order,  the BPU issued its order  approving  PSE&G's  petition  relating  to the
proposed  securitization  transaction  (Finance Order) which  authorized,  among
other  things,  the issuance  and sale of $2.525  billion of  transition  bonds,
including an estimated $125 million of transaction costs.

     The Energy Competition Act, the BPU's Summary Order and Final Order and the
related  BPU  proceedings,  referred to as the Energy  Master Plan  Proceedings,
opened the New Jersey energy  markets to  competition by allowing all New Jersey
retail electric customers to, among other things, select their electric supplier
commencing  August 1, 1999 and all New  Jersey  retail gas  customers  to select
their gas supplier commencing January 1, 2000.

     In October and  November  1999,  two appeals of certain  provisions  of the
Final Order and two appeals of certain  provisions of the related  Finance Order
were filed in the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court (Appellate
Division)  on behalf  of  several  customers  and the New  Jersey  Office of the
Ratepayer Advocate.  In an order issued April 13, 2000, a three-judge  Appellate
Division  panel  unanimously   affirmed  the  Final  Order  and  Finance  Order.
Thereafter,  the  appellants  filed a Petition  requesting  Certification  and a
Notice  of  Appeal  with the New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  seeking  review of the
Appellate  Division  decision.  On July 14, 2000,  the New Jersey  Supreme Court
granted  Certification  with respect to both  matters.  Oral  arguments  for all
parties were held on November 8, 2000.

     As  a  result  of  the  Supreme  Court's  review,   PSE&G's  securitization
transaction has been delayed at least until the first quarter of 2001, causing a
delay in the implementation of the Securitization  Transition Charge (STC) which
would have  reduced  MTC.  In order to  recognize  the  recovery  of the allowed
unsecuritized  stranded  costs over the transition  period,  PSEG has recorded a
charge to net income of $52 million, after tax, in the third quarter of 2000 for
the  cumulative  amount  of  estimated  collections  in  excess  of the  allowed
unsecuritized stranded costs from August 1, 1999 through September 30, 2000. Any
such  collections in excess of the allowed  unsecuritized  stranded costs at the
end of the transition  period will be credited to the Societal  Benefits  Clause
(SBC) as required by the Final Order.

     While PSE&G  continues to believe that the Appellate  Division's  unanimous
decision was  correct,  it can give no  assurances  with respect to the ultimate
timing or  disposition  of these  matters by the New Jersey  Supreme  Court.  An
adverse outcome to this review or substantial additional delays beyond the first
quarter of 2001,  could have a material  adverse  impact on PSEG's,  PSE&G's and
Energy Holdings' financial  condition,  results of operations and net cash flows
and could  require  revisions to financing  plans,  revisions to business  plans
delaying or restricting  current  growth  strategies and the imposition of other
operational and/or financial measures.

     As a result of the Final Order,  PSEG  organized PSEG Power LLC (Power) and
its  subsidiaries  to,  among other  things,  acquire,  own and operate  PSE&G's
electric generation assets.  PSE&G,  pursuant to the Final Order has transferred
its electric generating facilities to Power and its wholesale power contracts to
PSEG Energy Resources and Trade LLC (ER&T), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Power.
The generating assets were transferred at the price specified in the BPU order -
$2.443  billion  plus $343  million  for other  generating  related  assets  and
liabilities.  The  parties  have  agreed  to  execute a  supplemental  agreement
reflecting  any change in the value of the assets if required as a result of the
New Jersey  Supreme  Court review,  discussed  above.  The  transfer,  which was
effective August 1, 2000, was in exchange for a Promissory Note from Power in an
amount  equal  to the  purchase  price.  Until  such  note is paid,  the  assets
transferred remain subject to the lien of PSE&G's First and Refunding Mortgage.

     PSEG has positioned  Energy  Holdings as a major part of its planned growth
strategy.  In order to achieve this  strategy,  PSEG Global Inc.  (Global)  will
focus on generation and  distribution  investments  within targeted  high-growth
regions.  A  significant  portion  of  Global's  growth  is  expected  to  occur
internationally  due to the current and anticipated  growth in electric capacity
required in certain regions of the world.  PSEG Resources Inc.  (Resources) will
utilize  its market  access,  industry  knowledge  and  transaction  structuring
capabilities to expand its energy-related  financial investment portfolio.  PSEG
Energy  Technologies,  Inc.  (Energy  Technologies)  will  continue  to  provide
heating,   ventilating  and  air  conditioning   (HVAC)  contracting  and  other
energy-related   services  to  industrial  and   commercial   customers  in  the
Northeastern and Middle Atlantic United States.

     Effective  August 1,  2000,  the  presentation  of  Electric  Revenues  and
Electric Energy Costs in the Consolidated  Statements of Income has changed, due
to PSE&G's transfer of its electric generating facilities to Power and wholesale
power  contracts to ER&T.  Effective  with the  transfer,  PSE&G  entered into a
contract with Power to obtain the energy and capacity  necessary to meet PSE&G's
basic generation service (BGS) obligation.  As a result, PSE&G's Electric Energy
Costs will now reflect  PSE&G's cost under the  contracted  price with Power and
Power's  Electric Energy Costs will reflect the actual cost of generation.  PSEG
eliminates  these  intercompany  revenues  and  expenses  in their  consolidated
financial statements.

     Under the BGS  contract  PSE&G pays a fixed  price for energy and  capacity
provided  by Power and  charges  such costs to its BGS  customers.  As a result,
PSE&G is no longer  subject to price risk  related to market  exposures  for its
estimated  electric  commitments.  Following the transfer of generation  assets,
Power has entered into forwards, futures, swaps and options to manage price risk
exposure  for its  commitments  to meet  PSE&G's BGS  obligation  in addition to
Power's other supply contracts.

Results of Operations

     In the following discussion for the quarter and nine months ended September
30,  2000,  as compared to the same  periods in the prior year,  Management  has
combined   certain   current  year  results  for  PSE&G  and  Power,   including
intercompany  eliminations,  to  provide a better  comparison  to the prior year
results,  prior to the generation asset transfer to Power,  when operations were
centralized under PSE&G.

     Basic and diluted  earnings per share of PSEG common stock  (Common  Stock)
were $0.66 for the quarter  ended  September  30,  2000, a decrease of $0.35 per
share from the comparable 1999 period, excluding the extraordinary charge. Basic
and diluted  earnings  per share of Common  Stock were $2.57 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000, a decrease of $0.11 per share from the comparable 1999
period, excluding the extraordinary charge.

     Excluding the  extraordinary  charge from 1999 relating to deregulation and
the  discontinuation of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) No.
71,  "Accounting  for the  Effects of Certain  Types of  Regulation"  (SFAS 71),
PSE&G's and Power's combined contributions to earnings per share of Common Stock
for the quarter and nine months ended  September  30, 2000  decreased  $0.38 and
$0.01 from the comparable 1999 periods, respectively. The decrease was primarily
due to the $52 million  charge to income  related to MTC recovery  (See Overview
and Future Outlook).  Lower  depreciation  and  amortization  resulting from the
amortization of the Excess Depreciation Reserve beginning in January 2000 helped
to offset some of the decrease.

     Energy  Holdings'  contribution  to  earnings  per  share of  Common  Stock
increased  $0.02 and  decreased  $0.09 for the  quarter  and nine  months  ended
September 30, 2000, respectively, from the comparable 1999 periods. The increase
for the quarter was primarily due to Resources'  higher  leveraged  lease income
and a prior year  write-down of other  investments  in Global's  portfolio.  The
decrease for the nine months ended  September  30, 2000, as compared to the same
period in 1999,  is  primarily  due to lower  unrealized  gains from  Resources'
investment portfolio.

     As a result of PSEG's  stock  repurchase  program  which began in September
1998,  earnings  per share of Common Stock for the quarter and nine months ended
September 30, 2000 increased $0.01 and $0.06, respectively,  from the comparable
1999 periods.  A total of approximately 17.8 million shares had been repurchased
at a cost of  approximately  $679 million under this program as of September 30,
2000.

* Represents the revenue Power receives from PSE&G for BGS and MTC.
</TABLE>


     Revenues  decreased  $182  million  or 15% and $168  million  or 5% for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2000 from the comparable  periods in
1999  primarily due to an $88 million  pre-tax  charge to income  related to MTC
recovery  combined  with the  effects of the 5% rate  reduction  required by the
Final Order which decreased  generation revenues for the quarter and nine months
ended  September  30,  2000 by  approximately  $27  million  and  $123  million,
respectively.

     In addition,  customer  migration  from PSE&G could further  reduce PSE&G's
future basic generation service (BGS) obligation which would result in decreased
BGS  revenues  for Power.  However,  such  customer  migration  also creates the
opportunity  for Power to sell available  energy and capacity into the wholesale
market.  As of  September  30,  2000,  approximately  8% of  the  customer  load
traditionally served by PSE&G was being served by third party suppliers.

     Gas

     Revenues  increased  $66  million  or 23% and $155  million  or 12% for the
quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2000 from the comparable  periods in
1999, respectively, primarily due to the increasing prices for natural gas. This
is due to the fact that under certain  transportation  only contracts,  PSE&G is
responsible  only for  delivery  of gas to its  customers.  Such  customers  are
responsible  for payment to PSE&G for the cost of the  commodity  and as PSE&G's
costs for these customers increase, the customer's rates will increase.

</TABLE>

     Depreciation and Amortization expense decreased $34 million or 28% and $149
million or 37% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2000 from the
comparable  1999  periods,  respectively.  The decrease was primarily due to the
amortization of the regulatory  liability for the excess  electric  distribution
depreciation  reserve at PSE&G,  which commenced on January 1, 2000 and amounted
to  approximately  $31  million  and $94 million for the quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 2000. Also  contributing to the decrease for the nine months
ended  September  30,  2000,  as  compared  to the  same  period  in  1999,  was
approximately  $60 million of lower  depreciation  resulting  from the lower net
book value balances of the generation-related  assets, which were transferred to
Power,  which  were  reduced  as of April 1, 1999 as a result of the  impairment
recorded  pursuant to SFAS 121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment  of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of" (SFAS 121).

     Once the  securitization  transaction  is  complete,  PSE&G  will  begin to
amortize the regulatory asset recorded for stranded costs with such amortization
expense offsetting these decreases.

     Interest Expense

     PSE&G's  interest  expense  decreased $46 million or 47% and $38 million or
13% for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2000 from the comparable
1999 periods,  respectively.  The decrease is primarily  due to interest  income
received  from  Power  for the  Promissory  Note  (See  Note 10.  Related  Party
Transactions).

     Income Taxes

     Income  Taxes  decreased  $96 million or 63% and $60 million or 15% for the
quarter and nine  months  ended  September  30,  2000 from the  comparable  1999
periods,  primarily due to lower pre-tax  operating  income  resulting  from the
transfer of the generation portion of the business to Power.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings--Revenues

     Revenues  increased  $35 million and $146  million for the quarter and nine
months ended September 30, 2000,  respectively,  as compared to the same periods
in 1999. The increases primarily resulted from Resources' higher leveraged lease
income from new leveraged lease  investments,  Energy  Technologies'  additional
revenues from acquisitions of HVAC and mechanical service contracting  companies
in 2000 and 1999 and Global's higher income from partnerships.

Energy Holdings--Operating Expenses

     Operating  expenses  decreased $35 million for the quarter ended  September
30, 2000 from the comparable period in 1999 primarily due to Global's prior year
write-down  of  investments  of $44 million.  Operating  expenses  increased $83
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 from the comparable  period
in 1999,  primarily due to the addition of operating  expenses from the HVAC and
mechanical service contracting companies acquired by Energy Technologies in 2000
and 1999.  This  increase in  operating  expenses  was  partially  offset by the
write-down of Global's investments in 1999.

Energy Holdings--Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends

     Net financing expenses increased $6 million and $37 million for the quarter
and nine months ended  September 30, 2000,  respectively.  Both  increases  were
primarily  due to higher  levels of debt  required  to  finance  investment  and
acquisition activities at Global and Resources and higher interest rates.

Energy Holdings - Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) Contribution

     The results of operations for each of Energy  Holdings'  business  segments
are explained  below with reference to the EBIT  contribution.  Energy  Holdings
borrows on the basis of a combined  credit  profile to finance the activities of
its  subsidiaries.  As such, the capital  structure of each of the businesses is
managed by Energy Holdings. Debt at each subsidiary is evidenced by demand notes
with Energy Holdings and PSEG Capital Corporation (PSEG Capital).

         Global

     Global's  investments  consist primarily of minority ownership positions in
projects  and joint  ventures,  none of which it  consolidates.  Other than fees
collected for providing operations and maintenance  services,  Global's revenues
primarily  represent  its pro-rata  ownership  share of net income  generated by
project  affiliates  which is accounted for by the equity method of  accounting.
The  expenses in the table  below are those  required  to develop  projects  and
administrative and general expenses required to operate the business as a whole.
Project operating expenses are not reported as direct expenses of Global but are
deducted  to arrive at net income of  project  affiliates,  a pro-rata  share of
which is reported as revenues by Global.

     Global's  EBIT  contribution  decreased  $8 million for the  quarter  ended
September  30,  2000  from the  comparable  period  in 1999.  The  decrease  was
primarily  due to the  gain on sale of its  interest  in a  Newark,  New  Jersey
co-generation  facility in 1999,  partially  offset by the  write-down  of other
investments in Global's portfolio.

     Global's  EBIT  contribution  was $85  million  for the nine  months  ended
September  30, 2000 and 1999.  For the nine months  ended  September  30,  2000,
Global's  EBIT  contribution  was primarily the result of higher income from its

         Resources

     Resources earns its leveraged lease revenues primarily from rental payments
and tax benefits  associated with such  transactions.  As a passive  investor in
limited partnership project financing transactions, Resources recognizes revenue
from its  pro-rata  share of the income  generated by these  investments.  As an
owner  of  beneficial  interests  in  two  leveraged  buyout  funds,   Resources
recognizes  revenue as the share  prices of public  companies  in the  leveraged
buyout funds fluctuate.  In addition,  revenue is recognized as companies in the
fund  distribute  dividend  income  through the fund to the investors and as the
fund liquidates its holdings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     PSEG is a holding  company and, as such,  has no operations of its own. The
following  discussion  of  PSEG's  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  on  a
consolidated  basis,  noting the uses and  contributions  of PSEG's three direct
operating subsidiaries in 2000, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

PSE&G and Power

     As noted previously, on July 14, 2000, the New Jersey Supreme Court decided
to hear appeals of the BPU Energy Master Plan decision.  As a result,  a planned
$2.525 billion securitization financing by PSE&G has been delayed at least until
the first quarter of 2001,  and a planned  financing by Power has been similarly
delayed.

     Going forward,  cash generated from PSE&G's  transmission  and distribution
business is expected to provide the  majority of the funds for PSE&G's  business
needs.  Power's  initial  external  financing  will be delayed  until  after the
securitization  financing.  Following this initial  financing,  Power's  capital
needs will be funded with cash generated from operations and may be supplemented
with external  financings and equity  infusions from PSEG as dictated by Power's
growth strategy. Also as a result of the delay in securitization, PSEG and PSE&G
will utilize  various  medium-term  financings  to refinance  existing  debt and
maturities. The BPU has authorized PSE&G to issue through December 2001 up to $1
billion in  long-term  debt with  maturities  not to exceed  three years for the
purposes of redeeming or refunding prior debt.

     On September 17, 1999,  the BPU issued its Finance Order which  authorized,
among other things, the imposition of a non-bypassable transition bond charge on
PSE&G's customers;  the sale of PSE&G's property right in such charge created by
the Energy Competition Act to a bankruptcy-remote financing entity; the issuance
and sale of $2.525 billion of transition  bonds by such entity as  consideration
for such  property  right,  including an estimated  $125 million of  transaction
costs;  and the  application by PSE&G of the transition  bond proceeds to retire
outstanding  debt and/or equity.  Pending a favorable  resolution of matters now
before the New Jersey Supreme  Court,  PSEG and PSE&G do not expect such sale of
transition bonds and the receipt of proceeds prior to the first quarter of 2001.

     Both the right of PSE&G to receive the bondable  transition charge pursuant
to the  securitization  transaction  and the proceeds from the  Promissory  Note
related to the transfer of its  generation-related  assets to Power are property
subject to the lien of PSE&G's First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage). All such
property  will be released  from the lien of the Mortgage at the time of receipt
of the cash proceeds from each such sale. In accordance  with the  provisions of
the Mortgage,  the net proceeds from each sale of such released property will be
deposited with the Trustee.

     The  Mortgage  authorizes  PSE&G to exercise  one or more of the  following
options as to the application of proceeds of such released property, at its sole
discretion:

          1.   Withdraw  funds for  corporate  use by  utilizing  additions  and
               improvements and/or retired bonds. (Option 1)

          2.   Direct  the  Trustee to invest the  proceeds  in U.S.  Government
               Securities. (Option 2)

          3.   Direct the Trustee to purchase its  Mortgage  Bonds at the lowest
               prices  obtainable,  at or below par  value.  If the  Trustee  is
               unable to  purchase  sufficient  Mortgage  Bonds to exhaust  such
               proceeds  deposited  with it, the balance may be applied on a pro
               rata basis towards the redemption of eligible  series of Mortgage
               Bonds outstanding at par. (Option 3)

     At September 30, 2000,  PSE&G had a total of $3.4 billion of Mortgage Bonds
outstanding, of which $2.6 billion are taxable registered Mortgage Bonds subject
to the special redemption  provisions  outlined in Option 3 (Redeemable  Bonds).
Further, $777 million of the Mortgage Bonds outstanding are tax-exempt Pollution
Control Bonds and $15 million are two series of taxable  coupon  Mortgage  Bonds
due 2037 (Coupon  Bonds).  Neither the  Pollution  Control  Bonds nor the Coupon
Bonds are subject to the special redemption provisions outlined in Option 3.

     PSE&G has not yet made a final  decision as to the amount and the manner in
which it will retire or redeem its Mortgage Bonds.  Such a decision will be made
on or about the time the  proceeds  from  securitization  and the payment of the
Promissory  Note related to the sale of the  generation-related  assets to Power
are  deposited  with the Trustee,  on the basis of market  conditions  and other
factors  existing  at that time (see  Overview  and  Future  Outlook).  Based on
current information,  a likely utilization of the options available to PSE&G, as
noted above, could be as follows:

          A.   Withdraw $2.4 billion of net proceeds from  securitization  under
               Option 1, above. These proceeds would be used to:

               i.   Redeem  $123.5  million  of  Pollution   Control  Bonds  now
                    redeemable;

               ii.  Retire PSE&G's outstanding short-term debt; and

               iii. Reduce PSE&G common  and/or  preferred  securities  with the
                    balance of proceeds.

          B.   Withdraw the  proceeds  from the payment of the  Promissory  Note
               related  to the  generation-related  asset  sale to  Power  under
               Option 1.  These  proceeds  will be used to reduce  PSE&G  common
               and/or preferred securities.

     As previously reported, in anticipation of securitization,  PSEG's Board of
Directors  has  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to an aggregate of 30 million
shares of Common Stock in the open  market.  At  September  30,  2000,  PSEG had
repurchased  approximately  17.8 million  shares of Common  Stock,  at a cost of
approximately  $679 million.  The repurchased  shares have been held as treasury
stock or used for other corporate purposes.  In December 1999, PSEG entered into
a  Forward   Purchase   Agreement   with  a  third  party  which  has  purchased
approximately  6.4 million shares at a cost of approximately  $225 million.  The
transaction  may be  settled  in  cash or  with  shares  of  Common  Stock.  Any
repurchase  of these shares will not be reflected on PSEG's  balance sheet until
settlement  of the  transaction.  Market  conditions  and  the  availability  of
alternative  investments  will  dictate if and when more shares of Common  Stock
will be repurchased under this authorization.

     Dividend  payments  on  Common  Stock  for the  nine  month  periods  ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 were $1.62 per share and totaled  approximately $348
million and $357 million for the nine months ended  September 30, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  PSEG has not  increased its dividend rate in eight years in order
to retain additional  capital for reinvestment and to reduce its payout ratio as
earnings grow.  Since 1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash payments to PSEG in the
form of dividends on  outstanding  shares of PSE&G's  common  stock.  PSE&G paid
common  stock  dividends  of $450  million and $510 million to PSEG for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  These amounts were used
to fund PSEG's  Common Stock  dividends and to support a portion of PSEG's stock
repurchase program.

     PSEG  believes  that it will have  adequate  earnings  and cash flow in the
future from PSE&G and Power to maintain  Common  Stock  dividends at the current
level.  However,  the amounts and dates of such dividends declared in the future
will necessarily be dependent upon PSEG's future earnings, cash flows, financial
requirements and other factors.  Earnings and cash flows required to support the
dividend will become more volatile as PSEG's  business  changes from one that is
principally regulated to one that is principally competitive.

     Energy Holdings

     It is intended that Global and Resources will provide the earnings and cash
flow for Energy Holdings' long-term growth.  Resources' investments are designed
to  produce  immediate  cash flow and  earnings  that  enable  Global and Energy
Technologies to focus on longer investment horizons. During the next five years,
Energy Holdings will need  significant  capital to fund its planned  growth.  In
addition to cash  generated from  operations,  Energy  Holdings'  growth will be
funded through external  financings and equity infusions from PSEG. The delay of
the  securitization  financing  could  impact the ability of PSEG to continue to
make equity  infusions into Energy Holdings which could affect Energy  Holdings'
growth strategy.

     Cash flow from operating activities increased $39 million from $104 million
to $143  million for the nine  months  ended  September  30, 2000 as compared to
1999,  primarily due to a decrease in accounts  receivable in Global as a result
of a partner's reimbursement for their share of project costs.

     Regulatory Restrictions

     As a result of a 1992 BPU proceeding  concerning the  relationship of PSE&G
to PSEG's non-utility businesses (Focused Audit), the BPU approved a plan which,
among other things,  provided that: (1) PSEG would not permit PSEG's non-utility
assets to exceed 20% of PSEG's  consolidated  assets without prior notice to the
BPU (as of September 30, 2000,  these assets were in excess of the 20% limit and
such notice had been given);  (2) the PSE&G Board of Directors  would provide an
annual  certification  that the business and financing  plans of Energy Holdings
will not adversely  affect PSE&G; (3) PSEG would (a) limit debt supported by the
minimum net worth  maintenance  agreement  between PSEG and PSEG Capital to $650
million and (b) make a good-faith  effort to eliminate such support by May 2003;
and (4) Energy Holdings would pay PSE&G an affiliation fee of up to $2 million a
year to be applied by PSE&G to reduce utility rates.

     As a result of the  accounting  impacts  resulting from the Final Order and
the  deregulation of the electric  generation  business in New Jersey,  PSEG and
PSE&G no  longer  believe  that the 20%  non-utility  asset  limitation  remains
appropriate  and  believe  further  that  modifications  to  the  Focused  Audit
limitations  will be  required.  The Final Order  addressed  the Focused  Audit,
noting that PSEG's non-regulated assets would likely exceed 20% and that, due to
significant  changes  in the  industry  and,  in  particular,  PSEG's  corporate
structure  as a result of the Final Order,  modifications  to or relief from the
Focused  Audit might be  warranted.  The BPU  directed  PSE&G to file a petition
addressing  the Focused  Audit prior to the end of the first quarter of 2000. In
March 2000,  PSE&G submitted a letter to the BPU as its initial  compliance with
this filing  requirement in which it notified the BPU of its intention to make a
filing to modify the terms of the Focused  Audit within 120 days after the Final
Order becomes final and non-appealable.  Energy Holdings believes that, if still
required,  it is capable of eliminating PSEG support of PSEG Capital debt within
the time period set forth in the Focused Audit.

     Regulatory  oversight by the BPU to ensure that there is no harm to utility
customers from PSEG's non-utility  investments is expected to continue. PSEG and
PSE&G  believe that these issues will be  satisfactorily  resolved,  although no
assurances  can be given.  In addition,  if PSEG were no longer exempt under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA),  PSEG and its subsidiaries  would be
subject  to  additional  regulation  by the SEC with  respect to  financing  and
investing activities,  including the amount and type of non-utility investments.
PSEG believes, however, that this would not have a material adverse impact on it
and its subsidiaries.

Capital Requirements

     PSE&G and Power

     On October 31, 2000 Power  announced  that it had entered into an agreement
with a third party to purchase 30 gas and steam  turbines with a total  combined
generating capacity of 4,390 MW for $862.8 million. The turbines will be used at
projects in the Northeast and Midwest.

     In September 2000,  Power announced that it will assume  responsibility  of
four  Midwest  generation  projects  being  developed  by  Global  and  will  be
responsible  for all future  generation  projects and  development in the United
States. The four projects will have a combined  generating capacity of 2,830 MW.
Power will reimburse Global for their project costs through 2000.

     On July 19, 2000, Power announced that it will construct a two-unit,  1,186
MW natural-gas fired combined-cycle generating facility at its Linden Generating
Station at a cost of approximately $590 million with completion  expected in May
2003.  Three existing  oil-fired  steam units at Linden with a total capacity of
436 MW will be retired upon completion of the new facility.

     Also in 2000,  Power  announced  that it will  construct  a 500 MW  natural
gas-fired,  combined-cycle  electric  generating plant at its Bergen  Generating
Station at a cost of approximately $290 million with completion expected in June
2002.  Power has also  installed  four new  combustion  turbines  at  Burlington
Generating Station and two new combustion turbines at Linden Generating Station,
adding 168 MW and 164 MW, respectively,  of electric generating  capacity,  at a
cost of  approximately  $151  million.  The new  combustion  turbines  were  all
operational as of July 2000.

     In May 2000,  Power acquired  Niagara Mohawk Power  Corporation's  (Niagara
Mohawk) 400 MW oil and gas-fired electric generating station in Albany, New York
(Albany Steam  Station) for $49.9  million.  Under the terms of the  acquisition
agreement,  Niagara  Mohawk could also receive up to an additional $9 million if
Power chooses to pursue redevelopment of the Albany Steam Station.

     In  September  1999,  Power  announced  that it had signed an  agreement to
acquire all of  Conectiv's  interests in the Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station
(Salem) and the Hope Creek Nuclear  Generating  Station (Hope Creek) and half of
Conectiv's  interest in the Peach Bottom  Atomic Power Station  (Peach  Bottom),
totaling 544 MW for an aggregate  purchase  price of $15.4  million plus the net
book value of nuclear fuel at closing. For further information and discussion of
the  Wholesale  Transaction  Confirmation  letter  agreements  between Power and
Conectiv, see Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     PSE&G and  Power  have  substantial  commitments  as part of their  ongoing
construction programs. These programs are continuously reviewed and periodically
revised as a result of changes in economic  conditions,  revised load forecasts,
business   strategies,   site  changes,   cost  escalations  under  construction
contracts,  requirements  of regulatory  authorities and laws, the timing of and
amount of electric and gas transmission and/or distribution rate changes and the
ability of PSE&G to raise necessary capital.

     For the nine month periods ended  September 30, 2000 and 1999 PSE&G had net
plant  additions  of $280  million,  excluding  Allowance  for Funds Used During
Construction (AFDC) and capitalized interest.  Power had net plant additions for
the  nine  months  ended  September  2000 of $288  million,  excluding  AFDC and
capitalized interest.

     Energy Holdings

     Future investment  activity will be subject to periodic review and revision
and may vary significantly depending upon the opportunities  presented.  Factors
affecting actual  expenditures and investments  include  availability of capital
and suitable  investment  opportunities,  market  volatility  and local economic
trends.

     Over the next  several  years,  Energy  Holdings,  certain  of its  project
affiliates and PSEG Capital will be required to refinance  maturing debt,  incur
additional debt and provide equity to fund investment activity. Any inability to
obtain required  additional  external  capital or to extend or replace  maturing
debt and/or existing  agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates
may affect Energy Holdings' financial  condition,  results of operations and net
cash flows (see Liquidity and Capital Resources-Regulatory Restrictions above).

External Financings

     PSEG

     At September 30, 2000, PSEG had a committed $150 million  revolving  credit
facility which will expire in December  2002. At September 30, 2000,  there were
no borrowings under this revolving  credit facility.  On September 8, 1999, PSEG
entered into an uncommitted  line of credit with a bank with no stated limit. At
September 30, 2000, PSEG had $145 million outstanding under this line of credit.

     PSEG has an $850  million  commercial  paper  program to provide  funds for
general  corporate  purposes and,  until  securitization  proceeds are received,
provide funds for Power.  On September 30, 2000,  PSEG had  commercial  paper of
$557 million outstanding.

     To provide  liquidity for its  commercial  paper  program,  PSEG has a $570
million  revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2001 and a $280  million
revolving  credit facility  expiring in March 2005.  These agreements are with a
group of banks and provide for borrowings  with maturities of up to one year. As
of  September  30,  2000  there  were  no  borrowings  outstanding  under  these
facilities.

     On October 10,  2000 PSEG filed a  registration  statement  with the SEC to
register $500 million of additional debt.

     In 1998,  PSEG  issued  $100  million of  Extendible  Notes,  Series A, due
November 22, 2000.  These Notes were  automatically  tendered and  remarketed in
February 2000. The interest rate through  maturity is at the three-month  London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.22%, reset quarterly.

     Also in 1998, PSEG issued $175 million of Extendible  Notes,  Series B, due
November 22, 2000. These Notes were automatically tendered and remarketed in May
2000. The interest rate through maturity is at the three-month LIBOR plus 0.32%,
reset quarterly.

     In 1999, PSEG issued $300 million of Extendible  Notes,  Series C, due June
15, 2001.  These Notes were  automatically  tendered and remarketed in September
2000.  The  interest  rate  through  maturity is at the  three-month  LIBOR plus
0.375%, reset quarterly.

     PSE&G

     As of  September  30, 2000,  the  Mortgage  would permit up to $2.9 billion
aggregate  principal  amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous
additions and  improvements,  the level of which will be impacted by the actions
ultimately   taken  in   connection   with   securitization   and  the  sale  of
generation-related  assets to Power (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources - PSEG
and PSE&G). In addition to the refinancing of existing long-term debt authorized
by the BPU in the Final Order,  PSE&G will need to obtain BPU  authorization  to
issue any incremental debt financing  necessary for its capital  program.  PSE&G
expects  to apply for and  receive  necessary  BPU  authorization  for  external
financings to meet its requirements  over the next five years, as needed.  While
PSE&G expects such authority to be granted, no assurances can be given.  Failure
to receive such authority on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect
on the financial  condition,  results of operations  and net cash flows of PSE&G
and PSEG.

     The BPU has  authorized  PSE&G to issue up to $1 billion  of new  long-term
debt on the basis of  previously  matured,  redeemed or  purchased  debt through
December 31, 2001

     On  September 6, 2000,  PSE&G  issued $290  million of secured  Medium Term
Notes, Series A at 7.19%, due September 6, 2002.

     PSE&G  maintains  a $1.5  billion  commercial  paper  program.  To  provide
liquidity for this program,  PSE&G has a $450 million revolving credit agreement
expiring in June 2001, a $650 million credit facility  expiring in June 2002 and
a $400 million credit facility  expiring in June 2001. These agreements  provide
for  borrowings  with  maturities  of up to one year.  As of September 30, 2000,
there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

     The BPU has authorized  PSE&G to issue and have outstanding at any one time
through  January 2, 2001, not more than $2.0 billion of short-term  obligations,
consisting of commercial  paper and other  unsecured  borrowings  from banks and
other  lenders.  PSE&G has several  uncommitted  lines of credit with banks.  On
September  30, 2000,  PSE&G had $1.6  billion of  short-term  debt  outstanding,
including $423 million  borrowed  against its uncommitted  bank lines of credit.
PSE&G  has  filed a  petition  with the BPU to  extend  its  authority  to issue
short-term debt through January 2, 2003.

     PSE&G Fuel  Corporation  had a $125  million  commercial  paper  program to
finance a 42.49% share of Peach  Bottom  nuclear  fuel.  This  commercial  paper
program was supported by a $125 million  revolving  credit facility with a group
of banks. As a result of the transfer of generation  assets from PSE&G to Power,
the PSE&G Fuel Corporation  commercial paper program has been discontinued.  All
commercial  paper  outstanding  under this  program  was paid down on August 17,
2000. The credit  facility  supporting  this program was terminated on September
11, 2000.

     Energy Holdings

     A registration statement was declared effective September 5, 2000 regarding
an exchange offer for the $300 million of 9.125% Senior Notes due February 2004.
The  exchange  offer was  completed on October 18, 2000 with  substantially  all
notes being exchanged.

     Energy Holdings  completed an exchange offer in August 2000 exchanging $400
million of publicly  traded  10.0% Senior Notes due October 2009 for notes which
were issued in October 1999 in a private placement.

     Foreign Operations

     In accordance with their growth strategies,  Global and Resources have made
approximately  $1.5 billion and $1.2  billion,  respectively,  of  international
investments.  As of September 30, 2000, foreign  investments  represented 13% of
PSEG's  consolidated  assets and the  revenues  from those  foreign  investments
contributed 3% to consolidated  revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
2000. For discussion of foreign currency risk, see Note 5. Financial Instruments
and Risk Management.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market risk inherent in PSEG's market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions  is the  potential  loss  arising  from  adverse  changes in commodity
prices,  pollution  credit prices,  equity security  prices,  interest rates and
foreign  currency  exchange  rates as discussed  below.  PSEG's policy is to use
derivatives  to manage  risk  consistent  with its  business  plans and  prudent
practices.  PSEG has a Risk Management Committee comprised of executive officers
which utilizes an independent risk oversight  function to ensure compliance with
corporate policies and prudent risk management practices.

     PSEG is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event of  non-performance  or
non-payment by  counterparties.  PSEG also has a credit management process which
is used to assess,  monitor and mitigate  counterparty exposure for PSEG and its
subsidiaries.  In  the  event  of  non-performance  or  non-payment  by a  major
counterparty,  there  may  be a  material  adverse  impact  on  PSEG's  and  its
subsidiaries' financial condition,  results of operations or net cash flows. For
discussion of interest rates, commodity-related  instruments,  equity securities
and  foreign  currency  risks,  see  Note  5.  Financial  Instruments  and  Risk
Management.

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand and state and Federal  regulatory  policies.  To reduce  price
risk  caused by market  fluctuations,  PSE&G and  Power  enter  into  derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties,  to hedge anticipated  demand.  These contracts,  in conjunction
with owned electric generating  capacity and physical gas supply contracts,  are
designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer commitments.

     PSEG uses a value-at-risk  model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load  requirements,  physical  and  financial  contracts.  Value-at-risk
represents  the potential  gains or losses for  instruments or portfolios due to
changes in market  factors,  for a specified time period and  confidence  level.
PSEG estimates  value-at-risk  across its commodity  business using a model with
historical volatilities and correlations.

     The measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95%
confidence  level  over a  one-week  time  horizon  at  September  30,  2000 was
approximately  $12  million,  compared  to the  December  31,  1999  level of $3
million. PSEG's calculated value-at-risk represents an estimate of the potential
change  in the value of its  portfolio  of  physical  and  financial  derivative
instruments.  These estimates, however, are not necessarily indicative of actual
results,  which may differ due to the fact that actual market rate  fluctuations
may differ from forecasted  fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio
of hedging instruments may change over the holding period.

PSE&G agreement with El Paso Merchant Energy

     New Matter.  PSE&G and El Paso Merchant  Energy, a business unit of El Paso
Energy Corporation,  have announced the restructuring of a long-term power sales
agreement,  a  non-utility  generation  (NUG)  contract  between  its Newark Bay
generating  project and PSE&G.  The BPU approved the  agreement.  As required by
state and  federal  regulation,  PSE&G  entered  into a long-term  agreement  to
purchase the output of the plant at prices that are now above market.  Under the
new agreement, El Paso Merchant Energy will supply a fixed amount of electricity
to PSE&G at reduced  rates.  PSE&G expects that the new agreement  will save its
customers $75 million over the remaining 13-year term of the agreement,  with no
impact on earnings.

Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC)

     Form 10-K,  page 9 and June 30, 2000 Form 10-Q page 41 . On July 31,  2000,
PSE&G filed an amended motion with the BPU requesting  interim  authorization by
September  1, 2000 to change the monthly  pricing  mechanism  in PSE&G's LGAC to
cover currently  estimated price increases on a per month basis,  exercisable in
any month with no annual  limit.  The change  will also allow  PSE&G to decrease
prices if the expected increases in gas costs do not occur. Currently, PSE&G has
been given limited  authority to change the monthly pricing mechanism during the
months of November 2000 through  April 2001. On October 3, 2000,  PSE&G filed an
emergent motion for provisional relief with the BPU.

     On  November  1, 2000,  the BPU  issued a written  order  granting  PSE&G a
provisional rate increase of 16% with a 2% monthly  potential  flexing mechanism
during the  upcoming  winter for the amounts  that PSE&G is  permitted to charge
customers.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Formerly DSM)

     Form 10-K,  page 9. On October 10, 2000,  the BPU  approved,  on an interim
basis, $7.5 million of statewide funding for new energy efficiency  programs and
$2.5  million  of  statewide   funding  for  renewable  energy  programs  to  be
administered  by the BPU  pending  the BPU's  final  order in the  Comprehensive
Resource  Analysis  (CRA)  proceeding.  PSE&G is waiting  for the BPU to issue a
written order with details on how the interim CRA program is to be  administered

(FERC) stating that PJM is a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) that meets
or exceeds the  requirements  of the Final Rule  promulgated  by FERC in the RTO
rulemaking  proceeding  (Order  2000).  Included  in this  filing was a PJM rate

a subsidiary  of Power and a  requirements  contract  between  PSE&G and Power's
subsidiary enabling PSE&G to fulfill its basic gas supply service.  PSE&G cannot
predict the outcome of this matter.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

                  AGREEMENT,  by and between  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group
Incorporated,  a New Jersey  Corporation  ("Enterprise")  and Frank Cassidy (the
"Executive"), dated as of October 17, 2000.

                  WHEREAS,  the Executive is currently  serving as President and
Chief Operating Officer of PSEG Power LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company,
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enterprise (Enterprise and its subsidiaries and
affiliates being collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Company").

                  WHEREAS,  in consideration  of the substantial  benefits to be
provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement,  the Executive is willing to
commit himself to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions  herein
set forth; and

                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions for the  employment  relationship  of the
Executive  with  the  Company  during  the  Employment  Period  (as  hereinafter
defined):

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN  CONSIDERATION  of the  mutual  premises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.  General.
                      -------

                  (a) Employment.  The Company  agrees  to employ the Executive,
and the Executive  agrees to be employed by the Company,  in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

                  (b) Term. The term of the  Executive's  employment  under this
Agreement  (the  "Employment  Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the
"Effective  Date") and shall  continue  until  October 16, 2005.  In the event a
Change  in  Control  occurs  during  the  Employment  Period,  the  term  of the
Executive's  employment shall (unless  terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4
hereof) automatically continue until the later of the last day of the Employment
Period or the second  anniversary  of the Change in  Control.  In the event this
Agreement  is extended as provided in the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment
Period shall be the period from the Effective Date to the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.

                  2.  Position and Attention to Duties.
                      --------------------------------

                  (a) Position.  During  the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall serve as  President  and Chief  Operating  Officer of PSEG Power LLC or in
another senior executive position or positions for the Company, as determined by
the  Chief  Executive  Officer  ("CEO")  and  Board of  Directors  ("Board")  of
Enterprise.

                  (b) Attention. During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of  vacation  and sick leave to which the  Executive  is  entitled,  the
Executive  agrees to devote full attention and time during normal business hours
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and to use his  reasonable  best
efforts to perform such  responsibilities in a professional manner. It shall not
be a violation of this  Agreement  for the  Executive to (i) serve on corporate,
civic or  charitable  boards  or  committees,  (ii)  deliver  lectures,  fulfill
speaking  engagements  or teach at  educational  institutions  and (iii)  manage
personal  investments,  so long as such  activities  do not  interfere  with the
performance of the  Executive's  responsibilities  as an officer and director of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

                  3.  Compensation.
                      ------------

                  Except  as  modified  by  this   Agreement,   the  Executive's
compensation  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with the  Company's  standard
compensation and payroll practices as in effect from time to time. The aggregate
of Base Salary,  Annual  Incentive  Compensation  and  Long-Term  Incentives  in
paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive
practices for companies of comparable size and standing.

                  (a) Base Salary. The annual rate of base salary payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
established by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee").  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible  increase at least
annually.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced,  and after any such increase
and the term  "Annual  Base Salary"  shall  thereafter  refer to the Annual Base
Salary as so increased.

                  (b) Annual Incentive  Compensation.  The Board has established
and intends to continue an annual incentive compensation plan for the benefit of
the officers and other key employees of the Company,  including  the  Executive,
based on  competitive  practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.
The  performance  objectives for the Executive in respect of such incentive will
be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

                  (c)  Long-Term  Incentives.  The  Board  has  established  and
intends to continue a long-term  incentive  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices for companies of comparable size and standing.  Such plan
may, in the judgment of the Compensation  Committee,  provide for stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or
units and/or other type of long-term  incentive  awards.  The type and amount of
equity  and any other  long-term  incentive  grants  will be  determined  by the
Compensation Committee from time to time, and awards thereunder shall be payable
to the Executive in accordance  with the  long-term  incentive  plan or plans in
effect from time to time.

                  (d) Option Award.
                      ------------

         (i) In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will  assume  during  the
         Employment Period, the Executive shall be granted an award (the "Option
         Award")  of  non-qualified   options  under  the  Enterprise  Long-Term
         Incentive Plan ("LTIP") to purchase  250,000 shares of the Common Stock
         without nominal or par value of Enterprise  ("Stock").  Options granted
         under the Option Award are herein  referred to as "Options".  The grant
         price of the Options  shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on
         the New York Stock  Exchange on the  Effective  Date.  The  Executive's
         right  to the  Option  Award  shall  vest  and  become  exercisable  in
         accordance with the following schedule, provided that the Executive has
         remained  continuously  employed by the Company  during the  Employment
         Period through the dates indicated below:


             Date                Number of Shares
             ----               ----------------
         October 17, 2001           50,000
         October 17, 2002           50,000
         October 17, 2003           50,000
         October 17, 2004           50,000
         October 17, 2005           50,000



If, during the  Employment  Period (1) there occurs a Change in Control,  or (2)
Enterprise  enters  into an  agreement  to merge or  consolidate  with any other
corporation  which, if consummated,  would meet the requirements of Section 6(b)
(iii) and the  shareholders  of Enterprise  approve that  agreement,  the entire
Option  Award  shall  vest and become  exercisable.  If,  during the  Employment
Period, the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause or the
Executive  terminates  his  employment  for  Good  Reason,  or  the  Executive's
Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability, the Executive's right to
the entire  Option  Award  shall vest and become  exercisable  as of the Date of
Termination.  If,  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  terminates  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his  employment
without Good Reason, including Retirement, the Executive shall forfeit all right
to all  shares  of the  Option  Award  that  are not  vested  as of the  Date of
Termination.

         (ii)  The Options shall expire ten (10) years after the Effective Date.


         (iii) Once Options  become  exercisable  hereunder,  the  Executive may
         exercise such Options in any manner  permitted by the LTIP.  All vested
         options  shall be  exercised  or shall be  forfeited  no later than the
         earlier of three  years after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years
         after the Effective Date.

         (iv)  Unless  specifically  provided by this  Agreement,  all terms and
         conditions of the Options  granted  hereunder  shall be governed by the
         LTIP.

         (v) The  Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
         steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of
         any taxes that the  Company is  required  by law or  regulation  of any
         governmental  authority,  whether federal,  state or local, domestic or
         foreign,  to withhold in connection  with the Option Award,  including,
         but not  limited to (1)  withholding  delivery of the  certificate  for
         shares of Stock  until the  Executive  reimburses  the  Company for the
         amount it is required to withhold  with respect to such taxes,  (2) the
         canceling of any number of shares of Stock issuable to the Executive in
         an amount  necessary  to  reimburse  the  Company  for the amount it is
         required to so  withhold,  or (3)  withholding  the amount due from the
         Executive's other compensation.

                  (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment  Period,
(i) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement
plans,  practices,  policies  and  programs to the same  extent as other  senior
executives of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all
benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices,  policies and programs provided
by the Company, other than severance plans, practices, policies and programs but
including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary
continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and
as  supplemented  hereby.  Following  a Change in Control,  no benefit  coverage
available to the Executive  and/or to his family under any such plan,  practice,
policy or program shall be materially  reduced without the prior written consent
of the Executive.

                  (f) Retirement  Benefit.  During  the Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall   participate  in  Enterprise's   Pension  Plan,  and  also  in
Enterprise's   Limited  Supplemental   Benefits  Plan,   Mid-Career  Hire  Plan,
Reinstatement Plan and such other supplemental executive retirement plans as may
be adopted and amended by Enterprise from time to time ("SERPs"),  such that the
aggregate value of the retirement  benefits that he and his  beneficiaries  will
receive  under all pension  benefit plans of the Company  (whether  qualified or
not) will not be less than the benefits he would have  received had he continued
to participate in such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof
through the earlier of the end of the  Employment  Period or  Retirement.  It is
agreed that the Option Award and any dividends or other distributions in respect
of the Option  Award  shall not be  included  in any  pension  calculation.  The
Executive's  right to retire  shall be governed by the  Enterprise  Pension Plan
("Retirement").

                  (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable
expenses in carrying out his duties and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such expenses in accordance
with the  policies of the Company in effect from time to time for  reimbursement
of expenses for senior executives,  and subject to documentation provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

                  (h) Fringe  Benefits.   During  the  Employment  Period,   the
Executive shall participate in all fringe benefits and perquisites  available to
senior executives of the Company, including provision of an automobile, on terms
and conditions that are commensurate with his positions and  responsibilities at
the Company.

                  (i)  Vacation.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall be entitled to paid  vacation in  accordance  with Company  policy for its
most senior executives as in effect from time to time.

                  (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive  will retain all of
his rights in any  compensation  deferred prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Deferred  Compensation Plan,  including earnings thereon, and following
the date hereof the obligations of the Company to pay such deferred compensation
at the times and in the manner specified in the Deferred  Compensation Plan will
continue.

                  4.  Termination of Employment.
                      -------------------------

                  (a) Death or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable disability plan for senior executives.

                  (b) By the Company.
                      --------------

                  (i) The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment
         during the Employment  Period for Cause or without Cause.  For purposes
         of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (A) willful and continued failure
         by the  Executive  to  substantially  perform  his  duties  under  this
         Agreement,   (B)  the  willful  engaging  by  the  Executive  in  gross
         misconduct  which  is  materially  and  demonstrably  injurious  to the
         Company,  or (C) the conviction of the Executive of a felony. No act or
         failure  to act on  the  part  of the  Executive  shall  be  considered
         "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in
         bad faith or without  reasonable belief that the Executive's  action or
         omission was in the best  interests of the Company.  Any act or failure
         to act that is based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
         adopted  by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company,  or the advice of
         counsel for the Company,  shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
         omitted  to be done,  by the  Executive  in good  faith and in the best
         interests of the Company.

                  (ii) A termination  of the  Executive's  employment  for Cause
         shall be effected in  accordance  with the  following  procedures.  The
         Company shall give the Executive written notice ("Notice of Termination
         for Cause") of its  intention to terminate the  Executive's  employment
         for Cause,  setting forth in reasonable  detail the specific conduct of
         the Executive  that it considers to  constitute  Cause and the specific
         provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies. Such notice shall be
         given no later than 60 days after the act or failure  (or the last in a
         series of acts or  failures)  that the  Company  alleges to  constitute
         Cause.  The Executive  shall have 30 days after receiving the Notice of
         Termination  for  Cause in which to cure  such act or  failure,  to the
         extent  such  cure is  possible.  In the  case of a  termination  under
         Section  4(b)(i)(A) or Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to
         cure such act or failure to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company,
         the Company shall give the Executive a second  written  notice  stating
         that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of
         the conduct  described in the Notice of Termination  for Cause and that
         such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

                  (c) Good Reason.
                      -----------

                  (i) The  Executive may  terminate  his  employment  during the
         Employment  Period for Good Reason or without Good Reason.  For purpose
         of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                  (A) prior   to  the  occurrence  of a Change in  Control,  any
               reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary;

                  (B) following a Change in Control:


                    (1) any  reduction  in the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary,
               target annual  bonus,  target  long-term  incentive or Retirement
               benefit;

                    (2) any adverse change in the Executive's title,  authority,
               duties, responsibilities and reporting lines or the assignment to
               the Executive of any duties or  responsibilities  inconsistent in
               any respect with those  customarily  associated with the position
               of the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control;

                    (3) any purported termination of the Executive's  employment
               by  the  Company  for a  reason  or  in a  manner  not  expressly
               permitted by this Agreement;

                    (4) any failure by  Enterprise  to comply with Section 10(c)
               of this Agreement; or

                    (5) any  other  material  breach  of this  Agreement  by the
               Company  that either is not taken in good faith or, even if taken
               in good faith,  is not  remedied by the  Company  promptly  after
               receipt of notice thereof from the Executive.

               Following  a  Change in Control,  the  Executive's  determination
               that  an  act  or failure to act constitutes Good Reason shall be
               conclusively  presumed  to  be valid unless such determination is
               decided  to  be  unreasonable  by   an   arbitrator  pursuant  to
               Section 9.

               (ii) A termination of employment by the Executive for Good Reason
          shall be effectuated by giving the Company  written notice ("Notice of
          Termination  for Good  Reason") of the  termination,  setting forth in
          reasonable  detail the specific  acts or omissions of the Company that
          constitute Good Reason and the specific provision(s) of this Agreement
          on which the Executive relies. Unless the CEO determines otherwise,  a
          Notice of  Termination  for Good Reason by the Executive  must be made
          within 60 days after the Executive  first has actual  knowledge of the
          act or omission  (or the last in a series of acts or  omissions)  that
          the Executive alleges to constitute Good Reason, and the Company shall
          have 30 days from the receipt of such Notice of  Termination  for Good
          Reason to cure the conduct cited therein.  A termination of employment
          by the  Executive  for Good Reason shall be effective on the final day
          of such 30-day cure period  unless  prior to such time the Company has
          cured the specific  conduct  asserted by the  Executive to  constitute
          Good Reason to the reasonable satisfaction of the Executive.


               (iii)A termination of the Executive's employment by the Executive
          without Good Reason, including Retirement, shall be effected by giving
          the Company at least 30 days' written notice  specifying the effective
          date of termination.

                  (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of Termination"  means the
date of the  Executive's  death,  the Disability  Effective Date, or the date on
which the termination of the Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or
without  Cause or by the  Executive  for Good  Reason or  without  Good  Reason,
including Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.

                  5.  Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
                      -------------------------------------------

                  (a) Good  Reason;   Other  Than  for  Cause.  If,  during  the
Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's  employment other

employment for Good Reason:

                  (i) the Company  shall pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in
         cash,  within 15 days after the Date of  Termination,  the aggregate of

                          Termination;

                      (2) the product of (x) the  "target"  annual  bonus  under
                          Section 3(b) (the "Target  Bonus") and (y) a fraction,
                          the numerator  of which is the  number  of days in the
                          current calendar year through the Date of Termination,
                          and the denominator of which is 365; and

                      (3) any accrued vacation pay;

                  in each case to the  extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of
                  the amounts  described  in clauses  (1),  (2) and (3) shall be
                  hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                  B.  the amount equal to the product of (1) two and (2) the sum
                      of (x)  the  Executive's  Annual  Base Salary and (y)  the
                      Target Bonus.


                  (ii) the Option  Award  shall vest in accordance  with Section
         3(d)(i);

                  (iii) any stock awards,  stock options,  other than the Option
         Award, stock appreciation rights or other equity-based awards that were
         outstanding immediately prior to the Date of Termination ("Prior Equity
         Awards") shall vest and/or become  exercisable  in accordance  with the
         underlying plan for such Prior Equity Award;

                  (iv) for two years after the  Executive's  Date of Termination
         or  such  longer  period  as  may  be  provided  by  the  terms  of the
         appropriate  plan,  program,  practice  or policy,  the  Company  shall
         continue  benefits to the Executive  and/or the  Executive's  family at
         least  equal  to  those  which  would  have  been  provided  to them in
         accordance  with the welfare  plans,  programs,  practices and policies
         described  in  Section  3(e)  of  this  Agreement  if  the  Executive's
         employment  had  not  been  terminated  or,  if more  favorable  to the
         Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with respect
         to other peer  executives of the Company and its  affiliated  companies
         and their families,  provided  however,  that if the Executive  becomes
         reemployed with another  employer and is eligible to receive medical or
         dental benefits under another  employer  provided plan, the medical and
         dental benefits  described  herein shall be secondary to those provided
         under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility;


                  (v) any compensation  previously deferred (other than pursuant
         to a  tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the  Executive  (together
         with any accrued  interest or  earnings  thereon),  whether or not then
         vested,  shall become  vested on the Date of  Termination  and shall be
         paid in accordance with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under
         which it was deferred;

                  (vi) the  Company  shall,  at its sole  expense  as  incurred,
         provide  the  Executive  with  outplacement  services  suitable  to the
         Executive's  position  for a period  not to  exceed  two  years  with a
         nationally recognized outplacement firm; and,

                  (vii) to the  extent not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the
         Company  shall pay or provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
         benefits  required  to be paid or provided  or which the  Executive  is
         entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract
         or agreement of the Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than
         medical  or dental  benefits  if the  Executive  is  eligible  for such
         benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer), including earned but
         unpaid stock and similar  compensation but excluding any severance plan
         or  policy  (such  other  amounts  and  benefits  shall be  hereinafter
         referred to as the "Other Benefits").


                  (b) Cause;  Other  than for Good  Reason.  If the  Executive's
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, or if the
Executive  voluntarily  terminates  employment  during  the  Employment  Period,
excluding a  resignation  for Good  Reason,  the  Company  shall have no further
payment  obligations  to the  Executive  other  than for  amounts  described  in
Sections  5(a)(i)(A)(1) and 5(a)(i)(A)(3) and the timely payment or provision of
Other Benefits. In such case, all such amounts shall be paid to the Executive in
a lump sum within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.  Any unvested  portion of
the Option Award shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 3(d)(i).

                  (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment terminates by reason
of the Executive's death during the Employment Period,  all Accrued  Obligations
as of the time of death shall be paid to the Executive's  estate or beneficiary,
as  applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  estate  or  beneficiary  shall be  entitled  to any  Other
Benefits in  accordance  with their terms.  In addition,  the Option Award shall
vest in  accordance  with Section  3(d)(i).  Any Prior Equity  Awards shall vest

equity-based  award  until  the  earlier  of (A)  one  year  from  the  Date  of
Termination  (or such longer  period as may be  provided  under the terms of any
such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (d) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
reason of Disability during the Employment Period, all Accrued Obligations shall
be paid to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash  within  30 days of the Date of
Termination,  and the  Executive  shall be  entitled  to any Other  Benefits  in

such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (e) Retirement.  If the Executive's employment terminates as a
result of Retirement,  the Executive shall be paid the Accrued  Obligations in a
lump sum in cash  within 30 days of the Date of  Termination  and the  Executive
shall be entitled to any Other  Benefits in  accordance  with their  terms.  Any
remaining  portion of the Option Award shall vest or be forfeited in  accordance
with Section 3(d)(i).

                  6.  Change in Control.
                      -----------------

                  (a) Benefits Upon a Change in Control.  The Executive's rights
upon a termination of employment that occurs following a Change in Control shall
be as specified in Section 5 generally for termination of employment, except (i)
the amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall be three  times the sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period; (iii) the Option Award shall have vested in accordance with Section
3(d)(i);  and (iv) the Executive  shall be paid within 15 days after the Date of
Termination, an amount equal to the excess of

                           (A) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the
                  Company's applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan
                  in which the Executive is participating  immediately  prior to
                  his Date of Termination (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing the
                  rate  used  to   determine   lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent
                  applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions no less favorable to
                  the Executive than those in effect under the  Retirement  Plan
                  immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement), any SERPs in
                  which  the   Executive   participates   and,   to  the  extent
                  applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement
                  between  the  Executive  and  the  Company   ("Other   Pension
                  Benefits")   which  the   Executive   would   receive  if  the
                  Executive's  employment  continued for three  additional years
                  beyond the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that
                  all accrued benefits are fully vested,  and, assuming that the
                  Executive's compensation for such deemed additional period was
                  the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect  immediately
                  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
                  year during such deemed  additional period equal to the Target
                  Bonus, over

                           (B)  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  Executive's
                  actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement
                  Plan,  the SERPs and Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of
                  Termination  (utilizing  the rate used to determine  lump sums
                  and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial assumptions no
                  less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
                  Retirement  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  date  of  this
                  Agreement).

                  (b) Definition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in
Control"  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of   any  of  the  ----------  following
events after the date of this Agreement:

                  (i) any "person"  (within the meaning of Section  13(d) of the
         Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is or
         becomes the beneficial owner within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
         Exchange  Act  (a  "Beneficial  Owner"),  directly  or  indirectly,  of
         securities of Enterprise (not including in the securities  beneficially
         owned by such person any securities  acquired  directly from Enterprise
         or its  affiliates)  representing  25% or more of the  combined  voting
         power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities, excluding any person
         who becomes such a Beneficial  Owner in  connection  with a transaction
         described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

                  (ii)  the  following  individuals  cease  for  any  reason  to
         constitute  a majority of the number of directors  of  Enterprise  then
         serving: individuals who, on the date of this Agreement, constitute the
         Board  and  any new  director  (other  than a  director  whose  initial
         assumption  of office  is in  connection  with an actual or  threatened
         election contest,  including but not limited to a consent solicitation,
         relating to the election of directors of Enterprise)  whose appointment
         or election by the Board or  nomination  for  election by  Enterprise's
         stockholders  was  approved  or  recommended  by a  vote  of  at  least
         two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were
         directors  on  the  date  hereof  or  whose  appointment,  election  or
         nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

                  (iii)  there is  consummated  a  merger  or  consolidation  of
         Enterprise  or  any  direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
         Enterprise  with any  other  corporation,  other  than (A) a merger  or
         consolidation which would result in the voting securities of Enterprise
         outstanding   immediately   prior  to  such  merger  or   consolidation
         continuing to represent  (either by remaining  outstanding  or by being
         converted into voting  securities of the surviving entity or any parent
         thereof),  in  combination  with the  ownership of any trustee or other
         fiduciary  holding   securities  under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of
         Enterprise  or  any  subsidiary  of  Enterprise,  at  least  75% of the
         combined voting power of the securities of Enterprise or such surviving
         entity or any parent thereof outstanding  immediately after such merger
         or  consolidation,  or  (B)  a  merger  or  consolidation  effected  to
         implement a recapitalization of Enterprise (or similar  transaction) in
         which no  person  is or  becomes  the  Beneficial  Owner,  directly  or
         indirectly, of securities of Enterprise representing 25% or more of the
         combined voting power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

                  (iv) the shareholders of Enterprise approve a plan of complete
         liquidation  or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is  consummated an
         agreement  for  the  sale  or  disposition  by  Enterprise  of  all  or
         substantially  all  of  Enterprise's  assets,  other  than  a  sale  or
         disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of Enterprise's
         assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the combined  voting power of the
         voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders of Enterprise in
         substantially  the same  proportions  as their  ownership of Enterprise
         immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have
occurred  by  virtue  of  the  consummation  of any  transaction  or  series  of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

                  7.       Confidential Information; No Competition.
                           ----------------------------------------

                  (a) The Executive  shall hold in a fiduciary  capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information,  knowledge or data (defined
below)  relating to the Company or any of its  affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and
their  respective  businesses,  which shall have been  obtained by the Executive
during  the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  or any of its  affiliated
companies and which shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts
by the  Executive  or  representatives  of the  Executive  in  violation of this
Agreement).  Upon Termination of the Executive's employment,  he shall return to
the  Company all  Company  information.  After  termination  of the  Executive's
employment with the Company,  the Executive shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal  process,
communicate or divulge any such  information,  knowledge or data to anyone other
than the Company  and those  designated  by it,  except (x)  otherwise  publicly
available  information,  or (y) as may be  necessary to enforce his rights under
this Agreement or necessary to defend himself against a claim asserted  directly
or indirectly by the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination
has been made in  accordance  with  Section  7(d) or  Section 9 hereof  that the
Executive has violated this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the  provisions
of this Section 7 shall not constitute a basis for deferring or withholding  any
amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

                  (b)  As  used  herein,  the  term  "confidential  information,
knowledge  or data"  means  all  trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential
business information  belonging to, used by, or in the possession of the Company
or any of  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to
information,  knowledge  or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and
financial information, mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, purchase or sale
of  property,  leasing,  pricing,  sales  programs  or  tactics,  actual or past
sellers, purchasers,  lessees, lessors or customers, those with whom the Company
or its  affiliates and  subsidiaries  has begun  negotiations  for new business,
costs, employee  compensation,  marketing and development plans,  inventions and
technology,  whether such confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,
written or electronically  recorded or stored,  except information in the public
domain, information known by the Executive prior to employment with the Company,
and information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or
its affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

                  (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and  data,  as
defined in the previous paragraph,  gained in the performance of the Executive's
duties  hereunder  may be  valuable  to  those  who are now,  or  might  become,
competitors of the Company or its affiliates and subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
Executive agrees that,  without the written consent of Enterprise,  he will not,
for the  period  of one year  from  Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the
Employment Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage, operate, join,
control,  become  employed  by,  consult  to or  participate  in the  ownership,
management,  or control of any business which is in direct  competition with the
Company and/or its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive agrees
that, for two years following the Date of Termination,  he will not, directly or
indirectly,  solicit or hire,  or encourage  the  solicitation  or hiring of any
person who was a managerial or higher level  employee of the Company at any time
during the term of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer
other than the Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,
consultant or  otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement of the Executive  shall not
apply to any person after 6 months have elapsed  subsequent to the date on which
such person's employment by the Company has terminated.  In the case of any such
prohibited  activity,  the  Executive  shall not be entitled to  post-employment
payments (including any unexercised options under the Option Award).

                  (d) In the  event of a breach by the  Executive  of any of the
agreements set forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, it is agreed that the
Company  shall  suffer  irreparable  harm for  which  money  damages  are not an
adequate  remedy,  and that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company shall be
entitled to obtain an order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  for equitable
relief from such breach,  including,  but not limited to, temporary  restraining
orders and preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such
agreements by the Executive.  In the event that the Company should  initiate any
legal action for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in
this  Section 7 and the  Company  does not prevail in such  action,  the Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  the  Executive  the full amount of any court  costs,
filing  fees,  attorney's  fees which the  Executive  incurs in  defending  such
action, and any loss of income during the period of such litigation.

                  8.  Full Settlement.
                      ---------------

                  (a) No Duty to Mitigate;  No Reduction.  Except as provided in
Section  7(c),  and except to the extent that a Court under  Section  7(d) or an
arbitrator  appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine  to permit an offset in
respect of a violation by the Executive of his obligations  under Section 7, the
Company's  obligation  to make the payments  provided for in this  Agreement and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

                  (b)  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section
7(c), nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.
Vested  benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to
receive under the incentive  compensation plans referred to in Section 3(c), the
SERPs, or any other plan,  policy,  practice of program of the Company or any of
its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.


                  9.  Disputes

                  Except  with  respect  to  equitable  relief  provided  for in
Section 7(d), any dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged
violation  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  resolved  by   confidential   binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be held in Newark, New Jersey in accordance
with  the  Employment  Dispute  Resolution  Rules  of the  American  Arbitration
Association  and the United  States  Arbitration  Act.  Judgment  upon the award
rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.  All costs and expenses  incurred by the Company or the  Executive or
the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in  connection  with  any such  controversy  or
dispute, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne
by the Company as incurred,  except that the Executive  shall be responsible for
any such costs and expenses  incurred in connection with any claim determined by
the arbitrator to have been without  reasonable basis or to have been brought in
bad faith. The Executive shall be entitled to interest at the applicable Federal
rate  provided for in Section  7872 (f) (2)(A) of the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  on any delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator
determine he was entitled to under this Agreement.

                  10. Successors.
                      ----------

                  (a) No Assignment by Executive.  This Agreement is personal to
the Executive and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be
assignable  by the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

                  (b) Successors to Enterprise. This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.

                  (c) Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will
require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or  substantially  all of the business and/or
assets of Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same  manner and to the same  extent  that  Enterprise  would be required to
perform it if no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,
"Enterprise" shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to
its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this
Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

                  11. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
                      ------------------------------------------

                  (a) Anything   in   this    Agreement   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid
or  payable  or  distributed  or  distributable  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 11) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the  Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise  Tax"),  then the  Executive  shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a  "Gross-Up  Payment")  in an amount  such that  after  payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including,  without limitation,  any income and employment taxes
(and any interest  and  penalties  imposed with respect  thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed  upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the  Executive  retains  an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b) Subject  to   the   provisions  of  Section   11(c),   all
determinations  required to be made under this Section 11, including whether and
when a Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made
by the Company's  independent auditors or such other certified public accounting
firm  as may be  jointly  designated  by the  Executive  and  the  Company  (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to
the Company and the  Executive.  All fees and  expenses of the  Accounting  Firm
shall be borne  solely by the  Company.  Any  Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined
pursuant  to this  Section  11,  shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive
within  15 days of the  receipt  of the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
determination  by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
the  Code at the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  Accounting  Firm
hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Company  should  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the
calculations  required  to be made  hereunder.  In the  event  that the  Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is
required  to make a  payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the  Accounting  Firm  shall
determine  the  amount  of the  Underpayment  that  has  occurred  and any  such
Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

                  (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal  Revenue  Service that, if  successful,  would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period  ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim
is  due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior  to the
expiration  of such period that it desires to contest such claim,  the Executive
shall:

                  (i) give the Company any information  reasonably  requested
     by the Company relating to such claim,

                  (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim
     as the  Company  shall  reasonably  request in  writing  from time to time,
     including, without limitation,  accepting legal representation with respect
     to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                (iii) cooperate   with  the   Company   in  good faith  in order
     effectively to contest such claim, and

                (iv)  permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
     relating to such claim;

provided  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay  directly all costs and
expenses  (including  additional  interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall  indemnify  and hold the Executive  harmless,  on an
after-tax  basis,  for any  Excise  Tax or income tax  (including  interest  and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such  representation  and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this  Section  11(c),  the  Company  shall  control  all  proceedings  taken  in
connection  with such contest  and, at its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any
and all administrative appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the
taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole  option,  either
direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any  permissible  manner,  and the Executive  agrees to prosecute  such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties with respect  thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further  provided that any extension of the statute of limitations  relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which
such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's  control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment would be payable  hereunder and
the  Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any
other  issue  raised  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or any  other  taxing
authority.

                  (d) If,  after  the  receipt  by the  Executive  of an  amount
advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  11(c),  the  Executive  becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim,  the Executive  shall
(subject to the Company's  complying  with the  requirements  of Section  11(c))
promptly  pay to the  Company  the  amount  of such  refund  (together  with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section 11(c), a determination  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled
to any refund  with  respect to such claim and the  Company  does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration  of 30 days  after such  determination,  then such  advance  shall be
forgiven  and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such  advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
be paid.

                  12. Miscellaneous.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                  AGREEMENT, by  and  between  Public   Service Enterprise Group
Incorporated, a New Jersey Corporation ("Enterprise") and  Robert  J. Dougherty,
Jr. (the "Executive"),  dated as of October 17, 2000.

                  WHEREAS,  the Executive is currently  serving as President and
Chief Operating Officer of PSEG Energy Holdings Inc., a New Jersey  Corporation,
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enterprise (Enterprise and its subsidiaries and
affiliates being collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Company").

                  WHEREAS,  in consideration  of the substantial  benefits to be
provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement,  the Executive is willing to
commit himself to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions  herein
set forth; and

                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions for the  employment  relationship  of the
Executive  with  the  Company  during  the  Employment  Period  (as  hereinafter
defined):

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN  CONSIDERATION  of the  mutual  premises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.       General.
                           -------

                  (a)  Employment.  The Company  agrees to employ the Executive,
and the Executive  agrees to be employed by the Company,  in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

                  (b) Term. The term of the  Executive's  employment  under this
Agreement  (the  "Employment  Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the
"Effective  Date") and shall  continue  until  October 16, 2005.  In the event a
Change  in  Control  occurs  during  the  Employment  Period,  the  term  of the
Executive's  employment shall (unless  terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4
hereof) automatically continue until the later of the last day of the Employment
Period or the second  anniversary  of the Change in  Control.  In the event this
Agreement  is extended as provided in the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment
Period shall be the period from the Effective Date to the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.

                  2.       Position and Attention to Duties.
                           --------------------------------

                  (a) Position.  During  the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall  serve  as  President and  Chief Operating Officer of PSEG Energy Holdings
Inc. or  in another  senior  executive  position  or positions  for the Company,
as determined  by the Executive Officer ("CEO") and Board of Directors ("Board")
of Enterprise.

                  (b) Attention. During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of  vacation  and sick leave to which the  Executive  is  entitled,  the
Executive  agrees to devote full attention and time during normal business hours
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and to use his  reasonable  best
efforts to perform such  responsibilities in a professional manner. It shall not
be a violation of this  Agreement  for the  Executive to (i) serve on corporate,
civic or  charitable  boards  or  committees,  (ii)  deliver  lectures,  fulfill
speaking  engagements  or teach at  educational  institutions  and (iii)  manage
personal  investments,  so long as such  activities  do not  interfere  with the
performance of the  Executive's  responsibilities  as an officer and director of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

                  3.       Compensation.
                           ------------

                  Except  as  modified  by  this   Agreement,   the  Executive's
compensation  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with the  Company's  standard
compensation and payroll practices as in effect from time to time. The aggregate
of Base Salary,  Annual  Incentive  Compensation  and  Long-Term  Incentives  in
paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive
practices for companies of comparable size and standing.

                  (a) Base Salary. The annual rate of base salary payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
established by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee").  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible  increase at least
annually.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced,  and after any such increase
and the term  "Annual  Base Salary"  shall  thereafter  refer to the Annual Base
Salary as so increased.

                  (b) Annual Incentive  Compensation.  The Board has established
and intends to continue an annual incentive compensation plan for the benefit of
the officers and other key employees of the Company,  including  the  Executive,
based on  competitive  practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.
The  performance  objectives for the Executive in respect of such incentive will
be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

                  (c)  Long-Term  Incentives.  The  Board  has  established  and
intends to continue a long-term  incentive  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices for companies of comparable size and standing.  Such plan
may, in the judgment of the Compensation  Committee,  provide for stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or
units and/or other type of long-term  incentive  awards.  The type and amount of
equity  and any other  long-term  incentive  grants  will be  determined  by the
Compensation Committee from time to time, and awards thereunder shall be payable
to the Executive in accordance  with the  long-term  incentive  plan or plans in
effect from time to time.

                  (d)      Option Award.
                           ------------

         (i) In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will  assume  during  the
         Employment Period, the Executive shall be granted an award (the "Option
         Award")  of  non-qualified   options  under  the  Enterprise  Long-Term
         Incentive Plan ("LTIP") to purchase  250,000 shares of the Common Stock
         without nominal or par value of Enterprise  ("Stock").  Options granted
         under the Option Award are herein  referred to as "Options".  The grant
         price of the Options  shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on
         the New York Stock  Exchange on the  Effective  Date.  The  Executive's
         right  to the  Option  Award  shall  vest  and  become  exercisable  in
         accordance with the following schedule, provided that the Executive has
         remained  continuously  employed by the Company  during the  Employment
         Period through the dates indicated below:

                Date          Number of Shares
                ----          ----------------
         October 17, 2001           50,000
         October 17, 2002           50,000
         October 17, 2003           50,000
         October 17, 2004           50,000
         October 17, 2005           50,000

If, during the  Employment  Period (1) there occurs a Change in Control,  or (2)
Enterprise  enters  into an  agreement  to merge or  consolidate  with any other
corporation  which, if consummated,  would meet the requirements of Section 6(b)
(iii) and the  shareholders  of Enterprise  approve that  agreement,  the entire
Option  Award  shall  vest and become  exercisable.  If,  during the  Employment
Period, the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause or the
Executive  terminates  his  employment  for  Good  Reason,  or  the  Executive's
Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability, the Executive's right to
the entire  Option  Award  shall vest and become  exercisable  as of the Date of
Termination.  If,  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  terminates  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his  employment
without Good Reason, including Retirement, the Executive shall forfeit all right
to all  shares  of the  Option  Award  that  are not  vested  as of the  Date of
Termination.


         (ii)  The Options shall expire ten (10) years after the Effective Date.


         (iii) Once Options  become  exercisable  hereunder,  the  Executive may
         exercise such Options in any manner  permitted by the LTIP.  All vested
         options  shall be  exercised  or shall be  forfeited  no later than the
         earlier of three  years after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years
         after the Effective Date.

         (iv)  Unless  specifically  provided by this  Agreement,  all terms and
         conditions of the Options  granted  hereunder  shall be governed by the
         LTIP.

         (v) The  Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
         steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of
         any taxes that the  Company is  required  by law or  regulation  of any
         governmental  authority,  whether federal,  state or local, domestic or
         foreign,  to withhold in connection  with the Option Award,  including,
         but not  limited to (1)  withholding  delivery of the  certificate  for
         shares of Stock  until the  Executive  reimburses  the  Company for the
         amount it is required to withhold  with respect to such taxes,  (2) the
         canceling of any number of shares of Stock issuable to the Executive in
         an amount  necessary  to  reimburse  the  Company  for the amount it is
         required to so  withhold,  or (3)  withholding  the amount due from the
         Executive's other compensation.

                  (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment  Period,
(i) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement
plans,  practices,  policies  and  programs to the same  extent as other  senior
executives of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all
benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices,  policies and programs provided
by the Company, other than severance plans, practices, policies and programs but
including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary
continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and
as  supplemented  hereby.  Following  a Change in Control,  no benefit  coverage
available to the Executive  and/or to his family under any such plan,  practice,
policy or program shall be materially  reduced without the prior written consent
of the Executive.

                  (f)  Retirement  Benefit.  During the Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall   participate  in  Enterprise's   Pension  Plan,  and  also  in
Enterprise's   Limited  Supplemental   Benefits  Plan,   Mid-Career  Hire  Plan,
Reinstatement Plan and such other supplemental executive retirement plans as may
be adopted and amended by Enterprise from time to time ("SERPs"),  such that the
aggregate value of the retirement  benefits that he and his  beneficiaries  will
receive  under all pension  benefit plans of the Company  (whether  qualified or
not) will not be less than the benefits he would have  received had he continued
to participate in such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof
through the earlier of the end of the  Employment  Period or  Retirement.  It is
agreed that the Option Award and any dividends or other distributions in respect
of the Option  Award  shall not be  included  in any  pension  calculation.  The
Executive's  right to retire  shall be governed by the  Enterprise  Pension Plan
("Retirement").

                  (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable
expenses in carrying out his duties and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such expenses in accordance
with the  policies of the Company in effect from time to time for  reimbursement
of expenses for senior executives,  and subject to documentation provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

                   (h)  Fringe  Benefits. During  the  Employment  Period,   the
Executive shall participate in all fringe benefits and perquisites  available to
senior executives of the Company, including provision of an automobile, on terms
and conditions that are commensurate with his positions and  responsibilities at
the Company.

                  (i)  Vacation.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall be entitled to paid  vacation in  accordance  with Company  policy for its
most senior executives as in effect from time to time.

                  (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive  will retain all of
his rights in any  compensation  deferred prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Deferred  Compensation Plan,  including earnings thereon, and following
the date hereof the obligations of the Company to pay such deferred compensation
at the times and in the manner specified in the Deferred  Compensation Plan will
continue.

                  4.       Termination of Employment.
                           -------------------------

                  (a) Death or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable disability plan for senior executives.

                  (b)      By the Company.
                           --------------

                  (i) The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment
         during the Employment  Period for Cause or without Cause.  For purposes
         of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (A) willful and continued failure
         by the  Executive  to  substantially  perform  his  duties  under  this
         Agreement,   (B)  the  willful  engaging  by  the  Executive  in  gross
         misconduct  which  is  materially  and  demonstrably  injurious  to the
         Company,  or (C) the conviction of the Executive of a felony. No act or
         failure  to act on  the  part  of the  Executive  shall  be  considered
         "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in
         bad faith or without  reasonable belief that the Executive's  action or
         omission was in the best  interests of the Company.  Any act or failure
         to act that is based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
         adopted  by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company,  or the advice of
         counsel for the Company,  shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
         omitted  to be done,  by the  Executive  in good  faith and in the best
         interests of the Company.

                  (ii) A termination  of the  Executive's  employment  for Cause
         shall be effected in  accordance  with the  following  procedures.  The
         Company shall give the Executive written notice ("Notice of Termination
         for Cause") of its  intention to terminate the  Executive's  employment
         for Cause,  setting forth in reasonable  detail the specific conduct of
         the Executive  that it considers to  constitute  Cause and the specific
         provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies. Such notice shall be
         given no later than 60 days after the act or failure  (or the last in a
         series of acts or  failures)  that the  Company  alleges to  constitute
         Cause.  The Executive  shall have 30 days after receiving the Notice of
         Termination  for  Cause in which to cure  such act or  failure,  to the
         extent  such  cure is  possible.  In the  case of a  termination  under
         Section  4(b)(i)(A) or Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to
         cure such act or failure to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company,
         the Company shall give the Executive a second  written  notice  stating
         that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of
         the conduct  described in the Notice of Termination  for Cause and that
         such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Good Reason.
                           -----------

                  (i) The  Executive may  terminate  his  employment  during the
         Employment  Period for Good Reason or without Good Reason.  For purpose
         of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                    (A)  prior to the  occurrence  of a Change in  Control,  any
                         reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary;

                    (B)  following a Change in Control:

                         (1)  any  reduction  in  the  Executive's  Annual  Base
                    Salary,  target annual bonus,  target long-term incentive or
                    Retirement benefit;

                         (2)  any  adverse  change  in  the  Executive's  title,
                    authority,  duties,  responsibilities and reporting lines or
                    the   assignment   to  the   Executive   of  any  duties  or
                    responsibilities  inconsistent  in any  respect  with  those
                    customarily  associated  with the position of the  Executive
                    immediately prior to the Change in Control;

                         (3)  any  purported   termination  of  the  Executive's
                    employment  by the  Company  for a reason or in a manner not
                    expressly permitted by this Agreement;

                         (4) any failure by  Enterprise  to comply with  Section
                    10(c) of this Agreement; or

                         (5) any other material  breach of this Agreement by the
                    Company  that  either is not taken in good faith or, even if
                    taken in good faith, is not remedied by the Company promptly
                    after receipt of notice thereof from the Executive.

                  Following a Change in Control,  the Executive's  determination
                  that an act or failure to act constitutes Good Reason shall be
                  conclusively presumed to be valid unless such determination is
                  decided  to be  unreasonable  by  an  arbitrator  pursuant  to
                  Section 9.

                  (ii) A  termination  of  employment  by the Executive for Good
         Reason  shall be  effectuated  by giving  the  Company  written  notice
         ("Notice of Termination for Good Reason") of the  termination,  setting
         forth in  reasonable  detail  the  specific  acts or  omissions  of the
         Company that  constitute  Good Reason and the specific  provision(s) of
         this Agreement on which the Executive relies. Unless the CEO determines
         otherwise,  a Notice of  Termination  for Good Reason by the  Executive
         must be made  within 60 days  after  the  Executive  first  has  actual
         knowledge  of the act or  omission  (or the last in a series of acts or
         omissions) that the Executive  alleges to constitute  Good Reason,  and
         the  Company  shall  have 30 days from the  receipt  of such  Notice of
         Termination  for Good  Reason  to cure the  conduct  cited  therein.  A
         termination  of  employment  by the  Executive for Good Reason shall be
         effective  on the final day of such 30-day cure period  unless prior to
         such time the Company has cured the  specific  conduct  asserted by the
         Executive to constitute  Good Reason to the reasonable  satisfaction of
         the Executive.

                  (iii)  A  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  by the
         Executive without Good Reason, including Retirement,  shall be effected
         by giving the Company at least 30 days' written  notice  specifying the
         effective date of termination.

                  (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of Termination"  means the
date of the  Executive's  death,  the Disability  Effective Date, or the date on
which the termination of the Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or
without  Cause or by the  Executive  for Good  Reason or  without  Good  Reason,
including Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.


                  5.       Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
                           -------------------------------------------

                  (a)  Good  Reason;  Other  Than  for  Cause.  If,  during  the
Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's  employment other

                  (i) the Company  shall pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in

                            Date of Termination;

                        (2) the  product of (x) the  "target"  annual  bonus

                            a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
                            of days in the current calendar year through the
                            Date  of  Termination,  and the  denominator  of
                            which is 365; and

                        (3) any accrued vacation pay;

                  in each case to the  extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of
                  the amounts  described  in clauses  (1),  (2) and (3) shall be
                  hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                 B.     the amount  equal to the  product of (1) two and (2) the
                        sum of (x) the  Executive's  Annual  Base Salary and (y)
                        the Target Bonus.


                  (ii)  the  Option Award shall vest in  accordance with Section
        3(d)(i);

                  (iii) any stock awards,  stock options,  other than the Option
         Award, stock appreciation rights or other equity-based awards that were
         outstanding immediately prior to the Date of Termination ("Prior Equity
         Awards") shall vest and/or become  exercisable  in accordance  with the
         underlying plan for such Prior Equity Award;

                  (iv) for two years after the  Executive's  Date of Termination
         or  such  longer  period  as  may  be  provided  by  the  terms  of the
         appropriate  plan,  program,  practice  or policy,  the  Company  shall
         continue  benefits to the Executive  and/or the  Executive's  family at
         least  equal  to  those  which  would  have  been  provided  to them in
         accordance  with the welfare  plans,  programs,  practices and policies
         described  in  Section  3(e)  of  this  Agreement  if  the  Executive's
         employment  had  not  been  terminated  or,  if more  favorable  to the
         Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time thereafter with respect
         to other peer  executives of the Company and its  affiliated  companies
         and their families,  provided  however,  that if the Executive  becomes
         reemployed with another  employer and is eligible to receive medical or
         dental benefits under another  employer  provided plan, the medical and
         dental benefits  described  herein shall be secondary to those provided
         under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility;


                  (v) any compensation  previously deferred (other than pursuant
         to a  tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the  Executive  (together
         with any accrued  interest or  earnings  thereon),  whether or not then
         vested,  shall become  vested on the Date of  Termination  and shall be
         paid in accordance with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under
         which it was deferred;

                  (vi) the  Company  shall,  at its sole  expense  as  incurred,
         provide  the  Executive  with  outplacement  services  suitable  to the
         Executive's  position  for a period  not to  exceed  two  years  with a
         nationally recognized outplacement firm; and,

                  (vii) to the  extent not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the
         Company  shall pay or provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
         benefits  required  to be paid or provided  or which the  Executive  is
         entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract
         or agreement of the Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than
         medical  or dental  benefits  if the  Executive  is  eligible  for such
         benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer), including earned but
         unpaid stock and similar  compensation but excluding any severance plan
         or  policy  (such  other  amounts  and  benefits  shall be  hereinafter
         referred to as the "Other Benefits").


                  (b) Cause;  Other  than for Good  Reason.  If the  Executive's
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, or if the
Executive  voluntarily  terminates  employment  during  the  Employment  Period,
excluding a  resignation  for Good  Reason,  the  Company  shall have no further
payment  obligations  to the  Executive  other  than for  amounts  described  in
Sections  5(a)(i)(A)(1) and 5(a)(i)(A)(3) and the timely payment or provision of
Other Benefits. In such case, all such amounts shall be paid to the Executive in
a lump sum within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.  Any unvested  portion of
the Option Award shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 3(d)(i).

                  (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment terminates by reason

such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (d) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by

Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period; (iii) the Option Award shall have vested in accordance with Section
3(d)(i);  and (iv) the Executive  shall be paid within 15 days after the Date of

                  Company's applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan
                  in which the Executive is participating  immediately  prior to
                  his Date of Termination (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing the
                  rate  used  to   determine   lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent
                  applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions no less favorable to
                  the Executive than those in effect under the  Retirement  Plan
                  immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement), any SERPs in
                  which  the   Executive   participates   and,   to  the  extent
                  applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement
                  between  the  Executive  and  the  Company   ("Other   Pension
                  Benefits")   which  the   Executive   would   receive  if  the
                  Executive's  employment  continued for three  additional years
                  beyond the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that
                  all accrued benefits are fully vested,  and, assuming that the
                  Executive's compensation for such deemed additional period was
                  the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect  immediately
                  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
                  year during such deemed  additional period equal to the Target
                  Bonus, over

                           (B)  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  Executive's
                  actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement
                  Plan,  the SERPs and Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of
                  Termination  (utilizing  the rate used to determine  lump sums
                  and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial assumptions no
                  less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
                  Retirement  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  date  of  this
                  Agreement).

                  (b)      Definition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change
in  Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the  following events after the
date of this Agreement:

                  (i) any "person"  (within the meaning of Section  13(d) of the
         Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is or
         becomes the beneficial owner within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
         Exchange  Act  (a  "Beneficial  Owner"),  directly  or  indirectly,  of
         securities of Enterprise (not including in the securities  beneficially
         owned by such person any securities  acquired  directly from Enterprise
         or its  affiliates)  representing  25% or more of the  combined  voting
         power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities, excluding any person
         who becomes such a Beneficial  Owner in  connection  with a transaction
         described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

                  (ii)  the  following  individuals  cease  for  any  reason  to
         constitute  a majority of the number of directors  of  Enterprise  then
         serving: individuals who, on the date of this Agreement, constitute the
         Board  and  any new  director  (other  than a  director  whose  initial
         assumption  of office  is in  connection  with an actual or  threatened
         election contest,  including but not limited to a consent solicitation,
         relating to the election of directors of Enterprise)  whose appointment
         or election by the Board or  nomination  for  election by  Enterprise's
         stockholders  was  approved  or  recommended  by a  vote  of  at  least
         two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were
         directors  on  the  date  hereof  or  whose  appointment,  election  or
         nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

                  (iii)  there is  consummated  a  merger  or  consolidation  of
         Enterprise  or  any  direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
         Enterprise  with any  other  corporation,  other  than (A) a merger  or
         consolidation which would result in the voting securities of Enterprise
         outstanding   immediately   prior  to  such  merger  or   consolidation
         continuing to represent  (either by remaining  outstanding  or by being
         converted into voting  securities of the surviving entity or any parent
         thereof),  in  combination  with the  ownership of any trustee or other
         fiduciary  holding   securities  under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of
         Enterprise  or  any  subsidiary  of  Enterprise,  at  least  75% of the
         combined voting power of the securities of Enterprise or such surviving
         entity or any parent thereof outstanding  immediately after such merger
         or  consolidation,  or  (B)  a  merger  or  consolidation  effected  to
         implement a recapitalization of Enterprise (or similar  transaction) in
         which no  person  is or  becomes  the  Beneficial  Owner,  directly  or
         indirectly, of securities of Enterprise representing 25% or more of the
         combined voting power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

                  (iv) the shareholders of Enterprise approve a plan of complete
         liquidation  or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is  consummated an
         agreement  for  the  sale  or  disposition  by  Enterprise  of  all  or
         substantially  all  of  Enterprise's  assets,  other  than  a  sale  or
         disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of Enterprise's
         assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the combined  voting power of the
         voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders of Enterprise in
         substantially  the same  proportions  as their  ownership of Enterprise
         immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have
occurred  by  virtue  of  the  consummation  of any  transaction  or  series  of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

                  7.       Confidential Information; No Competition.
                           ----------------------------------------

                  (a) The Executive  shall hold in a fiduciary  capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information,  knowledge or data (defined
below)  relating to the Company or any of its  affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and
their  respective  businesses,  which shall have been  obtained by the Executive
during  the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  or any of its  affiliated
companies and which shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts
by the  Executive  or  representatives  of the  Executive  in  violation of this
Agreement).  Upon Termination of the Executive's employment,  he shall return to
the  Company all  Company  information.  After  termination  of the  Executive's
employment with the Company,  the Executive shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal  process,
communicate or divulge any such  information,  knowledge or data to anyone other
than the Company  and those  designated  by it,  except (x)  otherwise  publicly
available  information,  or (y) as may be  necessary to enforce his rights under
this Agreement or necessary to defend himself against a claim asserted  directly
or indirectly by the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination
has been made in  accordance  with  Section  7(d) or  Section 9 hereof  that the
Executive has violated this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the  provisions
of this Section 7 shall not constitute a basis for deferring or withholding  any
amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.


                  (b)  As  used  herein,  the  term  "confidential  information,
knowledge  or data"  means  all  trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential
business information  belonging to, used by, or in the possession of the Company
or any of  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to
information,  knowledge  or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and
financial information, mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, purchase or sale
of  property,  leasing,  pricing,  sales  programs  or  tactics,  actual or past
sellers, purchasers,  lessees, lessors or customers, those with whom the Company
or its  affiliates and  subsidiaries  has begun  negotiations  for new business,
costs, employee  compensation,  marketing and development plans,  inventions and
technology,  whether such confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,
written or electronically  recorded or stored,  except information in the public
domain, information known by the Executive prior to employment with the Company,
and information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or
its affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

                  (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and  data,  as
defined in the previous paragraph,  gained in the performance of the Executive's
duties  hereunder  may be  valuable  to  those  who are now,  or  might  become,
competitors of the Company or its affiliates and subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
Executive agrees that,  without the written consent of Enterprise,  he will not,
for the  period  of one year  from  Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the
Employment Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage, operate, join,
control,  become  employed  by,  consult  to or  participate  in the  ownership,
management,  or control of any business which is in direct  competition with the
Company and/or its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive agrees
that, for two years following the Date of Termination,  he will not, directly or
indirectly,  solicit or hire,  or encourage  the  solicitation  or hiring of any
person who was a managerial or higher level  employee of the Company at any time
during the term of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer
other than the Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,
consultant or  otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement of the Executive  shall not
apply to any person after 6 months have elapsed  subsequent to the date on which
such person's employment by the Company has terminated.  In the case of any such
prohibited  activity,  the  Executive  shall not be entitled to  post-employment
payments (including any unexercised options under the Option Award).


                  (d) In the  event of a breach by the  Executive  of any of the
agreements set forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, it is agreed that the
Company  shall  suffer  irreparable  harm for  which  money  damages  are not an
adequate  remedy,  and that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company shall be
entitled to obtain an order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  for equitable
relief from such breach,  including,  but not limited to, temporary  restraining
orders and preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such
agreements by the Executive.  In the event that the Company should  initiate any
legal action for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in
this  Section 7 and the  Company  does not prevail in such  action,  the Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  the  Executive  the full amount of any court  costs,
filing  fees,  attorney's  fees which the  Executive  incurs in  defending  such
action, and any loss of income during the period of such litigation.

                  8.       Full Settlement.
                           ---------------

                  (a) No Duty to Mitigate;  No Reduction.  Except as provided in
Section  7(c),  and except to the extent that a Court under  Section  7(d) or an
arbitrator  appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine  to permit an offset in
respect of a violation by the Executive of his obligations  under Section 7, the
Company's  obligation  to make the payments  provided for in this  Agreement and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.


                  (b)  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section
7(c), nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.
Vested  benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to
receive under the incentive  compensation plans referred to in Section 3(c), the
SERPs, or any other plan,  policy,  practice of program of the Company or any of
its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.


                  9.       Disputes

                  Except  with  respect  to  equitable  relief  provided  for in
Section 7(d), any dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged
violation  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  resolved  by   confidential   binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be held in Newark, New Jersey in accordance
with  the  Employment  Dispute  Resolution  Rules  of the  American  Arbitration
Association  and the United  States  Arbitration  Act.  Judgment  upon the award
rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.  All costs and expenses  incurred by the Company or the  Executive or
the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in  connection  with  any such  controversy  or
dispute, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne
by the Company as incurred,  except that the Executive  shall be responsible for
any such costs and expenses  incurred in connection with any claim determined by
the arbitrator to have been without  reasonable basis or to have been brought in
bad faith. The Executive shall be entitled to interest at the applicable Federal
rate  provided for in Section  7872 (f) (2)(A) of the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  on any delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator
determine he was entitled to under this Agreement.


                  10.      Successors.
                           ----------

                  (a) No Assignment by Executive.  This Agreement is personal to
the Executive and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be
assignable  by the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

                  (b) Successors to Enterprise.  This  Agreement  shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.

                  (c) Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will
require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or  substantially  all of the business and/or
assets of Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same  manner and to the same  extent  that  Enterprise  would be required to
perform it if no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,
"Enterprise" shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to
its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this
Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

                  11.      Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
                           ------------------------------------------

                  (a)    Anything   in   this    Agreement   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid
or  payable  or  distributed  or  distributable  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 11) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the  Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise  Tax"),  then the  Executive  shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a  "Gross-Up  Payment")  in an amount  such that  after  payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including,  without limitation,  any income and employment taxes
(and any interest  and  penalties  imposed with respect  thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed  upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the  Executive  retains  an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b)  Subject  to  the   provisions  of  Section   11(c),   all
determinations  required to be made under this Section 11, including whether and
when a Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made
by the Company's  independent auditors or such other certified public accounting
firm  as may be  jointly  designated  by the  Executive  and  the  Company  (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to
the Company and the  Executive.  All fees and  expenses of the  Accounting  Firm
shall be borne  solely by the  Company.  Any  Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined
pursuant  to this  Section  11,  shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive
within  15 days of the  receipt  of the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
determination  by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
the  Code at the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  Accounting  Firm
hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Company  should  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the
calculations  required  to be made  hereunder.  In the  event  that the  Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is
required  to make a  payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the  Accounting  Firm  shall
determine  the  amount  of the  Underpayment  that  has  occurred  and any  such
Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

                  (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal  Revenue  Service that, if  successful,  would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period  ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim
is  due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior  to the
expiration  of such period that it desires to contest such claim,  the Executive
shall:

                  (i)  give the Company any information reasonably requested by
     the Company relating to such claim,

                  (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim
     as the  Company  shall  reasonably  request in  writing  from time to time,
     including, without limitation,  accepting legal representation with respect
     to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                  (iii) cooperate  with  the  Company  in  good  faith in order
     effectively to contest such claim, and

                  (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings
     relating to such claim;

provided  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay  directly all costs and
expenses  (including  additional  interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall  indemnify  and hold the Executive  harmless,  on an
after-tax  basis,  for any  Excise  Tax or income tax  (including  interest  and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such  representation  and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this  Section  11(c),  the  Company  shall  control  all  proceedings  taken  in
connection  with such contest  and, at its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any
and all administrative appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the
taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole  option,  either
direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any  permissible  manner,  and the Executive  agrees to prosecute  such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties with respect  thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further  provided that any extension of the statute of limitations  relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which
such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's  control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment would be payable  hereunder and
the  Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any
other  issue  raised  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or any  other  taxing
authority.

                  (d) If,  after  the  receipt  by the  Executive  of an  amount
advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  11(c),  the  Executive  becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim,  the Executive  shall
(subject to the Company's  complying  with the  requirements  of Section  11(c))
promptly  pay to the  Company  the  amount  of such  refund  (together  with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section 11(c), a determination  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled
to any refund  with  respect to such claim and the  Company  does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration  of 30 days  after such  determination,  then such  advance  shall be
forgiven  and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such  advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
be paid.

                  12.      Miscellaneous.

withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

failure to insist upon strict  compliance  with any  provisions of, or to assert

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


                  AGREEMENT,  by and between  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group
Incorporated,  a New Jersey Corporation ("Enterprise") and Alfred C. Koeppe (the
"Executive"), dated as of October 17, 2000.


                  WHEREAS,  the Executive is currently  serving as President and
Chief Operating Officer of Public Service Electric and Gas Company, a New Jersey
Corporation,  and a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Enterprise  (Enterprise  and its
subsidiaries and affiliates being  collectively  hereinafter  referred to as the
"Company").

                  WHEREAS,  in consideration  of the substantial  benefits to be
provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement,  the Executive is willing to
commit himself to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions  herein
set forth; and


                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions for the  employment  relationship  of the
Executive  with  the  Company  during  the  Employment  Period  (as  hereinafter
defined):

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN  CONSIDERATION  of the  mutual  premises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.       General.
                           -------

                  (a)  Employment.  The Company  agrees to employ the Executive,
and the Executive  agrees to be employed by the Company,  in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

                  (b) Term. The term of the  Executive's  employment  under this
Agreement  (the  "Employment  Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the
"Effective  Date") and shall  continue  until  October 16, 2005.  In the event a
Change  in  Control  occurs  during  the  Employment  Period,  the  term  of the
Executive's  employment shall (unless  terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4
hereof) automatically continue until the later of the last day of the Employment
Period or the second  anniversary  of the Change in  Control.  In the event this
Agreement  is extended as provided in the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment
Period shall be the period from the Effective Date to the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.

                  2.       Position and Attention to Duties.
                           --------------------------------


                  (a)  Position.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall serve as President and Chief Operating  Officer of Public Service Electric
and Gas Company or in another  senior  executive  position or positions  for the
Company,  as  determined  by the Chief  Executive  Officer  ("CEO") and Board of
Directors ("Board") of Enterprise.


                  (b) Attention. During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of  vacation  and sick leave to which the  Executive  is  entitled,  the
Executive  agrees to devote full attention and time during normal business hours
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and to use his  reasonable  best
efforts to perform such  responsibilities in a professional manner. It shall not
be a violation of this  Agreement  for the  Executive to (i) serve on corporate,
civic or  charitable  boards  or  committees,  (ii)  deliver  lectures,  fulfill
speaking  engagements  or teach at  educational  institutions  and (iii)  manage
personal  investments,  so long as such  activities  do not  interfere  with the
performance of the  Executive's  responsibilities  as an officer and director of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

                  3.       Compensation.
                           ------------

                  Except  as  modified  by  this   Agreement,   the  Executive's
compensation  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with the  Company's  standard
compensation and payroll practices as in effect from time to time. The aggregate
of Base Salary,  Annual  Incentive  Compensation  and  Long-Term  Incentives  in
paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive
practices for companies of comparable size and standing.

                  (a) Base Salary. The annual rate of base salary payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
established by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee").  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible  increase at least
annually.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced,  and after any such increase
and the term  "Annual  Base Salary"  shall  thereafter  refer to the Annual Base
Salary as so increased.

                  (b) Annual Incentive  Compensation.  The Board has established
and intends to continue an annual incentive compensation plan for the benefit of
the officers and other key employees of the Company,  including  the  Executive,
based on  competitive  practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.
The  performance  objectives for the Executive in respect of such incentive will
be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

                  (c)  Long-Term  Incentives.  The  Board  has  established  and
intends to continue a long-term  incentive  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices for companies of comparable size and standing.  Such plan
may, in the judgment of the Compensation  Committee,  provide for stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or
units and/or other type of long-term  incentive  awards.  The type and amount of
equity  and any other  long-term  incentive  grants  will be  determined  by the
Compensation Committee from time to time, and awards thereunder shall be payable
to the Executive in accordance  with the  long-term  incentive  plan or plans in
effect from time to time.

                  (d)      Option Award.
                           ------------

         (i) In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will  assume  during  the
         Employment Period, the Executive shall be granted an award (the "Option
         Award")  of  non-qualified   options  under  the  Enterprise  Long-Term
         Incentive Plan ("LTIP") to purchase  250,000 shares of the Common Stock
         without nominal or par value of Enterprise  ("Stock").  Options granted
         under the Option Award are herein  referred to as "Options".  The grant
         price of the Options  shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on
         the New York Stock  Exchange on the  Effective  Date.  The  Executive's
         right  to the  Option  Award  shall  vest  and  become  exercisable  in
         accordance with the following schedule, provided that the Executive has
         remained  continuously  employed by the Company  during the  Employment
         Period through the dates indicated below:

            Date                 Number of Shares
            ----                 ----------------
         October 17, 2001           50,000
         October 17, 2002           50,000
         October 17, 2003           50,000
         October 17, 2004           50,000
         October 17, 2005           50,000



If, during the  Employment  Period (1) there occurs a Change in Control,  or (2)
Enterprise  enters  into an  agreement  to merge or  consolidate  with any other
corporation  which, if consummated,  would meet the requirements of Section 6(b)
(iii) and the  shareholders  of Enterprise  approve that  agreement,  the entire
Option  Award  shall  vest and become  exercisable.  If,  during the  Employment
Period, the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause or the
Executive  terminates  his  employment  for  Good  Reason,  or  the  Executive's
Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability, the Executive's right to
the entire  Option  Award  shall vest and become  exercisable  as of the Date of
Termination.  If,  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  terminates  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his  employment
without Good Reason, including Retirement, the Executive shall forfeit all right
to all  shares  of the  Option  Award  that  are not  vested  as of the  Date of
Termination.


         (ii) The  Options shall expire ten (10) years after the Effective Date.


         (iii) Once Options  become  exercisable  hereunder,  the  Executive may
         exercise such Options in any manner  permitted by the LTIP.  All vested
         options  shall be  exercised  or shall be  forfeited  no later than the
         earlier of three  years after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years
         after the Effective Date.

         (iv) Unless  specifically  provided  by this  Agreement,  all terms and
         conditions of the Options  granted  hereunder  shall be governed by the
         LTIP.


         (v) The  Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
         steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of
         any taxes that the  Company is  required  by law or  regulation  of any
         governmental  authority,  whether federal,  state or local, domestic or
         foreign,  to withhold in connection  with the Option Award,  including,
         but not  limited to (1)  withholding  delivery of the  certificate  for
         shares of Stock  until the  Executive  reimburses  the  Company for the
         amount it is required to withhold  with respect to such taxes,  (2) the
         canceling of any number of shares of Stock issuable to the Executive in
         an amount  necessary  to  reimburse  the  Company  for the amount it is
         required to so  withhold,  or (3)  withholding  the amount due from the
         Executive's other compensation.

                  (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment  Period,
(i) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement
plans,  practices,  policies  and  programs to the same  extent as other  senior
executives of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all
benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices,  policies and programs provided
by the Company, other than severance plans, practices, policies and programs but
including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary
continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and
as  supplemented  hereby.  Following  a Change in Control,  no benefit  coverage
available to the Executive  and/or to his family under any such plan,  practice,
policy or program shall be materially  reduced without the prior written consent
of the Executive.


                  (f)  Retirement  Benefit.  During the Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall   participate  in  Enterprise's   Pension  Plan,  and  also  in
Enterprise's   Limited  Supplemental   Benefits  Plan,   Mid-Career  Hire  Plan,
Reinstatement Plan and such other supplemental executive retirement plans as may
be adopted and amended by Enterprise from time to time ("SERPs"),  such that the
aggregate value of the retirement  benefits that he and his  beneficiaries  will
receive  under all pension  benefit plans of the Company  (whether  qualified or
not) will not be less than the benefits he would have  received had he continued
to participate in such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof
through  the  earlier of the end of the  Employment  Period or  Retirement,  and
giving  effect to the service  credits set forth in Section 8 of the  employment
agreement  dated August 23, 1995,  between PSE&G and the  Executive  (the "PSE&G
Employment Agreement"),  the terms of which Section 8 are incorporated herein by
reference, and a copy of which PSE&G Employment Agreement is attached hereto. It
is agreed that the Option  Award and any  dividends  or other  distributions  in
respect of the Option  Award shall not be  included in any pension  calculation.
The Executive's right to retire shall be governed by the Enterprise Pension Plan
("Retirement").


                  (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable
expenses in carrying out his duties and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such expenses in accordance
with the  policies of the Company in effect from time to time for  reimbursement
of expenses for senior executives,  and subject to documentation provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

                  (h)  Fringe  Benefits.   During  the  Employment  Period,  the
Executive shall participate in all fringe benefits and perquisites  available to
senior executives of the Company, including provision of an automobile, on terms
and conditions that are commensurate with his positions and  responsibilities at
the Company.

                  (i)  Vacation.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall be entitled to paid  vacation in  accordance  with Company  policy for its
most senior  executives as in effect from time to time,  or six weeks  vacation,
whichever is greater.

                  (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive  will retain all of
his rights in any  compensation  deferred prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Deferred  Compensation Plan,  including earnings thereon, and following
the date hereof the obligations of the Company to pay such deferred compensation
at the times and in the manner specified in the Deferred  Compensation Plan will
continue.

                  4.       Termination of Employment.
                           -------------------------

                  (a) Death or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable disability plan for senior executives.

                  (b)      By the Company.
                           --------------

                (i) The Company may terminate the Executive's  employment during
        the Employment  Period for Cause or without Cause.  For purposes of this
        Agreement,  "Cause" shall mean (A) willful and continued  failure by the
        Executive to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement,  (B)
        the  willful  engaging by the  Executive  in gross  misconduct  which is
        materially  and  demonstrably  injurious  to the  Company,  or  (C)  the
        conviction of the Executive of a felony. No act or failure to act on the
        part of the Executive shall be considered  "willful"  unless it is done,
        or  omitted  to be  done,  by the  Executive  in bad  faith  or  without
        reasonable  belief that the  Executive's  action or omission  was in the
        best  interests of the Company.  Any act or failure to act that is based
        upon authority  given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board
        of Directors  of the Company,  or the advice of counsel for the Company,
        shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the
        Executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company.

                (ii) A termination of the Executive's employment for Cause shall
        be effected in  accordance  with the following  procedures.  The Company
        shall give the Executive  written  notice  ("Notice of  Termination  for
        Cause") of its intention to terminate  the  Executive's  employment  for
        Cause,  setting forth in reasonable  detail the specific  conduct of the
        Executive  that it  considers  to  constitute  Cause  and  the  specific
        provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies.  Such notice shall be
        given no later than 60 days  after the act or failure  (or the last in a
        series of acts or  failures)  that the  Company  alleges  to  constitute
        Cause.  The Executive  shall have 30 days after  receiving the Notice of
        Termination  for  Cause  in which to cure  such act or  failure,  to the
        extent such cure is possible. In the case of a termination under Section
        4(b)(i)(A) or Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to cure such
        act or  failure  to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the  Company,  the
        Company shall give the Executive a second written notice stating that in
        the good  faith  opinion of the Board,  the  Executive  is guilty of the
        conduct  described in the Notice of Termination  for Cause and that such
        conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Good Reason.
                           -----------

                (i) The  Executive  may  terminate  his  employment  during  the
        Employment Period for Good Reason or without Good Reason. For purpose of
        this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                        (A)     prior to the  occurrence of a Change in Control,
                                any  reduction  in the  Executive's  Annual Base
                                Salary;

                        (B)     following a Change in Control:

                        (1) any reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary,
                target annual bonus,  target  long-term  incentive or Retirement
                benefit;

                        (2)  any  adverse  change  in  the  Executive's   title,
                authority,  duties,  responsibilities and reporting lines or the
                assignment  to the  Executive of any duties or  responsibilities
                inconsistent  in any respect with those  customarily  associated
                with the  position  of the  Executive  immediately  prior to the
                Change in Control;

                        (3)  any  purported   termination  of  the   Executive's
                employment  by the  Company  for a  reason  or in a  manner  not
                expressly permitted by this Agreement;

                        (4) any failure by  Enterprise  to comply  with  Section
                10(c) of this Agreement; or

                        (5) any other  material  breach of this Agreement by the
                Company that either is not taken in good faith or, even if taken
                in good faith,  is not  remedied by the Company  promptly  after
                receipt of notice thereof from the Executive.

                  Following a Change in Control,  the Executive's  determination
                  that an act or failure to act constitutes Good Reason shall be
                  conclusively presumed to be valid unless such determination is
                  decided  to be  unreasonable  by  an  arbitrator  pursuant  to
                  Section 9.

                (ii) A  termination  of  employment  by the  Executive  for Good
        Reason  shall be  effectuated  by  giving  the  Company  written  notice
        ("Notice of Termination  for Good Reason") of the  termination,  setting
        forth in reasonable detail the specific acts or omissions of the Company
        that  constitute  Good  Reason  and the  specific  provision(s)  of this
        Agreement  on which the  Executive  relies.  Unless  the CEO  determines
        otherwise, a Notice of Termination for Good Reason by the Executive must
        be made within 60 days after the Executive first has actual knowledge of
        the act or omission (or the last in a series of acts or omissions)  that
        the Executive  alleges to constitute Good Reason,  and the Company shall
        have 30 days from the  receipt of such  Notice of  Termination  for Good
        Reason to cure the conduct cited therein. A termination of employment by
        the  Executive  for Good Reason  shall be  effective on the final day of
        such 30-day cure period  unless prior to such time the Company has cured
        the specific conduct asserted by the Executive to constitute Good Reason
        to the reasonable satisfaction of the Executive.

                (iii)  A  termination  of  the  Executive's  employment  by  the
        Executive without Good Reason,  including Retirement,  shall be effected
        by giving the Company at least 30 days' written  notice  specifying  the
        effective date of termination.

                  (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of Termination"  means the
date of the  Executive's  death,  the Disability  Effective Date, or the date on
which the termination of the Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or
without  Cause or by the  Executive  for Good  Reason or  without  Good  Reason,
including Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.

                  5.       Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
                           -------------------------------------------

                  (a)  Good  Reason;  Other  Than  for  Cause.  If,  during  the
Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's  employment other
than for Cause,  death or  Disability,  or the  Executive  shall  terminate  his
employment for Good Reason:

                (i) the  Company  shall  pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in
        cash, within 15 days after the Date of Termination, the aggregate of the
        amounts set forth in clauses A and B below:

                  A.       The sum of:

                           (1) the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary
                               through the Date of Termination;

                           (2) the product of (x) the "target" annual bonus
                               under Section 3(b) (the "Target  Bonus") and
                               (y) a fraction,  the  numerator  of which is
                               the number of days in the  current  calendar
                               year  through the Date of  Termination,  and
                               the denominator of which is 365; and

                           (3) any accrued vacation pay;

                  in each case to the  extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of
                  the amounts  described  in clauses  (1),  (2) and (3) shall be
                  hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                 B.     the amount  equal to the  product of (1) two and (2) the
                        sum of (x) the  Executive's  Annual  Base Salary and (y)
                        the Target Bonus.


                (ii) the Option  Award  shall vest in  accordance  with  Section
        3(d)(i);

                (iii) any stock  awards,  stock  options,  other than the Option
        Award, stock appreciation  rights or other equity-based awards that were
        outstanding  immediately prior to the Date of Termination ("Prior Equity
        Awards")  shall vest and/or become  exercisable  in accordance  with the
        underlying plan for such Prior Equity Award;

                (iv) for two years after the Executive's  Date of Termination or
        such longer  period as may be  provided by the terms of the  appropriate
        plan,  program,  practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits
        to the Executive  and/or the Executive's  family at least equal to those
        which would have been  provided to them in  accordance  with the welfare
        plans,  programs,  practices  and policies  described in Section 3(e) of
        this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or,
        if more favorable to the Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time
        thereafter  with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its
        affiliated companies and their families,  provided however,  that if the
        Executive  becomes  reemployed with another  employer and is eligible to
        receive medical or dental benefits under another employer provided plan,
        the medical and dental benefits  described  herein shall be secondary to
        those  provided under such other plan during such  applicable  period of
        eligibility;

                (v) any compensation previously deferred (other than pursuant to
        a  tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the Executive  (together with
        any accrued interest or earnings  thereon),  whether or not then vested,
        shall  become  vested  on the Date of  Termination  and shall be paid in
        accordance with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under which it
        was deferred;

                (vi) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide
        the Executive with  outplacement  services  suitable to the  Executive's
        position  for a  period  not to  exceed  two  years  with  a  nationally
        recognized outplacement firm; and,

                (vii)  to the  extent  not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the
        Company  shall pay or  provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
        benefits  required  to be paid or  provided  or which the  Executive  is
        entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice,  contract
        or agreement  of the Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than
        medical  or  dental  benefits  if the  Executive  is  eligible  for such
        benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer),  including earned but
        unpaid stock and similar  compensation  but excluding any severance plan
        or policy (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred
        to as the "Other Benefits").


                  (b) Cause;  Other  than for Good  Reason.  If the  Executive's
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, or if the
Executive  voluntarily  terminates  employment  during  the  Employment  Period,
excluding a  resignation  for Good  Reason,  the  Company  shall have no further
payment  obligations  to the  Executive  other  than for  amounts  described  in
Sections  5(a)(i)(A)(1) and 5(a)(i)(A)(3) and the timely payment or provision of
Other Benefits. In such case, all such amounts shall be paid to the Executive in
a lump sum within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.  Any unvested  portion of
the Option Award shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 3(d)(i).

                  (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment terminates by reason
of the Executive's death during the Employment Period,  all Accrued  Obligations
as of the time of death shall be paid to the Executive's  estate or beneficiary,
as  applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  estate  or  beneficiary  shall be  entitled  to any  Other
Benefits in  accordance  with their terms.  In addition,  the Option Award shall
vest in  accordance  with Section  3(d)(i).  Any Prior Equity  Awards shall vest
and/or become exercisable, as the case may be, as of the Date of Termination and
the Executive's estate or beneficiary,  as the case may be, shall have the right
to exercise any such stock option, stock appreciation right or other exercisable
equity-based  award  until  the  earlier  of (A)  one  year  from  the  Date  of
Termination  (or such longer  period as may be  provided  under the terms of any
such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (d) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
reason of Disability during the Employment Period, all Accrued Obligations shall
be paid to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash  within  30 days of the Date of
Termination,  and the  Executive  shall be  entitled  to any Other  Benefits  in
accordance  with  their  terms.  In  addition,  the Option  Award  shall vest in
accordance with Section 3(d)(i).  Any Prior Equity Awards shall vest immediately
and/or become exercisable,  as the case may be, and the Executive shall have the
right to  exercise  any such stock  option,  stock  appreciation  right or other
exercisable  equity-based  award until the earlier of (A) one year from the Date
of Termination  (or such longer period as may be provided under the terms of any
such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (e) Retirement.  If the Executive's employment terminates as a
result of Retirement,  the Executive shall be paid the Accrued  Obligations in a
lump sum in cash  within 30 days of the Date of  Termination  and the  Executive
shall be entitled to any Other  Benefits in  accordance  with their  terms.  Any
remaining  portion of the Option Award shall vest or be forfeited in  accordance
with Section 3(d)(i).


                  6.       Change in Control.
                           -----------------


                  (a) Benefits Upon a Change in Control.  The Executive's rights
upon a termination of employment that occurs following a Change in Control shall
be as specified in Section 5 generally for termination of employment, except (i)
the amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall be three  times the sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period; (iii) the Option Award shall have vested in accordance with Section
3(d)(i);  and (iv) the Executive  shall be paid within 15 days after the Date of
Termination, an amount equal to the excess of


                           (A) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the
                  Company's applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan
                  in which the Executive is participating  immediately  prior to
                  his Date of Termination (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing the
                  rate  used  to   determine   lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent
                  applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions no less favorable to
                  the Executive than those in effect under the  Retirement  Plan
                  immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement), any SERPs in
                  which  the   Executive   participates   and,   to  the  extent
                  applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement
                  between  the  Executive  and  the  Company   ("Other   Pension
                  Benefits")   which  the   Executive   would   receive  if  the
                  Executive's  employment  continued for three  additional years
                  beyond the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that
                  all accrued benefits are fully vested,  and, assuming that the
                  Executive's compensation for such deemed additional period was
                  the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect  immediately
                  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
                  year during such deemed  additional period equal to the Target
                  Bonus, over

                           (B)  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  Executive's
                  actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement
                  Plan,  the SERPs and Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of
                  Termination  (utilizing  the rate used to determine  lump sums
                  and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial assumptions no
                  less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
                  Retirement  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  date  of  this
                  Agreement).

                  (b) Definition.  For purposes of  this Agreement, a "Change in
Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events after the date
of this Agreement:

                (i) any  "person"  (within the  meaning of Section  13(d) of the
        Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act") is or
        becomes the beneficial  owner within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
        Exchange  Act  (a  "Beneficial  Owner"),   directly  or  indirectly,  of
        securities of Enterprise  (not including in the securities  beneficially
        owned by such person any securities acquired directly from Enterprise or
        its affiliates) representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of
        Enterprise's  then  outstanding  securities,  excluding  any  person who
        becomes  such a  Beneficial  Owner  in  connection  with  a  transaction
        described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

                (ii)  the  following   individuals   cease  for  any  reason  to
        constitute  a majority of the number of  directors  of  Enterprise  then
        serving: individuals who, on the date of this Agreement,  constitute the
        Board  and  any  new  director  (other  than a  director  whose  initial
        assumption  of office  is in  connection  with an  actual or  threatened
        election contest,  including but not limited to a consent  solicitation,
        relating to the election of directors of Enterprise)  whose  appointment
        or  election by the Board or  nomination  for  election by  Enterprise's
        stockholders  was  approved  or  recommended  by  a  vote  of  at  least
        two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors  then still in office who either were
        directors  on  the  date  hereof  or  whose  appointment,   election  or
        nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

                (iii)  there  is  consummated  a  merger  or   consolidation  of
        Enterprise  or  any  direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned   subsidiary  of
        Enterprise  with any  other  corporation,  other  than  (A) a merger  or
        consolidation  which would result in the voting securities of Enterprise
        outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing
        to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into
        voting  securities of the surviving  entity or any parent  thereof),  in
        combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding
        securities   under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of  Enterprise  or  any
        subsidiary of Enterprise,  at least 75% of the combined  voting power of
        the  securities  of Enterprise  or such  surviving  entity or any parent
        thereof outstanding  immediately after such merger or consolidation,  or
        (B) a merger or consolidation  effected to implement a  recapitalization
        of Enterprise (or similar  transaction) in which no person is or becomes
        the  Beneficial  Owner,   directly  or  indirectly,   of  securities  of
        Enterprise  representing  25% or more of the  combined  voting  power of
        Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

                (iv) the  shareholders of Enterprise  approve a plan of complete
        liquidation  or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is  consummated  an
        agreement  for  the  sale  or   disposition  by  Enterprise  of  all  or
        substantially  all  of  Enterprise's   assets,  other  than  a  sale  or
        disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of  Enterprise's
        assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the  combined  voting power of the
        voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders  of Enterprise in
        substantially  the same  proportions  as their  ownership of  Enterprise
        immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have
occurred  by  virtue  of  the  consummation  of any  transaction  or  series  of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

                  7.       Confidential Information; No Competition.
                           ----------------------------------------

                  (a) The Executive  shall hold in a fiduciary  capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information,  knowledge or data (defined
below)  relating to the Company or any of its  affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and
their  respective  businesses,  which shall have been  obtained by the Executive
during  the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  or any of its  affiliated
companies and which shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts
by the  Executive  or  representatives  of the  Executive  in  violation of this
Agreement).  Upon Termination of the Executive's employment,  he shall return to
the  Company all  Company  information.  After  termination  of the  Executive's
employment with the Company,  the Executive shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal  process,
communicate or divulge any such  information,  knowledge or data to anyone other
than the Company  and those  designated  by it,  except (x)  otherwise  publicly
available  information,  or (y) as may be  necessary to enforce his rights under
this Agreement or necessary to defend himself against a claim asserted  directly
or indirectly by the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination
has been made in  accordance  with  Section  7(d) or  Section 9 hereof  that the
Executive has violated this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the  provisions
of this Section 7 shall not constitute a basis for deferring or withholding  any
amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.


                  (b)  As  used  herein,  the  term  "confidential  information,
knowledge  or data"  means  all  trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential
business information  belonging to, used by, or in the possession of the Company
or any of  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to
information,  knowledge  or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and
financial information, mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, purchase or sale
of  property,  leasing,  pricing,  sales  programs  or  tactics,  actual or past
sellers, purchasers,  lessees, lessors or customers, those with whom the Company
or its  affiliates and  subsidiaries  has begun  negotiations  for new business,
costs, employee  compensation,  marketing and development plans,  inventions and
technology,  whether such confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,
written or electronically  recorded or stored,  except information in the public
domain, information known by the Executive prior to employment with the Company,
and information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or
its affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

                  (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and  data,  as
defined in the previous paragraph,  gained in the performance of the Executive's
duties  hereunder  may be  valuable  to  those  who are now,  or  might  become,
competitors of the Company or its affiliates and subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
Executive agrees that,  without the written consent of Enterprise,  he will not,
for the  period  of one year  from  Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the
Employment Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage, operate, join,
control,  become  employed  by,  consult  to or  participate  in the  ownership,
management,  or control of any business which is in direct  competition with the
Company and/or its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive agrees
that, for two years following the Date of Termination,  he will not, directly or
indirectly,  solicit or hire,  or encourage  the  solicitation  or hiring of any
person who was a managerial or higher level  employee of the Company at any time
during the term of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer
other than the Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,
consultant or  otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement of the Executive  shall not
apply to any person after 6 months have elapsed  subsequent to the date on which
such person's employment by the Company has terminated.  In the case of any such
prohibited  activity,  the  Executive  shall not be entitled to  post-employment
payments (including any unexercised options under the Option Award).


                  (d) In the  event of a breach by the  Executive  of any of the
agreements set forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, it is agreed that the
Company  shall  suffer  irreparable  harm for  which  money  damages  are not an
adequate  remedy,  and that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company shall be
entitled to obtain an order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  for equitable
relief from such breach,  including,  but not limited to, temporary  restraining
orders and preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such
agreements by the Executive.  In the event that the Company should  initiate any
legal action for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in
this  Section 7 and the  Company  does not prevail in such  action,  the Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  the  Executive  the full amount of any court  costs,
filing  fees,  attorney's  fees which the  Executive  incurs in  defending  such
action, and any loss of income during the period of such litigation.

                  8.       Full Settlement.
                           ---------------

                  (a) No Duty to Mitigate;  No Reduction.  Except as provided in
Section  7(c),  and except to the extent that a Court under  Section  7(d) or an
arbitrator  appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine  to permit an offset in
respect of a violation by the Executive of his obligations  under Section 7, the
Company's  obligation  to make the payments  provided for in this  Agreement and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.


                  (b)  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section
7(c), nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.
Vested  benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to
receive under the incentive  compensation plans referred to in Section 3(c), the
SERPs, or any other plan,  policy,  practice of program of the Company or any of
its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.


                  9.       Disputes

                  Except  with  respect  to  equitable  relief  provided  for in
Section 7(d), any dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged
violation  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  resolved  by   confidential   binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be held in Newark, New Jersey in accordance
with  the  Employment  Dispute  Resolution  Rules  of the  American  Arbitration
Association  and the United  States  Arbitration  Act.  Judgment  upon the award
rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.  All costs and expenses  incurred by the Company or the  Executive or
the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in  connection  with  any such  controversy  or
dispute, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne
by the Company as incurred,  except that the Executive  shall be responsible for
any such costs and expenses  incurred in connection with any claim determined by
the arbitrator to have been without  reasonable basis or to have been brought in
bad faith. The Executive shall be entitled to interest at the applicable Federal
rate  provided for in Section  7872 (f) (2)(A) of the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  on any delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator
determine he was entitled to under this Agreement.

                  10.      Successors.
                           ----------

                  (a) No Assignment by Executive.  This Agreement is personal to
the Executive and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be
assignable  by the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Executive's legal representatives.

                  (b) Successors to Enterprise.  This Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.

                  (c) Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will
require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or  substantially  all of the business and/or
assets of Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in
the same  manner and to the same  extent  that  Enterprise  would be required to
perform it if no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,
"Enterprise" shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to
its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this
Agreement by operation of law, or otherwise.

                  11.      Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
                           ------------------------------------------

                  (a)    Anything   in   this    Agreement   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid
or  payable  or  distributed  or  distributable  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 11) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the  Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise  Tax"),  then the  Executive  shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a  "Gross-Up  Payment")  in an amount  such that  after  payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including,  without limitation,  any income and employment taxes
(and any interest  and  penalties  imposed with respect  thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed  upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the  Executive  retains  an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b)  Subject  to  the   provisions  of  Section   11(c),   all
determinations  required to be made under this Section 11, including whether and
when a Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made
by the Company's  independent auditors or such other certified public accounting
firm  as may be  jointly  designated  by the  Executive  and  the  Company  (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to
the Company and the  Executive.  All fees and  expenses of the  Accounting  Firm
shall be borne  solely by the  Company.  Any  Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined
pursuant  to this  Section  11,  shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive
within  15 days of the  receipt  of the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
determination  by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
the  Code at the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  Accounting  Firm
hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Company  should  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the
calculations  required  to be made  hereunder.  In the  event  that the  Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is
required  to make a  payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the  Accounting  Firm  shall
determine  the  amount  of the  Underpayment  that  has  occurred  and any  such
Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

                  (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal  Revenue  Service that, if  successful,  would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period  ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim
is  due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior  to the
expiration  of such period that it desires to contest such claim,  the Executive
shall:

                (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the
        Company relating to such claim,

                (ii) take such action in connection  with  contesting such claim
        as the Company  shall  reasonably  request in writing from time to time,
        including,  without  limitation,  accepting  legal  representation  with
        respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                (iii)  cooperate  with  the  Company  in  good  faith  in  order
        effectively to contest such claim, and

                (iv)  permit  the  Company  to  participate  in any  proceedings
        relating to such claim;

provided  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay  directly all costs and
expenses  (including  additional  interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall  indemnify  and hold the Executive  harmless,  on an
after-tax  basis,  for any  Excise  Tax or income tax  (including  interest  and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such  representation  and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this  Section  11(c),  the  Company  shall  control  all  proceedings  taken  in
connection  with such contest  and, at its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any
and all administrative appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the
taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole  option,  either
direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any  permissible  manner,  and the Executive  agrees to prosecute  such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties with respect  thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further  provided that any extension of the statute of limitations  relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which
such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's  control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment would be payable  hereunder and
the  Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any
other  issue  raised  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or any  other  taxing
authority.

                  (d) If,  after  the  receipt  by the  Executive  of an  amount
advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  11(c),  the  Executive  becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim,  the Executive  shall
(subject to the Company's  complying  with the  requirements  of Section  11(c))
promptly  pay to the  Company  the  amount  of such  refund  (together  with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section 11(c), a determination  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled
to any refund  with  respect to such claim and the  Company  does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration  of 30 days  after such  determination,  then such  advance  shall be
forgiven  and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such  advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
be paid.

                  12.      Miscellaneous.
                           -------------

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

                  AGREEMENT,  by and between  Public  Service  Enterprise  Group
Incorporated,  a New Jersey Corporation ("Enterprise") and Robert C. Murray (the
"Executive"), dated as of October 17, 2000.

                  WHEREAS,  the Executive is currently serving as Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer of Enterprise and Executive Vice President - Finance
of PSEG Services Corporation, both New Jersey Corporations and both wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Enterprise (Enterprise and its subsidiaries and affiliates being
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Company").

                  WHEREAS,  in consideration  of the substantial  benefits to be
provided by the Company pursuant to this Agreement,  the Executive is willing to
commit himself to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions  herein
set forth; and

                  WHEREAS,  the  parties  desire to enter  into  this  Agreement
setting forth the terms and conditions for the  employment  relationship  of the
Executive  with  the  Company  during  the  Employment  Period  (as  hereinafter
defined):

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN  CONSIDERATION  of the  mutual  premises,
covenants and agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

                  1.       General.
                           -------

                  (a)  Employment.  The Company  agrees to employ the Executive,
and the Executive  agrees to be employed by the Company,  in accordance with the
terms and provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

                  (b) Term. The term of the  Executive's  employment  under this
Agreement  (the  "Employment  Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the
"Effective  Date") and shall  continue  until  October 16, 2005.  In the event a
Change  in  Control  occurs  during  the  Employment  Period,  the  term  of the
Executive's  employment shall (unless  terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4
hereof) automatically continue until the later of the last day of the Employment
Period or the second  anniversary  of the Change in  Control.  In the event this
Agreement  is extended as provided in the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment
Period shall be the period from the Effective Date to the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.

                  2.       Position and Attention to Duties.
                           --------------------------------

                  (a)  Position.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall serve as Vice  President and Chief  Financial  Officer of  Enterprise  and
Executive  Vice  President - Finance of PSEG Services  Corporation or in another
senior  executive  position or positions  for the Company,  as determined by the
Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Board of Directors ("Board") of Enterprise.

                  (b) Attention. During the Employment Period, and excluding any
periods of  vacation  and sick leave to which the  Executive  is  entitled,  the
Executive  agrees to devote full attention and time during normal business hours
to the  business  and  affairs of the  Company  and to use his  reasonable  best
efforts to perform such  responsibilities in a professional manner. It shall not
be a violation of this  Agreement  for the  Executive to (i) serve on corporate,
civic or  charitable  boards  or  committees,  (ii)  deliver  lectures,  fulfill
speaking  engagements  or teach at  educational  institutions  and (iii)  manage
personal  investments,  so long as such  activities  do not  interfere  with the
performance of the  Executive's  responsibilities  as an officer and director of
the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

                  3.       Compensation.
                           ------------

                  Except  as  modified  by  this   Agreement,   the  Executive's
compensation  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with the  Company's  standard
compensation and payroll practices as in effect from time to time. The aggregate
of Base Salary,  Annual  Incentive  Compensation  and  Long-Term  Incentives  in
paragraphs  (a), (b) and (c) below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive
practices for companies of comparable size and standing.

                  (a) Base Salary. The annual rate of base salary payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
established by the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the
"Compensation Committee").  During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary
shall be reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible  increase at least
annually.  Annual Base Salary shall not be reduced,  and after any such increase
and the term  "Annual  Base Salary"  shall  thereafter  refer to the Annual Base
Salary as so increased.

                  (b) Annual Incentive  Compensation.  The Board has established
and intends to continue an annual incentive compensation plan for the benefit of
the officers and other key employees of the Company,  including  the  Executive,
based on  competitive  practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.
The  performance  objectives for the Executive in respect of such incentive will
be determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

                  (c)  Long-Term  Incentives.  The  Board  has  established  and
intends to continue a long-term  incentive  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices for companies of comparable size and standing.  Such plan
may, in the judgment of the Compensation  Committee,  provide for stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or
units and/or other type of long-term  incentive  awards.  The type and amount of
equity  and any other  long-term  incentive  grants  will be  determined  by the
Compensation Committee from time to time, and awards thereunder shall be payable
to the Executive in accordance  with the  long-term  incentive  plan or plans in
effect from time to time.

                  (d)      Option Award.
                           ------------

         (i) In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will  assume  during  the
         Employment Period, the Executive shall be granted an award (the "Option
         Award")  of  non-qualified   options  under  the  Enterprise  Long-Term
         Incentive Plan ("LTIP") to purchase  250,000 shares of the Common Stock
         without nominal or par value of Enterprise  ("Stock").  Options granted
         under the Option Award are herein  referred to as "Options".  The grant
         price of the Options  shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on
         the New York Stock  Exchange on the  Effective  Date.  The  Executive's
         right  to the  Option  Award  shall  vest  and  become  exercisable  in
         accordance with the following schedule, provided that the Executive has
         remained  continuously  employed by the Company  during the  Employment
         Period through the dates indicated below:


            Date                  Number of Shares
            ----                  ----------------
         October 17, 2001           50,000
         October 17, 2002           50,000
         October 17, 2003           50,000
         October 17, 2004           50,000
         October 17, 2005           50,000

If, during the  Employment  Period (1) there occurs a Change in Control,  or (2)
Enterprise  enters  into an  agreement  to merge or  consolidate  with any other
corporation  which, if consummated,  would meet the requirements of Section 6(b)
(iii) and the  shareholders  of Enterprise  approve that  agreement,  the entire
Option  Award  shall  vest and become  exercisable.  If,  during the  Employment
Period, the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause or the
Executive  terminates  his  employment  for  Good  Reason,  or  the  Executive's
Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability, the Executive's right to
the entire  Option  Award  shall vest and become  exercisable  as of the Date of
Termination.  If,  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  terminates  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his  employment
without Good Reason, including Retirement, the Executive shall forfeit all right
to all  shares  of the  Option  Award  that  are not  vested  as of the  Date of
Termination.

         (ii)  The Options shall expire ten (10) years after the Effective Date.

         (iii) Once Options  become  exercisable  hereunder,  the  Executive may
         exercise such Options in any manner  permitted by the LTIP.  All vested
         options  shall be  exercised  or shall be  forfeited  no later than the
         earlier of three  years after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years
         after the Effective Date.

         (iv)  Unless  specifically  provided by this  Agreement,  all terms and
         conditions of the Options  granted  hereunder  shall be governed by the
         LTIP.

         (v) The  Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
         steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of
         any taxes that the  Company is  required  by law or  regulation  of any
         governmental  authority,  whether federal,  state or local, domestic or
         foreign,  to withhold in connection  with the Option Award,  including,
         but not  limited to (1)  withholding  delivery of the  certificate  for
         shares of Stock  until the  Executive  reimburses  the  Company for the
         amount it is required to withhold  with respect to such taxes,  (2) the
         canceling of any number of shares of Stock issuable to the Executive in
         an amount  necessary  to  reimburse  the  Company  for the amount it is
         required to so  withhold,  or (3)  withholding  the amount due from the
         Executive's other compensation.

                  (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment  Period,
(i) the Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement
plans,  practices,  policies  and  programs to the same  extent as other  senior
executives of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's  family,
as the case may be, shall be eligible for participation in and shall receive all
benefits under welfare benefit plans, practices,  policies and programs provided
by the Company, other than severance plans, practices, policies and programs but
including, without limitation, medical, prescription, dental, disability, salary
continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and
as  supplemented  hereby.  Following  a Change in Control,  no benefit  coverage
available to the Executive  and/or to his family under any such plan,  practice,
policy or program shall be materially  reduced without the prior written consent
of the Executive.

                  (f)  Retirement  Benefit.  During the Employment  Period,  the
Executive  shall   participate  in  Enterprise's   Pension  Plan,  and  also  in
Enterprise's   Limited  Supplemental   Benefits  Plan,   Mid-Career  Hire  Plan,
Reinstatement Plan and such other supplemental executive retirement plans as may
be adopted and amended by Enterprise from time to time ("SERPs"),  such that the
aggregate value of the retirement  benefits that he and his  beneficiaries  will
receive  under all pension  benefit plans of the Company  (whether  qualified or
not) will not be less than the benefits he would have  received had he continued
to participate in such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof
through  the  earlier of the end of the  Employment  Period or  Retirement,  and
giving effect to the service credits as set forth in Section 7 of the employment
agreement dated December 17, 1991, as amended by letter  agreement dated January
6, 1998, between PSE&G and the Executive (the "PSE&G Employment Agreement"), the
terms of which Section 7 are  incorporated  herein by  reference,  and a copy of
which  PSE&G  Employment  Agreement  is attached  hereto.  It is agreed that the
Option Award and any dividends or other  distributions  in respect of the Option
Award shall not be included in any pension calculation. The Executive's right to
retire shall be governed by the Enterprise Pension Plan ("Retirement").

                  (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable
expenses in carrying out his duties and  responsibilities  under this Agreement.
The Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such expenses in accordance
with the  policies of the Company in effect from time to time for  reimbursement
of expenses for senior executives,  and subject to documentation provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

                  (h)  Fringe  Benefits.   During  the  Employment  Period,  the
Executive shall participate in all fringe benefits and perquisites  available to
senior executives of the Company, including provision of an automobile, on terms
and conditions that are commensurate with his positions and  responsibilities at
the Company.

                  (i)  Vacation.  During the  Employment  Period,  the Executive
shall be entitled to paid  vacation in  accordance  with Company  policy for its
most senior  executives as in effect from time to time,  or six weeks  vacation,
whichever is greater.

                  (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive  will retain all of
his rights in any  compensation  deferred prior to the date hereof in accordance
with the Deferred  Compensation Plan,  including earnings thereon, and following
the date hereof the obligations of the Company to pay such deferred compensation
at the times and in the manner specified in the Deferred  Compensation Plan will
continue.

                  4.       Termination of Employment.
                           -------------------------

                  (a) Death or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death during the Employment Period.
If the Company determines in good faith that the Disability of the Executive has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable disability plan for senior executives.

                  (b)      By the Company.
                           --------------

                  (i) The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment
         during the Employment  Period for Cause or without Cause.  For purposes
         of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (A) willful and continued failure
         by the  Executive  to  substantially  perform  his  duties  under  this
         Agreement,   (B)  the  willful  engaging  by  the  Executive  in  gross
         misconduct  which  is  materially  and  demonstrably  injurious  to the
         Company,  or (C) the conviction of the Executive of a felony. No act or
         failure  to act on  the  part  of the  Executive  shall  be  considered
         "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in
         bad faith or without  reasonable belief that the Executive's  action or
         omission was in the best  interests of the Company.  Any act or failure
         to act that is based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly
         adopted  by the Board of  Directors  of the  Company,  or the advice of
         counsel for the Company,  shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or
         omitted  to be done,  by the  Executive  in good  faith and in the best
         interests of the Company.

                  (ii) A termination  of the  Executive's  employment  for Cause
         shall be effected in  accordance  with the  following  procedures.  The
         Company shall give the Executive written notice ("Notice of Termination
         for Cause") of its  intention to terminate the  Executive's  employment
         for Cause,  setting forth in reasonable  detail the specific conduct of
         the Executive  that it considers to  constitute  Cause and the specific
         provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies. Such notice shall be
         given no later than 60 days after the act or failure  (or the last in a
         series of acts or  failures)  that the  Company  alleges to  constitute
         Cause.  The Executive  shall have 30 days after receiving the Notice of
         Termination  for  Cause in which to cure  such act or  failure,  to the
         extent  such  cure is  possible.  In the  case of a  termination  under
         Section  4(b)(i)(A) or Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to
         cure such act or failure to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company,
         the Company shall give the Executive a second  written  notice  stating
         that in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is guilty of
         the conduct  described in the Notice of Termination  for Cause and that
         such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

                  (c)      Good Reason.
                           -----------

                  (i) The  Executive may  terminate  his  employment  during the
         Employment  Period for Good Reason or without Good Reason.  For purpose
         of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

                (A)     prior to the  occurrence  of a Change  in  Control,  any
                        reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary;

                (B)     following a Change in Control:

                        (1) any reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary,
                target annual bonus,  target  long-term  incentive or Retirement
                benefit;

                        (2) any  adverse  change   in  the  Executive's   title,
                authority,  duties,  responsibilities and reporting lines or the
                assignment  to the  Executive of any duties or  responsibilities
                inconsistent  in any respect with those  customarily  associated
                with the  position  of the  Executive  immediately  prior to the
                Change in Control;

                        (3) any   purported   termination  of  the   Executive's
                employment  by the  Company  for a  reason  or in a  manner  not
                expressly permitted by this Agreement;

                        (4) any failure by  Enterprise  to comply  with  Section
                10(c) of this Agreement; or

                        (5) any other  material  breach of this Agreement by the
                Company that either is not taken in good faith or, even if taken
                in good faith,  is not  remedied by the Company  promptly  after
                receipt of notice thereof from the Executive.

                  Following a Change in Control,  the Executive's  determination
                  that an act or failure to act constitutes Good Reason shall be
                  conclusively presumed to be valid unless such determination is
                  decided  to be  unreasonable  by  an  arbitrator  pursuant  to
                  Section 9.

                (ii) A  termination  of  employment  by the  Executive  for Good
        Reason  shall be  effectuated  by  giving  the  Company  written  notice
        ("Notice of Termination  for Good Reason") of the  termination,  setting
        forth in reasonable detail the specific acts or omissions of the Company
        that  constitute  Good  Reason  and the  specific  provision(s)  of this
        Agreement  on which the  Executive  relies.  Unless  the CEO  determines
        otherwise, a Notice of Termination for Good Reason by the Executive must
        be made within 60 days after the Executive first has actual knowledge of
        the act or omission (or the last in a series of acts or omissions)  that
        the Executive  alleges to constitute Good Reason,  and the Company shall
        have 30 days from the  receipt of such  Notice of  Termination  for Good
        Reason to cure the conduct cited therein. A termination of employment by
        the  Executive  for Good Reason  shall be  effective on the final day of
        such 30-day cure period  unless prior to such time the Company has cured
        the specific conduct asserted by the Executive to constitute Good Reason
        to the reasonable satisfaction of the Executive.

                (iii)  A  termination  of  the  Executive's  employment  by  the
        Executive without Good Reason,  including Retirement,  shall be effected
        by giving the Company at least 30 days' written  notice  specifying  the
        effective date of termination.

                  (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of Termination"  means the
date of the  Executive's  death,  the Disability  Effective Date, or the date on
which the termination of the Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or
without  Cause or by the  Executive  for Good  Reason or  without  Good  Reason,
including Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.

                  5.       Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
                           -------------------------------------------

                  (a)  Good  Reason;  Other  Than  for  Cause.  If,  during  the
Employment Period, the Company shall terminate the Executive's  employment other

employment for Good Reason:

                (i) the  Company  shall  pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in
        cash, within 15 days after the Date of Termination, the aggregate of the
        amounts set forth in clauses A and B below:

                A.      The sum of:

                                Date of Termination;

                        (2)     the  product of (x) the  "target"  annual  bonus
                                under Section 3(b) (the "Target  Bonus") and (y)
                                a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
                                of days in the current calendar year through the
                                Date  of  Termination,  and the  denominator  of
                                which is 365; and

                        (3)     any accrued vacation pay;

                  in each case to the  extent not  theretofore  paid (the sum of
                  the amounts  described  in clauses  (1),  (2) and (3) shall be
                  hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

                B.      the amount  equal to the  product of (1) two and (2) the
                        sum of (x) the  Executive's  Annual  Base Salary and (y)
                        the Target Bonus.


                (ii) the Option  Award  shall vest in  accordance  with  Section
        3(d)(i);

                (iii) any stock  awards,  stock  options,  other than the Option
        Award, stock appreciation  rights or other equity-based awards that were
        outstanding  immediately prior to the Date of Termination ("Prior Equity
        Awards")  shall vest and/or become  exercisable  in accordance  with the
        underlying plan for such Prior Equity Award;

                (iv) for two years after the Executive's  Date of Termination or
        such longer  period as may be  provided by the terms of the  appropriate
        plan,  program,  practice or policy, the Company shall continue benefits
        to the Executive  and/or the Executive's  family at least equal to those
        which would have been  provided to them in  accordance  with the welfare
        plans,  programs,  practices  and policies  described in Section 3(e) of
        this Agreement if the Executive's employment had not been terminated or,
        if more favorable to the Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time
        thereafter  with respect to other peer executives of the Company and its
        affiliated companies and their families,  provided however,  that if the
        Executive  becomes  reemployed with another  employer and is eligible to
        receive medical or dental benefits under another employer provided plan,
        the medical and dental benefits  described  herein shall be secondary to
        those  provided under such other plan during such  applicable  period of
        eligibility;

                (v) any compensation previously deferred (other than pursuant to
        a  tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the Executive  (together with
        any accrued interest or earnings  thereon),  whether or not then vested,
        shall  become  vested  on the Date of  Termination  and shall be paid in
        accordance with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under which it
        was deferred;

                (vi) the Company shall, at its sole expense as incurred, provide
        the Executive with  outplacement  services  suitable to the  Executive's
        position  for a  period  not to  exceed  two  years  with  a  nationally
        recognized outplacement firm; and,

                (vii)  to the  extent  not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the
        Company  shall pay or  provide  to the  Executive  any other  amounts or
        benefits  required  to be paid or  provided  or which the  Executive  is
        entitled to receive under any plan, program, policy, practice,  contract
        or agreement  of the Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than
        medical  or  dental  benefits  if the  Executive  is  eligible  for such
        benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer),  including earned but
        unpaid stock and similar  compensation  but excluding any severance plan
        or policy (such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter referred
        to as the "Other Benefits").

                  (b) Cause;  Other  than for Good  Reason.  If the  Executive's
employment shall be terminated for Cause during the Employment Period, or if the
Executive  voluntarily  terminates  employment  during  the  Employment  Period,
excluding a  resignation  for Good  Reason,  the  Company  shall have no further
payment  obligations  to the  Executive  other  than for  amounts  described  in
Sections  5(a)(i)(A)(1) and 5(a)(i)(A)(3) and the timely payment or provision of
Other Benefits. In such case, all such amounts shall be paid to the Executive in
a lump sum within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.  Any unvested  portion of
the Option Award shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 3(d)(i).

                  (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment terminates by reason
of the Executive's death during the Employment Period,  all Accrued  Obligations
as of the time of death shall be paid to the Executive's  estate or beneficiary,
as  applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination

equity-based  award  until  the  earlier  of (A)  one  year  from  the  Date  of
Termination  (or such longer  period as may be  provided  under the terms of any
such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (d) Disability. If the Executive's employment is terminated by
reason of Disability during the Employment Period, all Accrued Obligations shall
be paid to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash  within  30 days of the Date of

right to  exercise  any such stock  option,  stock  appreciation  right or other
exercisable  equity-based  award until the earlier of (A) one year from the Date

such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

                  (e) Retirement.  If the Executive's employment terminates as a
result of Retirement,  the Executive shall be paid the Accrued  Obligations in a
lump sum in cash  within 30 days of the Date of  Termination  and the  Executive

remaining  portion of the Option Award shall vest or be forfeited in  accordance
with Section 3(d)(i).

                  6.       Change in Control.
                           -----------------


                  (a) Benefits Upon a Change in Control.  The Executive's rights
upon a termination of employment that occurs following a Change in Control shall
be as specified in Section 5 generally for termination of employment, except (i)
the amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall be three  times the sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period; (iii) the Option Award shall have vested in accordance with Section
3(d)(i);  and (iv) the Executive  shall be paid within 15 days after the Date of
Termination, an amount equal to the excess of

                           (A) the actuarial equivalent of the benefit under the
                  Company's applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan
                  in which the Executive is participating  immediately  prior to
                  his Date of Termination (the "Retirement Plan") (utilizing the
                  rate  used  to   determine   lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent
                  applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions no less favorable to
                  the Executive than those in effect under the  Retirement  Plan
                  immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement), any SERPs in
                  which  the   Executive   participates   and,   to  the  extent
                  applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement
                  between  the  Executive  and  the  Company   ("Other   Pension
                  Benefits")   which  the   Executive   would   receive  if  the
                  Executive's  employment  continued for three  additional years
                  beyond the Date of Termination, assuming for this purpose that
                  all accrued benefits are fully vested,  and, assuming that the
                  Executive's compensation for such deemed additional period was
                  the  Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect  immediately
                  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
                  year during such deemed  additional period equal to the Target
                  Bonus, over

                           (B)  the  actuarial  equivalent  of  the  Executive's
                  actual benefit (paid or payable), if any, under the Retirement
                  Plan,  the SERPs and Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of
                  Termination  (utilizing  the rate used to determine  lump sums
                  and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial assumptions no
                  less favorable to the Executive than those in effect under the
                  Retirement  Plan  immediately   prior  to  the  date  of  this
                  Agreement).

                (b)  Definition.  For purposes of this  Agreement,  a "Change in
Control"  shall  mean  the  occurrence of any of the --  following  events after
the date of this Agreement:

                (i) any  "person"  (within the  meaning of Section  13(d) of the
        Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act") is or
        becomes the beneficial  owner within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
        Exchange  Act  (a  "Beneficial  Owner"),   directly  or  indirectly,  of
        securities of Enterprise  (not including in the securities  beneficially
        owned by such person any securities acquired directly from Enterprise or
        its affiliates) representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of
        Enterprise's  then  outstanding  securities,  excluding  any  person who
        becomes  such a  Beneficial  Owner  in  connection  with  a  transaction
        described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

                (ii)  the  following   individuals   cease  for  any  reason  to
        constitute  a majority of the number of  directors  of  Enterprise  then
        serving: individuals who, on the date of this Agreement,  constitute the
        Board  and  any  new  director  (other  than a  director  whose  initial
        assumption  of office  is in  connection  with an  actual or  threatened
        election contest,  including but not limited to a consent  solicitation,
        relating to the election of directors of Enterprise)  whose  appointment
        or  election by the Board or  nomination  for  election by  Enterprise's
        stockholders  was  approved  or  recommended  by  a  vote  of  at  least
        two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors  then still in office who either were
        directors  on  the  date  hereof  or  whose  appointment,   election  or
        nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

                (iii)  there  is  consummated  a  merger  or   consolidation  of
        Enterprise  or  any  direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned   subsidiary  of
        Enterprise  with any  other  corporation,  other  than  (A) a merger  or
        consolidation  which would result in the voting securities of Enterprise
        outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing
        to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into
        voting  securities of the surviving  entity or any parent  thereof),  in
        combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding
        securities   under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of  Enterprise  or  any
        subsidiary of Enterprise,  at least 75% of the combined  voting power of
        the  securities  of Enterprise  or such  surviving  entity or any parent
        thereof outstanding  immediately after such merger or consolidation,  or
        (B) a merger or consolidation  effected to implement a  recapitalization
        of Enterprise (or similar  transaction) in which no person is or becomes
        the  Beneficial  Owner,   directly  or  indirectly,   of  securities  of
        Enterprise  representing  25% or more of the  combined  voting  power of
        Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

                (iv) the  shareholders of Enterprise  approve a plan of complete
        liquidation  or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is  consummated  an
        agreement  for  the  sale  or   disposition  by  Enterprise  of  all  or
        substantially  all  of  Enterprise's   assets,  other  than  a  sale  or
        disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of  Enterprise's
        assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the  combined  voting power of the
        voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders  of Enterprise in
        substantially  the same  proportions  as their  ownership of  Enterprise
        immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have
occurred  by  virtue  of  the  consummation  of any  transaction  or  series  of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

                  7.       Confidential Information; No Competition.
                           ----------------------------------------

                  (a) The Executive  shall hold in a fiduciary  capacity for the
benefit of the Company all confidential information,  knowledge or data (defined
below)  relating to the Company or any of its  affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and
their  respective  businesses,  which shall have been  obtained by the Executive
during  the  Executive's  employment  by the  Company  or any of its  affiliated
companies and which shall not be or become public  knowledge (other than by acts
by the  Executive  or  representatives  of the  Executive  in  violation of this
Agreement).  Upon Termination of the Executive's employment,  he shall return to
the  Company all  Company  information.  After  termination  of the  Executive's
employment with the Company,  the Executive shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal  process,
communicate or divulge any such  information,  knowledge or data to anyone other
than the Company  and those  designated  by it,  except (x)  otherwise  publicly
available  information,  or (y) as may be  necessary to enforce his rights under
this Agreement or necessary to defend himself against a claim asserted  directly
or indirectly by the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination
has been made in  accordance  with  Section  7(d) or  Section 9 hereof  that the
Executive has violated this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the  provisions
of this Section 7 shall not constitute a basis for deferring or withholding  any
amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

                  (b)  As  used  herein,  the  term  "confidential  information,
knowledge  or data"  means  all  trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential
business information  belonging to, used by, or in the possession of the Company
or any of  its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to
information,  knowledge  or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and
financial information, mergers, acquisitions or consolidations, purchase or sale
of  property,  leasing,  pricing,  sales  programs  or  tactics,  actual or past
sellers, purchasers,  lessees, lessors or customers, those with whom the Company
or its  affiliates and  subsidiaries  has begun  negotiations  for new business,
costs, employee  compensation,  marketing and development plans,  inventions and
technology,  whether such confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,
written or electronically  recorded or stored,  except information in the public
domain, information known by the Executive prior to employment with the Company,
and information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or
its affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

                  (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and  data,  as
defined in the previous paragraph,  gained in the performance of the Executive's
duties  hereunder  may be  valuable  to  those  who are now,  or  might  become,
competitors of the Company or its affiliates and subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the
Executive agrees that,  without the written consent of Enterprise,  he will not,
for the  period  of one year  from  Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the
Employment Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage, operate, join,
control,  become  employed  by,  consult  to or  participate  in the  ownership,
management,  or control of any business which is in direct  competition with the
Company and/or its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive agrees
that, for two years following the Date of Termination,  he will not, directly or
indirectly,  solicit or hire,  or encourage  the  solicitation  or hiring of any
person who was a managerial or higher level  employee of the Company at any time
during the term of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer
other than the Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,
consultant or  otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement of the Executive  shall not
apply to any person after 6 months have elapsed  subsequent to the date on which
such person's employment by the Company has terminated.  In the case of any such
prohibited  activity,  the  Executive  shall not be entitled to  post-employment
payments (including any unexercised options under the Option Award).

                  (d) In the  event of a breach by the  Executive  of any of the
agreements set forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above, it is agreed that the
Company  shall  suffer  irreparable  harm for  which  money  damages  are not an
adequate  remedy,  and that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company shall be
entitled to obtain an order of a court of competent  jurisdiction  for equitable
relief from such breach,  including,  but not limited to, temporary  restraining
orders and preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such
agreements by the Executive.  In the event that the Company should  initiate any
legal action for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in
this  Section 7 and the  Company  does not prevail in such  action,  the Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  the  Executive  the full amount of any court  costs,
filing  fees,  attorney's  fees which the  Executive  incurs in  defending  such
action, and any loss of income during the period of such litigation.

                  8.       Full Settlement.
                           ---------------

                  (a) No Duty to Mitigate;  No Reduction.  Except as provided in
Section  7(c),  and except to the extent that a Court under  Section  7(d) or an
arbitrator  appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine  to permit an offset in
respect of a violation by the Executive of his obligations  under Section 7, the
Company's  obligation  to make the payments  provided for in this  Agreement and
otherwise  to perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

                  (b)  Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section
7(c), nothing in the Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive's continuing
or future participation in any plan, program, policy or practice provided by the
Company or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.
Vested  benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to
receive under the incentive  compensation plans referred to in Section 3(c), the
SERPs, or any other plan,  policy,  practice of program of the Company or any of
its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.


                  9.       Disputes

                  Except  with  respect  to  equitable  relief  provided  for in
Section 7(d), any dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged
violation  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  resolved  by   confidential   binding
arbitration before one arbitrator to be held in Newark, New Jersey in accordance
with  the  Employment  Dispute  Resolution  Rules  of the  American  Arbitration
Association  and the United  States  Arbitration  Act.  Judgment  upon the award
rendered  by the  arbitrator  may be  entered in any court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.  All costs and expenses  incurred by the Company or the  Executive or
the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in  connection  with  any such  controversy  or
dispute, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees, shall be borne
by the Company as incurred,  except that the Executive  shall be responsible for
any such costs and expenses  incurred in connection with any claim determined by
the arbitrator to have been without  reasonable basis or to have been brought in
bad faith. The Executive shall be entitled to interest at the applicable Federal
rate  provided for in Section  7872 (f) (2)(A) of the  Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended (the  "Code"),  on any delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator
determine he was entitled to under this Agreement.

                  10.      Successors.
                           ----------

                (a) No Assignment by  Executive.  This  Agreement is personal to
the Executive and without the prior written consent of Enterprise  shall
not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of
descent and  distribution.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by the Executive's legal representatives.

                (b) Successors to Enterprise.  This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit  of and be  binding  upon  Enterprise  and  its  successors  and
assigns.

                (c)  Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise  will
require  any  successor  (whether  direct  or  indirect,  by  purchase,  merger,
consolidation  or  otherwise) to  all  or  substantially   all  o f the business
and/or   assets of  Enterprise  to  assume  expressly  and  agree  to  perform
this  Agreement  in  the  same  manner  and  to  the same extent that Enterprise
would be   required to  perform  it  if  no  such  succession  had  taken place.
As    used  in   this  Agreement,  "Enterprise"  shall   mean   Enterprise   as
hereinbefore  defined  and  any  successor  to  its  business  and/or assets  as
aforesaid   which   assumes   and   agrees   to   perform   this   Agreement  by
operation of law, or otherwise.

                  11.      Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
                           ------------------------------------------

                  (a)    Anything   in   this    Agreement   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  in the  event it  shall be  determined  that  any  payment  or
distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Executive (whether paid
or  payable  or  distributed  or  distributable  pursuant  to the  terms of this
Agreement or otherwise, but determined without regard to any additional payments
required under this Section 11) (a "Payment") would be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by
the  Executive  with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax,  together with
any such interest and penalties, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"Excise  Tax"),  then the  Executive  shall be entitled to receive an additional
payment (a  "Gross-Up  Payment")  in an amount  such that  after  payment by the
Executive of all taxes (including any interest or penalties imposed with respect
to such taxes), including,  without limitation,  any income and employment taxes
(and any interest  and  penalties  imposed with respect  thereto) and Excise Tax
imposed  upon the  Gross-Up  Payment,  the  Executive  retains  an amount of the
Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

                  (b)  Subject  to  the   provisions  of  Section   11(c),   all
determinations  required to be made under this Section 11, including whether and
when a Gross-Up  Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and
the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination,  shall be made
by the Company's  independent auditors or such other certified public accounting
firm  as may be  jointly  designated  by the  Executive  and  the  Company  (the
"Accounting Firm"), which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to
the Company and the  Executive.  All fees and  expenses of the  Accounting  Firm
shall be borne  solely by the  Company.  Any  Gross-Up  Payment,  as  determined
pursuant  to this  Section  11,  shall be paid by the  Company to the  Executive
within  15 days of the  receipt  of the  Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any
determination  by the Accounting  Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the
Executive.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of
the  Code at the  time  of the  initial  determination  by the  Accounting  Firm
hereunder,  it is possible that Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made
by the  Company  should  have been made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the
calculations  required  to be made  hereunder.  In the  event  that the  Company
exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is
required  to make a  payment  of any  Excise  Tax,  the  Accounting  Firm  shall
determine  the  amount  of the  Underpayment  that  has  occurred  and any  such
Underpayment  shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the
Executive.

                  (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal  Revenue  Service that, if  successful,  would require the
payment by the Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given
as soon as  practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive
is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise the Company of the nature
of such  claim and the date on which  such claim is  requested  to be paid.  The
Executive  shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period
following the date on which he gives such notice to the Company (or such shorter
period  ending on the date that any payment of taxes with  respect to such claim
is  due).  If the  Company  notifies  the  Executive  in  writing  prior  to the
expiration  of such period that it desires to contest such claim,  the Executive
shall:

                (i) give the Company any information reasonably requested by the
        Company relating to such claim,

                (ii) take such action in connection  with  contesting such claim
        as the Company  shall  reasonably  request in writing from time to time,
        including,  without  limitation,  accepting  legal  representation  with
        respect to such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                (iii)  cooperate  with  the  Company  in  good  faith  in  order
        effectively to contest such claim, and

                (iv)  permit  the  Company  to  participate  in any  proceedings
        relating to such claim;

provided  however,  that the Company  shall bear and pay  directly all costs and
expenses  (including  additional  interest and penalties) incurred in connection
with such contest and shall  indemnify  and hold the Executive  harmless,  on an
after-tax  basis,  for any  Excise  Tax or income tax  (including  interest  and
penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such  representation  and
payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of
this  Section  11(c),  the  Company  shall  control  all  proceedings  taken  in
connection  with such contest  and, at its sole option,  may pursue or forgo any
and all administrative appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and conferences with the
taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole  option,  either
direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the
claim in any  permissible  manner,  and the Executive  agrees to prosecute  such
contest to a determination  before any  administrative  tribunal,  in a court of
initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the Company shall
determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company directs the Executive to pay
such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company  shall  advance the amount of such
payment to the Executive, on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax
(including  interest or penalties with respect  thereto) imposed with respect to
such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance;
and further  provided that any extension of the statute of limitations  relating
to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive  with respect to which
such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested
amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's  control of the contest shall be limited to
issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment would be payable  hereunder and
the  Executive  shall be entitled to settle or contest,  as the case may be, any
other  issue  raised  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  or any  other  taxing
authority.

                  (d) If,  after  the  receipt  by the  Executive  of an  amount
advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to Section  11(c),  the  Executive  becomes
entitled to receive any refund with respect to such claim,  the Executive  shall
(subject to the Company's  complying  with the  requirements  of Section  11(c))
promptly  pay to the  Company  the  amount  of such  refund  (together  with any
interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto). If, after the
receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced  by the  Company  pursuant  to
Section 11(c), a determination  is made that the Executive shall not be entitled
to any refund  with  respect to such claim and the  Company  does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the
expiration  of 30 days  after such  determination,  then such  advance  shall be
forgiven  and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such  advance
shall offset, to the extent thereof,  the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to
be paid.

                  12.      Miscellaneous.
                           -------------

written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective  successors
and legal representatives.

when actually received by the addressee.

                  (c)  Invalidity.  The  invalidity or  unenforceability  of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of
any other provision of this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement shall
be held  invalid  or  unenforceable  in  part,  the  remaining  portion  of such
provision,  together with all other  provisions of this Agreement,  shall remain
valid and  enforceable  and  continue  in full force and  effect to the  fullest
extent  consistent  with law.  Further,  to the extent that a provision is to be

Agreement such Federal, state, local or foreign taxes as shall be required to be
withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.


                  (e) Failure to Assert Rights. The Executive's or the Company's
failure to insist upon strict  compliance  with any  provisions of, or to assert
any  right  under,  this  Agreement  shall  not be deemed to be a waiver of such
provision or right or of any other provision of or right under this Agreement.

                  (f) No  Alienation.  The rights and benefits of the  Executive
under this Agreement may not be anticipated,  assigned,  alienated or subject to
attachment,  garnishment,  levy,  execution or other legal or equitable  process
except as required by law. Any attempt by the Executive to anticipate, alienate,
assign,  sell,  transfer,  pledge,  encumber  or charge  the same shall be void.
Payments  hereunder shall not be considered assets of the Executive in the event
of insolvency or bankruptcy.

                  (g) Entire Agreement. This Employment Agreement represents the
complete  agreement between the Executive and the Company relating to employment
and  termination  and may not be altered or changed except by written  agreement
executed  by  the  parties  hereto  or  their  respective  successors  or  legal
representatives.  This  Agreement  supersedes  the PSE&G  Employment  Agreement,
except Section 7 thereof,  which is hereby  incorporated  by reference into this
Agreement.

                  IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  Executive  and,  pursuant  to  due
authorization  from  its  Board of  Directors,  the  Company  have  caused  this
Agreement to be executed as of the day and year first above written.
