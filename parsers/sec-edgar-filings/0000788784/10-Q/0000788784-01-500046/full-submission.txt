================================================================================
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

     Public Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated  (PSEG) is an exempt public
utility   holding   company  which  has  four  principal   direct   wholly-owned
subsidiaries:  Public Service Electric and Gas Company  (PSE&G),  PSEG Power LLC
(Power),   PSEG  Energy  Holdings  Inc.  (Energy  Holdings)  and  PSEG  Services
Corporation (Services).

Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with the
Notes  contained in PSEG's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly  Report
on Form 10-Q for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  2001.  These  Notes  update and
supplement  matters  discussed  in PSEG's  2000  Annual  Report on Form 10-K and
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2001.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented.  The year-end  consolidated balance sheet was
derived from the audited  consolidated  financial  statements included in PSEG's
2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications of prior period data
have been made to conform with the current presentation.

Note 2.  Accounting Matters

     In July 2000,  the  Emerging  Issues Task Force  (EITF)  99-19,  "Reporting
Revenue  Gross as a Principal  versus Net as an Agent"  (EITF  99-19),  provided
guidance on the issue of whether a company  should  report  revenue based on the
gross  amount  billed to the customer or the net amount  retained.  The guidance
states that this determination  requires significant judgment,  which depends on
the relevant  facts and  circumstances.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2001,
based on PSEG's analysis and interpretation of EITF 99-19, PSEG reported all the
revenues  and energy costs on a gross basis for the  physical  bilateral  energy
sales and purchases and capacity sales and  purchases.  PSEG continues to report
swaps,  futures,  option  premiums,   firm  transmission  rights,   transmission
congestion credits,  and purchases and sales of emission credits on a net basis.
The prior year financial statements have been reclassified accordingly.

     On  January  1,  2001,  PSEG  adopted  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as amended (SFAS 133), and recorded a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting  principle and other comprehensive  income of $9 million and ($14)
million,  respectively. As of June 30, 2001, the fair value of PSEG's derivative
assets and liabilities were $32 million and $76 million, respectively, resulting
in a net $44 million liability,  a negative impact to Other Comprehensive Income
(OCI) of $39 million,  deferred taxes of $21 million and a minimal impact on the
income statement.
<PAGE>
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Derivative Implementation
Group (DIG),  has issued  guidance  effective  July 1, 2001,  regarding  certain
derivative  contracts  and the  eligibility  of those  contracts  for the normal
purchases  and  sales  exceptions.  PSEG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  currently
evaluating  this  guidance  and cannot  predict  the  impact on their  financial
position or results of operations, however such impact could be material.

     In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141).
SFAS 141 was effective July 1, 2001 and requires that all business  combinations
subsequent to that date be accounted for under the purchase method. PSEG and its
subsidiaries  are currently  evaluating this guidance and do not believe it will
have a substantial effect on their growth strategy. PSEG and its subsidiaries do
not anticipate that there will be a material impact on their financial  position
or results of operations.

     Also in July  2001,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No.  142,  "Goodwill  and Other
Intangible  Assets"  (SFAS  142).  Under  SFAS 142,  goodwill  is  considered  a
nonamortizable  asset and will be subject to an annual review for impairment and
an  interim  review  when  required  by events or  circumstances.  SFAS 142 also
defines  intangible  assets,  other than goodwill,  that may arise in a purchase
combination. SFAS 142 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2001. PSEG and its subsidiaries  are currently  evaluating this guidance and
cannot  predict the impact on its financial  position or results of  operations;
however, such impact could be material.

     Also in July 2001,  the FASB  issued SFAS No.  143,  "Accounting  for Asset
Retirement  Obligations"  (SFAS  143).  Under  SFAS  143,  the  fair  value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation should be recorded in the period in
which it is incurred. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity either settles
the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement.
SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15, 2002. PSEG and
its subsidiaries  are currently  evaluating this guidance and cannot predict the
impact on its financial position or results of operations;  however, such impact
could be material.

Note 3.  Regulatory Issues

New Jersey Energy Master Plan Proceedings and Related Orders

     In August 1999, following the enactment of the New Jersey Electric Discount
and Energy  Competition  Act,  the New Jersey  Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)
rendered a Final Order relating to PSE&G's rate  unbundling,  stranded costs and
restructuring  proceedings (Final Order) providing,  among other things, for the
transfer to Power of all of PSE&G's electric  generation  facilities,  plant and
equipment  for  $2.443  billion  and  all  other  related  property,   including
materials,  supplies  and  fuel at the net book  value  thereof,  together  with
associated rights and liabilities.

     Also in the Final Order,  the BPU concluded that PSE&G should recover up to
$2.94  billion (net of tax) of its  generation-related  stranded  costs  through
securitization  of $2.4 billion and an opportunity to recover up to $540 million
(net of tax) of its  unsecuritized  generation-related  stranded  costs on a net
present  value basis.  The $540 million is subject to recovery  through a market
transition  charge (MTC).  PSE&G remits the MTC revenues to Power as part of the
Basic Generation Service (BGS) Contract as provided for by the Final Order.

     In September  1999,  the BPU issued its order  approving  PSE&G's  petition
relating  to the  proposed  securitization  transaction  (Finance  Order)  which
authorized,  among other things,  the imposition of a non-bypassable  transition
bond charge (TBC) on PSE&G's  customers;  the sale of PSE&G's  property right in
such charge to a  bankruptcy-remote  financing entity;  the issuance and sale of
$2.525  billion of  transition  bonds by such entity as  consideration  for such
property right,  including an estimated $125 million of transaction  costs;  and
the application by PSE&G of the transition  bond proceeds to retire  outstanding
debt and/or equity. PSE&G Transition Funding LLC (Transition Funding) issued the
transition  bonds on January 31,  2001;  and the TBC and an  additional  2% rate
reduction  became  effective  on February 7, 2001 in  accordance  with the Final
Order. The rate decrease and the TBC were funded through the MTC rate.

     In October and November  1999,  appeals  were filed by New Jersey  Business
User's Coalition,  the New Jersey Ratepayer  Advocate (RPA) and Co-Steel Raritan
(Co-Steel),  an individual  PSE&G  customer,  (the  appellants)  challenging the
validity of the Finance  Order as well as the Final  Order.  In April 2000,  the
Appellate  Division of the New Jersey  Superior Court  unanimously  rejected the
arguments made by the appellants and affirmed the Final Order and Finance Order.
In May 2000,  the  appellants  requested the New Jersey  Supreme Court to review
certain aspects of the Appellate Division decision. In July 2000, the New Jersey
Supreme Court granted the requests.  In December  2000, by a vote of 4 to 1, the
New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  issued  its order  affirming  the  judgment  of the
Appellate Division. The New Jersey Supreme Court's written opinion was issued on
May 18, 2001.

     On  March  6,  2001,  Co-Steel  filed a  Petition  of  Writ  of  Certiorari
(Petition)  with the United States  Supreme Court seeking  limited review of the
New  Jersey  Supreme  Court   decision,   the  granting  of  which  is  entirely
discretionary  with the Court.  Briefs in  opposition  to the Petition have been
filed. The outcome of this action cannot be predicted.

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed securities)  were issued by  Transition  Funding,  in eight  classes with
maturities  ranging  from 1 year to 15 years.  Also on January 31,  2001,  PSE&G
received  payment  from  Power on its  $2.786  billion  promissory  note used to
finance the transfer of PSE&G's  generation  business.  The proceeds  from these
transactions  were used to pay for certain debt  issuance and related  costs for
securitization,  retire a portion of PSE&G's outstanding short-term debt, reduce
PSE&G common equity, loan funds to PSEG and make various short-term investments.

Note 5.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Pending Asset Purchases

     Atlantic  City  Electric  Company  (ACE),  a subsidiary  of Conectiv,  is a
co-owner of the Salem Nuclear  Generating  Station  (Salem) and the Peach Bottom
Atomic  Power  Station  (Peach  Bottom)  with  Power and Exelon  Generation  LLC
(Exelon). Additionally, Power and ACE are co-owners of the Hope Creek Generating
Station (Hope Creek).  In 1999,  Power entered into  agreements  with  Conectiv,
Delmarva  Power and Light  Company  (DP&L),  a subsidiary  of Conectiv,  ACE and
Exelon  pursuant to which Power would acquire all of DP&L's and ACE's  interests
in Salem and Hope Creek and half of DP&L's and ACE's interest in Peach Bottom (a
total of 544 MW) for a purchase  price of $15.4  million plus the net book value
of nuclear fuel at the  respective  closing  dates.  In December  2000, the DP&L
portion of the transaction (246 MW) closed.  In October 2000, Power entered into
Wholesale Transaction  Confirmation letter agreements with ACE under which Power
obtains 298 MW of  generation  capacity and output  representing  the portion of
ACE's interest in Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom to be acquired. Under these
agreements,  Power  receives all revenue and pays all expenses  associated  with
this 298 MW of generating capacity and output through the date that the purchase
transaction  closes.  Power has been advised by Conectiv that the RPA, by letter
to the BPU dated  October 26, 2000,  has objected to and  challenged  the letter
agreements.

     In March 2001,  Global reached  agreement to purchase a 94% equity stake in
Sociedad Austral de Electricidad  S.A. (SAESA) and all of its subsidiaries  from
Compania  de  Petroleos  de Chile S.A.  (COPEC).  Additionally,  Global  reached
agreement to purchase from COPEC  approximately  14% of Empresa  Electrica de la
Frontera S.A.  (Frontel) not owned by SAESA.  Global's  purchase  price for this
acquisition will total  approximately  $460 million and is scheduled to close in
the third quarter of 2001.

     In March 2001, Global,  through its affiliate Dhofar Power Company S.A.O.C.
(DPCO), signed a 20-year concession with the government of Oman to privatize the
electric  system of Salalah.  Total  project cost is estimated at $277  million.
Global's  equity  investment,   including  contingencies,   is  expected  to  be
approximately $82 million.

     In May 2001,  GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy),  a 50/50 joint  venture  between
Global and Harbinger GWF LLC,  entered into a 10-year power  purchase  agreement
(PPA) with the  California  Department  of Water  Resources to provide 340 MW of
electric  capacity to California from three new peaker plants  (totaling 340 MW)
that GWF Energy  expects to build and  operate in  California.  Global's  equity
investment in these plants, including  contingencies,  is not expected to exceed
$100 million.

     In July  2001,  Global won the bid to  purchase  up to a 100%  interest  in
Empresa  de  Electricidad  de  los  Andes  S.A.  (Electroandes)  with  a bid  of
approximately $227 million. The closing for this acquisition is scheduled in the
fourth quarter of 2001.

Hazardous Waste

     The New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of environmental investigations
and  remediations,  where  necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface
water bodies.  Power,  PSE&G and  predecessor  companies  owned and/or  operated
certain  facilities  situated  on  surface  water  bodies,  certain of which are
currently  the subject of remedial  activities.  The  financial  impact of these
regulations  on  these  projects  is not  currently  estimable.  PSEG  does  not
anticipate  that the  compliance  with  these  regulations  will have a material
adverse  effect on its  financial  position,  results of  operations or net cash
flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     PSE&G is  currently  working  with the NJDEP  under a program  (Remediation
Program) to assess,  investigate  and,  if  necessary,  remediate  environmental
conditions at PSE&G's  former  manufactured  gas plant sites.  To date, 38 sites
have been  identified.  The  Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and
revised  by  PSE&G  based  on  regulatory  requirements,   experience  with  the
Remediation Program and available remediation technologies.  The long-term costs
of the  Remediation  Program cannot be reasonably  estimated,  but experience to
date indicates that  approximately $20 million per year could be incurred over a
period of about 30 years and that the overall cost could be material.  The costs
for this remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

     Net of recoveries, costs incurred through June 30, 2001 for the Remediation
Program  amounted to $151.6  million.  In addition,  at June 30,  2001,  PSE&G's
estimated  liability for remediation  costs through 2003 aggregated $74 million.
Expenditures beyond 2003 cannot be reasonably estimated.

Passaic River Site

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that
a six mile  stretch of the Passaic  River in Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"
within the  meaning of that term under the Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and that, to date, at
least thirteen  corporations,  including  PSE&G,  may be potentially  liable for
performing   required  remedial  actions  to  address  potential   environmental
pollution at the Passaic River "facility." PSE&G and certain of its predecessors
operated   industrial   facilities  at  properties   within  the  Passaic  River
"facility,"  comprised  of  four  former  manufactured  gas  plants  (MGP),  one
operating electric generating station and one former generating  station.  Costs
to clean up former MGPs are  recoverable  from utility  customers under the SBC.
The operating  electric  generating station has been transferred to Power, which
is responsible for remediation of the station, if required.  PSEG cannot predict
what action,  if any,  the EPA or any third party may take against  PSE&G and/or
Power with respect to these matters,  or in such event,  what costs PSE&G and/or
Power may incur to address any such claims. However, such costs may be material.

New Source Review

     The EPA and NJDEP issued a demand to PSE&G in March 2000 under  section 114
of the  Federal  Clean Air Act (CAA)  requiring  information  to assess  whether
projects  completed  since 1978 at the Hudson and Mercer coal burning units were
implemented in accordance  with applicable New Source Review  regulations.  As a
result  of the  transfer  of the  generating  business  by PSE&G to  Power,  the
responsibility for these environmental  requirements now rests with Power. Power
completed its response to the section 114 information  request in November 2000.
Based upon the  information  provided to the EPA, it is likely that the EPA will
seek to enforce the  requirements  of the New Source Review  program at Hudson 2
and Mercer 1 and 2. Power is currently in discussions  with the EPA and NJDEP to
resolve the matter.  However,  it is uncertain whether these discussions will be
successful and capital costs of compliance could be material.

     The EPA indicated that it is considering  enforcement  action against Power
under its  Prevention of Significant  Deterioration  (PSD) rules relating to the
construction  that  is  currently  in  progress  for  Bergen  2,  scheduled  for
operations in 2002. The EPA had maintained that PSD  requirements are applicable
to  Bergen  2,  thereby  requiring  Power  to  obtain  a  permit  prior  to  the
commencement  of  construction.  To obtain  such a  permit,  an  applicant  must
demonstrate  that the  additional  emission  source  will not cause  significant
deterioration of the air shed in the vicinity of the plant. The time required to
obtain such a permit is estimated at 6-12 months. Power vigorously disputes that
PSD requirements are applicable to Bergen 2 and is continuing construction.  The
NJDEP has  informally  indicated it agrees with Power's  position,  but has also
advised that the ultimate  authority to decide PSD applicability  rests with the
EPA.  Discussions to resolve this matter are underway with the EPA and NJDEP. At
June 30, 2001, Power had expended approximately $179 million in the construction
of Bergen 2.

Guaranteed Obligations

     Energy Holdings,  PSEG Global Inc. (Global),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
Energy  Holdings,  and/or PSEG have guaranteed  certain  obligations of Global's
affiliates,   including  the   successful   completion,   performance  or  other
obligations  related  to  certain  of the  projects  in an  aggregate  amount of
approximately  $286 million as of June 30, 2001. A  substantial  portion of such
guarantees  is  eliminated  upon  successful   completion,   performance  and/or
refinancing of construction debt with non-recourse project debt.

Note 6.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     PSEG's  operations  give rise to exposure to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and securities
prices. PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments for the purpose
of managing market risk consistent with its business plans and prudent  business
practices.

Energy Trading and Related Contracts

     Power   routinely   enters  into  exchange   traded   futures  and  options
transactions  for  electricity  and  natural  gas as part of  wholesale  trading
operations.  Generally,  exchange-traded  futures  contracts  require deposit of
margin cash,  the amount of which is subject to change based on market  movement
and in accordance with exchange rules. The amount of the margin deposits at June
30,  2001 and  December  31, 2000 was  approximately  $4 million and $1 million,
respectively.

     Power's energy trading and related contracts have been marked-to-market and
gains and losses from such contracts  were included in earnings.  Power recorded
$5 million  and $6 million of  unrealized  gains in the  quarter  and six months
ended June 30, 2001,  respectively and $36 million and $48 million of unrealized
gains in the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2000, respectively.

     The  fair  value of the  energy  trading  and  related  contracts  that are
marked-to-market are based on management's best estimates using over-the-counter
quotations, exchange prices, volatility factors and other valuation methodology.
The estimates  presented  herein are not  necessarily  indicative of the amounts
that Power could  realize in a current  market  exchange.  The fair values as of
June 30, 2001 and  December 31, 2000 and the average fair values for the periods
then  ended of  Power's  significant  financial  instruments  related  to energy
commodities are summarized in the following table:

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     Power and PSE&G also hold and issue  commodity  and  financial  instruments
that  reduce  exposure  to price  fluctuations  from  factors  such as  weather,
environmental policies,  changes in demand, changes in supply, state and Federal
regulatory policies and other events.  Power's instruments,  in conjunction with
owned electric generating  capacity  contracts,  are designed to cover estimated
electric  supply  commitments  and gas  requirements  for  electric  generation.
PSE&G's  instruments,  in conjunction  with physical gas supply  contracts,  are
designed  to cover  estimated  gas  customer  commitments.  Power  and PSE&G use
futures,  forwards,  swaps and options to manage and hedge price risk related to
these market exposures.

     As of June 30,  2001,  Power had  entered  into 18 million  mWh of electric
physical  forward  contracts  and 30 million  MMBTU of gas  futures and swaps to
hedge  its  forecasted  BGS  requirements  and gas  purchases  requirements  for
generation,  with a maximum term of approximately  one year, which qualified for
hedge  accounting  treatment  under  SFAS 133.  These  commodity  and  financial
instruments  are  marked-to-market  based on  management's  best estimates using
over-the-counter  quotations,  exchange  prices,  volatility  factors  and other
valuation  methodology.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2001, the total negative
mark-to-market  valuation of $34 million was recorded as a derivative  liability
offset by  negative  OCI and  deferred  taxes of $21  million  and $13  million,
respectively.

     Also as of June 30, 2001,  PSE&G had entered into 236 million  MMBTU of gas
futures and  options  and 58 MMBTU of gas futures and swaps to hedge  forecasted
requirements.  As of June 30,  2001,  the fair  value of those  instruments  was
$(144)  million with a maximum term of  approximately  one year.  PSE&G utilizes
derivatives  to hedge its gas  purchasing  activities  which, when realized, are
recoverable through its Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause (LGAC). Accordingly, the
offset to the  change  in fair  value of these  derivatives  is  specified  as a
regulatory asset or liability.

     Interest Rate Swaps

     In February 2001, Power entered into various  forward-interest  rate swaps,
with an aggregate  notional  amount of $400 million,  to hedge the interest rate
risk  related to the  anticipated  issuance of debt.  On April 11,  2001,  Power
issued  $1.8  billion in  fixed-rate  Senior  Notes and  closed out the  forward
starting  interest rate swaps.  The aggregate  loss, net of tax, of $3.2 million
was classified as Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Loss and is being amortized
and charged to interest expense over the life of the debt.

     Transition Funding has entered into an interest rate swap on its sole class
of floating rate transition bonds. The notional amount of the interest rate swap
is $496.6 million.  The interest rate swap is indexed to the  three-month  LIBOR
rate. The fair value of the interest rate swap was approximately $0.7 million as
of June 30, 2001 and was recorded as a derivative liability,  with an offsetting
amount recorded as a regulatory asset on the Consolidated  Balance Sheets.  This
amount will vary over time as a result of changes in market conditions.

Equity Securities -- Energy Holdings

     PSEG  Resources  Inc.  (Resources),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Energy
Holdings,  has  investments  in  equity  securities  and  limited  partnerships.
Resources carries its investments in equity securities at their approximate fair
value  as of the  reporting  date.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value of these
investments  is  affected  by  changes  in the  fair  value  of  the  underlying
securities.  Fair value is  determined  by  adjusting  the  market  value of the
securities for liquidity and market volatility factors,  where appropriate.  The
aggregate fair values of such  investments  which had available market prices at
June  30,  2001  and  December  31,  2000  were $65  million  and $115  million,
respectively.  The  decrease  in fair  value  was  primarily  due to the sale of
Resources'  interest in an equity security which had a book value of $30 million
on December 31, 2000 and lower  valuation of publicly  traded equity  securities
within its leveraged  buyout funds. The potential change in fair value resulting
from a  hypothetical  10% change in quoted  market  prices of these  investments
amounted to $5 million and $9 million at June 30, 2001 and  December  31,  2000,
respectively.

Foreign Currencies -- Energy Holdings

     As of June 30,  2001,  Global and  Resources  had  international  assets of
approximately $2.349 billion and $1.328 billion, respectively.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets  located in the  Netherlands,  Australia,  the United  Kingdom,  Austria,
Germany,  China and New Zealand with  associated  revenues  denominated  in U.S.
dollars ($US) and therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

     Global's international investments are primarily in companies that generate
or distribute  electricity in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  India, Italy,
Oman,  Peru,  Poland,  Tunisia and  Venezuela.  Investing  in foreign  countries
involves certain  additional  risks.  Economic  conditions that result in higher
comparative  rates of  inflation  in foreign  countries  are likely to result in
declining values in such countries' currencies.  As currencies fluctuate against
the $US, there is a corresponding  change in Global's  investment value in terms
of the  $US.  Such  change  is  reflected  as an  increase  or  decrease  in the
investment value and OCI. As of June 30, 2001, net foreign currency devaluations
have reduced the reported  amount of PSEG's total  stockholder's  equity by $241
million  (after-tax),  $168  million  (after-tax)  of which  was  caused  by the
devaluation of the Brazilian Real.

Credit Risk

     Credit  risk  relates  to the risk of loss that  PSEG and its  subsidiaries
would incur as a result of non-performance  by  counterparties,  pursuant to the
terms of their  contractual  obligations.  PSEG has established  credit policies
that it believes  significantly  minimize  its  exposure to credit  risk.  These
policies include an evaluation of potential  counterparties' financial condition
(including credit rating),  collateral  requirements under certain circumstances
and the use of  standardized  agreements,  which may allow  for the  netting  of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

     Two major California  utilities,  including  Pacific Gas & Electric Company
(PG&E),  have  significantly  underrecovered  from customers the costs they have
paid for power. As a consequence, these utilities have defaulted under a variety
of  contractual  obligations.  On April 6, 2001,  PG&E filed for  reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

     GWF Energy LLC (GWF), Hanford and Tracy Qualifying  Facilities (QF), each a
project  affiliate  of  Global,   have  continued  to  honor  their  contractual
obligations  to PG&E  under  existing  QF  contracts.  On March  27,  2001,  the
California  Public Utility  Commission (CPUC) approved a plan to assure that the
state's  QFs are paid for  future  deliveries  of  energy  within 15 days of the
receipt of an invoice.  The CPUC's plan, while  immediately  effective,  did not
address amounts due such  facilities for past due receivables  related to energy
delivered  since November 2000. In addition to the payment issue,  the CPUC also
approved  a 40%  increase  in  electric  retail  rates,  a portion  of which was
intended to help the state's  utilities recover  significantly  higher wholesale
energy  costs.  However,  PG&E did not consider the portion of the rate increase
available to recover its energy costs to be sufficient  and  accordingly,  filed
for  reorganization  under  Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code on April 6,
2001. On April 11, 2001,  management at Global's project  affiliates  received a
letter from PG&E  addressed to QF owners  stating that they  intended to pay the
QFs for power delivered commencing April 6, 2001 (post-petition  payable).  PG&E
has subsequently paid, on a timely basis, the appropriate  post-petition payable
amounts due to Global's project affiliates for all energy deliveries  subsequent
to filing of its bankruptcy petition.

     In July  2001,  the US  Bankruptcy  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of
California approved an agreement authorizing PG&E to assume GWF's, Hanford's and
Tracy's  modified QF contracts.  Under the terms of the agreement,  GWF, Hanford
and Tracy  continue  to  receive  their  contractual  capacity  payments  plus a
five-year  fixed  energy  price  component  of  approximately   5.37  cents  per
kilowatt-hour  for five  years,  with  the  energy  price  reverting  to  PG&E's
short-run  avoided cost at the end of the five-year  period.  This  agreement is
consistent with the recent CPUC Decision No.  01-06-015.  In addition,  all past
due  receivables  under the QF  contracts  are now  elevated  to  administrative
priority  status.  Administrative  claims receive priority over payments made to
the general unsecured creditors.

     As of December 31, 2000,  GWF,  Hanford and Tracy had combined  receivables
due from PG&E, for all plants  amounting to approximately  $40 million.  Of this
amount,  approximately $8 million had been reserved as an allowance for doubtful
accounts  resulting in a net receivable  balance of  approximately  $32 million.
Global's pro-rata share of this net receivable was approximately $15 million.

     As of June 30,  2001  GWF,  Hanford  and Tracy  had  combined  pre-petition
receivables  due from  PG&E,  for all  plants  amounting  to  approximately  $62
million.  Of this  amount,  approximately  $25 million  had been  reserved as an
allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  resulting  in a net  receivable  balance  of
approximately $37 million.  Global's pro-rata share of this gross receivable and
net  receivable  was  approximately  $30 million and $18 million,  respectively.
Management  of PSEG and Energy  Holdings  cannot  predict the timing or ultimate
outcome of future resolutions,  including potential payment adjustments based on
different energy price determinations,  which have been consistently asserted by
PG&E.

     Two affiliates of the California  utilities  referred to above have entered
into physical  forward and swap contracts  with PSEG Energy  Resources and Trade
(ER&T),   a  subsidiary  of  Power,   for  delivery  in  the  PJM  area.   These
counterparties have met their obligations to date and are still investment grade
entities.  ER&T has entered into a limited number of additional  contracts since
May 2001 with one of these counterparties but none with the other since December
2000.  ER&T's  exposure to these entities under these  contracts is not material
and management does not believe that any reserve is presently necessary.

Interest Rates

     PSEG is subject  to the risk of  fluctuating  interest  rates in the normal
course of business.  PSEG's  policy is to manage  interest rate risk through the
use of fixed rate debt,  floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.  As of June
30, 2001, a hypothetical  10% change in market  interest rates would result in a
$13 million  change in annual  interest costs related to short-term and floating
rate debt at PSEG and its subsidiaries.

</TABLE>

     PSEG's  effective  tax rate  differs  from the  statutory  income  tax rate
primarily due to the accruals at the rate of 10% of Global's  foreign income due
to the incremental cost associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.

     The Internal  Revenue  Service has concluded the audit of PSEG's  1994-1996
Federal  Income Tax Returns.  It is  anticipated  that the result of the Revenue
Agents'  Report will not have a material  impact on PSEG's  financial  position,
statement of operations or net cash flows.

</TABLE>

     Basic and diluted  earnings per share of PSEG common stock  (Common  Stock)
was $0.68 for the quarter  ended June 30, 2001,  representing  a $0.02  increase
from the comparable 2000 period.  Basic and diluted earnings per share of Common
Stock were $1.94 for the six months  ended June 30, 2001,  representing  a $0.03
increase from the comparable 2000 period.

     PSE&G's and Power's  combined  contribution to earnings per share of Common
Stock for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001,  decreased $0.04 or 6%
and $0.18 or 10% from the comparable  2000 periods,  respectively.  The decrease
for the  quarter  ended June 30,  2001 was  primarily  due to an  additional  2%
electric  rate  reduction  combined with the  amortization  of the stranded cost
regulatory  asset  beginning in February  2001.  These  decreases were partially
offset by higher  profits from trading  activities  and  increased  sales due to
colder weather.

     Energy Holdings' contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001 increased $0.08 and $0.22 or from the
comparable  2000  periods,  respectively,  primarily  due to  Global's  gain  on
withdrawal from its interest in the Eagle Point Cogeneration  Partnership (Eagle
Point) in the first  quarter 2001.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2001,  Energy
Holdings'  increase was primarily due to higher  leveraged lease income combined
with higher  comparative  income due to a  reduction  in the  carrying  value of
publicly  traded  securities  within  Resources'  leveraged  buyout funds in the
second quarter of 2000.

     As a result of PSEG's  stock  repurchase  program  which began in September
1998,  earnings  per share of Common  Stock for the quarter and six months ended
June 30,  2001  increased  $0.02 and $0.03  from the  comparable  2000  periods,
respectively.  A total of 24.2  million  shares  were  repurchased  at a cost of
approximately $905 million under this program as of June 30, 2001.

Operating Revenues

     Electric Transmission and Distribution

     Transmission  and  Distribution  revenues  increased  $4  million or 1% and
decreased  $6 million or 1% for the  quarter  and the six months  ended June 30,
2001 from the comparable periods in 2000, respectively.

     Generation

     Generation  Revenues increased $58 million or 11% and $89 million or 8% for
the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable  periods
in 2000,  respectively,  primarily  due to  increased  load served under the BGS
contract with PSE&G.  This increased  load results from  customers  returning to
PSE&G from third party suppliers (TPS) as wholesale market prices have typically
exceeded fixed BGS rates.  As of June 30, 2001,  TPS were serving  approximately
1.5% of the customer load traditionally  served by PSE&G as compared to the June
30, 2000, level of 8%. Also  contributing to the increase was a $17 million gain
on a sale of a fixed asset at the Kearny Generation  Station and output from new
operating  generation projects placed in service subsequent to the first quarter
of 2000.  These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $28 million in
MTC revenues caused by an additional 2% rate  reduction,  which was effective on
February 7, 2001 in  accordance  with the BPU's Final Order and the  issuance of
PSE&G's  securitization  bonds.  Effective August 1, 2001, PSE&G  implemented an
additional 2% rate reduction as required by the Final Order,  bringing the total
rate decrease to 9% since August 1, 1999.

     Power has  contracted  with PSE&G to provide the capacity  and  electricity
necessary for the BGS  obligation  through July 31, 2002. On June 29, 2001 PSE&G
and the  other  three  BPU  regulated  New  Jersey  electric  utility  companies
submitted a joint  filing to the BPU setting  forth an auction  proposal for the
provision of BGS supply  beginning  August 1, 2002.  Power  expects that it will
continue  to earn a  substantial  portion  of its  revenues  from  these  supply
contracts.

     Gas Distribution

     Gas Distribution  revenues increased $33 million or 10% and $368 million or
35% for the quarter and the six months  ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable
periods in 2000,  respectively,  primarily due to higher natural gas costs which
were passed along to customers.  Customer  rates in all classes of business have
increased  in 2001 to  recover a portion of the higher  natural  gas costs.  The
commercial and industrial  classes fuel recovery rates vary monthly according to
the  market  price  of  energy.  The BPU  also  approved  increases  in the fuel
component of the residential class rates of 16% in November 2000 and 2% for each
month from December 2000 through July 2001. These increased revenues were offset
by higher gas distribution costs discussed below.

     Trading

     Trading revenues  decreased $115 million or 17% and $142 million or 11% for
the quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable  periods in
2000, respectively, due to lower trading volumes resulting from increased market
volatility.  However,  trading margins increased from $15 million to $27 million
and from $42 million to $78 million for the three and six month periods ended as
of June 30,  2001,  as  decreased  revenues  were more than offset by  decreased
trading costs as discussed below in Trading Costs.

     Other

     Other revenues  increased $32 million or 19% and $39 million or 10% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2001 as compared to the same  periods in
2000.

     Other revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2001 were favorably  impacted
by  increased  revenues of $25 million at Resources of which $14 million was due
to higher  leveraged  lease income from continued  investments in such financing
transactions. In addition, Resources recorded no change in the carrying value of
publicly traded equity  securities in its leveraged buyout funds for the quarter
ended June 30, 2001 as compared  to a reduction  of $13 million  recorded in the
comparable period in 2000.  Global's revenues increased $4 million primarily due
to an  increase of $9 million in Interest  Income  associated  with its loans to
Texas   Independent   Energy,   L.P.  (TIE)  and  a  note  receivable  taken  as
consideration  for the  withdrawal  from its  interest in the Eagle  Point.  The
increase in Interest Income of $9 million was partially offset by reduced Income
from Joint Ventures and Partnerships  primarily due to the withdrawal from Eagle
Point in January 2001.

     Other  revenues  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2001 were  favorably
impacted by increased revenues of $55 million at Global of which $5l million was
related to the gain on the  withdrawal  from Eagle  Point.  The  increase of $55
million  was  partially  offset by lower  revenues  of $8  million  realized  by
Resources  and $8 million  realized by PSEG  Energy  Technologies  Inc.  (Energy
Technologies),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Energy Holdings.  The reduction in
revenue at Resources was  primarily due to a net decrease in the carrying  value
of publicly traded equity  securities in Resources'  leveraged buyout funds. The
reduction of revenues at Energy  Technologies was primarily due to the exit from
the electric and gas commodity business,  partially offset by increased revenues
from the expansion of its mechanical contracting businesses.

Operating Expenses

     Energy Costs

     Energy  Costs  increased  $5  million  or 2% and $30  million or 7% for the
quarter and the six months  ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable  periods in
2000,  respectively,  primarily  due to  increased  load  served  under  the BGS
obligation,  higher fuel costs fossil  generation  resulting from higher natural
gas prices,  partially  offset by  increased,  low cost,  nuclear  generation as
compared to 2000.

     Gas Costs

     Gas  Costs  increased  $6  million  or 3% and $313  million  or 44% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable  2000  periods,
respectively,  primarily due to the increase in the gas fuel revenues, discussed
above. Due to the PSE&G's Levelized Gas Adjustment Clause,  retail gas costs are
increased  or decreased  to offset a  corresponding  increase or decrease in gas
revenues with no impact on income.

     Trading Costs

     Trading Costs decreased $127 million or 19% and $177 million or 14% for the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001 from the comparable  periods in 2000,
respectively,  primarily due to lower trading  volumes  resulting from increased
market volatility.

     Operations and Maintenance

     Operations and  Maintenance  expense  increased $82 million or 17% and $141
million or 15% for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001  primarily due
to planned  generation  outage  work in the first  quarter of 2001 and a greater
proportion of  expenditures  used for  Operations  and  Maintenance  rather than
capital  project work in the second quarter of 2001 than in the comparable  2000
period and higher expenses relating to projects going into operation  subsequent
to the first  quarter of 2000 for Power and lower  capital  project work for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30,  2001 as compared to the same  periods in
2000 for PSE&G.

     Depreciation and Amortization

     Depreciation and Amortization  expense increased $37 million or 43% and $55
million  or 31% for the  quarter  and six months  ended  June 30,  2001 from the
comparable  2000  periods,  respectively.  The increase was primarily due to $43
million and $65 million of  amortization  of the  regulatory  asset recorded for
PSE&G's stranded costs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001. These
increases were partially  offset by a change in the accrual for the  anticipated
cost of removal of Power's generating stations.

     Interest Expense

     Interest  Expense  increased  $25 million or 18% and $52 million or 19% for
the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2001 from the comparable 2000 periods,
respectively,  primarily  due to  increased  long-term  debt to finance  various
projects.

     Preferred Securities Dividend Requirements

     Preferred Securities Dividend Requirements  decreased $3 million or 13% and
$3 million or 6% for the quarter  and six months  ended June 30, 2001 due to the
redemption  of PSE&G  preferred  securities.  For further  detail,  see External
Financings - PSE&G.

     Income Taxes

     Income  taxes  decreased  $16 million or 16% and $46 million or 16% for the
quarter and six months  ended June 30, 2001 from the  comparable  2000  periods,
respectively.  The decrease of income taxes is due to lower pre-tax income and a
lower effective tax rate at Energy  Holdings due to a greater  proportion of its
earnings  coming from foreign  operations,  which are accrued at the rate of 10%
due  to the  incremental  cost  associated  with  the  repatriation  of  foreign
earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     PSEG

     PSEG is a holding  company and, as such,  has no operations of its own. The
following  discussion  of  PSEG's  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  on  a
consolidated  basis,  noting the uses and  contributions  of PSEG's three direct
operating subsidiaries: PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

     Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock were $0.54 per share per  quarter  and
totaled  approximately $112 million and $116 million for the quarters ended June
30,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Dividend  payments on Common  Stock  totaled
approximately $225 million and $234 million for the six month periods ended June
30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Although PSEG  presently  believes it will have adequate  earnings and cash
flow in the future from its  subsidiaries  to maintain its Common Stock dividend
at the current  level,  earnings and cash flows required to support the dividend
will  become  more  volatile  as  PSEG's  business  changes  from  one  that  is
principally regulated to one that is principally  competitive.  Future dividends
declared will necessarily be dependent upon PSEG's future earnings,  cash flows,
financial requirements, alternate investment opportunities and other factors.

     PSE&G

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed   securities)   were   issued  by  PSE&G   Transition   Funding   LLC,  a
bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned subsidiary of PSE&G. PSE&G also received payment
from Power on its $2.786 billion Promissory Note used to finance the transfer of
PSE&G's generation  business to Power. The proceeds from these transactions were
used to pay for certain  debt  issuance  and related  costs for  securitization,
redeem a portion of PSE&G's  outstanding  short-term  debt,  reduce PSE&G common
equity by $2.265 billion,  loan funds to PSEG of $1.084 billion and make various
short-term  investments.  These funds are  expected to be used for further  debt
and/or  equity  reductions  in 2001  including  payment of maturing  and certain
redeemable  securities.  Any inability to obtain  required  additional  external
capital or to extend or replace  maturing  debt and/or  existing  agreements  at
current  levels  and  reasonable  interest  rates may affect  PSE&G's  financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

     Cash  generated  from PSE&G's  transmission  and  distribution  business is
expected to provide the majority of the funds for PSE&G's business needs.  Since
1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash  payments to PSEG in the form of dividends on
outstanding shares of PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G paid common stock dividends of
$112 million and $334 million to PSEG for the six months ended June 30, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

     Power

     In 2000, Power financed the transfer of the generation  business from PSE&G
through the issuance of a $2.786 billion  promissory  note. On January 31, 2001,
through $1.2 billion of equity  infusions  and $1.62 billion of loans from PSEG,
Power repaid this note to PSE&G. In April 2001, Power issued $1.8 billion of its
Senior Notes in a private  placement,  the proceeds of which were used primarily
to replace its interim  financing  from PSEG. It is expected that Power's future
capital  needs will be funded with cash  generated  from  operations  and may be
supplemented  with external  financings,  equity  infusions  from PSEG and other
project  financing  alternatives  as dictated by Power's  growth  strategy.  Any
inability to obtain required additional external capital or to extend or replace
maturing  debt  and/or  existing  agreements  at current  levels and  reasonable
interest rates may affect Power's financial condition, results of operations and
net cash flows.

     Energy Holdings

     It is intended that Global and Resources will provide the earnings and cash
flow for Energy Holdings' long-term growth.  Resources' investments are designed
to  produce  immediate  cash flow and  earnings  that  enable  Global and Energy
Technologies to focus on longer investment horizons. During the next five years,
Energy Holdings will need  significant  capital to fund its planned  growth.  In
addition to cash  generated from  operations,  Energy  Holdings'  growth will be
funded through external financings and equity infusions from PSEG.

     Over the next  several  years,  Energy  Holdings,  certain  of its  project
affiliates  and PSEG  Capital  Corporation  (PSEG  Capital)  will be required to
refinance  maturing  debt,  incur  additional  debt and  provide  equity to fund
investment  activity.  Any  inability  to obtain  required  additional  external
capital or to extend or replace  maturing  debt and/or  existing  agreements  at
current  levels  and  reasonable  interest  rates may  affect  Energy  Holdings'
financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Capital Requirements

     PSE&G

     PSE&G  has  substantial  commitments  as part of its  ongoing  construction
programs. These programs are continuously reviewed and periodically revised as a
result of changes in  economic  conditions,  revised  load  forecasts,  business
strategies,   site  changes,  cost  escalations  under  construction  contracts,
requirements  of regulatory  authorities  and laws,  the timing of and amount of
electric and gas transmission  and/or  distribution rate changes and the ability
of PSE&G to raise necessary capital.

     Construction   expenditures   are  related  to   improvements   in  PSE&G's
transmission and distribution system, gas system and common facilities.  For the
six month  periods  ended June 30,  2001 and 2000,  respectively,  PSE&G had net
plant additions of $172 million and $230 million,  excluding Allowance for Funds
Used  During  Construction  (AFDC).  This  decrease  is a  result  of a  greater
proportion of expenditures  being applied to Operations and Maintenance  expense
projects as discussed above.

     Power

     Construction  expenditures  were  related  to  acquisitions  by  Power  and
improvements in Power's existing power plants. Power had net plant additions for
the six months ended June 30, 2001 and 2000,  respectively,  of $741 million and
$177  million,   excluding  capitalized  interest.  The  expenditures  were  for
developing  the 1,150 MW  Lawrenceburg  site and the 850 MW  Waterford  site and
adding capacity to its Bergen, Linden,  Burlington, and Kearny stations. Power's
growth  strategy is designed to increase its operating  generating  portfolio to
20,000 MW by 2005.  Changes in environmental  regulations and unexpected impacts
of existing  regulations  could  impact  both  Power's  construction  and growth
strategy as well as its capital expenditure  amounts.  For further  information,
including New Source Review  requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA),
see Note. 5. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     Energy Holdings

     Energy  Holdings  plans to  continue  the growth of Global  and  Resources.
Energy Holdings will assess the growth  prospects and  opportunities  for Energy
Technologies'  business  before  committing  substantial  amounts of  additional
capital.  For the six months ended June 30, 2001, Energy Holdings'  subsidiaries
made net investments totaling  approximately $732 million. These net investments
included  leveraged  lease  investments  of $392  million by  Resources  and net
investments  of  $337  million  by  Global,  primarily  related  to  incremental
investments in certain existing  generation and distribution  projects including
those  in  operation  and  currently  under  construction  and  loans  to  Texas
Independent Energy (TIE).  Factors affecting actual expenditures and investments
include  availability of capital and suitable investment  opportunities,  market
volatility and economic trends.

     As of June 30, 2001, Global investments in the TIE partnership include $162
million  of loans  that  earn  interest  at an annual  rate of 12%.  Of the $162
million currently  outstanding,  $83 million is scheduled to be repaid in a lump
sum in February 2002 and $79 million will be paid over the next 12 years.

     In the second  quarter of 2001,  PSEG  invested  $300 million of additional
equity in Energy  Holdings,  the proceeds of which were used to fund  additional
investments at Global and Resources.

     In June 2001,  Global  exercised its option to acquire an additional 49% of
Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Entre Rios S.A. (EDEERSA), bringing its
total  ownership  to  90%.  The  acquisition  of the  additional  ownership  was
purchased for approximately $110 million.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2001,  Resources invested $392 million
in three leveraged lease financing transactions of three electric power stations
in the United States and an electric power,  district heating and transportation
utility in Austria.

     For a discussion of Global's pending  investments,  see Note 5. Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities of Notes.

     External Financings

     PSEG

     At June 30,  2001,  PSEG had a  committed  $150  million  revolving  credit
facility  which will expire in December  2002. At June 30, 2001,  there was $150
million of  borrowings  under this  revolving  credit  facility.  In 1999,  PSEG
entered into an uncommitted  line of credit with a bank with no stated limit. At
June 30, 2000, PSEG had $224 million outstanding under this line of credit.

     PSEG has an $850  million  commercial  paper  program to provide  funds for
general corporate purposes.  On June 30, 2001, PSEG had commercial paper of $521
million outstanding under this program.

     To provide  liquidity for its  commercial  paper  program,  PSEG has a $570
million  revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2002 and a $280  million
revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2005.  These  agreements are with
groups of banks and provide for borrowings with maturities of up to one year. As
of June 30, 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

     On June 15, 2001, $300 million of Extendible Notes, Series C, matured.

     PSE&G

     Under its Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
against  previous  additions and  improvements  and/or  retired  Mortgage  Bonds
provided  that its ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  calculated in accordance
with its Mortgage is at least 2:1. At June 30, 2001,  PSE&G's Mortgage  coverage
ratio was 3:1. As of June 30, 2001,  the Mortgage  would permit up to $1 billion
aggregate  principal  amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous
additions and improvements. In addition to the refinancing of existing long-term
debt  authorized  by the BPU in the Final  Order,  PSE&G will need to obtain BPU
authorization to issue any incremental debt financing  necessary for its capital
program.  The BPU has  authorized  PSE&G to issue up to $1 billion of  long-term
debt on the basis of  previously  matured,  redeemed or  purchased  debt through
December 31, 2001, of which $590 million has been issued.

     PSE&G has several uncommitted lines of credit with banks. On June 30, 2001,
PSE&G had $55 million of short-term  debt  outstanding,  borrowed  against these
lines of credit.

     In June 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed all of its $208  million of 8.625%  Series A
Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities.

     In March  2001,  PSE&G  reduced the maximum  size of its  commercial  paper
program  from $1.5  billion  to $900  million.  To  provide  liquidity  for this
program,  PSE&G maintains $900 million in revolving credit  facilities,  each of
which  expire  in June  2002.  As of June 30,  2001,  there  were no  borrowings
outstanding under these facilities.

     In March 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed all of its $150 million of 9.375%  Series A
cumulative  income  preferred  securities,  all  of its  $75  million  of  5.97%
preferred stock, $15 million of its 6.75% preferred stock and $52 million of its
floating  rate notes due December 7, 2002. On June 7, 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed the
remaining $248 million outstanding of floating rate notes due December 7, 2002.

     As   discussed   previously,   on  January  31,  2001,   transition   bonds
(non-recourse  asset  backed  securities)  in the amount of $2.525  billion were
issued by Transition  Funding,  in eight classes with maturities  ranging from 1
year to 15 years.

     Power

     In April 2001, Power, in a private placement, issued $500 million of 6.875%
Senior  Notes due 2006,  $800  million of 7.75%  Senior  Notes due 2011 and $500
million of 8.625%  Senior Notes due 2031.  The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were used  primarily  for the  repayment of loans from PSEG,  which
were provided to finance Power's purchase of PSE&G's generation business.  Power
plans to file a  registration  statement  with the SEC  relating  to an exchange
offer for, or the resale of, these  Senior  Notes later in 2001.  Each series of
Senior Notes received  investment grade ratings from Moody's Investors  Service,
Fitch, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.

     Power has various lines of credit extended by banks to support the issuance
of letters of credit. As of June 30, 2001,  letters of credit were issued in the
amount of approximately $90 million.

     Energy Holdings

     On June 30, 2001,  Energy Holdings had two separate senior revolving credit
facilities with a syndicate of banks; a $495 million five-year  revolving credit
and  letter of credit  facility  and a $200  million  364-day  revolving  credit
facility.  The five-year  facility also permits up to $250 million of letters of
credit to be issued.  The 364-day facility and the five-year  facility mature in
May 2002 and May 2004,  respectively.  On June 30, 2001,  Energy Holdings had an
outstanding  balance  of  $137  million  under  its  existing  revolving  credit
facilities

     In June 2001,  Moody's  Investors  Service,  Inc. upgraded Energy Holdings'
unsecured  debt ratings to Baa3 from Ba1. The rating  outlook is stable.  Energy
Holdings now has investment grade ratings from all major rating agencies.

     In  July  2001,  Energy  Holdings  received  the  proceeds  from a  private
placement of $550 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2011.  The net proceeds were
used for the repayment of short-term debt  outstanding from  intercompany  loans
and borrowings under Energy Holdings' revolving credit facilities. The remaining
proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Regulatory Restrictions

     Capital  resources  and  investment  requirements  may be  affected  by the
outcome of the  proceedings  being  conducted  by the BPU pursuant to its Energy
Master Plan and the New Jersey  Electric  Discount  and Energy  Competition  Act
(Energy  Competition  Act)  and  the  requirements  of the  1992  Focused  Audit
conducted by the BPU, of the impact of PSEG's non-utility businesses,  including
Energy Holdings,  on PSE&G. As a result of the Focused Audit, the BPU approved a
plan which, among other things, provides that:

(1)  PSEG will not permit Energy  Holdings'  investments to exceed 20% of PSEG's
     consolidated assets without prior notice to the BPU;

(2)  The PSE&G Board of Directors will provide an annual  certification that the
     business and financing plans of Energy  Holdings will not adversely  affect
     PSE&G;

(3)  PSEG will (a) limit debt  supported  by the minimum  net worth  maintenance
     agreement  between  PSEG and PSEG  Capital to $650  million  and (b) make a
     good-faith  effort to eliminate  such support over a six to ten year period
     from May 1993; and

(4)  Energy  Holdings  will pay PSE&G an  affiliation  fee of up to $2 million a
     year.

     In its Final Order  requiring  PSE&G to transfer its  generation  assets to
Power,  the BPU noted that, due to  significant  changes in the industry and, in
particular,  PSEG's  corporate  structure  as  a  result  of  the  Final  Order,
modifications to or relief from the Focused Audit might be warranted.  PSE&G has
notified  the BPU of its  intention  to make a filing to modify the terms of the
Focused  Audit.   PSE&G  believes  that  the  Focused  Audit  restrictions  have
effectively  been  superceded  by  the  Final  Order.  PSE&G  therefore  expects
modifications to be made,  although no assurances can be given, and that the 20%
notification  requirement  and the  present  requirement  for PSEG to  eliminate
credit  supported  debt to PSEG Capital will not adversely  affect its financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows. Regulatory oversight by the
BPU to assure that there is no harm to utility  ratepayers from Energy Holdings'
share  of  PSEG's  non-utility  investments  is  expected  to  continue.  Energy
Holdings' assets were  approximately 26% of PSEG's  consolidated  assets at June
30, 2001.

     In addition,  if PSEG were no longer to be exempt under the Public  Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA),  PSEG and its subsidiaries would be subject
to  additional  regulation  by the SEC with respect to financing  and  investing
activities,  including  the amount  and type of  non-utility  investments.  PSEG
believes  that this would not have a material  adverse  effect on its  financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Accounting Matters

     For a discussion of EITF 99-19, SFAS 133 and related DIG issues,  SFAS 141,
SFAS 142 and SFAS 143, see Note 2.  Accounting  Matters,  and Note 6.  Financial
Instruments and Risk Management.

Foreign Operations

     As of June 30, 2001, Global and Resources had approximately  $2.349 billion
and $1.328 billion,  respectively, of international assets. As of June 30, 2001,
foreign assets  represented 16% of PSEG's  consolidated  assets and the revenues
related to those foreign assets  contributed  approximately  2% to  consolidated
revenues  for the six months  ended June 30,  2001.  For  discussion  of foreign
currency risk, see Note 6. Financial Instruments and Risk Management.

     As of  June  30,  2001,  approximately  $1.589  billion  or 25%  of  Energy
Holdings'  assets  were  invested  in Latin  America,  specifically  in  Brazil,
Argentina,  Chile, Peru and Venezuela. The Argentine economy has been in a state
of recession for approximately three years. Continued deficit spending in the 23
Argentine  provinces  coupled with low growth and high  unemployment have caused
much  speculation  in the ability of the country to service and  refinance  $130
billion  of debt  over the next  several  years.  The  Argentine  situation  has
contributed to downward  pressure on the Brazilian and Chilean  currencies.  The
Brazilian Real has devalued  approximately 18% since year-end 2000 from 1.951 to
$1US to 2.311 to $1US as of June 30,  2001  and the  Chilean  Peso has  devalued
approximately  10% since year-end 2000 from 573.9 to $1US to 631.9 to $1US as of
June 30, 2001.  The Argentine  currency  remains pegged at 1 peso to $1US though
there has been much  speculation as to whether or not the peg will hold.  Recent
actions by the current  Argentine  administration  provide for a more  favorable
exchange rate for exporters,  which has continued to fuel the  speculation  that
the currency peg may not hold.  In addition,  the Argentine  administration  cut
spending to balance its budget by year-end 2001 to improve  financial  stability
in the region.

     In  Argentina,   the  electricity  law  provides  for  a  pass  through  of
devaluation to the end user customer. Customers' bills are first computed in the
$US and  converted  into the peso for billing.  This implies that a  devaluation
will not impact  the level of $US  revenues  an  electric  distribution  company
receives.  Energy Holdings' faces exposure as a result of secondary impacts of a
devaluation on the overall economy, which could follow many different scenarios.
In  addition,   Energy  Holdings'  share  of  $US  operating   company  debt  is
approximately  $256 million.  This is of concern  because such debt becomes more
costly  to  service  with  a  devaluation,  and  the  immediate  impact  of  the
devaluation  must be recorded  through the income  statement  as the $US debt is
revalued  into the local  currency.  Additionally,  upon  devaluation,  Global's
operating companies in the region may be exposed to increased collection risk.

     The  Brazilian  distribution  company in which  Global has a 32%  interest,
entered into a $190 million $US denominated loan, of which Global's share is $62
million.  The functional  currency of the distribution  company is the Brazilian
Real. Therefore, its debt is subject to exchange rate risk as the Brazilian Real
fluctuates with the $US. Changes in the exchange rate cause the loan amount,  as
reported in the functional  currency,  to be marked upward or downward,  with an
offset to the income statement.

     In  Chile,  the  operating   performance  of  Energy  Holdings'  assets  is
offsetting the impact of the weakening currency in relation to the $US.

     Energy  Holdings  cannot  predict  if and when  currencies  will  fluctuate
against the $US or changes in economic  situations in the operating companies in
which it invests.  However,  the impact of these  changes  could cause  material
adverse effects to Energy Holdings' financial condition,  results of operations,
or net cash flows. For further  discussion of foreign currency risk, see Note 6.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market risk inherent in PSEG's market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions  is the  potential  loss  arising  from  adverse  changes in commodity
prices,  pollution credits,  equity security prices,  interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates as discussed below.  PSEG's policy is to use derivatives
to manage risk  consistent with its business plans and prudent  practices.  PSEG
has a Risk Management  Committee  comprised of executive officers which utilizes
an  independent  risk  oversight  function to ensure  compliance  with corporate
policies and prudent risk management practices.

     PSEG is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event of  non-performance  or
non-payment by  counterparties.  PSEG also has a credit management process which
is used to assess,  monitor and mitigate  counterparty exposure for PSEG and its
subsidiaries.  In  the  event  of  non-performance  or  non-payment  by a  major
counterparty,  there  may  be a  material  adverse  impact  on  PSEG's  and  its
subsidiaries' financial condition,  results of operations or net cash flows. For
discussion of interest rates, commodity-related instruments,  equity securities,
credit risks and foreign currency risks,  see Note 6. Financial  Instruments and
Risk Management.

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand and state and Federal  regulatory  policies.  To reduce  price
risk caused by market  fluctuations,  PSEG's  subsidiaries enter into derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties,  to hedge anticipated  demand.  These contracts,  in conjunction
with owned electric generating  capacity and physical gas supply contracts,  are
designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer commitments.

     PSEG uses a value-at-risk  model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load  requirements,  physical  and  financial  contracts.  Value-at-risk
represents  the potential  gains or losses for  instruments or portfolios due to
changes in market  factors,  for a specified time period and  confidence  level.
PSEG estimates  value-at-risk  across its commodity  business using a model with
historical volatilities and correlations.

     The measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95%
confidence level over a one-week time horizon at June 30, 2001 was approximately
$7 million,  compared to the  December  31,  2000 level of $19  million.  PSEG's
calculated  value-at-risk  represents an estimate of the potential change in the
value of its portfolio of physical and financial derivative  instruments.  These
estimates,  however, are not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may
differ due to the fact that  actual  market  rate  fluctuations  may differ from
forecasted  fluctuations  and due to the fact  that  the  portfolio  of  hedging
instruments may change over the holding period.

                            ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

     Certain  information  reported under PSEG's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and  Quarterly  Report  on Form 10-Q for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  2001 is
updated  below.  References are to the related pages on the Form 10-K as printed
and distributed.

     Electric Operation and Supply

     Form 10-K,  page 3. PSE&G has contracted with Power to provide the capacity
and electricity  necessary for the BGS obligation through July 31, 2002. On June
29, 2001 PSE&G and the other three BPU  regulated  New Jersey  electric  utility
companies  submitted a joint filing to the BPU setting forth an auction proposal
for the  provision of BGS supply  beginning  August 1, 2002.  In addition,  each
company also filed specific contingency plans and accounting information.

     Gas Contract Transfer

     Form 10-K,  page 12. On March 16, 2001, the New Jersey  Ratepayer  Advocate
(RPA)  filed a motion to  dismiss  this case.  The motion is pending  before the
Administrative Law Judge. At a hearing held on April 16, 2001, PSE&G presented a
Stipulation of  Settlement.  PSE&G is  negotiating  to have  additional  parties
execute the  Stipulation.  The final  hearing was  conducted on June 22, 2001. A
settlement  meeting  was  conducted  with  the BPU on July  24,  2001.  PSE&G is
drafting a proposed settlement agreement. The initial brief and reply briefs are
scheduled to be filed on August 15, 2001 and September 4, 2001, respectively.

     FERC RTO Orders

     Form 10-K, page 14. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission  (FERC), in a
series of orders  issued on July 11 and 12 called for the creation of four large
regional  transmission  organizations (RTOs) to facilitate  competitive regional
markets in the U.S.  FERC  rejected  several  smaller RTO proposals and directed
transmission owners and independent system operators (ISOs) to combine into much
larger  RTOs,   dramatically   altering  their  proposed   geographic  size  and
configuration.

     In the Northeast region, FERC conditionally  approved the  Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland  (PJM)  RTO  proposal  (subject  to  several  modifications  and
compliance  filings)  and  rejected  the New York ISO and  ISO-New  England  RTO
proposals.  FERC directed that the three existing ISOs for PJM, New York and New
England,  as well as the systems  involved in PJM West, form a single  Northeast
RTO, based on the "PJM  platform".  FERC directed that the parties in the region
engage in mediation  (with FERC  oversight)  to prepare a proposal and timetable
for the merger of the ISOs into a single RTO. At the end of the 45-day mediation
period, the Administrative Law Judge assigned to the matter will submit a report
to the Commission.

     In the Southeast region,  FERC rejected a separate RTO proposal made by the
Southern  Companies and another  submitted  jointly by Entergy and the Southwest
Power Pool. FERC directed that a single Southeast RTO be created, using the Grid
South  platform.  As in the  Northeast,  FERC directed the Southeast  parties to
engage in mediation under the supervision of an Administrative Law Judge.

     Wholesale and retail  customers,  as well as lower-cost  generation  should
benefit from having better access to a larger regional market.  While impacts on
all PSEG affiliates are uncertain  because  specific  business rule changes will
not be known for some time, the  elimination of seams issues and the creation of
a single  wholesale  market in the  Northeast  is  generally  expected to have a
positive impact on the PSEG companies.  The goal of the mediation  process is to
develop a business plan and  milestones for the creation and  implementation  of
the single northeast RTO.

     Gas Base Rate Filings

     New  Matter.  On May 4,  2001,  PSE&G  filed a  petition  with  the BPU for
authority to revise its gas property  depreciation rates (Depreciation Case). In
this filing,  PSE&G requested  authority to implement its proposed  depreciation
rates  simultaneous  for book  purposes  and  ratemaking  purposes  when the BPU
implements  new  tariffs  designed  to recover the  additional  annual  revenues
resulting from the gas base rate case discusses  below.  On May 25, 2001,  PSE&G
filed a petition  with the BPU  requesting an increase in gas base rates of $171
million for gas delivery  service (Gas Base Rate Case).  The requested  increase
would  result in an overall  gas revenue  increase  of 7.06% to reflect  current
costs.  Present  gas rates will  remain in effect  pending  approval by the BPU.
PSE&G  believes that the current gas base rates,  in effect since November 1991,
do not  reasonably  reflect  capital  investments  and other  costs  required to
maintain  the  gas  utility   infrastructure.   The  BPU  has  consolidated  the
Depreciation Case and the Gas Base Rate Case.

     Construction and Development

     New Matter. In June 2001,  Fossil's Kearny Unit #12 (175 MW) in Kearny, New
Jersey,  began commercial  operation for one half of the capacity.  The unit was
fully operational in August 2001.

     Form 10-K,  page 24. In June 2001,  Tanir Bavi began simple cycle operation
of 170 MW of its planned 220 MW  combined-cycle  plant located in India.  In the
third  quarter,  the plant is expected  to begin  operating  in  combined-cycle.
Global owns a 74% interest in Tanir Bavi.

     Form  10-K,  page 24.  In June  2001,  the  Fushi  Hydropower  Plant  began
commercial  operation of a hydropower plant located along the Rongjiang River in
China. Global owns an indirect 35% interest in the Fushi Hydropower plant.

     Form 10-K,  page 24. In July 2001,  the first 500 MW phase of  Odessa-Ector
Power Partner, L.P. (OEP) 1,000 MW gas-fired  combined-cycle electric generation
facility in Odessa, Texas commenced commercial operation.  The plant is expected
to reach  full  commercial  operation  in the  third  quarter  of  2001.  OEP is
wholly-owned  by  TIE,  a  50/50  joint  venture  of  Global  and  Panda  Energy
International, Inc.

     Form 10-K,  page 44. PSEG Power New York Inc.,  an indirect  subsidiary  of
Power,  is in the process of obtaining  permits and  approvals to authorize  the
development of the Bethlehem Energy Center, a 750 MW combined-cycle  power plant
that will use natural gas as its primary fuel and low-sulfur distillate oil as a
secondary  fuel. The Bethlehem  Energy Center will be located on the site of the
400 MW Albany  Steam  Station,  (which was acquired  from  Niagara  Mohawk Power
Corporation  in May 2000) and will  replace that  facility.  PSEG Power New York
Inc. filed an application  for a water permit in March 2001, an application  for
an air permit in May 2001 and an application for a Certificate of  Environmental
Compatibility  and Public Need in July 2001.  Under its Purchase  Agreement with
Niagara  Mohawk,  Power will be obligated to pay Niagara Mohawk $9 million if it
redevelops the Albany Station.

     License Renewals

     New Matter.  Exelon,  co-owner and  operator of Peach  Bottom  Atomic Power
Station  (Peach  Bottom),  has informed PSEG that on July 3, 2001 an application
was  submitted  to the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  to renew the  operating
licenses for Peach Bottom Units 2 and 3. If approved, the current licenses would
be extended by 20 years, to 2033 and 2034 for Units 2 and 3,  respectively.  NRC
review of the application is expected to take approximately two years.

     Form 10-K, page 18. The New Jersey  Department of Environmental  Protection
(NJDEP) issued a final New Jersey Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System permit
(Permit)  for PSEG  Nuclear  LLC's  (Nuclear),  a  subsidiary  of  Power,  Salem
Generating Station (Salem) on June 29, 2001, with an effective date of August 1,
2001,  allowing for the continued  operation of Salem with its existing  cooling
water system.  This Permit renews Salem's variance from applicable thermal water
quality  standards  under  Section  316(a) of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA),
determines  that  the  existing  intake  structure  represents  best  technology
available  under Section  316(b) of the CWA,  requires that Nuclear  continue to
implement the wetlands  restoration and fish ladder programs  established  under
the 1994 permit and imposes  requirements  for  additional  analyses of data and
studies to determine if other intake  technologies are available for application
at Salem that are  biologically  effective.  The Permit also requires Nuclear to
install  up to two  additional  fish  ladders  in New  Jersey and fund an escrow
account in the amount of $500,000 for the  construction  of artificial  reefs by
NJDEP. The Permit's expiration date is July 31, 2006.

     Nuclear also reached an agreement  settlement with the Delaware  Department
of Natural  Resources and  Environmental  Control (DNREC) providing that Nuclear
will fund additional habitat  restoration and enhancement  activities as well as
fisheries  monitoring  and that PSEG and DNREC  will work  cooperatively  on the
finalization of regulatory  approvals  required for Salem and the implementation
of the  Permit.  PSEG must also  obtain a renewal of the  Delaware  River  Basin
Commission's Docket for the Salem. As part of this agreement,  PSEG was required
to deposit  approximately  $5.8  million  into an escrow  account to be used for
future costs related to this settlement.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     AGREEMENT,  by and between Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated,  a
New Jersey  Corporation  ("Enterprise") and Thomas M. O'Flynn (the "Executive"),
dated as of April 18, 2001.

     WHEREAS,  Enterprise  wishes to employ  the  Executive  as  Executive  Vice
President and Chief Financial  Officer,  and in consideration of the substantial
benefits to be provided by Enterprise and its  subsidiaries and affiliates ("the
Company") pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive is willing to commit himself
to be employed on the terms and conditions herein set forth; and

     WHEREAS,  the parties desire to enter into this Agreement setting forth the
terms and conditions for the employment  relationship  of the Executive with the
Company during the Employment Period (as hereinafter defined):

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN CONSIDERATION  of the mutual  premises,  covenants and
agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

     1. General.
        --------

     (a)  Employment.  The  Company  agrees to  employ  the  Executive,  and the
Executive agrees to be employed by the Company, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

     (b) Term. The term of the Executive's  employment under this Agreement (the
"Employment  Period")  shall  commence  not later than July 1, 2001,  or on such
earlier date agreed to by the Executive and the Company (the  "Effective  Date")
and shall continue until the fifth  anniversary of the Effective Date;  provided
that  commencing on the fourth  anniversary  of the  Effective  Date and on each
anniversary  of the  Effective  Date  thereafter  (each  a  "Renewal  Date")  an
additional year shall be added to the term unless notice of non-renewal shall be
given by either the Executive or the Company to the other at least 90 days prior
to the  Renewal  Date.  In the  event a Change  in  Control  occurs  during  the
Employment  Period,  the  term  of  the  Executive's  employment  shall  (unless
terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4 hereof)  automatically  continue until
the later of the last day of the Employment Period or the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.  In the event this  Agreement  is extended as provided in
the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment  Period  shall be the period from the
Effective Date to the second anniversary of the Change in Control.
<PAGE>

     2. Position and Attention to Duties.
        --------------------------------

     (a) Position.  During the Employment  Period,  the Executive shall serve as
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Enterprise,  and in such
other senior executive and director position or positions for the Company as are
determined  by the  Chief  Executive  Officer  ("CEO")  and  Board of  Directors
("Board") of Enterprise.

     (b) Attention.  During the Employment  Period, and excluding any periods of
vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees
to devote full  attention and time during normal  business hours to the business
and  affairs of the Company and to use his  reasonable  best  efforts to perform
such  responsibilities in a professional  manner. It shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (i) serve on corporate,  civic or charitable
boards or committees,  (ii) deliver  lectures,  fulfill speaking  engagements or
teach at educational institutions and (iii) manage personal investments, so long
as such  activities do not interfere  with the  performance  of the  Executive's
responsibilities as an officer of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

     3. Compensation.
        -------------

     Except as modified by this Agreement, the Executive's compensation shall be
provided in accordance  with the  Company's  standard  compensation  and payroll
practices as in effect from time to time.  The aggregate of Base Salary,  Annual
Incentive  Compensation and Long-Term  Incentives in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive  practices  for companies of
comparable size and standing.

     (a) Base  Salary.  The initial  annual  rate of base salary  payable to the
Executive  during the  Employment  Period (the  "Annual Base  Salary")  shall be
$450,000. During the Employment Period, the Annual Base Salary shall be reviewed
by the Organization and Compensation  Committee of the Board (the  "Compensation
Committee") for possible  increase at least  annually.  Annual Base Salary shall
not be reduced,  and after any such  increase  and the term "Annual Base Salary"
shall thereafter refer to the Annual Base Salary as so increased.

     (b) Annual Incentive Compensation. The Board has established and intends to
continue an annual incentive  compensation  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices  for  companies  of  comparable  size and  standing.  The
performance  objectives  for the Executive in respect of such  incentive will be
determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.  The
target annual  incentive for the Executive shall initially be established at 50%
of Annual Base Salary, and shall not be reduced during the Employment Period.

     (c) Long-Term Incentives. The Board has established and intends to continue
a  long-term  incentive  plan for the  benefit  of the  officers  and  other key
employees  of  the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based  on  competitive
practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.  Such plan may, in the
judgment  of the  Compensation  Committee,  provide  for  stock  options,  stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or units
and/or other type of long-term  incentive awards.  The type and amount of equity
and any other long-term  incentive grants will be determined by the Compensation
Committee  from time to time,  and  awards  thereunder  shall be  payable to the
Executive  in  accordance  with  the  long-term  incentive  plan  or  plans   in

<PAGE>

effect  from time to time.  The  Executive's  target award  shall  initially  be
125% of  Annual  Base  Salary  under the  Enterprise  Long-Term  Incentive  Plan
("LTIP").  The Executive's  grant under the LTIP for 2001 shall be non-qualified
options  ("Options")  to  purchase  50,000  shares of the Common  Stock  without
nominal  or par  value of  Enterprise  ("Stock"),  to  reflect  commencement  of
employment mid-year.

     (d) Retention  Award. In  consideration  of the  Executive's  commitment to
employment by the Company and his  responsibilities,  as set forth  herein,  the
Company shall provide the Executive a retention  award (the  "Retention  Award")
consisting of restricted  shares of Enterprise  Common Stock (the "Stock Award")
and options to purchase shares of Enterprise  Common Stock (the "Option Award"),
as follows:

          (i) Stock Award.  The  Executive  shall be granted an award of 100,000
     shares of Stock,  effective as of the Effective  Date,  the shares of which
     Stock Award shall be restricted and shall be subject to the following terms
     and conditions:

               (A)  The  shares  for the  Stock  Award  shall  be  purchased  by
          Enterprise  or its agent on the open  market.  In the event any of the
          shares of the Stock Award  shall be  forfeited,  Enterprise  may apply
          such shares for its corporate purposes in its discretion.

               (B) The  Executive's  right  to the  Stock  Award  shall  vest in
          accordance  with the following  schedule,  provided that the Executive
          has remained  continuously  employed by the Company, or its successor,
          during the Employment Period through the dates indicated below:

               Anniversary of Employment              Number of Shares

                      First                               33,000
                      Second                              33,000
                      Third                               34,000

               (C)  Shares of the Stock  Award will be issued in the name of the
          Executive,  but  will be held by  Enterprise  for the  account  of the
          Executive together with a stock power that the Executive shall execute
          and deliver to Enterprise.  The shares shall bear a restrictive legend
          indicating  that  they  are  subject  to  the  terms,  conditions  and
          limitations of this Agreement.

               (D) Once shares of the Stock Award shall vest,  Enterprise  shall
          promptly issue to the Executive a certificate  for such shares without
          any legend or  restriction  (other  than may be  required  by law) and
          Enterprise  shall return to the Executive or shall destroy the related
          stock power previously executed by the Executive.
<PAGE>
               (E) Shares of Stock  held by  Enterprise  for the  account of the
          Executive  prior to  distribution  to the  Executive  may not be sold,
          assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of,
          except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Any attempted
          sale, assignment,  transfer,  pledge,  hypothecation or disposition in
          contravention  of the  foregoing  shall  be null  and  void  and of no
          effect.

               (F) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Executive shall have
          all of the rights of a  stockholder  with respect to the shares of the
          Stock  Award  issued  in his  name,  including  the  right to vote the
          shares,  to receive dividends and other  distributions  thereon and to
          participate  in any change in  capitalization  of  Enterprise.  In the
          event of any change in  capitalization  resulting  in the  issuance of
          additional  shares to the  Executive,  such shares shall be subject to
          the same terms,  conditions and  restrictions as the shares in respect
          to which they are issued,  and the Executive shall execute and deliver
          to Enterprise stock powers in respect thereto. If the Executive elects
          to reinvest dividends on the shares of the Stock Award, or if he shall
          receive  rights or  warrants  in  respect  to any  shares of the Stock
          Award,  the shares  acquired by dividend  reinvestment  or through the
          exercise of rights may be held,  sold or otherwise  disposed of by the
          Executive,  free  and  clear  of  any  restrictions  created  by  this
          Agreement.

               (G)  Unless  the  shares of the  Stock  Award to be issued to the
          Executive have been  registered  pursuant to a Registration  Statement
          under the Securities  Act of 1933,  prior to receiving such shares the
          Executive  shall  represent in writing to the Company that such shares
          are being  acquired for  investment  purposes only and not with a view
          towards  the further  sale or  distribution  thereof and shall  supply
          Enterprise  with  such  other  documentation  as  may be  required  by
          Enterprise,  unless in the opinion of counsel to the  Enterprise  such
          representation,  agreement or documentation is not necessary to comply
          with  the  Securities  Act of  1933  and  the  rules  and  regulations
          thereunder.

               (H) Enterprise shall not be required to deliver any shares of the
          Stock Award until they have been listed on each securities exchange on
          which  shares  of the  Stock  are  listed  or  until  there  has  been
          qualification  under or  compliance  with such state and federal laws,
          rules or regulations that Enterprise may deem  applicable.  Enterprise
          will use its best efforts to obtain such  listing,  qualification  and
          compliance.
<PAGE>

          (ii) Option Award. In addition to the annual grant under Section 3(c),
     the  Executive  shall be  granted  an award of  Options  under  the LTIP to
     purchase  250,000  shares  of Stock,  subject  to the  following  terms and
     conditions:


               (A) The grant price of the Options  shall be the closing price of
          the  Common  Stock  on the New  York  Stock  Exchange  on the date the
          Executive executes this Agreement.

               (B) The  Executive's  right to the  Option  Award  shall vest and
          become exercisable in accordance with the following schedule, provided
          that the Executive has remained  continuously  employed by the Company
          during the Employment Period through the dates indicated below:

               Anniversary of Employment     Number of Shares
               -------------------------     ----------------
                        First                     50,000
                        Second                    50,000
                        Third                     50,000
                        Fourth                    50,000
                        Fifth                     50,000

               (C) The Options  shall expire ten (10) years after the  Effective
          Date.

               (D) Once Options become exercisable hereunder,  the Executive may
          exercise such Options in any manner  permitted by the LTIP. All vested
          options  shall be  exercised  or shall be  forfeited no later than the
          earlier of three years after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years
          after the Effective Date.

               (E) Unless specifically provided by this Agreement, all terms and
          conditions of the Options  granted  hereunder shall be governed by the
          LTIP.

          (iii) If,  during the  Employment  Period (1) there occurs a Change in
     Control, or (2) Enterprise enters into an agreement to merge or consolidate
     with  any  other  corporation   which,  if  consummated,   would  meet  the
     requirements  of Section  6(b)  (iii) and the  shareholders  of  Enterprise
     approve that agreement,  the entire  Retention Award shall vest. If, during
     the Employment Period,  the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment
     without Cause or the Executive  terminates  his employment for Good Reason,
     or the Executive's  Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability,
     the  Executive's  right to the entire  Retention Award shall vest as of the
     Date  of  Termination.  If,  during  the  Employment  Period,  the  Company
     terminates the Executive's employment for Cause or the Executive terminates
     his employment  without Good Reason,  the Executive shall forfeit all right
     to all shares and options of the Retention  Award that are not vested as of
     the Date of Termination.
<PAGE>

          (iv) The Compensation Committee may make such provisions and take such
     steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of any
     taxes that the Company is required by law or regulation of any governmental
     authority,  whether  federal,  state or  local,  domestic  or  foreign,  to
     withhold in connection with the Retention Award, including, but not limited
     to (1)  withholding  delivery of the  certificate for shares of Stock until
     the  Executive  reimburses  the  Company  for the amount it is  required to
     withhold  with  respect to such taxes,  (2) the  canceling of any number of
     shares  of Stock  issuable  to the  Executive  in an  amount  necessary  to
     reimburse the Company for the amount it is required to so withhold,  or (3)
     withholding the amount due from the Executive's other compensation.

     (e)  Employee  Benefit  Programs.   During  the  Employment   Period,(i)the
Executive shall be eligible to participate in all savings and retirement  plans,
practices,  policies and programs to the same extent as other senior  executives
of the Company and (ii) the Executive and/or the Executive's family, as the case
may be, shall be eligible for  participation  in and shall  receive all benefits
under welfare benefit plans,  practices,  policies and programs  provided by the
Company  (other  than  severance  plans,   practices,   policies  and  programs)
including,   without  limitation,   medical,   prescription,   dental,   medical
reimbursement,  disability,  salary continuance,  thrift, deferred compensation,
group  universal life  insurance,  group life  insurance,  accidental  death and
travel  accident  insurance  plans  and  programs,  and,  upon  retirement,  all
applicable  retirement  benefit plans to the same extent and subject to the same
terms,  conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements  and the like,  as other  senior
executives of the Company  employed  prior to January 1, 1996, as such plans may
be amended from time to time, and as supplemented hereby.  Following a Change in
Control,  no benefit  coverage  available to the Executive  and/or to his family
under any such plan,  practice,  policy or program shall be  materially  reduced
without the prior written consent of the Executive.

     (f) Retirement Benefit.
         ------------------

          (i) During the Employment  Period,  the Executive shall participate in
     Enterprise's  Pension Plan, and also in Enterprise's  Limited  Supplemental
     Benefits Plan ("Limited Plan"),  Mid-Career Hire Plan,  Reinstatement  Plan
     and such other  supplemental  executive  retirement plans as may be adopted
     and  amended  by  Enterprise  from time to time  ("SERPs"),  applicable  to
     persons employed prior to January 1, 1996, such that the aggregate value of
     the retirement  benefits that he and his  beneficiaries  will receive under
     all pension  benefit plans of the Company  (whether  qualified or not) will
     not be less than the  benefits he would have  received  had he continued to
     participate in such plans, as in effect  immediately before the date hereof
     through the earlier of the end of the Employment  Period or Retirement.  It
     is agreed that the Retention Award and any dividends or other distributions
     in respect of the  Retention  Award  shall not be  included  in any pension
     calculation.  The  Executive's  right to retire  shall be  governed  by the
     Enterprise Pension Plan ("Retirement").
<PAGE>

          (ii) In recognition of the  Executive's  prior work  experience,  upon
     completion of five years of service with the Company,  the Executive  shall
     be entitled to fifteen  additional years of credited service in determining
     his pension benefit and eligibility for retirement  under the Pension Plan.
     The  Executive  shall be entitled to an  additional  five years of credited
     service for  pension  calculation  purposes if he retires  from the Company
     between ages 60 and 65.

          (iii)  Commencing  upon  completion  of five  years  of  service,  the
     Executive  shall be a  participant  in and entitled to a benefit  under the
     Limited  Plan of the  Company,  regardless  of whether he is entitled to an
     immediately  payable  pension under the Enterprise  Pension Plan;  provided
     that any benefit  under the Limited Plan shall  commence and be paid at the
     same time as any pension benefit under the Enterprise Pension Plan.

          (iv) In the event,  subsequent to a Change in Control, the Executive's
     employment is  terminated  during the first five years of employment by the
     Company  without Cause or by the  Executive for Good Reason,  the Executive
     shall be entitled to a benefit  calculated in  accordance  with the Limited
     Plan using 35% as the multiplier  against the  Executive's  Compensation as
     defined in the Limited Plan, and subject to the terms and conditions of the
     Limited Plan, with the benefit commencing at age 65.

     (g) Expenses.  The Executive is authorized to incur reasonable  expenses in
carrying out his duties and responsibilities  under this Agreement.  The Company
shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such  expenses  in  accordance  with the
policies  of the  Company  in  effect  from  time to time for  reimbursement  of
expenses for senior  executives,  and subject to  documentation  provided by the
Executive in accordance with such Company policies.

     (h) Fringe  Benefits.  During the Employment  Period,  the Executive  shall
participate  in  all  fringe  benefits  and  perquisites   available  to  senior
executives of the Company,  including  provision of an automobile  and financial
planning  services,  on terms  and  conditions  that are  commensurate  with his
positions and responsibilities at the Company.

     (i) Vacation. During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be entitled
to  paid  vacation  in  accordance  with  Company  policy  for its  most  senior
executives  as in effect from time to time,  but in no event less than six weeks
per year.

     4. Termination of Employment.
        -------------------------

     (a)  Death  or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall  terminate
automatically  upon the Executive's  death during the Employment  Period. If the
Company  determines  in good  faith that the  Disability  of the  Executive  has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability Effective Date"), provided that, within the 30 days

<PAGE>


after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the Enterprise Pension Plan .

     (b) By the Company.
         --------------

          (i) The Company may terminate the  Executive's  employment  during the
     Employment  Period  for  Cause  or  without  Cause.  For  purposes  of this
     Agreement,  "Cause"  shall mean (A)  willful and  continued  failure by the
     Executive to substantially perform his duties under this Agreement, (B) the
     willful  engaging by the Executive in gross  misconduct which is materially
     and  demonstrably  injurious to the Company,  or (C) the  conviction of the
     Executive  of a  felony.  No act or  failure  to  act  on the  part  of the
     Executive shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be
     done, by the Executive in bad faith or without  reasonable  belief that the
     Executive's  action or omission  was in the best  interests of the Company.
     Any act or failure to act that is based upon authority  given pursuant to a
     resolution  duly adopted by the Board of  Directors of the Company,  or the
     advice of counsel for the  Company,  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be
     done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best
     interests of the Company.

          (ii) A termination  of the  Executive's  employment for Cause shall be
     effected in  accordance  with the following  procedures.  The Company shall
     give the Executive  written notice  ("Notice of Termination  for Cause") of
     its intention to terminate the  Executive's  employment for Cause,  setting
     forth in reasonable  detail the specific  conduct of the Executive  that it
     considers  to  constitute  Cause  and  the  specific  provision(s)  of this
     Agreement  on which it relies.  Such notice shall be given no later than 60
     days after the act or failure (or the last in a series of acts or failures)
     that the Company alleges to constitute  Cause.  The Executive shall have 30
     days after  receiving the Notice of Termination  for Cause in which to cure
     such act or failure, to the extent such cure is possible.  In the case of a
     termination  under  Section  4(b)(i)(A)  or  Section  4(b)(i)(B),   if  the
     Executive fails to cure such act or failure to the reasonable  satisfaction
     of the  Company,  the Company  shall give the  Executive  a second  written
     notice  stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board,  the Executive
     is guilty of the conduct  described in the Notice of Termination  for Cause
     and that such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

          (iii) A termination of the Executive's  employment without Cause shall
     be effected by the Company  providing the  Executive  with at least 30 days
     written notice of such termination.
<PAGE>
     (c) By the Executive.
         ----------------

          (i) The Executive may terminate his  employment  during the Employment
     Period  for Good  Reason  or  without  Good  Reason.  For  purpose  of this
     Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean:

               (A) Any reduction in the Executive's  Annual Base Salary,  target
          annual incentive, target long-term incentive below the market norm, or
          Retirement benefit;

               (B) Any  adverse  change  in the  Executive's  title,  authority,
          duties,  responsibilities and reporting lines or the assignment to the
          Executive  of  any  duties  or  responsibilities  inconsistent  in any
          respect  with those  customarily  associated  with the position of the
          Executive as Chief  Financial  Officer of Enterprise or of a successor
          publicly-owned parent corporation;

               (C) Any requirement for the Executive to move his principal place
          of employment more than 50 miles from Newark, New Jersey;

               (D) Any purported  termination of the  Executive's  employment by
          the Company  for a reason or in a manner not  expressly  permitted  by
          this Agreement;

               (E)  Termination  of this  Agreement  by its  terms on the  fifth
          anniversary of the Effective Date pursuant to Section 1(b) as a result
          of the Company providing a notice of non-renewal;

               (F) Any failure by  Enterprise  to comply with  Section  10(c) of
          this Agreement; or

               (G) Any other  material  breach of this  Agreement by the Company
          that  either  is not  taken in good  faith  or,  even if taken in good
          faith, is not remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice
          thereof from the Executive.

Following  a  Change  in  Control, the  Executive's determination that an act or
failure to act  constitutes  Good Reason  shall be  conclusively  presumed to be
valid unless such  determination  is decided to be unreasonable by an arbitrator
pursuant to Section 9.
<PAGE>

          (ii) A  termination  of  employment  by the  Executive for Good Reason
     shall be  effectuated  by giving the  Company  written  notice  ("Notice of
     Termination  for  Good  Reason")  of  the  termination,  setting  forth  in
     reasonable  detail the  specific  acts or  omissions  of the  Company  that
     constitute  Good Reason and the specific  provision(s) of this Agreement on
     which the Executive relies. Unless the CEO determines  otherwise,  a Notice
     of Termination for Good Reason by the Executive must be made within 60 days
     after the Executive  first has actual  knowledge of the act or omission (or
     the last in a series of acts or omissions)  that the  Executive  alleges to
     constitute Good Reason, and the Company shall have 30 days from the receipt
     of such Notice of  Termination  for Good  Reason to cure the conduct  cited
     therein. A termination of employment by the Executive for Good Reason shall
     be  effective  on the final day of such 30-day cure period  unless prior to
     such time the  Company  has  cured the  specific  conduct  asserted  by the
     Executive to constitute  Good Reason to the reasonable  satisfaction of the
     Executive.

          (iii) A  termination  of the  Executive's  employment by the Executive
     without Good Reason, including Retirement,  shall be effected by giving the
     Company at least 30 days' written  notice  specifying the effective date of
     termination.

     (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of  Termination"  means the date of the
Executive's  death,  the  Disability  Effective  Date,  or the date on which the
termination  of the  Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or without
Cause or by the  Executive  for Good Reason or without  Good  Reason,  including
Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.

     5. Obligations of the Company upon Termination.
        -------------------------------------------

     (a) Good Reason;  Other Than for Cause.  If, during the Employment  Period,
the Company shall  terminate the  Executive's  employment  other than for Cause,
death or Disability,  or the Executive  shall  terminate his employment for Good
Reason:

          (i) the  Company  shall  pay to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash,
     within 15 days after the Date of Termination,  the aggregate of the amounts
     set forth in clauses A and B below:

               Section  3(b)  (the  "Target  Bonus")  and  (y) a  fraction,  the
               numerator of which is the number of days in the current  calendar
               year  through the Date of  Termination,  and the  denominator  of
               which is 365; and

                    (3) any accrued vacation pay;
<PAGE>


          in each case to the extent not theretofore paid (the sum of
          the amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall be
          hereinafter referred to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

               B. the amount  equal to the product of (1) two and (2) the sum of
          (x) the Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus.

     outstanding  immediately  prior to the Date of  Termination  ("Prior Equity
     Awards")  shall vest  and/or  become  exercisable  in  accordance  with the
     underlying plan for such Prior Equity Award;

          (iv) for two years after the  Executive's  Date of Termination or such
     longer  period as may be  provided  by the terms of the  appropriate  plan,
     program,  practice or policy,  the Company shall  continue  benefits to the
     Executive and/or the Executive's family at least equal to those which would
     have been provided to them in accordance with the welfare plans,  programs,
     practices and policies  described in Section 3(e) of this  Agreement if the
     Executive's employment had not been terminated or, if more favorable to the
     Executive,  as in effect  generally at any time  thereafter with respect to
     other peer executives of the Company and its affiliated companies and their
     families,  provided however,  that if the Executive becomes reemployed with
     another  employer  and is  eligible to receive  medical or dental  benefits
     under  another  employer  provided  plan,  the medical and dental  benefits
     described herein shall be secondary to those provided under such other plan
     during such applicable  period of  eligibility;  and thereafter the Company
     shall make health and welfare  benefits  available to the  Executive at his
     cost as provided by the Consolidated  Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of
     1985 (COBRA) for an additional 5 years, or, if sooner,  until the Executive
     becomes  employed with another  employer and is eligible to receive  health
     and wlfare benefits under another employer-provided plan.

          (v) any  compensation  previously  deferred  (other than pursuant to a
     tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the  Executive  (together  with any
     accrued interest or earnings  thereon),  whether or not then vested,  shall
     become  vested on the Date of  Termination  and shall be paid in accordance
     with the terms of the plan, policy or practice under which it was deferred;
<PAGE>


          (vi) the Company shall,  at its sole expense as incurred,  provide the
     Executive with outplacement  services suitable to the Executive's  position
     for a  period  not  to  exceed  two  years  with  a  nationally  recognized
     outplacement firm; and,

          (vii) to the extent not  theretofore  paid or  provided,  the  Company

     required  to be paid or  provided  or which the  Executive  is  entitled to
     receive under any plan, program, policy, practice, contract or agreement of
     the  Company and its  affiliated  companies  (other than  medical or dental
     benefits if the Executive is eligible for such benefits to be provided by a
     subsequent  employer),  including  earned  but  unpaid  stock  and  similar
     compensation but excluding any severance plan or policy (such other amounts
     and benefits shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Other Benefits").

     (b) Cause; Other than for Good Reason. If the Executive's  employment shall

obligations  to the  Executive  other than for  amounts  described  in  Sections
5(a)(i)(A)(1)  and  5(a)(i)(A)(3)  and the timely  payment or provision of Other
Benefits.  In such case,  all such amounts  shall be paid to the  Executive in a
lump sum within 30 days of the Date of Termination.  Any unvested portion of the
Retention Award shall be forfeited in accordance with Section 3(d)(iii).

     (c)  Death.  If the  Executive's  employment  terminates  by  reason of the
Executive's death during the Employment  Period,  all Accrued  Obligations as of

applicable,  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date of Termination and
the Executive's estate or beneficiary shall be entitled to any Other Benefits in
accordance  with their terms.  In addition,  the  Retention  Award shall vest in

Executive's  estate or beneficiary,  as the case may be, shall have the right to
exercise any such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or other exercisable
equity-based  award  until  the  earlier  of (A)  one  year  from  the  Date  of
Termination  (or such longer  period as may be  provided  under the terms of any
such stock option, stock appreciation right or other equity-based award) and (B)
the normal  expiration date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or
other equity-based award.

     (d) Disability.  If the  Executive's  employment is terminated by reason of

terms of any such stock option,  stock  appreciation right or other equity-based
award)  and  (B)  the  normal  expiration  date  of  such  stock  option,  stock
appreciation right or other equity-based award.

Retirement, the Executive shall be paid the Accrued Obligations in a lump sum in
cash  within  30 days of the  Date of  Termination  and the  Executive  shall be
entitled to any Other Benefits in accordance with their terms.

at the cost of the Executive from 18 months to 36 months.

     6. Change in Control.
        -----------------

     (a)  Benefits  Upon a Change in  Control.  The  Executive's  rights  upon a
termination of employment that occurs  following a Change in Control shall be as
specified in Section 5 generally for  termination of employment,  except (i) the
amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall  be  three  times  the  sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period;  (iii) the  Retention  Award shall have vested in  accordance  with
Section 3(d)(iii); and (iv) the Executive shall be paid within 15 days after the
Date of Termination, an amount equal to the excess of

               (A) the  actuarial  equivalent of the benefit under the Company's
          applicable  qualified  defined  benefit  retirement  plan in which the
          Executive  is   participating   immediately   prior  to  his  Date  of
          Termination (the "Retirement Plan", including, for this purpose, a 35%
          retirement  benefit under the Limited  Supplemental  Benefits Plan, as
          provided in Section  3(f)(iv))  (utilizing  the rate used to determine
          lump sums and, to the extent applicable,  other actuarial  assumptions
          no less  favorable  to the  Executive  than those in effect  under the
          Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Date of this Agreement),  any
          SERPs  in  which  the  Executive   participates  and,  to  the  extent
          applicable,  any other defined benefit retirement  arrangement between
          the Executive and the Company  ("Other  Pension  Benefits")  which the
          Executive  would receive if the Executive's  employment  continued for
          three  additional  years beyond the Date of Termination,  assuming for
          this purpose that all accrued benefits are fully vested, and, assuming
          that the Executive's  compensation for such deemed  additional  period
          was the Executive's  Annual Base Salary as in effect immediately prior
          to the Date of  Termination  and  assuming a bonus in each year during
          such deemed additional period equal to the Target Bonus, over
<PAGE>
              (B) the actuarial  equivalent of the  Executive's  actual benefit
          (paid or payable),  if any, under the  Retirement  Plan, the SERPs and
          Other Pension  Benefits as of the Date of  Termination  (utilizing the
          rate used to determine lump sums and, to the extent applicable,  other
          actuarial assumptions no less favorable to the Executive than those in
          effect under the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the date of this
          Agreement).

     (b) Definition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall
mean  the  occurrence  of any of the  following  events  after  the date of this
Agreement:

          (i)  any  "person"  (within  the  meaning  of  Section  13(d)  of  the
     Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended (the  "Exchange  Act") is or
     becomes  the  beneficial  owner  within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the
     Exchange Act (a "Beneficial Owner"),  directly or indirectly, of securities
     of Enterprise (not including in the securities  beneficially  owned by such
     person any securities  acquired directly from Enterprise or its affiliates)
     representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of Enterprise's  then
     outstanding securities,  excluding any person who becomes such a Beneficial
     Owner in connection with a transaction described in clause (A) of paragraph
     (iii) below; or

          (ii) the  following  individuals  cease for any reason to constitute a
     majority of the number of directors of Enterprise then serving: individuals
     who,  on the  date of this  Agreement,  constitute  the  Board  and any new
     director  (other than a director  whose initial  assumption of office is in
     connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not
     limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of
     Enterprise)  whose  appointment  or election by the Board or nomination for
     election by Enterprise's stockholders was approved or recommended by a vote
     of at least  two-thirds  (2/3) of the  directors  then  still in office who
     either were directors on the date hereof or whose appointment,  election or
     nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or

          (iii) there is consummated a merger or  consolidation of Enterprise or
     any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Enterprise with any other
     corporation, other than (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in
     the voting securities of Enterprise  outstanding  immediately prior to such
     merger or  consolidation  continuing  to  represent  (either  by  remaining
     outstanding or by being  converted into voting  securities of the surviving
     entity or any parent  thereof),  in  combination  with the ownership of any
     trustee or other fiduciary  holding  securities  under an employee  benefit
     plan of Enterprise or any  subsidiary  of  Enterprise,  at least 75% of the
     combined  voting power of the  securities of  Enterprise or such  surviving
     entity or any parent thereof  outstanding  immediately after such merger or
     consolidation,  or (B) a merger or  consolidation  effected to  implement a
     recapitalization  of Enterprise (or similar transaction) in which no person

<PAGE>

     is   or  becomes   the  Beneficial   Owner,  directly   or  indirectly,  of
     securities of Enterprise  representing  25% or more of the combined  voting
     power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

          (iv)  the  shareholders  of  Enterprise  approve  a plan  of  complete
     liquidation  or  dissolution  of  Enterprise  or  there is  consummated  an
     agreement for the sale or disposition by Enterprise of all or substantially
     all of Enterprise's  assets, other than a sale or disposition by Enterprise
     of all or substantially  all of Enterprise's  assets to an entity, at least
     75% of the  combined  voting  power of the voting  securities  of which are
     owned by stockholders of Enterprise in  substantially  the same proportions
     as their ownership of Enterprise immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  a  "Change  in Control" shall not be deemed to
have  occurred by virtue of the  consummation  of any  transaction  or series of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

     7. Confidential Information; No Competition.
        ----------------------------------------

     (a) The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all confidential information, knowledge or data (defined below) relating
to the Company or any of its affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and their  respective
businesses,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  the  Executive  during  the
Executive's  employment  by the Company or any of its  affiliated  companies and
which  shall  not be or  become  public  knowledge  (other  than  by acts by the
Executive or  representatives  of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).
Upon Termination of the Executive's  employment,  he shall return to the Company
all Company  information.  After termination of the Executive's  employment with
the Company,  the Executive shall not,  without the prior written consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process,  communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company
and those designated by it, except (x) otherwise publicly available information,
or (y) as may be  necessary  to enforce  his  rights  under  this  Agreement  or
necessary to defend himself  against a claim asserted  directly or indirectly by
the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination has been made in
accordance with Section 7(d) or Section 9 hereof that the Executive has violated
this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the provisions of this Section 7 shall
not  constitute  a basis for  deferring  or  withholding  any amounts  otherwise
payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

     (b) As used herein, the term "confidential information,  knowledge or data"
means all trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential  business  information
belonging  to,  used  by,  or in the  possession  of the  Company  or any of its
affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to information, knowledge
or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and  financial  information,
mergers, acquisitions or consolidations,  purchase or sale of property, leasing,
pricing, sales programs or tactics, actual or past sellers, purchasers, lessees,

<PAGE>
lessors  or  customers,  those  with  whom  the  Company or its  affiliates  and
subsidiaries  has  begun   negotiations  for  new  business,   costs,   employee
compensation,  marketing  and  development  plans,  inventions  and  technology,
whether such  confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,  written or
electronically  recorded or stored,  except  information  in the public  domain,
information  known by the Executive  prior to employment  with the Company,  and
information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or its
affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

     (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and data, as defined in the
previous  paragraph,  gained  in  the  performance  of  the  Executive's  duties
hereunder may be valuable to those who are now, or might become,  competitors of
the Company or its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  Executive
agrees that,  without the written  consent of  Enterprise,  he will not, for the
period of one year from Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the  Employment
Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage,  operate,  join, control,
become employed by, consult to or participate in the ownership,  management,  or
control of any business which is in direct  competition  with the Company and/or
its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive  agrees that, for two
years  following the Date of Termination,  he will not,  directly or indirectly,
solicit or hire, or encourage the solicitation or hiring of any person who was a
managerial  or higher level  employee of the Company at any time during the term
of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer  other than the
Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,  consultant or
otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement  of the  Executive  shall not apply to any
person after 6 months have elapsed subsequent to the date on which such person's
employment  by the Company has  terminated.  In the case of any such  prohibited
activity,  the  Executive  shall not be  entitled  to  post-employment  payments
(including any unexercised options under the Option Award).

     (d) In the event of a breach by the Executive of any of the  agreements set
forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above,  it is agreed that the Company shall
suffer  irreparable harm for which money damages are not an adequate remedy, and
that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company  shall be entitled to obtain an
order of a court of  competent  jurisdiction  for  equitable  relief  from  such
breach,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  temporary  restraining  orders  and
preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such agreements
by the Executive. In the event that the Company should initiate any legal action
for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in this Section
7 and the Company does not prevail in such action,  the Company  shall  promptly
reimburse  the  Executive  the full  amount of any  court  costs,  filing  fees,
attorney's  fees which the Executive  incurs in defending  such action,  and any
loss of income during the period of such litigation.

     8. Full Settlement.
        ---------------

     (a) No Duty to Mitigate; No Reduction.  Except as provided in Section 7(c),
and  except to the  extent  that a Court  under  Section  7(d) or an  arbitrator
appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine to permit an offset in respect of a
violation by the Executive of his obligations under Section 7, the

<PAGE>
Company's  obligation  to  make  the  payments  provided  for in this  Agreement
and otherwise to perform its obligations  hereunder shall not be affected by any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which
the Company  may have  against the  Executive  or others.  In no event shall the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

     (b) Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section 7(c), nothing
in the  Agreement  shall prevent or limit the  Executive's  continuing or future
participation in any plan,  program,  policy or practice provided by the Company
or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.  Vested
benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to receive
under the incentive  compensation plans referred to in Section 3(b) and (c), the
SERPs, or any other plan,  policy,  practice of program of the Company or any of
its affiliated companies on or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

     9. Disputes
        --------

     Except with respect to equitable  relief  provided for in Section 7(d), any
dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged violation of this
Agreement  shall be  resolved by  confidential  binding  arbitration  before one
arbitrator to be held in Newark,  New Jersey in accordance  with the  Employment
Dispute Resolution Rules of the American Arbitration  Association and the United
States  Arbitration Act.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may
be entered in any court having  jurisdiction  thereover.  All costs and expenses
incurred by the Company or the  Executive or the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in
connection with any such controversy or dispute,  including  without  limitation
reasonable  attorney's fees,  shall be borne by the Company as incurred,  except
that the Executive shall be responsible for any such costs and expenses incurred
in connection  with any claim  determined by the arbitrator to have been without
reasonable  basis or to have been brought in bad faith.  The Executive  shall be
entitled to interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872
(f) (2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), on any
delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator  determine he was entitled to under this
Agreement.

     10. Successors.
         ----------

     (a) No Assignment by Executive. This Agreement is personal to the Executive
and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be assignable by
the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and  distribution.
This  Agreement  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of and  be  enforceable  by the
Executive's legal representatives.

     (b) Successors to Enterprise.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.
<PAGE>


     (c)  Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will require any
successor  (whether direct or indirect,  by purchase,  merger,  consolidation or
otherwise)  to  all  or  substantially  all of the  business  and/or  assets  of
Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this  Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that Enterprise would be required to perform it if
no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,  "Enterprise"
shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business
and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

     11. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.
         -------------------------------------------

     (a)  Anything in this  Agreement to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  in the
event it shall be determined  that any payment or distribution by the Company to
or for the benefit of the Executive  (whether paid or payable or  distributed or
distributable  pursuant  to the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section
11) (a "Payment")  would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of
the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect
to such  excise  tax (such  excise  tax,  together  with any such  interest  and
penalties,  are hereinafter  collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive  shall be entitled to receive an  additional  payment (a "Gross-Up
Payment")  in an amount such that after  payment by the  Executive  of all taxes
(including  any  interest or  penalties  imposed  with  respect to such  taxes),
including, without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any interest
and  penalties  imposed  with  respect  thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment,  the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal
to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 11(c), all determinations required
to be made under this Section 11, including  whether and when a Gross-Up Payment
is required and the amount of such Gross-Up  Payment and the  assumptions  to be
utilized  in  arriving  at such  determination,  shall be made by the  Company's
independent  auditors or such other certified  public  accounting firm as may be
jointly  designated by the Executive  and the Company (the  "Accounting  Firm"),
which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the
Executive. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by
the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment,  as determined  pursuant to this Section 11,
shall be paid by the Company to the  Executive  within 15 days of the receipt of
the Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm
shall be  binding  upon  the  Company  and the  Executive.  As a  result  of the
uncertainty  in the  application  of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the
initial  determination  by the Accounting  Firm  hereunder,  it is possible that
Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the  calculations  required to be made
hereunder.  In the event that the  Company  exhausts  its  remedies  pursuant to
Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is required to make a payment of any
Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall  determine the amount of the  Underpayment
that has  occurred  and any such  Underpayment  shall  be  promptly  paid by the
Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.
<PAGE>


     (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the
Internal  Revenue Service that, if successful,  would require the payment by the
Company of the Gross-Up  Payment.  Such  notification  shall be given as soon as
practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed
in  writing of such claim and shall  apprise  the  Company of the nature of such
claim and the date on which such claim is  requested to be paid.  The  Executive
shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period  following
the date on which he gives such notice to the Company  (or such  shorter  period
ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).
If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such
period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

          (i) give the  Company  any  information  reasonably  requested  by the
     Company relating to such claim,

          (ii) take such action in connection  with contesting such claim as the
     Company shall reasonably  request in writing from time to time,  including,
     without  limitation,  accepting legal  representation  with respect to such
     claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

          (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to
     contest such claim, and

          (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings  relating to
     such claim;

provided  however,  that  the Company  shall  bear  and pay  directly  all costs
and  expenses   (including   additional  interest  and  penalties)  incurred  in
connection  with  such  contest  and  shall  indemnify  and hold  the  Executive
harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  for any Excise Tax or income tax  (including
interest  and  penalties  with  respect  thereto)  imposed  as a result  of such
representation  and payment of costs and  expenses.  Without  limitation  on the
foregoing  provisions  of this  Section  11(c),  the Company  shall  control all
proceedings  taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option,  may
pursue or forgo any and all administrative  appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and
conferences  with the taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its
sole option,  either  direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a
refund or contest the claim in any permissible  manner, and the Executive agrees
to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal,
in a court of initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the
Company  shall  determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company  directs the
Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company shall advance the
amount of such payment to the  Executive,  on an  interest-free  basis and shall
indemnify  and hold the  Executive  harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  from any
Excise Tax or income tax (including  interest or penalties with respect thereto)
imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed  income with
respect to such advance;  and further provided that any extension of the statute
of  limitations  relating  to  payment  of  taxes  for the  taxable  year of the
Executive  with respect to which such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is
limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's control of
the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a  Gross-Up Payment

<PAGE>


would  be  payable  hereunder  and  the Executive shall be entitled to settle or
contest,  as the case may be, any other  issue  raised by the  Internal  Revenue
Service or any other taxing authority.

     (d) If,  after the receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced by the
Company pursuant to Section 11(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the  requirements  of Section 11(c))  promptly pay to the Company
the amount of such refund  (together with any interest paid or credited  thereon
after taxes  applicable  thereto).  If, after the receipt by the Executive of an
amount  advanced by the Company  pursuant to Section 11(c), a  determination  is
made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such
claim and the Company does not notify the  Executive in writing of its intent to
contest  such  denial of refund  prior to the  expiration  of 30 days after such
determination,  then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


     AGREEMENT,  by and between Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated,  a
New Jersey  Corporation  ("Enterprise")  and Robert E. Busch (the  "Executive"),
dated as of April 24, 2001.

     WHEREAS,  the Executive is to be employed as President and Chief  Operating
Officer  of  PSEG  Services   Corporation,   a  New  Jersey  Corporation  and  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Enterprise  (Enterprise  and its  subsidiaries  and
affiliates being collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Company"); and

     WHEREAS, in consideration of the substantial benefits to be provided by the
Company  pursuant to this Agreement,  the Executive is willing to commit himself
to be employed by the Company on the terms and conditions herein set forth; and

     WHEREAS,  the parties desire to enter into this Agreement setting forth the
terms and conditions for the employment  relationship  of the Executive with the
Company during the Employment Period (as hereinafter defined):

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  IN CONSIDERATION  of the mutual  premises,  covenants and
agreements set forth below, it is hereby agreed as follows:

     1. General.

     (a)  Employment.  The  Company  agrees to  employ  the  Executive,  and the
Executive agrees to be employed by the Company, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement during the Employment Period.

     (b) Term. The term of the Executive's  employment under this Agreement (the
"Employment Period") shall commence as of the date hereof (the "Effective Date")
and shall  continue until the fifth  anniversary  of the Effective  Date. In the
event a Change in Control occurs during the Employment  Period,  the term of the
Executive's  employment shall (unless  terminated  earlier pursuant to Section 4
hereof) automatically continue until the later of the last day of the Employment
Period or the second  anniversary  of the Change in  Control.  In the event this
Agreement  is extended as provided in the  preceding  sentence,  the  Employment
Period shall be the period from the Effective Date to the second  anniversary of
the Change in Control.

     2. Position and Attention to Duties.

     (a) Position.  During the Employment  Period,  the Executive shall serve as
President and Chief Operating Officer of PSEG Services Corporation or in another
senior  executive  position or positions  for the Company,  as determined by the
Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Board of Directors ("Board") of Enterprise.

     (b) Attention.  During the Employment  Period, and excluding any periods of
vacation and sick leave to which the Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees
to devote full  attention and time during normal  business hours to the business
and  affairs of the Company and to use his  reasonable  best  efforts to perform
such  responsibilities in a professional  manner. It shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (i) serve on corporate,  civic or charitable
boards or committees,  (ii) deliver  lectures,  fulfill speaking  engagements or
teach at educational institutions and (iii) manage personal investments, so long
as such  activities do not interfere  with the  performance  of the  Executive's
responsibilities  as an officer and director of the Company in  accordance  with
this Agreement.

     3. Compensation.

     Except as modified by this Agreement, the Executive's compensation shall be
provided in accordance  with the  Company's  standard  compensation  and payroll
practices as in effect from time to time.  The aggregate of Base Salary,  Annual
Incentive  Compensation and Long-Term  Incentives in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)
below shall be  determined  based upon  competitive  practices  for companies of
comparable size and standing.

     (a) Base Salary.  The annual rate of base salary  payable to the  Executive
during the Employment  Period (the "Annual Base Salary") shall be established by
the  Organization  and  Compensation  Committee of the Board (the  "Compensation
Committee").  During the  Employment  Period,  the Annual Base  Salary  shall be
reviewed by the Compensation  Committee for possible increase at least annually.
Annual Base Salary  shall not be reduced,  and after any such  increase  and the
term "Annual Base Salary" shall thereafter refer to the Annual Base Salary as so
increased.

     (b) Annual Incentive Compensation. The Board has established and intends to
continue an annual incentive  compensation  plan for the benefit of the officers
and other key  employees  of the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based on
competitive  practices  for  companies  of  comparable  size and  standing.  The
performance  objectives  for the Executive in respect of such  incentive will be
determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with past practices.

     (c) Long-Term Incentives. The Board has established and intends to continue
a  long-term  incentive  plan for the  benefit  of the  officers  and  other key
employees  of  the  Company,  including  the  Executive,  based  on  competitive
practices for companies of comparable  size and standing.  Such plan may, in the
judgment  of the  Compensation  Committee,  provide  for  stock  options,  stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units, performance stock or units
and/or other type of long-term  incentive awards.  The type and amount of equity
and any other long-term  incentive grants will be determined by the Compensation
Committee  from time to time,  and  awards  thereunder  shall be  payable to the
Executive in  accordance  with the long-term  incentive  plan or plans in effect
from time to time.

     (d) Option Award.

          (i) In  consideration  of the  commitment  he will  assume  during the
     Employment  Period,  the  Executive  shall be granted an award (the "Option
     Award") of non-qualified  options under the Enterprise  Long-Term Incentive
     Plan  ("LTIP")  to  purchase  250,000  shares of the Common  Stock  without
     nominal or par value of  Enterprise  ("Stock").  Options  granted under the
     Option Award are herein  referred to as  "Options".  The grant price of the
     Options  shall be the  closing  price of the  Common  Stock on the New York
     Stock Exchange on the Effective Date. The  Executive's  right to the Option
     Award shall vest and become  exercisable  in accordance  with the following
     schedule, provided that the Executive has remained continuously employed by
     the Company during the Employment Period through the dates indicated below:

                Anniversary of Effective Date            Number of Shares
                -----------------------------            ----------------
                           First                              50,000
                           Second                             50,000
                           Third                              50,000
                           Fourth                             50,000
                           Fifth                              50,000


If,  during  the  Employment  Period (1)  there  occurs a Change in Control,  or
(2) Enterprise  enters into an agreement to merge or consolidate  with any other
corporation  which, if consummated,  would meet the requirements of Section 6(b)
(iii) and the  shareholders  of Enterprise  approve that  agreement,  the entire
Option  Award  shall  vest and become  exercisable.  If,  during the  Employment
Period, the Company  terminates the Executive's  employment without Cause or the
Executive  terminates  his  employment  for  Good  Reason,  or  the  Executive's
Employment terminates by reason of death or Disability, the Executive's right to
the entire  Option  Award  shall vest and become  exercisable  as of the Date of
Termination.  If,  during the  Employment  Period,  the Company  terminates  the
Executive's  employment  for Cause or the Executive  terminates  his  employment
without Good Reason, including Retirement, the Executive shall forfeit all right
to all  shares  of the  Option  Award  that  are not  vested  as of the  Date of
Termination.

          (ii) The Options shall expire ten (10) years after the Effective Date.


          (iii)Once  Options  become  exercisable  hereunder,  the Executive may
     exercise  such  Options in any  manner  permitted  by the LTIP.  All vested
     options  shall be exercised or shall be forfeited no later than the earlier
     of three  years  after  termination  of  employment  or 10 years  after the
     Effective Date.

          (iv) Unless  specifically  provided by this  Agreement,  all terms and
     conditions of the Options granted hereunder shall be governed by the LTIP.

          (v) The Compensation  Committee may make such provisions and take such
     steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of any
     taxes that the Company is required by law or regulation of any governmental
     authority,  whether  federal,  state or  local,  domestic  or  foreign,  to
     withhold in connection with the Option Award, including, but not limited to
     (1)  withholding  delivery of the certificate for shares of Stock until the
     Executive  reimburses the Company for the amount it is required to withhold
     with  respect to such taxes,  (2) the  canceling of any number of shares of
     Stock  issuable to the  Executive in an amount  necessary to reimburse  the
     Company for the amount it is required to so  withhold,  or (3)  withholding
     the amount due from the Executive's other compensation.

               (e) Employee Benefit Programs.  During the Employment Period, (i)
          the  Executive  shall be  eligible to  participate  in all savings and
          retirement plans, practices,  policies and programs to the same extent
          as other senior  executives of the Company with a similar date of hire
          (presently  called  "Benefits 2000") and (ii) the Executive and/or the
          Executive's  family,  as the  case  may  be,  shall  be  eligible  for
          participation  in and shall receive all benefits under welfare benefit
          plans, practices, policies and programs provided by the Company (other
          than severance  plans,  practices,  policies and programs)  including,
          without limitation, medical, prescription,  dental, disability, salary
          continuance, employee life insurance, group life insurance, accidental
          death and travel  accident  insurance  plans and  programs,  and, upon
          retirement, all applicable retirement benefit plans to the same extent
          and subject to the same terms, conditions,  cost-sharing  requirements
          and the like, as other senior executives of the Company with a similar
          date of hire,  as such plans may be amended from time to time,  and as
          supplemented  hereby.  Following  a  Change  in  Control,  no  benefit
          coverage  available  to the  Executive  and/or to his family under any
          such plan,  practice,  policy or program shall be  materially  reduced
          without the prior written consent of the Executive.

               (f)  Retirement  Benefit.   During  the  Employment  Period,  the
          Executive shall participate in Enterprise's  Pension Plan, and also in
          Enterprise's Limited Supplemental Benefits Plan, Mid-Career Hire Plan,
          Reinstatement  Plan and such other supplemental  executive  retirement
          plans as may be adopted  and amended by  Enterprise  from time to time
          ("SERPs"),  such that the aggregate  value of the retirement  benefits
          that he and his  beneficiaries  will receive under all pension benefit
          plans of the Company (whether  qualified or not) will not be less than
          the benefits he would have received had he continued to participate in
          such plans,  as in effect  immediately  before the date hereof through
          the earlier of the end of the Employment  Period or  Retirement.  Upon
          execution  of this  Agreement,  the  Executive  shall be  entitled  to
          additional service credit of 15 years. Further, the Executive shall be
          entitled to an additional  five years of service  credit if he retires
          between  ages 60 and 65. It is agreed  that the  Option  Award and any
          dividends or other  distributions in respect of the Option Award shall
          not be included in any pension  calculation.  The Executive's right to
          retire   shall   be   governed   by  the   Enterprise   Pension   Plan
          ("Retirement").

               (g) Expenses.  The  Executive is  authorized to incur  reasonable
          expenses in carrying  out his duties and  responsibilities  under this
          Agreement.  The  Company  shall  promptly  reimburse  him for all such
          expenses in accordance with the policies of the Company in effect from
          time to time for reimbursement of expenses for senior executives,  and
          subject to documentation  provided by the Executive in accordance with
          such Company policies.

               (h) Fringe Benefits.  During the Employment Period, the Executive
          shall participate in all fringe benefits and perquisites  available to
          senior executives of the Company, including provision of an automobile
          and  financial   counseling,   on  terms  and   conditions   that  are
          commensurate with his positions and responsibilities at the Company.

               (i) Vacation.  During the Employment  Period, the Executive shall
          be entitled to paid vacation in accordance with Company policy for its
          most senior  executives  as in effect from time to time, or four weeks
          vacation, whichever is greater.

               (j) Deferred  Compensation.  The Executive will retain all of his
          rights  in any  compensation  deferred  prior  to the date  hereof  in
          accordance with the Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  including  earnings
          thereon,  and following the date hereof the obligations of the Company
          to pay such  deferred  compensation  at the  times  and in the  manner
          specified in the Deferred Compensation Plan will continue.


     4. Termination of Employment.


     (a)  Death  or  Disability.  The  Executive's  employment  shall  terminate
automatically  upon the Executive's  death during the Employment  Period. If the
Company  determines  in good  faith that the  Disability  of the  Executive  has
occurred during the Employment  Period (pursuant to the definition of Disability
set forth below), it may give to the Executive written notice in accordance with
Section 4(b) of this  Agreement of its  intention to terminate  the  Executive's
employment.  In such event,  the  Executive's  employment with the Company shall
terminate  effective  on the  30th  day  after  receipt  of such  notice  by the
Executive (the "Disability  Effective Date"),  provided that, within the 30 days
after  such  receipt,  the  Executive  shall  not  have  returned  to  full-time
performance  of  the  Executive's   duties.  For  purposes  of  this  Agreement,
"Disability"  means that (i) the Executive has been unable,  for the period,  if
any, specified in the Company's  disability plan for senior executives,  but not
less than a period of 180 consecutive  days, to perform the  Executive's  duties
under  this  Agreement  and (ii) a  physician  selected  by the  Company  or its
insurers,   and   acceptable   to  the  Executive  or  the   Executive's   legal
representative, has determined that the Executive is disabled within the meaning
of the applicable Pension Plan.

     (b) By the Company.

     (i) The  Company  may  terminate  the  Executive's  employment  during  the
Employment  Period for Cause or without Cause.  For purposes of this  Agreement,
"Cause"  shall  mean (A)  willful  and  continued  failure by the  Executive  to
substantially perform his duties under this Agreement,  (B) the willful engaging
by the  Executive  in gross  misconduct  which is  materially  and  demonstrably
injurious to the Company, or (C) the conviction of the Executive of a felony. No
act or failure to act on the part of the Executive shall be considered "willful"
unless it is done,  or  omitted  to be done,  by the  Executive  in bad faith or
without  reasonable  belief that the  Executive's  action or omission was in the
best  interests  of the  Company.  Any act or  failure to act that is based upon
authority  given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors
of the Company, or the advice of counsel for the Company,  shall be conclusively
presumed to be done,  or omitted to be done,  by the Executive in good faith and
in the best interests of the Company.

     (ii) A  termination  of the  Executive's  employment  for  Cause  shall  be
effected in accordance with the following procedures. The Company shall give the
Executive written notice ("Notice of Termination for Cause") of its intention to
terminate  the  Executive's  employment  for Cause,  setting forth in reasonable
detail the specific  conduct of the  Executive  that it considers to  constitute
Cause and the specific  provision(s) of this Agreement on which it relies.  Such
notice  shall be given no later than 60 days  after the act or  failure  (or the
last in a series of acts or  failures)  that the Company  alleges to  constitute
Cause.  The  Executive  shall  have  30  days  after  receiving  the  Notice  of
Termination  for Cause in which to cure such act or failure,  to the extent such
cure is possible.  In the case of a  termination  under  Section  4(b)(i)(A)  or
Section  4(b)(i)(B),  if the Executive  fails to cure such act or failure to the
reasonable  satisfaction of the Company,  the Company shall give the Executive a
second written  notice stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board,  the
Executive is guilty of the conduct  described in the Notice of  Termination  for
Cause and that such conduct constitutes Cause under this Agreement.

     (iii) A termination of the  Executive's  employment  without Cause shall be
effected by the Company  providing the Executive  with at least 30 days' written
notice of such termination.

     (c) Good Reason.

     (i) The Executive may terminate his employment during the Employment Period
for Good Reason or without Good  Reason.  For purpose of this  Agreement,  "Good
Reason" shall mean:

     (A) prior to the  occurrence  of a Change in Control,  any reduction in the
Executive's Annual Base Salary;


     (B) following a Change in Control:


          (1) any reduction in the Executive's Annual Base Salary, target annual
     bonus,  target  long-term  incentive  below the market norm,  or Retirement
     benefit;

          (2) any adverse change in the Executive's  title,  authority,  duties,
     responsibilities  and reporting lines or the assignment to the Executive of
     any  duties or  responsibilities  inconsistent  in any  respect  with those
     customarily associated with the position of the Executive immediately prior
     to the Change in Control;

          (3) any purported  termination  of the  Executive's  employment by the
     Company  for a  reason  or in a  manner  not  expressly  permitted  by this
     Agreement;

          (4) any failure by  Enterprise  to comply with  Section  10(c) of this
     Agreement; or

          (5) any other  material  breach of this  Agreement by the Company that
     either is not taken in good faith or, even if taken in good  faith,  is not
     remedied by the Company  promptly  after receipt of notice thereof from the
     Executive.

     Following  a  Change  in Control,  the  Executive's  determination  that an
     act or  failure  to act  constitutes  Good  Reason  shall  be  conclusively
     presumed  to  be  valid  unless  such   determination   is  decided  to  be
     unreasonable by an arbitrator pursuant to Section 9.

     (ii) A termination  of employment by the Executive for Good Reason shall be
effectuated  by giving the Company  written notice  ("Notice of Termination  for
Good  Reason")  of the  termination,  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail  the
specific  acts or omissions of the Company that  constitute  Good Reason and the
specific  provision(s) of this Agreement on which the Executive  relies.  Unless
the CEO determines  otherwise,  a Notice of  Termination  for Good Reason by the
Executive  must be made  within 60 days  after the  Executive  first has  actual
knowledge of the act or omission (or the last in a series of acts or  omissions)
that the Executive alleges to constitute Good Reason, and the Company shall have
30 days from the receipt of such Notice of  Termination  for Good Reason to cure
the conduct cited therein. A termination of employment by the Executive for Good
Reason  shall be  effective  on the final day of such 30-day cure period  unless
prior to such time the Company has cured the  specific  conduct  asserted by the
Executive  to  constitute  Good  Reason to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the
Executive.

     (iii) A termination of the Executive's  employment by the Executive without
Good Reason,  including  Retirement,  shall be effected by giving the Company at
least 30 days' written notice specifying the effective date of termination.

     (d) Date of Termination.  The "Date of  Termination"  means the date of the
Executive's  death,  the  Disability  Effective  Date,  or the date on which the
termination  of the  Executive's  employment by the Company for Cause or without
Cause or by the  Executive  for Good Reason or without  Good  Reason,  including
Retirement, is effective, as the case may be.


     5. Obligations of the Company upon Termination.

     (a) Good Reason;  Other Than for Cause.  If, during the Employment  Period,
the Company shall  terminate the  Executive's  employment  other than for Cause,
death or Disability,  or the Executive  shall  terminate his employment for Good
Reason:

          (1)  the   Executive's   Annual  Base  Salary   through  the  Date  of
     Termination;

          (2) the product of (x) the "target"  annual  bonus under  Section 3(b)
     (the  "Target  Bonus") and (y) a fraction,  the  numerator  of which is the
     number  of  days  in  the  current   calendar  year  through  the  Date  of
     Termination, and the denominator of which is 365; and

          (3) any accrued vacation pay;

     in  each  case  to the  extent  not  theretofore   paid   (the  sum of  the
     amounts described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) shall be hereinafter referred
     to as the "Accrued Obligations"); and

     B. the  amount  equal  to  the  product of (1)  two  and (2) the sum of (x)
     the Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus.


     (ii) the Option Award shall vest in accordance with Section 3(d)(i);

     (iii) any stock awards,  stock options,  other than the Option Award, stock

and/or become  exercisable in accordance with the underlying plan for such Prior
Equity Award;

     (iv) for two years after the Executive's Date of Termination or such longer
period  as may be  provided  by the  terms  of the  appropriate  plan,  program,
practice or policy,  the Company shall continue benefits to the Executive and/or
the Executive's family at least equal to those which would have been provided to
them in  accordance  with the welfare  plans,  programs,  practices and policies
described in Section 3(e) of this  Agreement if the  Executive's  employment had
not been  terminated  or,  if more  favorable  to the  Executive,  as in  effect
generally at any time  thereafter  with respect to other peer  executives of the
Company and its affiliated companies and their families,  provided however, that
if the Executive  becomes  reemployed  with another  employer and is eligible to
receive  medical or dental  benefits under another  employer  provided plan, the
medical  and  dental  benefits  described  herein  shall be  secondary  to those
provided under such other plan during such applicable period of eligibility;

     (v)  any  compensation  previously  deferred  (other  than  pursuant  to  a
tax-qualified  plan) by or on behalf of the Executive (together with any accrued
interest or earnings thereon),  whether or not then vested,  shall become vested
on the Date of Termination and shall be paid in accordance with the terms of the
plan, policy or practice under which it was deferred;

     (vi) the  Company  shall,  at its sole  expense as  incurred,  provide  the
Executive with outplacement  services suitable to the Executive's position for a

companies  (other than medical or dental  benefits if the  Executive is eligible
for such benefits to be provided by a subsequent employer), including earned but
unpaid stock and similar compensation but excluding any severance plan or policy
(such other amounts and benefits shall be hereinafter  referred to as the "Other
Benefits").

          (b) Cause;  Other than for Good Reason. If the Executive's  employment
     shall be  terminated  for Cause  during the  Employment  Period,  or if the
     Executive  voluntarily  terminates employment during the Employment Period,
     excluding a resignation for Good Reason,  the Company shall have no further
     payment  obligations to the Executive  other than for amounts  described in
     Sections   5(a)(i)(A)(1)  and  5(a)(i)(A)(3)  and  the  timely  payment  or
     provision of Other  Benefits.  In such case, all such amounts shall be paid
     to the  Executive in a lump sum within 30 days of the Date of  Termination.
     Any unvested  portion of the Option Award shall be forfeited in  accordance
     with Section 3(d)(i).

          (c) Death. If the Executive's  employment  terminates by reason of the
     Executive's death during the Employment Period, all Accrued  Obligations as
     of  the  time  of  death  shall  be  paid  to  the  Executive's  estate  or
     beneficiary,  as  applicable,  in a lump sum in cash  within 30 days of the
     Date of Termination  and the  Executive's  estate or  beneficiary  shall be
     entitled to any Other Benefits in accordance with their terms. In addition,
     the Option Award shall vest in accordance with Section  3(d)(i).  Any Prior
     Equity Awards shall vest and/or become exercisable,  as the case may be, as
     of the Date of Termination  and the Executive's  estate or beneficiary,  as
     the case may be,  shall have the right to exercise  any such stock  option,
     stock appreciation right or other exercisable  equity-based award until the
     earlier of (A) one year from the Date of Termination (or such longer period
     as may be  provided  under  the  terms  of any  such  stock  option,  stock
     appreciation  right  or  other  equity-based  award)  and  (B)  the  normal
     expiration  date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or other
     equity-based award.

          (d) Disability.  If the Executive's employment is terminated by reason
     of Disability during the Employment Period,  all Accrued  Obligations shall
     be paid to the  Executive  in a lump sum in cash within 30 days of the Date
     of  Termination,  and the Executive shall be entitled to any Other Benefits
     in accordance with their terms. In addition, the Option Award shall vest in
     accordance  with  Section  3(d)(i).  Any Prior  Equity  Awards  shall  vest
     immediately  and/or  become  exercisable,  as the  case  may  be,  and  the
     Executive  shall have the right to exercise  any such stock  option,  stock
     appreciation  right or  other  exercisable  equity-based  award  until  the
     earlier of (A) one year from the Date of Termination (or such longer period
     as may be  provided  under  the  terms  of any  such  stock  option,  stock
     appreciation  right  or  other  equity-based  award)  and  (B)  the  normal
     expiration  date of such stock option,  stock  appreciation  right or other
     equity-based award.

          (e) Retirement.  If the Executive's  employment terminates as a result
     of  Retirement,  the Executive  shall be paid the Accrued  Obligations in a
     lump  sum in  cash  within  30  days of the  Date  of  Termination  and the
     Executive  shall be entitled to any Other Benefits in accordance with their
     terms. Any remaining portion of the Option Award shall vest or be forfeited
     in accordance with Section 3(d)(i).


     6. Change in Control.

     (a)  Benefits  Upon a Change in  Control.  The  Executive's  rights  upon a
termination of employment that occurs  following a Change in Control shall be as
specified in Section 5 generally for  termination of employment,  except (i) the
amount  payable  under  5(a)(i)(B)  shall  be  three  times  the  sum of (x) the
Executive's Annual Base Salary and (y) the Target Bonus; (ii) the benefits under
Section 5(a)(iv) shall be provided for three years after the Date of Termination
and the  Executive's  eligibility  (but  not the  time of  commencement  of such
benefits) for retiree benefits pursuant to such plans,  practices,  programs and
policies  shall be determined as if the  Executive had remained  employed  until
three years after the Date of Termination and to have retired on the last day of
such period; (iii) the Option Award shall have vested in accordance with Section
3(d)(i);  and (iv) the Executive  shall be paid within 15 days after the Date of
Termination, an amount equal to the excess of


          (A) the  actuarial  equivalent  of the  benefit  under  the  Company's
     applicable qualified defined benefit retirement plan in which the Executive
     is  participating  immediately  prior  to  his  Date  of  Termination  (the
     "Retirement  Plan") (utilizing the rate used to determine lump sums and, to
     the extent applicable, other actuarial assumptions no less favorable to the
     Executive than those in effect under the Retirement Plan immediately  prior
     to  the  Date  of  this  Agreement),  any  SERPs  in  which  the  Executive
     participates  and,  to the extent  applicable,  any other  defined  benefit
     retirement  arrangement  between  the  Executive  and the  Company  ("Other
     Pension  Benefits")  which the Executive  would receive if the  Executive's
     employment  continued  for  three  additional  years  beyond  the  Date  of
     Termination,  assuming for this purpose that all accrued benefits are fully
     vested,  and,  assuming that the Executive's  compensation  for such deemed
     additional  period  was the  Executive's  Annual  Base  Salary as in effect
     immediately  prior to the Date of Termination  and assuming a bonus in each
     year during such deemed additional period equal to the Target Bonus, over

          (B) the actuarial  equivalent of the Executive's  actual benefit (paid
     or payable), if any, under the Retirement Plan, the SERPs and Other Pension
     Benefits  as of the  Date  of  Termination  (utilizing  the  rate  used  to
     determine  lump  sums  and,  to  the  extent  applicable,  other  actuarial
     assumptions  no less  favorable to the Executive than those in effect under
     the Retirement Plan immediately prior to the date of this Agreement).

     (b) Definition. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall
mean  the  occurrence  of any of the  following  events  after  the date of this
Agreement:

     (i) any  "person"  (within the meaning of Section  13(d) of the  Securities
Exchange  Act of  1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange  Act") is or  becomes  the
beneficial  owner  within the  meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the  Exchange  Act (a
"Beneficial  Owner"),  directly or indirectly,  of securities of Enterprise (not
including in the  securities  beneficially  owned by such person any  securities
acquired directly from Enterprise or its affiliates) representing 25% or more of
the combined voting power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities, excluding
any person who becomes such a Beneficial  Owner in connection with a transaction
described in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

     (ii) the  following  individuals  cease  for any  reason  to  constitute  a
majority of the number of directors of Enterprise then serving: individuals who,
on the date of this Agreement,  constitute the Board and any new director (other
than a director  whose initial  assumption  of office is in  connection  with an
actual or threatened  election  contest,  including but not limited to a consent
solicitation,  relating  to the  election  of  directors  of  Enterprise)  whose
appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by  Enterprise's
stockholders  was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3)
of the  directors  then still in office who either  were  directors  on the date
hereof or whose appointment,  election or nomination for election was previously
so approved or recommended; or

     (iii) there is consummated a merger or  consolidation  of Enterprise or any
direct  or  indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Enterprise  with  any  other
corporation,  other than (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in the
voting securities of Enterprise outstanding  immediately prior to such merger or
consolidation  continuing to represent  (either by remaining  outstanding  or by
being  converted  into voting  securities of the surviving  entity or any parent
thereof),  in combination  with the ownership of any trustee or other  fiduciary
holding  securities  under  an  employee  benefit  plan  of  Enterprise  or  any
subsidiary  of  Enterprise,  at least 75% of the  combined  voting  power of the
securities  of  Enterprise  or  such  surviving  entity  or any  parent  thereof
outstanding  immediately after such merger or consolidation,  or (B) a merger or
consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of Enterprise (or similar
transaction) in which no person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner,  directly or
indirectly, of securities of Enterprise representing 25% or more of the combined
voting power of Enterprise's then outstanding securities; or

     (iv) the shareholders of Enterprise approve a plan of complete  liquidation
or  dissolution  of Enterprise or there is consummated an agreement for the sale
or disposition by Enterprise of all or substantially all of Enterprise's assets,
other than a sale or  disposition by Enterprise of all or  substantially  all of
Enterprise's  assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the combined voting power of
the  voting  securities  of which are owned by  stockholders  of  Enterprise  in
substantially the same proportions as their ownership of Enterprise  immediately
prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding  the  foregoing, a  "Change in Control" shall  not  be deemed to
have  occurred by virtue of the  consummation  of any  transaction  or series of
integrated  transactions  immediately  following which the record holders of the
common stock of Enterprise  immediately  prior to such  transaction or series of
transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate  ownership in
an entity  which  owns all or  substantially  all of the  assets  of  Enterprise
immediately following such transaction or series of transactions.

     7. Confidential Information; No Competition.

     (a) The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the
Company all confidential information, knowledge or data (defined below) relating
to the Company or any of its affiliates or  subsidiaries,  and their  respective
businesses,  which  shall  have  been  obtained  by  the  Executive  during  the
Executive's  employment  by the Company or any of its  affiliated  companies and
which  shall  not be or  become  public  knowledge  (other  than  by acts by the
Executive or  representatives  of the Executive in violation of this Agreement).
Upon Termination of the Executive's  employment,  he shall return to the Company
all Company  information.  After termination of the Executive's  employment with
the Company,  the Executive shall not,  without the prior written consent of the
Company or as may otherwise be required by law or legal process,  communicate or
divulge any such information, knowledge or data to anyone other than the Company
and those designated by it, except (x) otherwise publicly available information,
or (y) as may be  necessary  to enforce  his  rights  under  this  Agreement  or
necessary to defend himself  against a claim asserted  directly or indirectly by
the Company or its affiliates. Unless and until a determination has been made in
accordance with Section 7(d) or Section 9 hereof that the Executive has violated
this Section 7, an asserted  violation of the provisions of this Section 7 shall
not  constitute  a basis for  deferring  or  withholding  any amounts  otherwise
payable to the Executive under this Agreement.

     (b) As used herein, the term "confidential information,  knowledge or data"
means all trade  secrets,  proprietary  and  confidential  business  information
belonging  to,  used  by,  or in the  possession  of the  Company  or any of its
affiliates and subsidiaries, including but not limited to information, knowledge
or data  related  to  business  strategies,  plans  and  financial  information,
mergers, acquisitions or consolidations,  purchase or sale of property, leasing,
pricing, sales programs or tactics, actual or past sellers, purchasers, lessees,
lessors  or  customers,  those  with  whom the  Company  or its  affiliates  and
subsidiaries  has  begun   negotiations  for  new  business,   costs,   employee
compensation,  marketing  and  development  plans,  inventions  and  technology,
whether such  confidential  information,  knowledge or data is oral,  written or
electronically  recorded or stored,  except  information  in the public  domain,
information  known by the Executive  prior to employment  with the Company,  and
information received by the Executive from sources other than the Company or its
affiliates and subsidiaries, without obligation of confidentiality.

     (c) The  confidential  knowledge,  information  and data, as defined in the
previous  paragraph,  gained  in  the  performance  of  the  Executive's  duties
hereunder may be valuable to those who are now, or might become,  competitors of
the Company or its  affiliates  and  subsidiaries.  Accordingly,  the  Executive
agrees that,  without the written  consent of  Enterprise,  he will not, for the
period of one year from Date of  Termination  or  completion  of the  Employment
Period,  whichever occurs first, directly own, manage,  operate,  join, control,
become employed by, consult to or participate in the ownership,  management,  or
control of any business which is in direct  competition  with the Company and/or
its affiliates and  subsidiaries.  Further,  the Executive  agrees that, for two
years  following the Date of Termination,  he will not,  directly or indirectly,
solicit or hire, or encourage the solicitation or hiring of any person who was a
managerial  or higher level  employee of the Company at any time during the term
of the  Executive's  employment  by the Company by any  employer  other than the
Company for any position as an employee,  independent contractor,  consultant or
otherwise.  The  foregoing  agreement  of the  Executive  shall not apply to any
person after 6 months have elapsed subsequent to the date on which such person's
employment  by the Company has  terminated.  In the case of any such  prohibited
activity,  the  Executive  shall not be  entitled  to  post-employment  payments
(including any unexercised options under the Option Award).

     (d) In the event of a breach by the Executive of any of the  agreements set
forth in Paragraphs  (a), (b) or (c) above,  it is agreed that the Company shall
suffer  irreparable harm for which money damages are not an adequate remedy, and
that,  in the event of such breach,  the Company  shall be entitled to obtain an
order of a court of  competent  jurisdiction  for  equitable  relief  from  such
breach,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  temporary  restraining  orders  and
preliminary and/or permanent  injunctions  against the breach of such agreements
by the Executive. In the event that the Company should initiate any legal action
for the breach or enforcement of any of the provisions contained in this Section
7 and the Company does not prevail in such action,  the Company  shall  promptly
reimburse  the  Executive  the full  amount of any  court  costs,  filing  fees,
attorney's  fees which the Executive  incurs in defending  such action,  and any
loss of income during the period of such litigation.

     8. Full Settlement.


     (a) No Duty to Mitigate; No Reduction.  Except as provided in Section 7(c),
and  except to the  extent  that a Court  under  Section  7(d) or an  arbitrator
appointed  under  Section 9 shall  determine to permit an offset in respect of a
violation by the  Executive of his  obligations  under  Section 7, the Company's
obligation to make the payments  provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to
perform  its  obligations  hereunder  shall  not be  affected  by  any  set-off,
counterclaim,  recoupment,  defense or other  claim,  right or action  which the
Company  may have  against  the  Executive  or  others.  In no event  shall  the
Executive be obligated to seek other  employment or take any other action by way
of  mitigation  of  the  amounts  payable  to  the  Executive  under  any of the
provisions of this Agreement  and,  except as  specifically  provided in Section
5(a)(iv)  and  Section  5(a)(vii)  with  respect to certain  medical  and dental
benefits, such amounts shall not be reduced whether or not the Executive obtains
other employment.

     (b) Non-exclusivity of Rights.  Except as provided in Section 7(c), nothing
in the  Agreement  shall prevent or limit the  Executive's  continuing or future
participation in any plan,  program,  policy or practice provided by the Company
or any of its affiliated  companies for which the Executive may qualify.  Vested
benefits and other amounts that the  Executive is otherwise  entitled to receive
under the incentive  compensation  plans referred to in Section 3(c), the SERPs,
or any other  plan,  policy,  practice  of program of the  Company or any of its
affiliated  companies  on or after the Date of  Termination  shall be payable in
accordance with the terms of each such plan, policy, practice or program, as the
case may be, except as explicitly modified by this Agreement.

     9. Disputes.

     Except with respect to equitable  relief  provided for in Section 7(d), any
dispute about the validity, interpretation,  effect or alleged violation of this
Agreement  shall be  resolved by  confidential  binding  arbitration  before one
arbitrator to be held in Newark,  New Jersey in accordance  with the  Employment
Dispute Resolution Rules of the American Arbitration  Association and the United
States  Arbitration Act.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may
be entered in any court having  jurisdiction  thereover.  All costs and expenses
incurred by the Company or the  Executive or the  Executive's  beneficiaries  in
connection with any such controversy or dispute,  including  without  limitation
reasonable  attorney's fees,  shall be borne by the Company as incurred,  except
that the Executive shall be responsible for any such costs and expenses incurred
in connection  with any claim  determined by the arbitrator to have been without
reasonable  basis or to have been brought in bad faith.  The Executive  shall be
entitled to interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872
(f) (2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), on any
delayed  payment  which the  arbitrator  determine he was entitled to under this
Agreement.

     10. Successors.

     (a) No Assignment by Executive. This Agreement is personal to the Executive
and without the prior written  consent of Enterprise  shall not be assignable by
the Executive  otherwise  than by will or the laws of descent and  distribution.
This  Agreement  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of and  be  enforceable  by the
Executive's legal representatives.

     (b) Successors to Enterprise.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon Enterprise and its successors and assigns.

     (c)  Performance by a Successor to Enterprise.  Enterprise will require any
successor  (whether direct or indirect,  by purchase,  merger,  consolidation or
otherwise)  to  all  or  substantially  all of the  business  and/or  assets  of
Enterprise to assume  expressly and agree to perform this  Agreement in the same
manner and to the same extent that Enterprise would be required to perform it if
no such  succession  had taken place.  As used in this  Agreement,  "Enterprise"
shall mean Enterprise as hereinbefore  defined and any successor to its business
and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by
operation of law, or otherwise.

     11. Certain Additional Payments by the Company.

     (a)  Anything in this  Agreement to the  contrary  notwithstanding,  in the
event it shall be determined  that any payment or distribution by the Company to
or for the benefit of the Executive  (whether paid or payable or  distributed or
distributable  pursuant  to the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  but
determined without regard to any additional payments required under this Section
11) (a "Payment")  would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of
the Code or any interest or penalties are incurred by the Executive with respect
to such  excise  tax (such  excise  tax,  together  with any such  interest  and
penalties,  are hereinafter  collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then
the Executive  shall be entitled to receive an  additional  payment (a "Gross-Up
Payment")  in an amount such that after  payment by the  Executive  of all taxes
(including  any  interest or  penalties  imposed  with  respect to such  taxes),
including, without limitation, any income and employment taxes (and any interest
and  penalties  imposed  with  respect  thereto) and Excise Tax imposed upon the
Gross-Up Payment,  the Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal
to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.

     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 11(c), all determinations required
to be made under this Section 11, including  whether and when a Gross-Up Payment
is required and the amount of such Gross-Up  Payment and the  assumptions  to be
utilized  in  arriving  at such  determination,  shall be made by the  Company's
independent  auditors or such other certified  public  accounting firm as may be
jointly  designated by the Executive  and the Company (the  "Accounting  Firm"),
which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to the Company and the
Executive. All fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by
the Company.  Any Gross-Up Payment,  as determined  pursuant to this Section 11,
shall be paid by the Company to the  Executive  within 15 days of the receipt of
the Accounting  Firm's  determination.  Any determination by the Accounting Firm
shall be  binding  upon  the  Company  and the  Executive.  As a  result  of the
uncertainty  in the  application  of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the
initial  determination  by the Accounting  Firm  hereunder,  it is possible that
Gross-Up  Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been
made  ("Underpayment"),  consistent  with the  calculations  required to be made
hereunder.  In the event that the  Company  exhausts  its  remedies  pursuant to
Section 11(c) and the Executive  thereafter is required to make a payment of any
Excise Tax, the Accounting Firm shall  determine the amount of the  Underpayment
that has  occurred  and any such  Underpayment  shall  be  promptly  paid by the
Company to or for the benefit of the Executive.

     (c) The  Executive  shall notify the Company in writing of any claim by the
Internal  Revenue Service that, if successful,  would require the payment by the
Company of the Gross-Up  Payment.  Such  notification  shall be given as soon as
practicable  but no later than ten business days after the Executive is informed
in  writing of such claim and shall  apprise  the  Company of the nature of such
claim and the date on which such claim is  requested to be paid.  The  Executive
shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period  following
the date on which he gives such notice to the Company  (or such  shorter  period
ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due).
If the Company notifies the Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such
period that it desires to contest such claim, the Executive shall:

          (i) give the  Company  any  information  reasonably  requested  by the
     Company relating to such claim,

          (ii) take such action in connection  with contesting such claim as the
     Company shall reasonably  request in writing from time to time,  including,
     without  limitation,  accepting legal  representation  with respect to such
     claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

          (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to
     contest such claim, and

          (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings  relating to
     such claim;

provided   however,   that  the  Company  shall  bear and pay directly all costs
and  expenses   (including   additional  interest  and  penalties)  incurred  in
connection  with  such  contest  and  shall  indemnify  and hold  the  Executive
harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  for any Excise Tax or income tax  (including
interest  and  penalties  with  respect  thereto)  imposed  as a result  of such
representation  and payment of costs and  expenses.  Without  limitation  on the
foregoing  provisions  of this  Section  11(c),  the Company  shall  control all
proceedings  taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option,  may
pursue or forgo any and all administrative  appeals,  proceedings,  hearings and
conferences  with the taxing  authority in respect of such claim and may, at its
sole option,  either  direct the  Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a
refund or contest the claim in any permissible  manner, and the Executive agrees
to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal,
in a court of initial  jurisdiction and in one or more appellate  courts, as the
Company  shall  determine;  provided  however,  that if the Company  directs the
Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund,  the Company shall advance the
amount of such payment to the  Executive,  on an  interest-free  basis and shall
indemnify  and hold the  Executive  harmless,  on an after-tax  basis,  from any
Excise Tax or income tax (including  interest or penalties with respect thereto)
imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed  income with
respect to such advance;  and further provided that any extension of the statute
of  limitations  relating  to  payment  of  taxes  for the  taxable  year of the
Executive  with respect to which such  contested  amount is claimed to be due is
limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore,  the Company's control of
the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up  Payment
would be payable  hereunder  and the  Executive  shall be  entitled to settle or
contest,  as the case may be, any other  issue  raised by the  Internal  Revenue
Service or any other taxing authority.

     (d) If,  after the receipt by the  Executive  of an amount  advanced by the
Company pursuant to Section 11(c), the Executive becomes entitled to receive any
refund with respect to such claim, the Executive shall (subject to the Company's
complying with the  requirements  of Section 11(c))  promptly pay to the Company
the amount of such refund  (together with any interest paid or credited  thereon
after taxes  applicable  thereto).  If, after the receipt by the Executive of an
amount  advanced by the Company  pursuant to Section 11(c), a  determination  is
made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund with respect to such
claim and the Company does not notify the  Executive in writing of its intent to
contest  such  denial of refund  prior to the  expiration  of 30 days after such
determination,  then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to
be repaid and the amount of such advance  shall offset,  to the extent  thereof,
the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.
