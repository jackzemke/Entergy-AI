                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

     Unless the context  otherwise  indicates,  all  references to "PSEG," "we,"
"us" or "our" herein means Public  Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated,  an
exempt  public  utility  holding   company  which  has  four  principal   direct
wholly-owned subsidiaries: Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), PSEG
Power LLC (Power), PSEG Energy Holdings Inc. (Energy Holdings) and PSEG Services
Corporation (Services).

Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with the
Notes  contained in our 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  These Notes update and
supplement matters discussed in our 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were
derived from the audited consolidated  financial statements included in our 2001
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications of prior period data have
been made to conform with the current presentation.

Note 2.  Accounting Matters

     On January 1, 2002 we adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard
(SFAS) No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets" (SFAS 142). Under SFAS
142,  goodwill  is  considered  a  nonamortizable  asset and is be subject to an
annual review for impairment and an interim review when events or  circumstances
occur.  The effect of no longer  amortizing  goodwill  was not  material  to our
financial position and statement of operations.  The impact of adopting SFAS 142
is likely to be material to our financial  position and statement of operations.
We are required to complete our  analysis of  implementing  SFAS No. 142 by June
30, 2002, and the related financial  statement impact is required to be recorded
by December 31, 2002.  An impairment  loss, as of the date of adoption,  will be
recognized as the cumulative  effect of a change in accounting  principle in the
first  interim  period,   if  applicable.   If  certain  events  or  changes  in
circumstance  indicate that goodwill might be impaired before  completion of the
transitional  goodwill  impairment test, goodwill shall be tested for impairment
and any  impairment  loss  shall be  recorded  as a  component  of  income  from
continuing  operations.  For additional  information relating to potential asset
impairments, see Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting  for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" (SFAS 144).  The impact of adopting SFAS 144 did
not have an effect on our financial position and statement of operations.  Under
SFAS 144,  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of are  measured  at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell,  whether reported in continued
operations or in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations will no longer
be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that
have not yet  occurred.  SFAS 144 also  broadens the  reporting of  discontinued
operations.  A long-lived asset must be tested for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances  indicate that its carrying amount may be impaired. For
additional  information  relating to potential  asset  impairments,  see Note 4.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- Continued

     In July  2001,  the  FASB  issued  SFAS  No.  143,  "Accounting  for  Asset
Retirement  Obligations"  (SFAS  143).  Under  SFAS  143,  the  fair  value of a
liability for an asset retirement obligation should be recorded in the period in
which it is created with an offsetting  amount to an asset.  Upon  settlement of
the liability,  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded  amount
or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning  after June 15, 2002.  The impact of adopting SFAS 143 is likely to be
material to our financial position and statement of operations.

Note 3.  Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

     At March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively,  we had deferred the
following regulatory assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

Note 4.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Guaranteed Obligations

     Power has  guaranteed  certain  energy  trading  contracts  of PSEG  Energy
Resources and Trading (ER&T), its subsidiary.  Power has entered into guarantees
having a maximum  liability  of $701 and $506  million as of March 31,  2002 and
December  31, 2001,  respectively.  The amount of Power's  exposure  under these
guarantees was $206 million and $153 million,  as of March 31, 2002 and December
31, 2001, respectively.

     As of March 31, 2002,  Power had issued  letters of credit in the amount of
approximately  $122  million.  These  letters  of credit  are in  support of our
trading business and various contractual obligations.

================================================================================
                  PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED
================================================================================
             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- Continued

     Energy  Holdings or PSEG  Global  Inc.  (Global),  a  subsidiary  of Energy
Holdings, have guaranteed certain obligations of Global's affiliates,  including
the successful  completion,  performance or other obligations related to certain
of their projects,  in an aggregate amount of  approximately  $188 million as of
March 31, 2002. A substantial  portion of such  guarantees  is  eliminated  upon
successful completion,  performance and/or refinancing of construction debt with
non-recourse project debt.

     In the normal course of business,  PSEG Energy  Technologies  Inc.  (Energy
Technologies), a subsidiary of Energy Holdings, secures construction obligations
with performance bonds issued by insurance  companies.  In the event that Energy
Technologies' tangible equity falls below $100 million, Energy Holdings would be
required to provide  additional  support  for the  performance  bonds.  Tangible
equity is defined as net equity  less  goodwill.  As of March 31,  2002,  Energy
Technologies  had  tangible  equity  of  $111  million  and  performance   bonds
outstanding of $130 million.  The performance bonds are not included in the $188
million of guaranteed obligations of Energy Holdings, discussed above.

Environmental

Hazardous Waste

     The New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of  contaminated  sites.  The  NJDEP is  presently  working  with
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of remedial  investigations and
remediations,  where necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface water
bodies.  PSE&G, Power, and predecessor  companies own or owned and/or operate or
operated certain facilities  situated on surface water bodies,  certain of which
are currently the subject of remedial activities.  The financial impact of these
regulations on these projects is not currently  estimable.  We do not anticipate
that the compliance with these  regulations  will have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows.

PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     PSE&G is  currently  working  with the NJDEP  under a program  (Remediation
Program) to assess,  investigate  and,  if  necessary,  remediate  environmental
conditions at PSE&G's  former  manufactured  gas plant (MGP) sites.  To date, 38
sites have been identified. The Remediation Program is periodically reviewed and
revised  by  PSE&G  based  on  regulatory  requirements,   experience  with  the
Remediation Program and available remediation technologies.  The long-term costs
of the  Remediation  Program cannot be reasonably  estimated,  but experience to
date  indicates  that at least $20  million  per year could be  incurred  over a
period of about 30 years  since  inception  of the  program in 1988 and that the
overall  cost  could be  material.  The costs for this  remediation  effort  are
recovered through the SBC.

     At March 31, 2002 and  December  31,  2001,  our  estimated  liability  for
remediation costs through 2004 aggregated $87 million.  Expenditures beyond 2004
cannot be reasonably estimated.

Passaic River Site

     The U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that a six mile
stretch of the Passaic  River in Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"  within the
meaning of that term under the  Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,
Compensation  and  Liability  Act of 1980  (CERCLA) and that,  to date, at least
thirteen corporations, including PSE&G, may be potentially liable for performing
required  remedial actions to address potential  environmental  pollution at the
Passaic  River  "facility."  PSE&G,  PSEG Fossil LLC  (Fossil),  a subsidiary of
Power,  and certain of their  predecessors  operated  industrial  facilities  at
properties within the Passaic River  "facility,"  comprised of four former MGPs,
one operating  electric  generating  station and one former generating  station.
PSE&G's costs to clean up former MGPs are recoverable from its utility customers
under the SBC.  PSE&G has  contracted  to sell the former  generating  site to a
third party that would be responsible for remediation costs. Regulatory approval
by the state is pending.  We cannot predict what action,  if any, the EPA or any
third party may take against PSE&G and Power with respect to these  matters,  or
in such event,  what costs PSE&G and Power may incur to address any such claims.
However, such costs may be material.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR)

     In a response  to a request by the EPA and the NJDEP  under  Section 114 of
the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) requiring information to assess whether projects
completed  since  1978  at  the  Hudson  and  Mercer  coal  burning  units  were
implemented in accordance with applicable NSR  regulations,  we provided certain
data in November  2000. In January 2002, we reached an agreement  with the state
and the federal government to resolve  allegations of noncompliance with federal
and state NSR  regulations.  Under that agreement,  we will install advanced air
pollution  controls  over 12 years that are  expected  to  significantly  reduce
emissions of nitrogen  oxides (NOx),  sulfur dioxide  (SO2),  and carbon dioxide
(CO2),  particulate  matter, and mercury from these units. The estimated cost of
the program is $355 million and such costs,  when incurred,  will be capitalized
as plant additions.  We also paid a $1.4 million civil penalty,  and will pay up
to $6 million on supplemental  environmental  projects and up to $1.5 million if
reductions in CO2 levels are not achieved.

     The EPA had also asserted that PSD requirements are applicable to Bergen 2,
such that we were  required to have obtained a permit  before  beginning  actual
on-site  construction.  We disputed that PSD/NSR requirements were applicable to
Bergen 2. As a result of the agreement resolving the NSR allegations  concerning
Hudson  and  Mercer,  the NJDEP  issued an air  permit for Bergen 2. The unit is
expected to begin operating in June 2002.

Power

New Generation and Development

     Power is in the process of developing the Bethlehem Energy Center, a 750 MW
combined-cycle  power  plant  that will  replace  the 400 MW Albany  (NY)  Steam
Station.  Total costs for this project will be  approximately  $450 million with
expenditures to date of approximately  $59 million.  Construction is expected to
begin in the summer of 2002.  The expected  completion  date is in June 2004, at
which time the existing station will be retired.

     Power is constructing a 550 MW natural  gas-fired,  combined cycle electric
generation plant at Bergen  Generation  Station at a cost of approximately  $319
million with completion  expected in June 2002. Total  expenditures to date have
been  $299  million.  Power  is also  constructing  a 1,186  MW  combined  cycle
generation  plant in Linden,  New Jersey.  Costs are estimated at  approximately
$600 million with expenditures to date of approximately $282 million. Completion
is  expected  in May 2003 at which time 445 MW of  generating  capacity  will be
retired.

     Power is also constructing through indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, two
natural gas-fired combined cycle electric  generation plants in Waterford,  Ohio
(850 MW) and Lawrenceburg, Indiana (1,150 MW) at an aggregate total cost of $1.2
billion.  Total  expenditures to date on these projects have been  approximately
$968 million.  The required  estimated  equity  investment in these  projects is
approximately $400 million,  with the remainder being financed with non-recourse
debt.  As of March 31,  2002,  approximately  $168  million  of equity  has been
invested in these projects. In connection with these projects,  ER&T has entered
into a five-year tolling agreement pursuant to which it is obligated to purchase
the  output of these  facilities  at stated  prices.  The  agreement  expires if
current financing is repaid within five years. Additional equity investments may
be required if the proceeds  received from ER&T under this tolling agreement are
not  sufficient to cover the required  payments  under the bank  financing.  The
Waterford project will not begin commercial operation as a single-cycle facility
in June  2002 as  originally  scheduled.  Both the  Waterford  and  Lawrenceburg
combined-cycle   facilities  are  currently   scheduled  to  achieve  commercial
operation in 2003.

     Power has  commitments  to purchase  equipment  and  services,  to meet its
current plans to develop additional  generating  capacity.  The aggregate amount
due under these commitments is approximately $480 million, the majority of which
are included in estimated costs for the projects discussed above.

Energy Holdings

California Investments

     In May 2001,  GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy),  a 50/50 joint  venture  between
Global and Harbinger GWF LLC,  entered into a 10-year power  purchase  agreement
(PPA) with the California Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to provide 340 MW
of electric  capacity to  California  from three new natural  gas-fired  peaking
plants,  Hanford,  Henrietta  and Tracy  Peaking  Plants.  Total project cost is
estimated at  approximately  $335 million.  The Hanford  Peaking  Plant, a 90 MW
facility,  was  completed  and began  operation  in August 2001.  The  Henrietta
Peaking Plant is currently under construction,  with completion expected in July
2002,  and the Tracy  Peaking  Plant,  a 160 MW facility,  is in the  permitting
process.   Permitting   for  the  Tracy   Peaking   project  has  been   delayed
significantly.  The  California  Energy  Commission  is not  expected to issue a
permit allowing the start of construction before the end of June 2002. This date
does not  allow  sufficient  time to  complete  construction  before  the  final
Commercial  Operations Date deadline of October 31, 2002 under the contract.  On
February  28,  2002,  GWF  Energy  asserted  a force  majeure  claim  under  the
provisions of its contract for an appropriate extension of the deadline.

     On April 24, 2002, GWF Energy  received  notice from the CDWR rejecting GWF
Energy's  force majeure  claim.  Energy  Holdings and Global are  evaluating the
appropriate  course of action to protect its rights under the CDWR PPA. Global's
permanent equity  investment in these plants,  including  contingencies,  is not
expected to exceed $100 million after completion of project financing,  which is
currently  expected to occur in late 2002 or in 2003.  For a description  of the
loans to GWF Energy, see Note 10. Related-Party Transactions.

     On  February  25,  2002 the  Public  Utilities  Commission  of the State of
California  and the  State  of  California  Electricity  Oversight  Board  filed
complaints with the Federal Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (FERC) under Section
206 of the Federal Power Act against  sellers,  which pursuant to long-term FERC
authorized  contracts,  provide  power  to  the  CDWR.  GWF  Energy  is a  named
respondent  in  these  proceedings.   The  complaints,  which  address  over  40
transactions  embodied in over 30 contracts  with over 20 sellers,  allege that,
collectively,  the specified  long-term  wholesale power contracts are priced at
unjust and  unreasonable  levels and request FERC to abrogate  the  contracts to
enable  the  State  to  obtain  replacement  contracts  as  necessary  or in the
alternative, to reform the contracts to provide for just and reasonable pricing,
reduce the length of the  contracts  and strike from the  contracts the specific
non-price  conditions  found to be unjust and  unreasonable.  On April 25, 2002,
FERC  consolidated  the two  dockets  and set the ten year PPA  contract  of GWF
Energy and certain  other  respondents,  including  the ten year PPA contact for
hearing  "to  determine  whether  the  dysfunctional   California  spot  markets
adversely  affected  the  long-term   bilateral  markets  and,  if  so,  whether
modification of any individual  contract at issue is warranted." FERC determined
that the GWF contract,  among others,  was entitled to  presumption of validity,
requiring  the CPUC to prove it was  "against  the public  interest."  FERC also
strongly  encouraged  the  parties  to  negotiate  settlements  and  directed  a
settlement  judge to be appointed to oversee such  negotiations.  GWF Energy has
indicated to representatives of the State of California its willingness to enter
into negotiations in an attempt to resolve differences between the parties.  GWF
Energy plans to attend FERC settlement conference discussions during the week of
May 13,  2002.  We cannot  predict  the  outcome of this matter or its impact on
future earnings or cash flows.

Dispute of Power Contracts-Tanir Bavi

     Global owns a 74% interest in Tanir Bavi Power Company  Private Ltd. (Tanir
Bavi), which owns and operates a 220 MW barge mounted, combined-cycle generating
facility.  The plant commenced  combined-cycle  commercial operation in November
2001. Power from the plant is being sold under a seven-year fixed price PPA with
the Karnataka Power  Transmission  Company Limited  (KPTCL),  a State affiliated
entity, formerly known as Karnataka Electricity Board.

     Tanir Bavi has been in dispute  with KPTCL  regarding  the terms of payment
specified  in the PPA  relating  to the fixed  portion of the  tariff,  which is
approximately  US  $.04  per  kilowatt-hour.   The  amount  of  the  dispute  is
approximately half of this fixed amount. During the first quarter of 2002, KPTCL
referred the dispute to the  government of Karnataka,  which  directed  KPTCL to
accept Tanir Bavi's  position.  Prior to KPTCL's  acceptance of such  direction,
however,  the  Karnataka  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (KERC)  exercised
jurisdiction  over the matter  and  requested  that  KPTCL not  comply  with the
requests of the  government of Karnataka  until KERC had reviewed the matter.  A
hearing was held in May 2002, at which KERC determined that the disputed amounts
could not be paid until the parties complied with the dispute resolution process
called for in the PPA. KERC did not rule on the merits  regarding the arrearages
but directed the parties on the process of the dispute.  The dispute  resolution
process could take several months.

     Beginning in January 2002,  approximately  50% of the disputed amounts were
subject to a reserve  established by Global.  Beginning in the second quarter of
2002, Global began to reserve 100% of the disputed amount. As of March 31, 2002,
the amount in dispute due from KPTCL was $22 million, net of reserves,  of which
our share was $16 million.  We cannot predict the outcome due to the uncertainty
of the dispute resolution  process.  If there was an unfavorable outcome in this
matter,  we would be  required  to  recognize  a loss of up to our  share of the
entire unrecovered and unreserved amount in dispute. In addition, an unfavorable
outcome would adversely impact this project's future earnings and cash flows and
could lead to an impairment  of the existing $27 million of goodwill  associated
with this project.

Potential Asset Impairments

     As  previously  disclosed,   and  as  discussed  below,  we  are  currently
evaluating the  recoverability of our $585 million capital at risk in Argentina.
In addition,  as part of the implementation of SFAS 142, the goodwill associated
with Rio Grande Energia (RGE),  EDEERSA,  Energy  Technologies and Tanir Bavi is
being evaluated for potential  impairment.  Under a worst-case scenario,  if the
results of these evaluations indicate a complete impairment,  we would record an
approximate  $735 million  (pre-tax  and  pre-minority  interest),  $473 million
(after-tax and after minority  interest)  charge to earnings in 2002. This would
amount to  approximately  $2.29 per share.  The related,  worst-case,  charge to
equity would be approximately  $410 million due to the $63 million charge to OCI
previously  recorded in the first quarter.  We expect to complete our evaluation
of these issues during the second quarter of 2002.

Argentine Economic Crisis

     As of March 31, 2002,  Energy Holdings'  aggregate  investment  exposure in
Argentina was approximately  $585 million,  including $165 million of investment
exposure for Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Entre Rios S.A. (EDEERSA),
and $420 million of investment exposure for assets under contract for sale. This
investment  exposure was reduced in the first quarter by a $47 million (pre-tax)
charge  related to the change in the  functional  currency at EDEERSA  discussed
further below.  Goodwill  related to Energy  Holdings'  investment in EDEERSA is
approximately  $63  million  and  is  included  in  this  investment   exposure.
Investments  include a 90%  owned  distribution  company,  EDEERSA;  and  Energy
Holdings'   minority  interests  in  three   distribution   companies,   Empresa
Distribuidora de Energia Norte S.A. (EDEN), Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Sur
S.A. (EDES), and Empresa Distribuidora La Plata S.A. (EDELAP) and two generating
companies,  Central Termica San Nicolas power plant (CTSN), and Parana which are
under contract for sale to certain subsidiaries of the AES Corporation (AES).

     The Argentine  economy has been in a state of recession  for  approximately
five years.  Continued deficit spending in the 23 Argentine  provinces,  coupled
with low growth and high unemployment,  has precipitated an economic,  political
and social crisis. Toward the end of 2001, a liquidity crisis ensued causing the
Argentine  government to default on $141 billion of national  debt. The economic
crisis was fueled by  political  instability  and social  unrest as the new year
began. The present Argentine federal  government is in the process of developing
an  economic   plan  to  avert  a  return  to  the  economic   instability   and
hyperinflationary  economy of the 1980s.  In early January 2002,  the decade old
convertibility formula that maintained the Argentine Peso at a 1:1 exchange rate
with the US Dollar,  was  abandoned.  In early February 2002, the Argentine Peso
was no longer  pegged to the US  Dollar.  In the first day of the free  floating
formula,  the  currency  weakened  to a rate of  approximately  2 Pesos per 1 US
Dollar.  At the end of March 2002,  the currency  weakened  further to a rate of
approximately  2.90 Pesos per 1 US Dollar.  As of April 30,  2002,  the currency
weakened further to a rate of approximately 2.96 Pesos per 1 US Dollar.

     In the Province of Entre Rios,  where EDEERSA is located,  the  electricity
law  provided  for a  pass-through  of  devaluation  to the end  user  customer.
Customers' bills were to be first computed in US Dollars and then converted into
Pesos for billing.  This mechanism assured that devaluation would not impact the
level of US Dollar revenues an electric distribution company received.  However,
in January 2002,  the Argentine  federal  government  implemented a new law that
prohibits  any foreign price or currency  indexation  and any US Dollar or other
foreign currency  adjustment  clauses  relating to public service tariffs,  thus
prohibiting  the pass  through of the costs of  devaluation  to  customers.  The
provincial  governments  have  been  requested  to  adopt  this  provision.  The
provincial  government  of the Province of Entre Rios has recently  adopted this
provision as well as a law that requires  public  service  companies  within the
Province,  including  EDEERSA,  to accept  payment for all billed  services in a
provincial  promissory note, the "Federal".  The terms of the "Federal"  require
principal  payment at maturity in an equal amount of Argentine  Pesos.  However,
the "Federal" is not freely  convertible in the financial markets into Argentine
Pesos or US Dollars. Approximately 75% of cash receipts generated from EDEERSA's
operations are currently settled in "Federals."  There are ongoing  negotiations
to remedy this situation, although no assurances can be given. While we continue
to operate EDEERSA,  there has been an adverse impact to its financial condition
and cash flows due to its inability to pass through the costs of  devaluation to
customers and its receipt of an illiquid provincial currency. Energy Holdings is
pursuing  remedies on several fronts,  including  holding  discussions  with the
Province  and  United  States  government   officials,   both  individually  and
collectively with a coalition of international investors, and Energy Holdings is
pursuing legal recourse under the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United
States  and  Argentina.  Energy  Holdings  has been  notified  by lenders of the
occurrence  of events of default in  certain  of its  subsidiaries  non-recourse
credit agreements  related to Parana,  EDEN, EDES, and EDELAP credit facilities.
If Argentine conditions do not improve,  Global's other Argentine properties may
also default on non-recourse  obligations in connection  with other  financings.
Currently,  we cannot predict the outcome of our ongoing  negotiations  with the
lenders.

     The situation in Argentina is quite uncertain and highly volatile. While it
is likely that some or all of our  investment  in  Argentina  is  impaired,  the
continued  lack of stability in the  political and economic  environment  causes
significant  variability in the quantification of value.  However, the continued
passage  of  time  without  a  credible  solution  and  continuing   instability
diminishes the prospect of recovery.  Other  potential  impacts of the Argentine
economic,  political  and social  crisis,  include  increased  collection  risk,
further   devaluation  of  the  Peso,   potential   nationalization  of  assets,
foreclosure  of our assets by lenders and an  inability  to complete the pending
sale of  certain  Argentine  assets  to  certain  subsidiaries  of  AES.  Global
anticipates that evolving  economic and political  events,  ongoing  discussions
with regulators about tariff levels and discussions with lenders will occur that
will enable a determination of value in the second quarter of 2002.

Functional Currency - Argentine Operations

     As of December  31,  2001,  the  functional  currency of EDEERSA was the US
Dollar, as all revenues, most expenses and all financings were denominated in US
Dollars  or were  linked  to the US  Dollar.  As a US Dollar  reporting  entity,
EDEERSA's monetary accounts denominated in Pesos, such as short-term receivables
or  payables,  were  re-measured  into the US Dollar  with a  minimal  impact to
earnings.  At December  31,  2001,  Energy  Holdings'  90% share of EDEERSA's US
Dollar denominated debt was approximately $76 million. This debt is non-recourse
to us and Energy Holdings.  Due to the recent events described above, we changed
the functional currency of EDEERSA's operations to the Argentine Peso, effective
March 1, 2002. As a result, all monetary accounts denominated in US Dollars were
re-measured  to the Argentine  Peso  effective  March 1, 2002,  including the US
Dollar  denominated debt using the applicable  exchange rate of 2.90 Pesos per 1
US Dollar.  This resulted in a pre-tax loss of  approximately  $47 million after
deductions  for  minority  interest  for the quarter  ended March 31,  2002.  In
addition to this impact on our Consolidated  Statements of Income,  the recorded
amount of Energy Holdings' net investment in EDEERSA  decreased by approximately
$100 million due to the translation adjustment as of March 31, 2002.

Assets Held for Sale-Certain Argentine Projects

     On August 24, 2001, Global entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement to sell
its  minority  interests  in EDEN,  EDES,  EDELAP,  CTSN and Parana,  to certain
subsidiaries  of AES.  The  transaction  is subject to  regulatory  approval and
consent of lenders.

     On February 6, 2002, AES notified  Global that it was terminating the Stock
Purchase Agreement.  In the Notice of Termination,  AES alleged that a Political
Risk Event, within the meaning of the Stock Purchase Agreement, had occurred, by
virtue of certain decrees of the Government of Argentina, thereby giving AES the
right to  terminate  the  Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  Global  disagrees  that a
Political  Risk  Event as  defined  in the Stock  Purchase  Agreement,  which is
limited to  expropriation  of assets,  has occurred and has so notified  AES. In
April 2002,  Global filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court for New York
County  against AES to enforce its rights  under the Stock  Purchase  Agreement,
which it will vigorously  pursue. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this
matter.
<PAGE>
     As of March 31,  2002,  we had  approximately  $19 million of interest  and
other  receivables  due  from  the  AES  Corporation  as  provided  for  in  the
transaction documents.

     In the first quarter of 2002, the Administrative Agent for the non-recourse
project  financing  notified Global that Parana was in default and a $28 million
equity  commitment  was  accelerated  by two weeks.  Global made such payment in
March 2002 and it is  included  in the $585  million of  investment  exposure in
Argentina.

Goodwill

     As of March 31, 2002, the carrying  value of unamortized  goodwill was $621
million,  of which  $451  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  Global's
acquisitions  of Sociedad  Austral de Electricidad  S.A.  (SAESA) and Empresa de
Electricidad  de los Andes S.A.  (Electroandes)  in Chile and Peru in August and
December of 2001,  respectively.  For the  year-ended  December  31,  2001,  the
amortization expense related to goodwill was $3 million.

     As of March 31,  2002,  our pro-rata  share of goodwill  included in equity
method  investees  totaled $378 million.  In accordance with generally  accepted
accounting  principles,  such goodwill is not consolidated on our balance sheet.
Our share of the  amortization  expense  related to such goodwill was $8 million
for the year-ended December 31, 2001.  However,  this goodwill is subject to the
same impairment testing under SFAS 142 at the local entities.

     We are in the  process  of  finalizing  our  evaluation  of the  effect  of
adopting  SFAS 142 on the recorded  amount of goodwill at RGE,  EDEERSA,  Energy
Technologies  and Tanir Bavi. It is likely that the entire carrying value of the
goodwill at EDEERSA and Energy  Technologies  is completely  impaired,  that the
goodwill at RGE up to approximately half of the recorded carrying value could be
impaired, and that the goodwill at Tanir Bavi could be impaired. The goodwill at
EDEERSA is included in the $585 million of investment  exposure  associated with
our assets in Argentina.

Note 5.  Financial Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management

     Our  operations  are  exposed  to market  risks from  changes in  commodity
prices,  foreign currency exchange rates,  interest rates and equity prices that
could affect our results of operations and financial  conditions.  We manage our
exposure to these  market  risks  through our regular  operating  and  financing
activities  and, when deemed  appropriate,  hedge these risks through the use of
derivative  financial  instruments.  We use the term  hedge  to mean a  strategy
designed to manage risks of  volatility  in prices or rate  movements on certain
assets,  liabilities or anticipated  transactions and by creating a relationship
in  which  gains  or  losses  on   derivative   instruments   are   expected  to
counterbalance  the losses or gains on the assets,  liabilities  or  anticipated
transactions exposed to such market risks. We use derivative instruments as risk
management  tools  consistent  with our  business  plans  and  prudent  business
practices and for energy trading purposes.

<PAGE>
Energy Trading Contracts

     We  engage  in  physical  and  financial  transactions  in the  electricity
wholesale  markets and execute an overall risk  management  strategy to mitigate
the  effects  of  adverse  movements  in the fuel and  electricity  markets.  We
actively  trade  energy,  capacity,  fixed  transmission  rights  and  emissions
allowances   in  the  spot,   forward   and   futures   markets   primarily   in
Pennsylvania-New  Jersey-Maryland  Power Pool  (PJM),  but also  throughout  our
target market,  which we refer to as the Super Region,  which extends from Maine
to the  Carolinas  and the Atlantic  Coast to Indiana.  We are also  involved in
financial   transactions  that  include  swaps,   options  and  futures  in  the
electricity markets.

     Our energy trading  contracts are recorded under Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) 98-10. This requires energy trading contracts to be marked-to-market with
the  resulting  realized  and  unrealized  gains and losses  included in current
earnings. These contracts are recorded in our Energy Trading Segment.

     We also enter into certain  other  contracts  for our  generation  business
which are derivatives but do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 nor
are  classified  as energy  trading  contracts  under EITF 98-10.  Most of these
contracts are option  contracts on gas purchases  for  generation  requirements,
which do not  qualify for hedge  accounting  and  therefore  the changes in fair
market value of these derivative  contracts are recorded in the income statement
at the end of each reporting period in our generation segment.

Energy Trading

     For our Energy  Trading  Segment for the quarters  ended March 31, 2002 and
2001, we recorded net margins of $29.6 million and $48.8 million,  respectively,

     We routinely  enter into exchange  traded futures and options  transactions
for  electricity  and  natural  gas as part of our  energy  trading  operations.
Generally, exchange-traded futures contracts require deposit of margin cash, the
amount of which is subject to change based on market  movement and in accordance
with exchange rules.  The amount of the margin deposits as of March 31, 2002 was
approximately $4.9 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities

Commodity Contracts

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand,  state and federal  regulatory  policies and other events. To
reduce  price  risk  caused by market  fluctuations,  we enter  into  derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties, to hedge our anticipated demand. These contracts, in conjunction
with  owned  electric  generation  capacity,  are  designed  to cover  estimated
electric customer commitments.

     The BPU  approved an auction to  identify  energy  suppliers  for the Basic
Generation  Service (BGS) beginning on August 1, 2002. Power did not participate
directly  in the  auction  but  agreed to supply  power to several of the direct
bidders,  securing  contracts  for  a  substantial  portion  of  our  generation
capacity. On February 15, 2002 the BPU approved the BGS auction results.

     As a result of the BGS  auction,  Power has entered  into  BGS/Third  Party
Suppliers agreements with several counterparties who won bids to deliver energy,
capacity,  transmission  and  ancillary  services  to serve the  native  load of
various New Jersey  utilities at a fixed  price.  In order to hedge a portion of
our forecasted BGS requirements,  Power entered into forward purchase contracts,
futures,  options and swaps.  Power has forecasted the energy  delivery from our
generating  stations based on the forward price curve  movement of energy.  As a
result,  Power entered into swaps, options and futures transactions to hedge the
price  of gas to meet  our gas  purchases  requirements  for  generation.  These
transactions  qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133. As of March
31,  2002,  the fair value of these  hedges was $11.1  million  with  offsetting
charges to Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) of $6.5 million  (after-tax).  These
hedges will mature in 2003.

     As of March 31,  2002,  PSE&G had  entered  into 268 MMBTU of gas  futures,
options and swaps to hedge  forecasted  requirements.  Also as of  December  31,
2001,  PSE&G had  entered  into 330 MMBTU of gas  futures,  options and swaps to
hedge forecasted  requirements.  As of March 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the
fair value of those instruments was $(22.0) and $(137.0) million,  respectively,
with a maximum term of  approximately  one year.  PSE&G utilizes  derivatives to
hedge its gas purchasing  activities  which,  when realized,  are recoverable in
rates through the Levelized Gas  Adjustment  Clause (LGAC).  Accordingly,  these
commodity  contracts  are  recognized  at fair  value as  derivative  assets  or
liabilities  on the balance  sheet and the offset to the change in fair value of
these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.

     We use a  value-at-risk  (VAR)  model  to  assess  the  market  risk of our
commodity  business.  This model includes fixed price sales  commitments,  owned
generation,   native  load   requirements,   physical  contracts  and  financial
derivative  instruments.  VAR  represents  the  potential  gains or  losses  for
instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time
period and  confidence  level.  We estimated VAR across our  commodity  business
using a model with historical volatilities and correlations.

     Our Board of Directors  has  established a VAR Threshold of $75 million and
the Risk Management Committee (RMC) has established an internal VAR threshold of
$50 million for Power. If the $50 million  threshold was reached,  the RMC would
be notified  and the  portfolio  would be closely  monitored  to reduce risk and
potential adverse movements.

     The measured VAR using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95% confidence
level  and  assuming  a  one-week   time  horizon  as  of  March  31,  2002  was
approximately  $22  million,  compared  to the  December  31,  2001 level of $18
million  which  was   calculated   using  various   controls  and   conservative
assumptions,  such as a 50%  success  rate in the BGS  Auction.  This  estimate,
however, is not necessarily  indicative of actual results,  which may differ due
to the fact that actual  market  rate  fluctuations  may differ from  forecasted
fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio of hedging  instruments may
change over the holding  period and due to certain  assumptions  embedded in the
calculation.

Interest Rates

     We, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings are subject to the risk of fluctuating
interest  rates in the  normal  course  of  business.  Our  policy  is to manage
interest  rate risk  through  the use of fixed  rate debt,  floating  rate debt,
interest rate swaps and interest rate lock  agreements.  As of March 31, 2002, a
hypothetical  10% change in market  interest rates would result in a $3 million,
$5 million and $1 million change in annual  interest costs related to short-term
and floating rate debt at PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy  Holdings,  respectively.  The
following table shows details of the interest rate swaps at PSEG,  PSE&G,  Power
and Energy Holdings and their associated values that are still open at March 31,
2002:

     We expect to reclass approximately $24.5 million of open losses on interest
rate swaps from OCI to earnings  during the next twelve months.  As of March 31,

Equity Securities

     PSEG  Resources  Inc.  (Resources),  a wholly-  owned  subsidiary of Energy
Holdings  has  investments  in  equity  securities  and  limited   partnerships.
Resources carries its investments in equity securities at their approximate fair
value  as of the  reporting  date.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value of these
investments  is  affected  by  changes  in the  fair  value  of  the  underlying
securities.  Fair value is  determined  by  adjusting  the  market  value of the
securities for liquidity and market volatility factors,  where appropriate.  The
aggregate  fair values of such  investments,  which had quoted  market prices at
March  31,  2002 and  December  31,  2001  were  $28  million  and $34  million,
respectively.  The potential  change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical
10% change in quoted market prices of these  investments  amounted to $2 million
as of March 31, 2002.

Foreign Currencies

     We conduct  our  business  on a  multinational  basis in a wide  variety of
foreign currencies. Our objective for foreign currency risk management policy is
to preserve the  economic  value of cash flows in  currencies  other than the US
Dollar. Our policy is to hedge significant probable future cash flows identified
as  subject  to  significant  foreign  currency  variability.  In  addition,  we
typically hedge a portion of our exposure resulting from identified  anticipated
cash  flows,   providing  the  flexibility  to  deal  with  the  variability  of
longer-term  forecasts as well as changing market conditions,  in which the cost
of hedging may be excessive relative to the level of risk involved.  Our foreign
currency   hedging   activities  to  date  include  hedges  of  US  Dollar  debt
arrangements in operating  companies that conduct  business in currencies  other
than the US Dollar.

     As of March 31, 2002,  Global and  Resources  had  international  assets of
approximately $3.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets located in Austria, Australia,  Belgium, China, Germany, the Netherlands,
United  Kingdom,  and New Zealand with associated  revenues  denominated in U.S.
Dollars and therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

     Global's international investments are primarily in projects that presently
or upon  completion  are  expected  to  generate or  distribute  electricity  in
Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  India,  Italy, Oman, Peru, Poland,  Taiwan,
Tunisia  and  Venezuela.   Investing  in  foreign  countries   involves  certain
additional risks. Economic conditions that result in higher comparative rates of
inflation in foreign  countries are likely to result in declining values in such
countries'  currencies.  As  currencies  fluctuate  against the $US,  there is a
corresponding  change in  Global's  investment  value in terms of the $US.  Such
change is reflected as an increase or decrease in the investment  value and OCI,
a separate component of Stockholder's  Equity. As of March 31, 2002, net foreign
currency   devaluations   have  reduced  the   reported   amount  of  our  total
Stockholder's Equity by $320 million, of which $159 million, $84 million and $63
million were caused by the devaluation of the Brazilian  Real,  Chilean Peso and
Argentine Peso, respectively.

     Global holds a 60% ownership  interest in Carthage  Power Company  (CPC), a
Tunisian generation  facility under  construction.  The Power Purchase Agreement
(PPA), signed in 1999, contains an embedded derivative that indexes a portion of
the fixed Tunisian Dinar payments to US Dollar  exchange  rates.  The indexation
portion of the PPA is considered an embedded  derivative and has been recognized
and   valued   separately   as   a   derivative   instrument.   As   the   Dinar
depreciates/appreciates   in   relation  to  the  US  Dollar,   the   derivative
increases/decreases in value equal to the discounted present value of additional
units of foreign  currency  (measured  in US Dollars)  over the life of the PPA.
This  increased/decreased   value  is  reported  on  the  balance  sheet  as  an
asset/liability. To the extent that such indexation is provided to hedge foreign
currency debt exposure,  the offsetting  amount is recorded in OCI. Amounts will
be reclassified  from OCI to Earnings over the life of the debt beginning on the
date of  commercial  operation of the  project,  expected to occur in the second
quarter of 2002.  To the extent such  indexation  is provided to hedge an equity
return in US Dollars, the offsetting amount is recorded in Earnings. As of March
31, 2002, we had a derivative asset of $40 million recorded on the balance sheet
related to the  indexation of the PPA.  During the first quarter of 2002, a gain
of $4 million, net of tax and minority interests,  was recorded to earnings as a
result of a net increase in the value of the derivative.

     Global holds a 32% ownership interest in a Brazilian  distribution company,
RGE,  whose debt is denominated  in US Dollars.  As of March 31, 2002,  Global's
pro-rata share of such debt was approximately $60 million. In order to hedge the
risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies  associated
with the debt  principal  payments due in 2002,  RGE entered into three  forward
exchange  contracts to purchase US Dollars for Brazilian Reais in December 2001.
Global's  share of the notional  value of these  contracts,  which expire in the
same months as the respective  principal  payments are due, is approximately $12
million.  As of March  31,  2002,  Global's  share of the  derivative  liability
associated  with these contracts was $2 million and the change in fair value for
the  three  months  ended  March 31,  2002 was  negligible  to our  Consolidated
Statement of Income. Additionally, in order to hedge the risk of fluctuations in
the  exchange  rate between the two  currencies  associated  with the  principal
payments due in 2003 through 2005, RGE entered into nine cross currency interest
rate  swaps in  January  2002.  The  instruments  convert  the  fixed US  Dollar
principal  payments to Brazilian  Real-denominated  obligations  with a variable
CDI-based  (the Brazilian  inter-bank  offered rate) interest rate. As a result,
RGE  has  hedged  its  foreign  currency  exposure  but is  still  at  risk  for
variability  in  the  Brazilian  CDI  interest  rate  during  the  terms  of the
instruments.  Global's  share of the  notional  values of these  instruments  is
approximately $49 million.  The fair market value of the instruments as of March
31, 2002, and the change in the fair market values of these  instruments for the
three  months  ended March 31,  2002 were both  approximately  $1  million.  The
fluctuations  in the fair value of the interest  rate  components of these cross
currency swaps were recorded directly to the Consolidated Statements of Income.

     Through its 50% joint venture,  Meiya Power  Company,  Global holds a 17.5%
ownership  interest in a Taiwanese  generation  project under construction where
the construction  contractor's fees, payable in installments  through July 2003,
are payable in Euros. To manage the risk of foreign  exchange rate  fluctuations
associated  with these  payments,  the project  entered into a series of forward
exchange  contracts to purchase Euros in exchange for Taiwanese  Dollars.  As of
March 31, 2002, Global's share of the fair value and aggregate notional value of
these  forward  exchange  contracts was an asset of less than $1 million and $16
million,  respectively.  These forward  exchange  contracts  were  designated as
hedges for accounting  purposes and were recorded to OCI,  resulting in a change
to OCI of less than $1 million,  Global's share  after-tax for the quarter ended
March 31, 2002.

     During 2001, Global purchased  approximately 100% of a Chilean distribution
company.  In order to hedge final Chilean Peso denominated  payments required to
be made on the acquisition,  Global entered into a forward exchange  contract to
purchase  Chilean  Pesos for US Dollars.  Upon  settlement  of the  transaction,
Global recognized an after-tax loss of $1 million. Furthermore, as a requirement
to obtain certain debt financing necessary to fund the acquisition, and in order
to hedge against  fluctuations in the US Dollar to Chilean Peso foreign exchange
rates,  Global entered into two forward  contracts  with notional  values of $75
million each to exchange Chilean Pesos for US Dollars. These transactions expire
in October 2002 and are considered hedges for accounting  purposes.  As of March
31, 2002,  the  derivative  liability  value of $15 million has been recorded to
OCI, net of taxes.

Credit Risk

     Credit risk  relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of
non-performance  by  counterparties  pursuant to the terms of their  contractual
obligations.  We have established credit policies that we believe  significantly
minimize  credit  risk.  These  policies  include  an  evaluation  of  potential
counterparties'  financial  condition  (including  credit  rating),   collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements,
which may allow for the netting of positive  and negative  exposures  associated
with a single counterparty.

     As a result of the BGS auction,  Power has contracted to provide generating
capacity to the direct  suppliers of New Jersey  electric  utilities,  including
PSE&G,  commencing  August 1, 2002.  These  bilateral  contracts  are subject to
credit risk. This credit risk relates to the ability of  counterparties  to meet
their payment obligations for the power delivered under each BGS contract.  This
risk is substantially  higher than the risk associated with potential nonpayment
by PSE&G under the BGS contract  expiring July 31, 2002.  Any failure to collect
these payments under the new BGS contracts  could have a material  impact on our
results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.

Note 10.  Related Party Transactions

Loans to TIE

     In April 1999, Global and its partner,  Panda Energy  International,  Inc.,
established  Texas  Independent  Energy,  L.P. (TIE), a 50/50 joint venture,  to
develop, construct, own, and operate electric generation facilities in Texas. As
of March 31,  2002,  Global's  investments  in the TIE  partnership  include $76
million of loans that earn  interest at an annual rate of 12% that are scheduled
to be repaid over the next 10 years.

Loans to GWF Energy

     In May 2001, GWF Energy, a 50/50 joint venture between Global and Harbinger
GWF LLC,  entered into a 10-year PPA with the CDWR to provide 340 MW of electric
capacity to California from three new natural  gas-fired peaking plants that GWF
Energy  expects  to build and  operate  in  California.  Total  project  cost is
estimated at approximately $335 million. The first plant, a 90 MW facility,  was
completed  and began  operation  in August  2001.  The second plant is currently
under  construction,  with completion expected in July 2002, and the third plant
is in the permitting  process.  Global's  permanent  equity  investment in these
plants,  including  contingencies,  is not expected to exceed $100 million after
completion of project  financing,  which is currently  expected to occur in late
2002 or in 2003. Pending  completion of project  financing,  Global has provided
GWF Energy approximately $98 million of secured loans to finance the purchase of
turbines.  The turbine  loans bear interest at rates ranging from 12% to 15% per
annum and are  payable  in  installments  beginning  May 31,  2002,  with  final
maturity no later than  December 31, 2002.  Global has also  provided GWF Energy
$27 million of working capital loans that bear interest at 20% per annum and are
convertible  into equity at  Global's  option on various  dates  expiring in May
2002. For a further discussion of this issue matter, see Note 4. Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities.

                 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview of the Quarter Ended March 31, 2002 and Future Outlook

     Net Income for the quarter  ended March 31, 2002 was $180  million or $0.87
per share of common  stock,  based on 206 million  average  shares  outstanding.
These results  include a charge of $31 million  (after-tax),  or $0.15 cents per
share, due to a first-quarter change in the functional currency of an investment
in Argentina  resulting from the economic  crisis there.  Results  excluding the
charge  would have been $211  million or $1.02 per share.  We continue to expect
earnings for the year to meet our previous guidance of $3.90 to $4.10 per share,
excluding any accounting  charges  associated  with the Argentine  crisis or the
adoption of a new accounting standard on goodwill discussed below. These charges
are not expected to affect our long-term annual EPS growth target of 7%.

     The $0.15 per share  non-cash  charge  recorded  in the first  quarter  was
related  to a change in the  functional  currency  of  EDEERSA,  a  distribution
company  in  which  Global  has a 90%  interest,  from the  U.S.  dollar  to the
Argentine Peso. The Argentine Peso has lost  significant  value this year due to
the  ongoing  turmoil in  Argentina  and,  because  of the change in  functional
currency,  approximately  $76 million of non-recourse,  U.S.  dollar-denominated
debt was marked to the Argentine Peso. This charge of $47 million (pre-tax), $31
million (after-tax), reduces our previously disclosed exposure in Argentina from
$632 million to $585 million. See Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
for  further  discussion  of  the  Argentine  economic  crisis,  our  investment
exposure, potential goodwill impairments and certain other contingencies.

     We are currently  evaluating the  recoverability  of our capital at risk in
Argentina.  In addition, as part of the implementation of SFAS 142, the goodwill
associated  with RGE,  EDEERSA,  Energy  Technologies  and  Tanir  Bavi is being
evaluated for potential impairment.  Under a worst-case scenario, if the results
of these evaluations indicate a complete impairment of all such assets, we would
record an approximate  $735 million (pre-tax and  pre-minority  interest),  $473
million (after-tax and after minority interest) charge to earnings in 2002. This
would amount to approximately $2.29 per share. The related,  worst-case,  charge
to equity would be  approximately  $410 million due to the $63 million charge to
OCI  previously  recorded  in the  first  quarter.  We expect  to  complete  our
evaluation of those issues the second quarter of 2002.

     While Global realized  substantial growth in 2001,  significant  challenges
began  developing  during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2001  and into  2002.  These
challenges include the Argentine economic crisis, the soft power market in Texas
and the  worldwide  economic  downturn.  As a result,  Global has  refocused its
strategy  from  one  of  accelerated  growth  to one  that  places  emphasis  on
increasing the efficiency and returns of its existing assets.

     Power is expected to be a major factor in achieving our goals for the year.
Power's  successful  participation  as an  indirect  supplier  of  energy to New
Jersey's  utilities,  including  PSE&G,  involved in New  Jersey's  recent basic
generation  service (BGS) auction is expected to have a meaningful effect on our
earnings,  particularly  in the  second  half of the year and  should  more than
offset the lack of an earnings contribution from Argentina.  Power surpassed its
objective of securing  contracts on more than 75% of its capacity with suppliers
that  won the  right to serve  New  Jersey's  utilities  for a  one-year  period
beginning  August 1. At the same time, PSE&G was able to secure all of its power
supply for the one-year period at competitive prices.

     Following  are the  significant  changes  in or  additions  to  information
reported  in our 2001  Annual  Report on Form 10-K  affecting  the  consolidated
financial  condition and the results of  operations of us and our  subsidiaries.
This discussion refers to our Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and
related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) and should be read in
conjunction with such Statements and Notes.

     Basic and diluted  earnings  per share of our common stock  (Common  Stock)
were $0.87 for the quarter  ended  March 31,  2002,  representing  a decrease of
$0.38 or a 30.4% from the comparable  2001 period.  The results include a charge
of $31  million  or  $0.15  per  share  due  to a  first-quarter  change  in the
functional  currency of an investment in Argentina  resulting  from the economic
crisis there. Results excluding the charge would have been $211 million or $1.02
per share.

     Power's  contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for the quarter
ended March 31, 2002 increased $0.09 or 18% from the comparable 2001 period. The
increase was due primarily to higher  generation  revenues and lower fuel costs.
PSE&G's  earnings per share of Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2002
decreased  $0.20 or 39% for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 from the comparable
2001 period  primarily due to unusually warm winter  weather.  Energy  Holdings'
contribution  to earnings per share of Common Stock for the quarter  ended March
31, 2002 decreased $0.27 from the comparable  2001 period,  primarily due to the
$0.15  charge  due to the  change in the  functional  currency  of an  Argentine
investment  noted above, and the absence of a $0.19 benefit to Global related to
its withdrawal from an interest in the Eagle Point  Cogeneration  Partnership in
the first quarter of 2001. In December 2000,  Global  withdrew from its interest
in Eagle Point in exchange for a series of payments  through  2005,  expected to
total up to $290  million.  Such  payments will be made in each year until 2005,
provided certain  operating  contingencies are met. With respect to Eagle Point,
Global expects to record a total of $46 million in the second and third quarters
of 2002, as operating contingencies for the facility are expected to be met.

     For the Quarter  Ended March 31, 2002  compared to the Quarter  Ended March
31, 2001

Operating Revenues

Electric

     Electric revenues increased $147 million or 16% for the quarter ended March
31, 2002 from the  comparable  period in 2001  primarily due to the inclusion of
$92  million of  revenues  related to various  majority-owned  acquisitions  and
plants going into operation at our Global segment in the second quarter of 2001.

     Generation  segment  revenues  increased $64 million or 11% for the quarter
ended  March 31, 2002 from the  comparable  period in 2001  primarily  due to an
increase  of $65  million in  Interchange/Spot  Market  Sales due to  additional
generation and favorable prices. Also, a $25 million increase in BGS revenue for
the quarter contributed to the increase.  This resulted from customers returning
to PSE&G in 2001 from Third Party  Suppliers  (TPS) as wholesale  market  prices
exceeded fixed BGS rates.  At March 31, 2002, TPS were serving less than 0.5% of
the  customer  load  traditionally  served by PSE&G as compared to the March 31,
2001 level of 8%. These  increases  were  partially  offset by a net $28 million
decrease in Market Transition Charge (MTC) revenues remitted to Power from PSE&G
relating to the two 2% rate reductions that occurred in February and August 2001
and a decrease  in our PSE&G  segment  revenues  of $10 million or 3% due to the
effects of warmer weather.

Gas Distribution

     Gas  distribution  revenues  decreased  $267 million or 25% for the quarter
ended March 31,  2002 from the  comparable  period in 2001 due to the  unusually
warm winter and decreased commodity rates that became effective in January 2002,
partially  offset by increased  gas base rates.  For the quarter ended March 31,
2002,  we  experienced  an 18% decrease in degree days, as compared to the first
quarter 2001.

Trading

     Trading revenues  decreased $157 million or 27% for the quarter ended March
31, 2002 from the comparable  period in 2001 due to lower trading volumes in the
first quarter of 2001 (see  corresponding  decrease in trading  costs).  Despite
lower trading  volumes for the quarter,  we expect to meet our full year trading
margin goals.

Other

     Other revenues decreased $27 million or 12% for the quarter ended March 31,
2002 from the  comparable  period in 2001 due  primarily  to a $43 million  gain
recorded in connection  with Global's  withdrawal  and sale from its interest in
the Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership. Global expects to recover much of this
shortfall with scheduled  payments later this year.  This decrease was partially
offset by Resources'  higher leveraged lease income of $10 million,  as compared
to the first quarter of 2001, and Resources' lower net investment  losses of $10
million, as compared to the first quarter of 2001.

Operating Expenses

Electric Energy Costs

     Electric  Energy Costs  increased  $90 million or 41% for the quarter ended
March 31, 2002 from the comparable 2001 period primarily due to the inclusion of
$45  million of  expenses  related to various  majority-owned  acquisitions  and
plants  going  into  operation  at our  Global  segment  in the second and third
quarters of 2001.

     The  increased  load served under the BGS  contract  due to the  additional
retail  customers  returning to PSE&G in 2001 also  contributed to the increase.
This  increase  was  partially  offset by the lower  cost of fuel,  particularly
natural gas and the  continued  strong  performance  of our  nuclear  generating
plants.

Gas Costs

     Gas Costs  decreased  $260  million or 33% for the quarter  ended March 31,
2002 from the comparable  2001 period  primarily due to lower demand as a result
of the warmer  weather and decreased  commodity  rates that became  effective in
January of 2002.

Trading Costs

     Trading Costs decreased $138 million or 26% for the quarter ended March 31,
2002 from the comparable 2001 period primarily due to lower trading volumes (see
corresponding decreases in trading revenues).

Operations and Maintenance

     Operations and  Maintenance  expense  increased $17 million or 3% primarily
due to higher operating costs associated with new projects going into service at
our Global segment.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Depreciation and Amortization  expense increased $29 million or 27% for the
quarter ended March 31, 2002 from the comparable  2001 period.  The increase was
primarily due to a full periods  recognition of  amortization  of the regulatory
asset  recorded for PSE&G's  stranded  costs  beginning in February 2001 and the
increase  in gas  depreciation  expense  recorded  in  accordance  with  PSE&G's
increased gas base rates.

Interest Expense

     Interest  Expense  increased $31 million or 19% for the quarter ended March
31, 2002 from the comparable  2001 period  primarily due to increased  long-term
debt used to finance several investments made in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     The following  discussion  of our  liquidity and capital  resources is on a
consolidated  basis,  noting  the uses and  contributions  of our  three  direct
operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

<PAGE>
Financing Methodology

     Our  capital  requirements  and those of our  subsidiaries  are met through
liquidity  provided by internally  generated cash flow and external  financings.
PSEG,  Power and Energy Holdings from time to time make equity  contributions to
their respective  direct and indirect  subsidiaries to provide for part of their
capital and cash requirements,  generally relating to long-term investments.  At
times, we utilize  inter-company  dividends and  inter-company  loans to satisfy
various  subsidiary  needs  and  efficiently  manage  our and our  subsidiaries'
short-term  cash  needs.  Any  excess  funds are  invested  in  accordance  with
guidelines adopted by our Board of Directors.

     External  funding to meet our needs and the needs of PSE&G, the majority of
the  requirements  of Power and a  substantial  portion of the  requirements  of
Energy  Holdings,  is  comprised  of corporate  finance  transactions.  The debt
incurred is the direct  obligation  of those  respective  entities.  Some of the
proceeds of these debt  transactions are used by the respective  obligor to make
equity investments in its subsidiaries.

     Depending on the  particular  company,  external  financing  may consist of
public and private capital market debt and equity  transactions,  bank revolving
credit and term loan  facilities,  commercial  paper and/or project  financings.
Some  of  these  transactions  involve  special  purpose  entities.   These  are
corporations,  limited liability  companies or partnerships formed in accordance
with  applicable  tax,  accounting  and legal  requirements  in order to achieve
specified  beneficial  financial  advantages,   such  as  favorable  tax,  legal
liability or accounting treatment.

     The  availability  and cost of external  capital  could be affected by each
subsidiary's  performance  as well as by the  performance  of  their  respective
subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  This could  include the degree of  structural or
regulatory  separation between us and our subsidiaries and between PSE&G and its
non-utility  affiliates  and  the  potential  impact  of  affiliate  ratings  on
consolidated and unconsolidated  credit quality.  Additionally,  compliance with
applicable  financial  covenants will depend upon future financial  position and
levels of earnings and net cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.

     Financing for Global's  projects and  investments is generally  provided by
non-recourse project financing  transactions.  These consist of loans from banks
and other  lenders  that are  typically  secured by project and special  purpose
subsidiary  assets and/or cash flows.  Two of Power's  projects  currently under
construction have similar financing.  Non-recourse transactions generally impose
no  obligation  on the  parent-level  investor to repay any debt incurred by the
project borrower.  However, in some cases,  certain obligations  relating to the
investment  being  financed,   including  additional  equity  commitments,   are
guaranteed by Global,  Energy Holdings,  and/or Power. Further, the consequences
of permitting a project-level default include loss of any invested equity by the
parent.

Debt Covenants, Cross Default Provisions, Material Adverse Changes, and Ratings
Triggers

     Our credit agreements and those of our subsidiaries and the debt indentures
of Power and Energy  Holdings  contain  cross-default  provisions  under which a
default  by  us or by  specified  subsidiaries  involving  specified  levels  of
indebtedness  in other  agreements  would result in a default and the  potential
acceleration  of  payment  under such  indentures  and  credit  agreements.  For
example, a default with respect to specified indebtedness in an aggregate amount
of $50  million  for us, $50  million  for Power,  $50  million  for PSE&G or $5
million for Energy Holdings,  including relevant equity contribution obligations
in subsidiaries' non-recourse  transactions,  would cause a cross-default in our
or certain of our subsidiaries' credit agreements or indentures.

     If such a default were to occur,  lenders, or the debt holders under any of
our  or  our  subsidiaries'  indentures,   could  determine  that  debt  payment
obligations may be accelerated as a result of a cross-default.  A declaration of
cross-default  could  severely  limit our  liquidity and restrict our ability to
meet our debt, capital and, in extreme cases, operational cash requirements. Any
inability to satisfy required covenants and/or borrowing conditions would have a
similar  impact.  This  would have a material  adverse  effect on our  financial
condition,  results  of  operations  and  net  cash  flows,  and  those  of  our
subsidiaries.

     In addition,  our credit agreements and those of our subsidiaries generally
contain  provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the
event of a material  adverse change in the  borrower's,  and as may be relevant,
our, Energy Holdings',  Power's or PSE&G's business or financial  condition.  In
the  event  that we or the  lenders  in any of our or our  subsidiaries'  credit
agreements determine that a material adverse change has occurred, loan funds may
not be advanced.

     Some of these credit agreements also contain maximum debt to equity ratios,
minimum  cash flow  tests and other  restrictive  covenants  and  conditions  to
borrowing.  Compliance with applicable  financial covenants will depend upon our
future  financial  position and the level of earnings and cash flow, as to which
no assurances  can be given.  As part of our  financial  planning  forecast,  we
perform  stress  tests  on  our  financial  covenants.  These  tests  include  a
consideration  of the impacts of potential asset  impairments,  foreign currency
fluctuations  and other items.  Our current  analysis and  projections  indicate
that, even in a worst-case scenario with respect to our investments in Argentina
and  considering  other  potential  events,  we should still be able to meet our
financial covenants.

     Our debt indentures and credit  agreements and those of our subsidiaries do
not contain any  "ratings  triggers"  that would  cause an  acceleration  of the
required  interest and principal  payments in the event of a ratings  downgrade.
However, in the event of a downgrade,  we and/or our subsidiaries may be subject
to increased  interest costs on certain bank debt.  Also, in connection with its
energy trading business, Power must meet certain credit quality standards as are
required by  counterparties.  If Power loses its investment grade credit rating,
ER&T would have to provide  credit  support  (letters of credit or cash),  which
would  significantly  impact the energy trading  business.  These same contracts
provide  reciprocal  benefits  to Power.  Providing  this credit  support  would
increase  our costs of doing  business  and limit our  ability  to  successfully
conduct our energy  trading  operations.  In addition,  our  counterparties  may
require us to meet margin or other security  requirements which may include cash
payments.  Global and Energy Holdings may have to provide collateral for certain
of their  equity  commitments  if Energy  Holdings'  ratings  should  fall below
investment grade.

Regulatory Restrictions

     Capital  resources  and  investment  requirements  could be affected by the
outcome of proceedings by the BPU pursuant to the Energy Competition Act and the
requirements  of the 1992 Focused  Audit  conducted by the BPU, of the impact of
our non-utility  businesses,  owned by Energy Holdings, on PSE&G. As a result of
the Focused Audit, the BPU ordered that, among other things:

     (1)  We will not permit Energy  Holdings'  investments to exceed 20% of our
          consolidated assets without prior notice to the BPU;

     (2)  PSE&G's Board of Directors would provide an annual  certification that
          the business and financing plans of Energy Holdings will not adversely
          affect PSE&G;

     (3)  We will (a) limit debt supported by the minimum net worth  maintenance
          agreement  between us and PSEG  Capital to $650 million and (b) make a
          good-faith  effort to  eliminate  such  support over a six to ten year
          period from May 1993; and

     (4)  Energy  Holdings will pay PSE&G an affiliation fee of up to $2 million
          a year which is to be used to reduce customer rates.

     In the Final Order the BPU noted that,  due to  significant  changes in the
industry and, in  particular,  our corporate  structure as a result of the Final
Order,  modifications  to or  relief  from  the  Focused  Audit  order  might be
warranted. PSE&G has notified the BPU that PSEG will eliminate PSEG Capital debt
by the end of the  second  quarter of 2003 and that it  believes  that the Final
Order otherwise  supercedes the  requirements  of the Focused Audit.  The BPU is
expected to address the matter later this year. While we believe that this issue
will be satisfactorily  resolved, no assurances can be given. In addition, if we
were no longer to be exempt under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
(PUHCA),  we and our subsidiaries  would be subject to additional  regulation by
the SEC with respect to financing and investing activities, including the amount
and type of  non-utility  investments.  We  believe  that this  would not have a
material  adverse effect on our financial  condition,  results of operations and
net cash flows.

     Over the next several years,  we and our  subsidiaries  will be required to
refinance  maturing  debt,  incur  additional  debt and  provide  equity to fund
investment  activity.  Any  inability  to obtain  required  additional  external
capital or to extend or replace  maturing  debt and/or  existing  agreements  at
current levels and reasonable interest rates may affect our financial condition,
results of operations and net cash flows.

Short Term Liquidity

     We and  our  subsidiaries  have  revolving  credit  facilities  to  provide
liquidity for our $850 million commercial paper program and PSE&G's $550 million
commercial paper program and for various funding purposes. We are in the process
of  increasing  our  commercial  paper  program to $1 billion  and have  already
increased our available credit  facilities  accordingly.  We also have bilateral
agreements available at PSEG, PSE&G and Energy Holdings.

     The following table summarizes the various  revolving credit  facilities of
PSEG,  PSE&G and Energy Holdings as of March 31, 2002.  Power has no such credit
facilities and relies on PSEG for its short-term financing needs.

</TABLE>
     As of March 31, 2002, our  consolidated  total  short-term debt outstanding
was $1.503  billion,  including $689 million of commercial  paper at PSEG,  $284
million of non-recourse short-term financing at Global and $258 million and $272
million   outstanding  under  credit  facilities  and  through  the  uncommitted
bilateral agreement at PSEG and Energy Holdings,  respectively.  In addition, we
have a total of $1.385 billion of long-term debt due within one year,  comprised
of $274  million  at PSEG,  $823  million  at PSE&G and $288  million  at Energy
Holdlings.

     In the ordinary course of business,  we and our subsidiaries have financial
commitments for debt  maturities and general  corporate  purposes.  On April 16,
2002 PSEG filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form S-3 for the issuance of
$1.5 billion of various debt and equity securities.  The registration  statement
is currently under review by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). In the near term,  while we anticipate  that our commitments  could be in
excess of our current short-term funding capacity and internally-generated  cash
flow,  we expect to meet  these  commitments  through  a variety  of  short-term
borrowings  incremental  to  our  existing  commercial  paper  programs,  credit
facilities  and  bilateral  credit  agreements.  It is  expected  that  any such
incremental,  short-term  borrowings would be refinanced through the issuance of
more permanent financing by PSEG.

PSEG
     As of December  31, 2001,  we had  repurchased  approximately  26.5 million
shares of Common Stock, at a cost of approximately  $997 million since 1998. For
the year-ended  December 31, 2001, we had repurchased  approximately 2.3 million
shares of Common Stock, at a cost of approximately $92 million.  The repurchased
shares  have  primarily  been held as treasury  stock with the balance  used for
general  corporate  purposes.  No shares  have been  repurchased  subsequent  to
December  2001.  In addition,  since  December  31, 2001 we have issued  355,491
shares under our Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRASPP).

     Dividend payments on Common Stock for the quarter ended March 31, 2002 were
$0.54 per share and totaled  approximately  $111 million.  Our dividend rate has
remained  constant  since  1992  in  order  to  retain  additional  capital  for
reinvestment  and to reduce the  payout  ratio as  earnings  grow.  Although  we
presently  believe we will have  adequate  earnings  and cash flow in the future
from our  subsidiaries  to maintain common stock dividends at the current level,
earnings  and cash flows  required  to support  the  dividend  will  become more
volatile  as our  business  continues  to change  from one that was  principally
regulated to one that is principally competitive. Future dividends declared will
necessarily  be  dependent  upon our  future  earnings,  cash  flows,  financial
requirements,  alternate  investment  opportunities and other factors.  We would
consider  raising the dividend if our payout ratio  declined to 50% and could be
sustained at that level.

     We have issued Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures in connection
with the issuance of tax deductible preferred  securities.  If payments on these
Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures are deferred,  in accordance with
their  terms,  we may not pay any  dividends  on its  common  stock  until  such
payments become current. Currently, there has been no deferral or default.

     Financial covenants contained in our credit facilities include the ratio of
debt (excluding  non-recourse  project  financings and  securitization  debt and
including  commercial  paper and loans,  certain  letters of credit and  similar
instruments)  to total  capitalization.  At the end of any  quarterly  financial
period  such ratio shall not be more than 0.70 to 1. As of March 31,  2002,  the
ratio of debt to capitalization was 0.64 to 1.

     As noted above, PSEG has filed a registration  statement with the SEC which
is currently under review and has not yet become effective.

PSE&G

     Under its Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
against  previous  additions and  improvements  and/or  retired  Mortgage  Bonds
provided  that its ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  calculated in accordance
with its Mortgage is at least 2:1. At March 31, 2002,  PSE&G's Mortgage coverage
ratio  was  3:1.  As  of  March  31,  2002,  the  Mortgage  would  permit  up to
approximately $1 billion aggregate  principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be
issued against previous  additions and  improvements.  PSE&G will need to obtain
BPU  authorization  to issue any financing  necessary  for its capital  program,
including  refunding of maturing debt and opportunistic  refinancing.  PSE&G has
authorization  from  the BPU to issue  $1  billion  of  long-term  debt  through
December  31,  2003  for  the  refunding  of  maturing  debt  and  opportunistic
refinancing of debt.

     In December 2001,  PSE&G filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form S-3
for the  issuance of $1 billion of debt and tax deferred  preferred  securities,
which was declared effective by the SEC in February 2002.

     Since  1986,  PSE&G has made  regular  cash  payments  to us in the form of
dividends on outstanding shares of PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G paid common stock
dividends of $150  million and $112  million to us for the quarters  ended March
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

     PSE&G has issued Deferrable Interest Subordinated  Debentures in connection
with the issuance of tax deductible preferred  securities.  If payments on those
Deferrable  Interest  Subordinated  Debentures are deferred,  in accordance with
their terms,  PSE&G may not pay any  dividends on its common or preferred  stock
until such default is cured. Currently, there has been no deferral or default.

Power

     Power's  short-term  financing needs will be met using our commercial paper
program or lines of credit discussed above.

Energy Holdings

     As of March 31, 2002,  Energy  Holdings had two separate  senior  revolving
credit facilities with a syndicate of banks as discussed in the table above. The
five-year  facility permits up to $250 million of letters of credit to be issued
of which $14 million are outstanding as of March 31, 2002.

     Financial covenants contained in these facilities include the ratio of cash
flow  available  for debt service  (CFADS) to fixed  charges.  At the end of any
quarterly  financial  period  such  ratio  shall not be less than  1.50x for the
12-month period then ending. As a condition of borrowing, the pro-forma CFADS to
fixed charges  ratio shall not be less than 1.75x as of the quarterly  financial
period ending  immediately  following the first anniversary of each borrowing or
letter of credit issuance. CFADS includes, but is not limited to, operating cash
before  interest  and  taxes,   pre-tax  cash   distributions   from  all  asset
liquidations and equity capital  contributions from us to the extent not used to
fund  investing  activity.  In  addition,  the  ratio of  consolidated  recourse
indebtedness  to  recourse  capitalization,  as at  the  end  of  any  quarterly
financial  period,  shall  not be  greater  than  0.60 to  1.00.  This  ratio is
calculated by dividing the total recourse indebtedness of Energy Holdings by the
total  recourse  capitalization.  This ratio  excludes the debt of PSEG Capital,
which is  supported  by us. As of March 31,  2002,  the  latest 12 months  CFADS
coverage  ratio  was 5.2 and the  ratio of  recourse  indebtedness  to  recourse
capitalization was .43 to 1.

     PSEG Capital has a $650 million MTN program which  provides for the private
placement  of MTNs.  This MTN  program  is  supported  by a  minimum  net  worth
maintenance  agreement  between PSEG Capital and us which provides,  among other
things,  that we (1)  maintain its  ownership,  directly or  indirectly,  of all
outstanding common stock of PSEG Capital,  (2) cause PSEG Capital to have at all
times a positive tangible net worth of at least $100,000 and (3) make sufficient
contributions  of liquid assets to PSEG Capital in order to permit it to pay its
debt  obligations.  We will  eliminate  our support of PSEG  Capital debt by the
second quarter of 2003, as required by the Focused Audit.  At March 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2001, total debt outstanding under the MTN program was $480 million
and $480 million, respectively maturing from 2002 to 2003.

Capital Requirements

     Power's  capital  needs will be  dictated  by its  strategy  to continue to
develop as a profitable, growth-oriented supplier in the wholesale power market.
PSE&G's  construction  expenditures  are  primarily  to maintain  the safety and
reliability of its electric and gas transmission and distribution facilities. We
plan to continue the growth of  Resources.  Global has  refocused  its strategy,
from one of  accelerated  growth to one that places  emphasis on increasing  the
efficiency  and returns of its existing  assets.  We are  evaluating  the future
prospects and opportunities of Energy Technologies' business.

     For the quarter ended March 31, 2002,  we made net plant  additions of $373
million,  excluding  Allowance  for Funds Used  During  Construction  (AFDC) and
capitalized interest. The majority of these additions,  $216 million,  primarily
related to Power for  developing  the  Lawrenceburg,  Indiana and the Waterford,
Ohio sites and adding  capacity to the Bergen and Linden stations in New Jersey.
In  addition,   PSE&G  had  net  plant  additions  of  $80  million  related  to
improvements in its transmission and distribution  system, gas system and common
facilities.  Also,  Energy  Holdings'  subsidiaries  made  investments  totaling
approximately   $77  million  for  the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2002.  These
investments  included  investments  by Resources and  additional  investments in
existing  domestic and international  facilities at Global.  The $373 million of
net  plant  additions  and $77  million  of  investments  were  included  in our
forecasted expenditures for the year.

Accounting Matters

     For a discussion of SFAS 142, SFAS 143 and SFAS 144, see Note 2. Accounting
Matters and Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Other Accounting Matters

     Our most critical  accounting  policies include the application of SFAS No.
71  "Accounting  for the Effects of Certain Types of  Regulation"  (SFAS 71) for
PSE&G, our regulated  transmission and  distribution  business;  Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) 98-10,  "Accounting  for Contracts  Involved in Energy Trading
and Risk Management Activities" (EITF 98-10) and EITF 99-19,  "Reporting Revenue
Gross as a  Principal  versus  Net as an Agent"  (EITF  99-19),  for our  Energy
Trading  business;  SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and
Hedging  Activities",  as amended (SFAS 133), to account for our various hedging
transactions;  SFAS  52,  "Foreign  Currency  Translation"  and its  impacts  on
Global's  foreign  investments;  and SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 and  their  potential
impacts on our various investments.

Accounting for the Effects of Regulation

     PSE&G prepares its financial  statements in accordance  with the provisions
of SFAS No. 71, which differs in certain  respects from the  application of GAAP
by non-regulated  businesses. In general, SFAS 71 recognizes that accounting for
rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As
a result,  a regulated  utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (a
regulatory asset) or the recognition of obligations (a regulatory  liability) if
it  is  probable  that,  through  the  rate-making  process,  there  will  be  a
corresponding  increase  or  decrease in future  rates.  Accordingly,  PSE&G has
deferred certain costs, which will be amortized over various future periods.  To
the extent that  collection of such costs or payment of liabilities is no longer
probable  as a result  of  changes  in  regulation  and/or  PSE&G's  competitive
position, the associated regulatory asset or liability is charged or credited to
income.

     As a result of New Jersey  deregulation  legislation and regulatory  orders
issued by the BPU, certain regulatory assets and liabilities were recorded.  Two
of these  items  will have a  significant  effect on our annual  earnings.  They
include the  estimated  amount of MTC  revenues to be collected in excess of the
authorized amount of $540 million and the amount of excess electric distribution
depreciation reserves.

     The MTC was  authorized by the BPU as an  opportunity to recover up to $540
million (net of tax) of our unsecuritized generation-related stranded costs on a
net  present  value  basis.  As a result of the  appellate  reviews of the Final
Order, PSE&G's securitization transaction was delayed until the first quarter of
2001,  causing a delay in the  implementation of the  Securitization  Transition
Charge  (STC)  which  would have  reduced  the MTC.  As a result,  MTC was being
recovered at a faster rate than intended under the Final Order and a significant
overrecovery  was probable.  In order to properly  recognize the recovery of the
allowed unsecuritized  stranded costs over the transition period, PSE&G recorded
a regulatory liability and Power recorded a charge to net income of $88 million,
pre-tax,  or $52  million,  after  tax,  in the  third  quarter  of 2000 for the
cumulative   amount  of   estimated   collections   in  excess  of  the  allowed
unsecuritized  stranded  costs from August 1, 1999 through  September  30, 2000.
PSE&G then began  deferring a portion of these  revenues each month to recognize
the estimated collections in excess of the allowed unsecuritized stranded costs.
As of March 31, 2002,  this  deferred  amount was $177 million and is aggregated
with the  Societal  Benefits  Clause.  After  deferrals,  pre-tax  MTC  revenues
recognized  were $220 million in 1999, $239 million in 2000, and $196 million in
2001. In 2002 and 2003, we expect to record  approximately  $90 million and $121
million, respectively.

     The amortization of the Excess Depreciation  Reserve is another significant
regulatory  liability  affecting  our  earnings.  As required by the BPU,  PSE&G
reduced its depreciation  reserve for its electric  distribution  assets by $569
million and recorded such amount as a regulatory  liability to be amortized over
the period from January 1, 2000 to July 31, 2003.  Through March 31, 2002,  $287
million had been amortized and recorded as a reduction of  depreciation  expense
pursuant to the Final Order, of which $37 million relates to 2002. The remaining
$282 million will be amortized through July 31, 2003.

     See  Note 3.  Regulatory  Assets  and  Liabilities  of  Notes  for  further
discussion of these and other regulatory issues.

Accounting, Valuation and Presentation of Our Energy Trading Business

     Accounting - We account for our energy trading  business in accordance with
the provisions of EITF 98-10,  which  requires that energy trading  contracts be
marked to market with gains and losses included in current earnings.

     Valuation - Since the majority of our energy  trading  contracts have terms
of less than two years,  valuations for these  contracts are readily  obtainable
from the market  exchanges,  such as PJM, and over the counter  quotations.  The
valuations  also  include a credit  reserve  and a liquidity  reserve,  which is
determined using financial quotation systems,  monthly bid-ask prices and spread
percentages.  We have consistently  applied this valuation  methodology for each
reporting  period  presented.  The fair  values  of these  contracts  and a more
detailed   discussion  of  credit  risk  are  reflected  in  Note  5.  Financial
Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management.

     Presentation  - EITF  99-19  provided  guidance  on the issue of  whether a
company  should report  revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer
or the net amount  retained.  The guidance  states that whether a company should
recognize  revenue based on the gross amount billed or the net retained requires
significant  judgment,  which depends on the relevant  facts and  circumstances.
Based on the analysis  and  interpretation  of EITF 99-19,  we report all of the
energy trading  revenues and energy  trading-related  costs on a gross basis for
physical  bilateral  energy and capacity sales and  purchases.  We report swaps,
futures,  option premiums,  firm transmission  rights,  transmission  congestion
credits,  and purchases and sales of emission  allowances on a net basis. One of
the  primary  drivers  of our  determination  that  these  contracts  should  be
presented on a gross basis was that we retain counterparty risk.

SFAS 133 - Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

     SFAS 133  established  accounting  and reporting  standards for  derivative
instruments,   including  certain  derivative   instruments  embedded  in  other
contracts,  and for hedging  activities.  It requires an entity to recognize the
fair  value of  derivative  instruments  held as  assets or  liabilities  on the
balance sheet. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective  portion of the change
in the fair value of a derivative  instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is
reported in OCI, net of tax, or as a Regulatory  Asset  (Liability).  Amounts in
accumulated  OCI are  ultimately  recognized in earnings when the related hedged
forecasted  transaction  occurs. The change in the fair value of the ineffective
portion of the derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded
in earnings.  Derivative instruments that have not been designated as hedges are
adjusted to fair value through earnings. We have entered into several derivative
instruments,  including  hedges  of  anticipated  electric  and  gas  purchases,
interest rate swaps and foreign  currency  hedges which have been  designated as
cash flow hedges.

     The fair value of the derivative  instruments is determined by reference to
quoted market prices, listed contracts,  published quotations or quotations from
counterparties.  In the absence thereof, we utilize mathematical models based on
current  and  historical  data.  The fair  value of most of our  derivatives  is
determined based upon quoted market prices. Therefore, the effect on earnings of
valuations from our models is minimal.

     For additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments,  See
Note 5 - Financial  Instruments  Energy Trading and Risk Management - Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities of Notes.

SFAS 52 - Foreign Currency Translation

     Our financial statements are prepared using the $US Dollar as the reporting
currency.  In accordance with SFAS 52 "Foreign  Currency  Translation",  foreign
operations  whose  functional  currency  is  deemed  to be the  local  (foreign)
currency,  asset and  liability  accounts  are  translated  into $US  Dollars at
current  exchange  rates and revenues and  expenses  are  translated  at average
exchange rates prevailing  during the period.  Translation gains and losses (net
of applicable deferred taxes) are not included in determining net income but are
reported  in other  comprehensive  income.  Gains  and  losses  on  transactions
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the
results of operations as incurred.

     The determination of an entity's functional currency requires  management's
judgment.  It is  based  on an  assessment  of the  primary  currency  in  which
transactions  in the local  environment  are  conducted,  and  whether the local
currency can be relied upon as a stable  currency in which to conduct  business.
As economic  and  business  conditions  change,  we are required to reassess the
economic  environment and determine the  appropriate  functional  currency.  The
impact of  foreign  currency  accounting  has had and could  continue  to have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation and net
cash flows. See Note 4. Commitments and Contingent  Liabilities for a discussion
of the  change in  functional  currency  of  EDEERSA  from the $US Dollar to the
Argentine Peso.

Accounting for the Effects of Goodwill

     Our 2002 earnings will likely be materially  impacted by the application of
SFAS 142. This new standard,  effective in January 2002,  requires the amount of
any goodwill  impairment  to be disclosed in the second  quarter and recorded by
the fourth quarter of 2002,  applied  retroactively  to the first  quarter.  The
basic difference between previous  accounting  guidance and this new standard is
that a  discounted  cash  flow  test  must be  performed  to test  goodwill  for
impairment  under the new standard,  compared to an undiscounted  cash flow test
required under the old standard. The new test must be completed using data as of
January  1,  2002.  Any  amounts  impaired  using  data as of that  date will be
recorded as a "Cumulative Effect of an Accounting Change".  Any amounts impaired
under the new test using data after that date will be recorded above the line in
Operating Expenses. The discounted cash flow tests require broad assumptions and
significant judgment to be exercised by management. This includes projections of
future  energy  prices,  customer  demand,  operating  costs,  rate  relief from
regulators,  customer  growth and many other  items.  While we believe  that our
assumptions  are  reasonable,   actual  results  will  likely  differ  from  our
projections.

     As of March 31, 2002, the carrying  value of unamortized  goodwill was $621
million,  of which  $451  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  Global's
acquisitions  of Sociedad  Austral de Electricidad  S.A.  (SAESA) and Empresa de
Electricidad  de los Andes S.A.  (Electroandes)  in Chile and Peru in August and
December of 2001,  respectively.  For the  year-ended  December  31,  2001,  the
amortization expense related to goodwill was $3 million.

     As of March 31,  2002,  our pro-rata  share of goodwill  included in equity
method  investees  totaled $378 million.  In accordance with generally  accepted
accounting  principles,  such goodwill is not consolidated on our balance sheet.
Our share of the  amortization  expense  related to such goodwill was $8 million
for the year-ended December 31, 2001.  However,  this goodwill is subject to the
same impairment testing under SFAS 142 at the local entities.

     We are in the  process  of  finalizing  our  evaluation  of the  effect  of
adopting  SFAS 142 on the recorded  amount of goodwill at RGE,  EDEERSA,  Energy
Technologies  and Tanir Bavi. It is likely that the entire carrying value of the
goodwill at EDEERSA and Energy  Technologies  is completely  impaired,  that the
goodwill at RGE up to approximately half of the recorded carrying value could be
impaired, and that the goodwill at Tanir Bavi could be impaired. The goodwill at
EDEERSA is included in the $585 million of investment  exposure  associated with
our assets in Argentina.

     As of March 31,  2002,  our  unamortized  goodwill  and  pro-rata  share of
goodwill in equity method investees was as follows:

     As of December 31, 2001 goodwill was $1.024 billion.  As of March 31, 2002,
we had  goodwill of $999  million.  The  decrease of $25 million  from  year-end
represents  a purchase  price  adjustment  with  respect to our  acquisition  of
Electroandes.

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets

     On January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting  for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets" (SFAS 144).  The impact of adopting SFAS 144 did
not have an effect on our financial position and statement of operations.  Under
SFAS 144,  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of are  measured  at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell,  whether reported in continued
operations or in discontinued operations. Discontinued operations will no longer
be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that
have not yet  occurred.  SFAS 144 also  broadens the  reporting of  discontinued
operations.  A long-lived asset must be tested for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may be impaired.

     As previously  disclosed,  we have approximately $585 million of investment
exposure in  Argentina.  Due to the  economic,  political  and social  crisis in
Argentina,  our investments  there are faced with  considerable  fiscal and cash
flow  uncertainties.  As a result of these events,  an impairment  test of these
investments is required.  However,  due to the vast  uncertainty  related to the
situation in Argentina,  reasonable  assumptions  related to the  environment in
Argentina cannot be easily made. As the situation  continues to evolve,  we will
be able to develop assumptions related to the environment in Argentina and these
investments and will complete our impairment test.

     In  addition  to  impairment  testing  for the  Argentine  investments,  an
impairment test for Energy Technologies is also being done as negative operating
cash flow of certain parts of that entity indicate a potential impairment. These
tests are required  whenever events or circumstances  indicate an impairment may
exist.  Examples of potential  events which could require an impairment test are
when power prices become  depressed for a prolonged  period in a market,  when a
foreign  currency  significantly  devalues,  or  when  an  investment  generates
negative  operating cash flows. Any potential  impairments of these  investments
are recorded above the line. For  additional  information  relating to potential
asset impairments, see Note 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market  risk  inherent  in our market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange rates,  commodity prices, equity security prices, and interest rates as
discussed  in the  notes  to the  financial  statements.  Our  policy  is to use
derivatives  to manage  risk  consistent  with our  business  plans and  prudent
practices.  We have a Risk Management  Committee comprised of executive officers
which utilizes an independent risk oversight  function to ensure compliance with
corporate policies and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Contracts

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand,  state and federal  regulatory  policies and other events. To
reduce  price  risk  caused by market  fluctuations,  we enter  into  derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties, to hedge our anticipated demand. These contracts, in conjunction
with  owned  electric  generation  capacity,  are  designed  to cover  estimated
electric customer commitments.

     We use a  value-at-risk  (VAR)  model  to  assess  the  market  risk of our
commodity  business.  This model includes fixed price sales  commitments,  owned
generation,   native  load   requirements,   physical  contracts  and  financial
derivative  instruments.  VAR  represents  the  potential  gains or  losses  for
instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time
period and confidence  level.  PSEG estimates VAR across its commodity  business
using a model with historical volatilities and correlations.

     Our Board of Directors  has  established a VAR Threshold of $75 million and
the Risk Management Committee (RMC) has established an internal VAR threshold of
$50 million for Power. If the $50 million  threshold was reached,  the RMC would
be notified  and the  portfolio  would be closely  monitored  to reduce risk and
potential adverse movements.

     The measured VAR using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95% confidence
level  and  assuming  a  one-week   time  horizon  as  of  March  31,  2002  was
approximately  $22  million,  compared  to the  December  31,  2001 level of $18
million  which  was   calculated   using  various   controls  and   conservative
assumptions,  such as a 50%  success  rate in the BGS  Auction.  This  estimate,
however, is not necessarily  indicative of actual results,  which may differ due
to the fact that actual  market  rate  fluctuations  may differ from  forecasted
fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio of hedging  instruments may
change over the holding  period and due to certain  assumptions  embedded in the
calculation.

Credit Risk

     Counterparties  expose us to credit losses in the event of  non-performance
or  non-payment.  We have a credit  management  process which is used to assess,
monitor and mitigate counterparty  exposure for us and our subsidiaries.  In the
event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty,  there may be a
material  adverse  impact  on our and  our  subsidiaries'  financial  condition,
results of operations or net cash flows.

     Credit risk  relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of
non-performance  by  counterparties  pursuant to the terms of their  contractual
obligations.  We have established credit policies that we believe  significantly
minimize  credit  risk.  These  policies  include  an  evaluation  of  potential
counterparties'  financial  condition  (including  credit  rating),   collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements,
which may allow for the netting of positive  and negative  exposures  associated
with a single counterparty.

     As a result of the BGS auction,  Power has contracted to provide generating
capacity to the direct suppliers of New Jersey's electric  utilities,  including
PSE&G,  commencing  August 1, 2002.  These  bilateral  contracts  are subject to
credit risk. This credit risk relates to the ability of  counterparties  to meet
their payment obligations for the power delivered under each BGS contract.  This
risk is substantially  higher than the risk associated with potential nonpayment
by PSE&G  under  the BGS  contract  expiring  July  31,  2002  since  PSE&G is a
rate-regulated  entity.  Any failure to collect these payments under the new BGS
contracts could have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows,
and financial position.

Foreign Operations

     As of March 31, 2002, Global and Resources had  approximately  $3.5 billion
and $1.4 billion,  respectively,  of international assets. As of March 31, 2002,
foreign  assets  represented  19% of our  consolidated  assets and the  revenues
related to those foreign assets contributed 6% to consolidated  revenues for the
quarter  ended March 31,  2002.  For  discussion  of foreign  currency  risk and
potential asset impairments related to our investments in Argentina, see Note 5.
Financial  Instruments  Energy Trading and Risk Management,  Note 4. Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets located in Austria, Australia,  Belgium, China, Germany, the Netherlands,
United  Kingdom,  and New Zealand with associated  revenues  denominated in U.S.
Dollars and therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

     Global's  international  investments  are  primarily  in projects  that are
presently or upon completion are expected to generate or distribute  electricity
in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile, China,  India,  Italy, Peru, Poland,  Tunisia and
Venezuela.  Investing in foreign  countries  involves certain  additional risks.
Economic  conditions  that result in higher  comparative  rates of  inflation in
foreign  countries are likely to result in declining  values in such  countries'
currencies.  As currencies  fluctuate  against the $US, there is a corresponding
change  in  Global's  investment  value  in terms of the  $US.  Such  change  is
reflected  as an  increase  or  decrease  in  the  investment  value  and  Other
Comprehensive  Income, a separate component of Stockholder's Equity. As of March
31, 2002, net foreign currency  devaluations have reduced the reported amount of
our total  Stockholder's  Equity by $320  million,  of which $159  million,  $84
million and $63 million were caused by the  devaluation  of the Brazilian  Real,
Chilean Peso and Argentine Peso, respectively.

                            ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Certain  information  reported  under  Item 3 of Part I of  Public  Service
Enterprise  Group  Incorporated's  (PSEG)  2001  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K is
updated below.

     New Matter. On November 15, 2001,  Consolidated  Edison,  Inc. (Con Edison)
filed a complaint  against  PSE&G at the Federal  Energy  Regulatory  Commission
(FERC) pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act asserting that PSE&G had
breached  agreements covering 1,000 MW of transmission by curtailing service and
failing to  maintain  sufficient  system  capacity to satisfy all of its service
obligations.  PSE&G denied the  allegations  set forth in the  complaint.  While
finding that Con Edison's presentation of evidence failed to demonstrate several
of the allegations,  on April 26, 2002, FERC found sufficient  reason to set the
complaint for hearing. The hearing will be conducted on an expedited basis, with
an Initial  Decision  to be issued by the end of May and a FERC order by the end
of June. If Con Edison is successful,  PSE&G could be required to provide future
transmission services with uneconomic generation resources at a substantial cost
to PSE&G.  PSE&G  believes it has complied  with the terms of the  Agreement and
will vigorously defend its position. The nature and cost of any remedy, which is
expected to be prospective only, cannot be predicted. Docket No. EL02-23-000.

                           ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

     Certain information  reported under PSEG's 2001 Annual Report to the SEC is
updated  below.  References are to the related pages on the Form 10-K as printed
and distributed.

Gas Contract Transfer

     Form  10-K,  page 16.  On  August  11,  2000,  PSE&G  filed a gas  merchant
restructuring plan with the BPU. The BPU approved an amended stipulation,  which
authorized the transfer of PSE&G's gas supply business, including its interstate
capacity,  storage  and  gas  supply  contracts  to  ER&T  which  will,  under a
requirements contract, provide gas supply to PSE&G to serve its Basic Gas Supply
Service (BGSS) customers. The transfer took place on May 1, 2002. On May 1, 2002
the Ratepayer Advocate requested rehearing by the BPU of its decision,  but did
not seek a stay.

     The gas contract  transfer is expected to reduce volatility in PSE&G's cash
flows;  however,  ER&T will bear the increased  commodity  risk. Gas residential
commodity  costs are currently  recovered  through  adjustment  charges that are
periodically  trued-up  to  actual  costs  and  reset.  After  the gas  contract
transfer, PSE&G will pay ER&T for gas provided to PSE&G for its gas distribution
customers. Industrial and commercial BGSS customers will be priced under PSE&G's
Market Priced Gas Service (MPGS).  Residential  BGSS customers will remain under
current  pricing  until  April 1, 2004,  after  which,  subject  to further  BPU
approval those residential gas customers would also move to MPGS service.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)

     Form 10-K,  page 18. A  pressurized  water  reactor  nuclear unit (PWR) not
owned by us was recently  identified  with a degradation  of the reactor  vessel
head, which forms part of the pressure  boundary for the reactor coolant system.
In March 2002, the NRC issued a bulletin  2002-01,  requiring that all operators
of PWR units submit  information  concerning:  (i) the  integrity of the reactor
coolant  pressure  boundary,  (ii)  inspections  that  have  been  and  will  be
undertaken to satisfy applicable  regulatory  requirements,  and (iii) the basis
for concluding that plants satisfy applicable regulatory requirements related to
the structural integrity of the reactor coolant pressure boundary.  In April, we
provided the requested information for Salem Nuclear Generation Station (Salem).
The response included an assessment that primary water stress corrosion cracking
of the control rod drive mechanism nozzles at Salem Units 1 and 2 is unlikely in
the near term, and our assurance that both Salem Units 1 and 2 are in compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements. A visual inspection of the Salem Unit 2
reactor head has been  completed  during the current  refueling  outage,  and no
evidence of reactor vessel head degradation was found. A similar  inspection was
performed at Salem Unit 1 in 2001,  which also found no evidence of degradation.
Our Hope Creek  nuclear unit and our interests in the Peach Bottom units 2 and 3
are  unaffected  as they are Boiling  Water  Reactor  nuclear  units.  We cannot
predict what other actions the NRC may take on this issue.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

     Form 10-K,  page 26.  Under the NWPA,  the DOE was required to begin taking
possession of all spent nuclear fuel generated by our nuclear units for disposal
by no later than 1998. DOE construction of a permanent disposal facility has not
begun and DOE has  announced  that it does not expect a facility to be available
earlier than 2010.

     In February  2002,  President  Bush announced that Yucca Mountain in Nevada
would be the permanent  disposal  facility for nuclear wastes. On April 8, 2002,
the  Governor of Nevada  submitted  his veto to the siting  decision.  On May 8,
2002,  the U.S. House of  Representatives  approved a resolution to override the
veto. The issue now awaits a vote by the U.S. Senate, which is expected in early
July. No assurances can be given regarding the final outcome of this matter.
<PAGE>
Employee Relations

     Form  10-K,  page  20.  As  previously  disclosed,   PSE&G  has  collective
bargaining arrangements with the Utility Co-Workers Association, (UWUA) covering
approximately  1,400 employees  primarily in the customer  operations area. This
contract  expired on April 30,  2002,  and was  extended  through May 6, 2002. A
tentative agreement was reached on May 7, 2002, and is subject to a ratification
vote by union membership.

Water Pollution Control

     Form 10-K, page 23. The EPA is conducting a rulemaking  under Federal Water
Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) Section 316(b),  which requires that cooling water
intake  structures  reflect the best  technology  available (BTA) for minimizing
"adverse  environmental impact". Phase I of the rule became effective on January
17, 2002.  None of the projects that we currently have under  construction or in
development  is subject to the Phase I rule. EPA published for public comment on
April 9, 2002  proposed  draft  Phase II rules  covering  large  existing  power
plants,  and is  expected to issue  final  rules by August 28,  2003.  The draft
regulations  propose to regulate existing power plants that have a design intake
flow of 50 Million  Gallons per Day or greater and use at least 25% of the water
for cooling purposes.  The draft regulations propose to establish three means of
demonstrating that a facility has BTA at an intake; two of which would be linked
to  demonstrating  compliance with specific  performance  criteria and the third
requiring  a  determination  by the  permitting  authority  that a  case-by-case
demonstration would be warranted. The proposed uniform performance standards are
applicable  to  subsets  of  facilities  based on  waterbody  type and  capacity
utilization rate. The content of the final Phase II rules cannot be predicted at
this time,  although it is  reasonable to expect that the rule will apply to all
of our steam  electric  and  combined  cycle units that use  surface  waters for
cooling  purposes.  If the Phase II rules require  retrofitting of cooling water
intake  structures  at  our  existing   facilities,   meeting  the  specific  or
performance criteria,  identified as an option under the draft rule, the cost of
complying with the rules would be material.

New Matter

     Approximately  150,000  tons of fly ash  generated  by  Hudson  and  Mercer
Generating  Stations was taken by the ash marketer we then  employed and sold to
the owner and operator of a clay mine in Monroe Township, New Jersey. During the
Fall of 1997  through the Fall of 1998,  the owner and operator of the clay mine
used the fly ash as fill  material  to return  the mine  site to grade,  without
obtaining the necessary  approvals from NJDEP. Upon discovery of this use of the
material,  we  terminated  the  services  of this  ash  marketer  and  initiated
discussions  with NJDEP for the appropriate  regulatory  approvals to allow this
material to remain at the site.  NJDEP  likely will require a clay cap and other
engineering  controls to ensure that the ash is isolated from the environment if
the ash is left in place. Our negotiations with NJDEP and the property owner are
continuing.  Our cost of  resolving  this matter will depend upon the results of
our negotiations with NJDEP and the property owner.  Although the precise extent
of liability is not currently estimable, it is not expected to be material.
