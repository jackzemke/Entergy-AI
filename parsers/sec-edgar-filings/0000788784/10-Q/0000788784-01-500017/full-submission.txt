                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.  Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

     Public Service  Enterprise  Group  Incorporated  (PSEG) is an exempt public
utility   holding   company  which  has  four  principal   direct   wholly-owned
subsidiaries:  Public Service Electric and Gas Company  (PSE&G),  PSEG Power LLC
(Power),   PSEG  Energy  Holdings  Inc.  (Energy  Holdings)  and  PSEG  Services
Corporation (Services).

Basis of Presentation

     The financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).  Certain
information  and note  disclosures  normally  included in  financial  statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles have been
condensed or omitted  pursuant to such rules and  regulations.  However,  in the
opinion of  management,  the  disclosures  are adequate to make the  information
presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements and Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes) should be read in conjunction with the
Notes  contained in PSEG's 2000 Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  These Notes update
and supplement matters discussed in PSEG's 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     The unaudited  financial  information  furnished  reflects all  adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for the interim periods presented. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were
derived from the audited  consolidated  financial  statements included in PSEG's
2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain  reclassifications of prior period data
have been made to conform with the current presentation.

Note 2.  Accounting Matters

     In July 2000,  the  Emerging  Issues Task Force  (EITF)  99-19,  "Reporting
Revenue  Gross as a Principal  versus Net as an Agent"  (EITF  99-19),  provided
guidance on the issue of whether a company  should  report  revenue based on the
gross  amount  billed to the customer or the net amount  retained.  The guidance
states that whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount
billed or the net retained requires significant  judgment,  which depends on the
relevant  facts and  circumstances.  In the first quarter of 2001,  based on the
analysis and  interpretation  of EITF 99-19,  PSEG reported all the revenues and
cost of goods sold on a gross  basis for the energy  related  transactions.  The
prior year financial statements for PSEG and its subsidiaries have been restated
for comparability purposes.

     The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  133,  Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,  as amended,  which  became  effective  on
January  1, 2001.  Under  SFAS 133,  certain  contracts  that were not  formerly
considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative. PSEG adopted
SFAS 133  effective  January 1,  2001.  In  accordance  with SFAS No.  133,  all
derivative  instruments  (including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
other  contracts) are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values.  The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative designated
as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or
liability or a firm  commitment,  the gain or loss is  recognized in earnings in
the period of change in tandem  with the  offsetting  loss or gain on the hedged
item  attributable  to the risk being hedged.  For a derivative  designated as a
hedge of future cash flows, the effective  portion of the  derivative's  gain or
loss is  initially  reported as a component  of Other  Comprehensive  Income and
subsequently  reclassified  into Earnings along with the related  effects of the
hedged item. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in Earnings
immediately.  Additionally,  contracts  that do not in their  entirety  meet the
definition of a derivative  instrument,  may contain  implicit or explicit terms
that  affect  some or all of the  cash  flows or the  value  of other  exchanges
required by the contract in a manner similar to a derivative  instrument.  These
implicit or explicit terms are considered "embedded  derivatives." The effect of
embedding a  derivative  instrument  in another type of contract is that some or
all of the cash flows or other exchanges that otherwise would be required by the
contract, will be modified based on one or more underlying.  Embedded derivative
instruments  are required to be  accounted  for as a  derivative  instrument  in
accordance  with SFAS 133 if certain  criteria  are met.  PSEG does not have any
fair value hedges,  nor does it hold any derivatives  that are not designated as
hedges. See Note 9, Adoption of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standard No.
133.

     The Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Derivative Implementation
Group  (DIG),  has  issued  tentative   guidance  regarding  certain  derivative
contracts and eligibility of those contracts for the normal  purchases and sales
exceptions.  PSEG and its subsidiaries  are currently  evaluating this tentative
guidance and cannot  predict the impact on its financial  position or results of
operations, however, such impact could be material.

Note 3.  Regulatory Issues

New Jersey Energy Master Plan Proceedings and Related Orders

     In August 1999, following the enactment of the New Jersey Electric Discount
and Energy  Competition  Act,  the New Jersey  Board of Public  Utilities  (BPU)
rendered a Final Order relating to PSE&G's rate  unbundling,  stranded costs and
restructuring  proceedings (Final Order) providing,  among other things, for the
transfer to an affiliate of all of PSE&G's electric generation facilities, plant
and  equipment  for $2.443  billion and all other  related  property,  including
materials,  supplies  and  fuel at the net book  value  thereof,  together  with
associated rights and liabilities.

     Also in the Final Order,  the BPU concluded that PSE&G should recover up to
$2.94  billion (net of tax) of its  generation-related  stranded  costs  through
securitization  of $2.4 billion and an opportunity to recover up to $540 million
(net of tax) of its  unsecuritized  generation-related  stranded  costs on a net
present  value basis.  The $540 million is subject to recovery  through a market
transition  charge  (MTC).  Following  the issuance of the Final Order,  the BPU
issued  its  order  approving   PSE&G's   petition   relating  to  the  proposed
securitization transaction (Finance Order) which authorized, among other things,
the  imposition  of a  non-bypassable  transition  bond charge  (TBC) on PSE&G's
customers;   the  sale  of  PSE&G's   property   right  in  such   charge  to  a
bankruptcy-remote  financing entity;  the issuance and sale of $2.525 billion of
transition  bonds by such  entity  as  consideration  for such  property  right,
including an estimated $125 million of transaction costs; and the application by
PSE&G of the transition bond proceeds to retire outstanding debt and/or equity.

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Continued

     In October and November 1999,  appeals were filed  challenging the validity
of the Finance Order,  as well as the Final Order.  In April 2000, the Appellate
Division of the New Jersey  Superior  Court  unanimously  rejected the arguments
made by appellants and affirmed the Final Order and Finance Order.  In May 2000,
the appellants  requested the New Jersey Supreme Court to review certain aspects
of the Appellate Division  decision.  In July 2000, the New Jersey Supreme Court
granted the requests of the New Jersey Business User's Coalition, the New Jersey
Ratepayer  Advocate and Co-Steel  Raritan,  an  individual  PSE&G  customer.  On
December 6, 2000,  by a vote of 4 to 1, the New Jersey  Supreme Court issued its
order affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division. The 10-day period during
which a party may request reconsideration of this order has expired and thus the
New Jersey Supreme Court decision is final. As with any New Jersey Supreme Court
decision,  a party may request the court to enlarge this 10-day period under its
rules.  However,  Management  believes  that,  in light of the  language  of the
court's  order  determining  that it is in the public  interest to expedite  the
disposition  of the  appeals,  this  relief  would  be  extraordinary  and  that
reconsideration  would not be granted in any event. Although the opinions of the
New Jersey  Supreme Court  justices  relating to the order have not been issued,
that does not affect the finality of the order.

     In August 2000, in compliance with the Final Order,  PSE&G  transferred its
electric  generation  business to Power and its  subsidiaries  in  exchange  for
Power's promissory note in the amount of $2.786 billion.

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed   securities)   were   issued  by  PSE&G   Transition   Funding   LLC,  a
bankruptcy-remote,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of PSE&G,  in eight  classes  with
maturities  ranging  from 1 year to 15 years.  Also on January 31,  2001,  PSE&G
received  payment  from  Power on its  $2.786  billion  promissory  note used to
finance  the  transfer  of its  generation  business.  The  proceeds  from these
transactions  were used to pay for certain debt  issuance and related  costs for
securitization,  retire a portion of PSE&G's outstanding short-term debt, reduce
PSE&G common equity, loan funds to PSEG and make various short-term investments.

     On  March  6,  2001,  Co-Steel  filed a  Petition  of  Writ  of  Certiorari
(Petition)  with the United States  Supreme Court seeking  limited review of the
New  Jersey  Supreme  Court   decision,   the  granting  of  which  is  entirely
discretionary  with the Court.  In order to be considered,  the Petition must be
made within 90 days of the final state supreme court order and must  demonstrate
that an important  federal question was decided by the state court. The Clerk of
the United  States  Supreme Court (Clerk) has directed that briefs in opposition
to the Petition  will be due 30 days after the New Jersey  written  opinions are
received.  On March 19,  2001,  the RPA filed a letter with the Clerk asking the
Court to confirm that the RPA was not  otherwise out of time to file a Petition.
The Clerk indicated in response that the time for requesting certiorari began to
run on December 6, 2000.

Asset Transfer to Power

     As noted above,  PSE&G  transferred  its electric  generating  business and
wholesale  power  contracts to Power and its  subsidiaries  in August 2000.  The
transfer  price,  as  specified in the BPU order,  was $2.443  billion plus $343
million  for other  generating  related  assets  and  liabilities.  Because  the
transfer was between  affiliates,  PSE&G and Power  recorded the sale at the net
book value of the assets and  liabilities  rather than the transfer  price.  The
difference  between  the  total  transfer  price  and the net book  value of the
generation-related  assets and liabilities was recorded as an equity  adjustment
on PSE&G's and Power's respective Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts are
eliminated  on PSEG's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Power  settled  the
promissory  note on January 31, 2001,  with funds provided from PSEG in the form
of equity and loans.

Note 5.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Pending Asset Purchases

     Delmarva Power and Light Company (DP&L) and Atlantic City Electric  Company
(ACE),  subsidiaries of Conectiv,  are co-owners of the Salem Nuclear Generating
Station  (Salem) and the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station  (Peach  Bottom) with
Power  and  Exelon  Generation  LLC  (Exelon).  Additionally,  Power and ACE are
co-owners of the Hope Creek  Generating  Station  (Hope Creek).  In 1999,  Power
entered into  agreements  with Conectiv,  DP&L, ACE and Exelon pursuant to which
Power would  acquire all of DP&L's and ACE's  interests  in Salem and Hope Creek
and half of DP&L's and ACE's  interest in Peach Bottom (a total of 544 MW) for a
purchase  price of $15.4  million plus the net book value of nuclear fuel at the
respective  closing dates. In December 2000, the DP&L portion of the transaction
(246 MW) closed.  In October 2000,  Power  entered into a Wholesale  Transaction
Confirmation  agreement (Agreement) with ACE under which Power obtains 298 MW of
generation  capacity and output  representing  the portion of ACE's  interest in
Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom to be acquired.  Under this Agreement,  Power
receives  all  revenue  and pays all  expenses  associated  with  this 298 MW of
generating  capacity and output  through the date that the purchase  transaction
closes.  Power has been  advised by Conectiv  that the  Ratepayer  Advocate,  by
letter to the BPU dated October 26, 2000,  has objected to and  challenged  this
financial transaction.

Hazardous Waste

     The New Jersey Department of Environmental  Protection (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of environmental investigations
and  remediations,  where  necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface
water bodies.  Power and predecessor  companies  owned and/or  operated  certain
facilities situated on surface water bodies,  certain of which are currently the
subject of remedial  activities.  The financial  impact of these  regulations on
these projects is not currently  estimable.  PSEG does not  anticipate  that the
compliance  with these  regulations  will have a material  adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations or net cash flows.

Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

     PSE&G is  currently  working  with the NJDEP  under a program  (Remediation
Program) to assess,  investigate  and,  if  necessary,  remediate  environmental
conditions at PSE&G's  former  manufactured  gas plant sites.  To date, 38 sites
have been  identified.  The  Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and
revised  by  PSE&G  based  on  regulatory  requirements,   experience  with  the
Remediation Program and available remediation technologies.  The long-term costs
of the  Remediation  Program cannot be reasonably  estimated,  but experience to
date indicates that  approximately $20 million per year could be incurred over a
period of about 30 years and that the overall cost could be material.  The costs
for this remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

     Net  of  recoveries,   costs  incurred  through  March  31,  2001  for  the
Remediation  Program amounted to $129 million.  In addition,  at March 31, 2001,
PSE&G's  estimated  liability for remediation  costs through 2003 aggregated $74
million. Expenditures beyond 2003 cannot be reasonably estimated.

Passaic River Site

     The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that
a six mile  stretch of the Passaic  River in Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"
within the  meaning of that term under the Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and that, to date, at
least thirteen  corporations,  including  PSE&G,  may be potentially  liable for
performing   required  remedial  actions  to  address  potential   environmental
pollution at the Passaic River "facility." PSE&G and certain of its predecessors
operated   industrial   facilities  at  properties   within  the  Passaic  River
"facility,"  comprised  of  four  former  manufactured  gas  plants  (MGP),  one
operating electric generating station and one former generating  station.  Costs
to clean up former MGPs are  recoverable  from utility  customers under the SBC.
The operating  electric  generating station has been transferred to Power, which
is responsible for its remediation. PSEG cannot predict what action, if any, the
EPA or any third party may take against PSE&G and/or Power with respect to these
matters,  or in such event,  what costs PSE&G  and/or Power may incur to address
any such claims. However, such costs may be material.

New Source Review

     The EPA and NJDEP issued a demand to PSE&G in March 2000 under  section 114
of the  Federal  Clean Air Act (CAA)  requiring  information  to assess  whether
projects  completed  since 1978 at the Hudson and Mercer coal burning units were
implemented in accordance  with applicable New Source Review  regulations.  As a
result  of the  transfer  of the  generating  business  by PSE&G to  Power,  the
responsibility for these environmental  requirements now rests with Power. Power
completed its response to the section 114 information  request in November 2000.
Based upon the  information  provided  to the EPA it is likely that the EPA will
seek to enforce the  requirements  of the New Source Review  program at Hudson 2
and Mercer 1 and 2. Power is currently in discussions  with the EPA and NJDEP to
resolve the matter.  However,  it is uncertain whether these discussions will be
successful and capital costs of compliance could approximate $300 million. These
costs are not currently included in Power's business plans.

     The EPA indicated that it is considering  enforcement  action against Power
under its PSD rules relating to the  construction  that is currently in progress
for  Bergen  2,  scheduled  for  operations  in  2002.  The EPA  maintains  that
Prevention of Significant  Deterioration  (PSD)  requirements  are applicable to
Bergen 2, thereby  requiring Power to obtain a permit prior to the  commencement
of construction. To obtain such a permit, an applicant must demonstrate that the
additional  emission source will not cause significant  deterioration of the air
shed in the vicinity of the plant.  The time required to obtain such a permit is
estimated at 12-18 months.  Power vigorously  disputes that PSD requirements are
applicable to Bergen 2 and is continuing construction.  The NJDEP has informally
indicated it agrees with Power's position.  Settlement  discussions are underway
with the EPA.

Note  6.  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

     PSEG's  operations  give rise to exposure to market  risks from  changes in
commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and securities
prices. PSEG's policy is to use derivative financial instruments for the purpose
of managing market risk consistent with its business plans and prudent  business
practices.

Commodity-Related Instruments

     Power

     At March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, Power held or issued commodity and
financial  instruments that reduce exposure to price  fluctuations  from factors
such as weather,  environmental policies,  changes in demand, changes in supply,
state and Federal regulatory  policies and other events.  These instruments,  in
conjunction  with owned  electric  generating  capacity  and physical gas supply
contracts,   are  designed  to  cover   estimated   electric  and  gas  customer
commitments.  Power use futures, forwards, swaps and options to manage and hedge
price risk related to these market exposures.

     At March 31, 2001, Power had outstanding  commodity  financial  instruments
with a  notional  contract  quantity  of 53.4  million  megawatt-hours  (mWh) of
electricity  and 14.4 million MMBTU (million  British  thermal units) of natural
gas. At December 31, 2000, Power had outstanding commodity financial instruments
with a notional  contract  quantity of 54.0 million mWh of electricity  and 67.2
million MMBTU of natural gas. Notional amounts are indicative only of the volume
of activity and are not a measure of market risk.

     PSE&G's and Power's energy  trading and related  contracts have been marked
to market and gains and losses from such  contracts  were  included in earnings.
Power recorded  $(10.7)million  of unrealized  losses in the quarter ended March
31, 2001 and PSE&G  recorded  $1.6  million of  unrealized  gains in the quarter
ended March 31, 2000.

<PAGE>
     The fair value of the financial  instruments that are  marked-to-market are
based on management's best estimates using over-the counter quotations, exchange
prices,  volatility factors and valuation  methodology.  The estimates presented
herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Power could realize in
a current market exchange. The fair values as of March 31, 2001 and December 31,
2000 and the  average  fair  values for the  periods  then ended of PSE&G's  and
Power's  significant  financial  instruments  related to energy  commodities are
summarized in the following table:

</TABLE>

     PSE&G and Power  routinely  enter into exchange  traded futures and options
transactions  for electricity  and natural gas as part of its wholesale  trading
operations.  Generally,  exchange-traded  futures  contracts  require deposit of
margin cash,  the amount of which is subject to change based on market  movement
and in accordance  with  exchange  rules.  The amount of the margin  deposits at
March 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 was approximately $1 million.

Equity Securities -- Energy Holdings

     PSEG  Resources  Inc.  (Resources),  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Energy
Holdings,  has  investments  in  equity  securities  and  limited  partnerships.
Resources carries its investments in equity securities at their approximate fair
value  as of the  reporting  date.  Consequently,  the  carrying  value of these
investments  is  affected  by  changes  in the  fair  value  of  the  underlying
securities.  Fair value is  determined  by  adjusting  the  market  value of the
securities for liquidity and market volatility factors,  where appropriate.  The
aggregate fair values of such  investments  which had available market prices at
March  31,  2001 and  December  31,  2000  were $65  million  and $115  million,
respectively.  The decrease in fair value was  primarily  due to the sale of its
interest  in  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  which had a book value of $30
million on December  31, 2000 and lower  valuation  of  publicly  traded  equity
securities  within  Resources'  portfolio.  The  potential  change in fair value
resulting  from a  hypothetical  10%  change  in quoted  market  prices of these
investments amounted to $5 million and $9 million at March 31, 2001 and December
31, 2000, respectively.

Foreign Currencies -- Energy Holdings

     As of March 31, 2001,  Global and  Resources  had  international  assets of
approximately $2.023 billion and $1.210 billion, respectively.

     Resources'  international  investments  are primarily  leveraged  leases of
assets located in the Netherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, China
and New Zealand  with  associated  revenues  denominated  in U.S.  dollars,  and
therefore, not subject to foreign currency risk.

     Global's international  investments are primarily in projects that generate
or distribute  electricity in Argentina,  Brazil,  Chile,  China,  India, Italy,
Peru,  Poland,  Tunisia and Venezuela.  Investing in foreign countries  involves
certain additional risks.  Economic conditions that result in higher comparative
rates of inflation in foreign countries are likely to result in declining values
in such countries' currencies. As currencies fluctuate against the $US, there is
a corresponding  change in Global's  investment  value in terms of the $US. Such
change is reflected as an increase or decrease in the investment value and other
comprehensive  income, a separate component of stockholder's equity. As of March
31, 2001, net foreign currency  devaluations have reduced the reported amount of
Energy  Holdings' total  stockholder's  equity by $205 million,  $154 million of
which was caused by the devaluation of the Brazilian Real.


Credit Risk

     Credit  risk  relates  to the risk of loss that  PSEG and its  subsidiaries
would incur as a result of non-performance  by  counterparties,  pursuant to the
terms of their  contractual  obligations.  PSEG has established  credit policies
that it believes  significantly  minimize  its  exposure to credit  risk.  These
policies include an evaluation of potential  counterparties' financial condition
(including credit rating),  collateral  requirements under certain circumstances
and the use of  standardized  agreements,  which may allow  for the  netting  of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

     The  deregulation of the California  power market has produced  significant
unanticipated   results  in  the  past  year.  The  California   Public  Utility
Commission,  (CPUC) as part of deregulation,  froze the rates that utilities can
charge their retail and business  customers in  California  and  prohibited  the
utilities from buying power on a forward  basis,  while  wholesale  power prices
were not subjected to limits.  In the past year,  an increase in demand  coupled
with a reduced supply of power has caused a severe imbalance in the market. Such
imbalance has led to unprecedented wholesale prices.

     As a result of this  situation,  two major  California  utilities  that are
subject  to the retail  price  cap,  including  Pacific  Gas & Electric  Company
(PG&E),  have significantly  underrecovered from customers costs paid for power.
As a consequence,  these utilities have defaulted under a variety of contractual
obligations. On April 6, 2001, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

     GWF, Hanford and Tracy  Qualifying  Facilities (QF) have continued to honor
their contractual  obligations to PG&E under existing QF contracts. To date they
have refrained from pursuing collection remedies with respect to PG&E's default,
and have been  actively  involved  in being part of the  solution  to  stabilize
energy prices through the application of a long-term energy pricing  methodology
(for a five-year period).  On March 27, 2001, the CPUC approved a plan to assure
the state's QFs are paid for future  deliveries  of energy within 15 days of the
receipt of an invoice.  The CPUC's plan, while  immediately  effective,  did not
address amounts due such  facilities for past due receivables  related to energy
delivered  since December 2000. In addition to the payment issue,  the CPUC also
approved a 40% increase in electric  retail rates to help the state's  utilities
recover significantly higher wholesale energy costs. It is expected further that
legislation  will be  developed to enable the  California  utilities to finance,
over a longer term, the difference  between the wholesale  prices that have been
paid and the retail prices received during the latter half of 2000. On April 11,
2001,  management  at Global's  project  affiliates  received a letter from PG&E
addressed  to QF  owners  stating  that they  intended  to pay the QFs for power
delivered  commencing  April 6,  2001 at 9:00  A.M.  (the date and time of their
bankruptcy petition).  On April 17, 2001 and May 2, 2001, the project affiliates
received $3 million and $5 million respectively, from PG&E representing payments
for all energy delivered for the period from the time of the bankruptcy petition
through April 30, 2001.  Global cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of
the legislative process, or the payment of future amounts by PG&E.

     As of December 31, 2000,  GWF,  Hanford and Tracy had combined  receivables
due from PG&E,  for all plants  amounting  to $40 million.  Of this  amount,  $8
million had been reserved as an allowance for doubtful  accounts  resulting in a
net  receivable  balance of $32  million.  Global's  pro-rata  share of this net
receivable was $15 million.

     As of April 6, 2001,  GWF,  Hanford and Tracy had combined  receivables due
from  PG&E,  for  all  plants   amounting  to  $62  million.   Of  this  amount,
approximately  $20  million  had been  reserved  as an  allowance  for  doubtful
accounts  resulting in a net receivable  balance of  approximately  $42 million.
Global's pro-rata share of this net receivable was approximately $20 million.

Interest Rates

     PSEG is subject  to the risk of  fluctuating  interest  rates in the normal
course of business.  PSEG's  policy is to manage  interest rate risk through the
use of fixed rate debt,  floating rate debt and interest rate swaps. As of March
31, 2001, a hypothetical  10% change in market  interest rates would result in a
$11 million  change in annual  interest costs related to short-term and floating
rate debt at PSEG.

     PSEG's  effective  tax rate  differs  from the  statutory  income  tax rate
primarily due to the accruals at the rate of 10% of Global's  foreign income due
to the incremental cost associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.

Note 9. Adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133

     The  nature of PSEG's  bbusiness  activities  involves  the  management  of
various  financial  and  market  risks,  including  those  related to changes in
interest rates,  equity prices,  currency  exchange rates, and commodity prices.
PSEG's policy is to use  derivative  financial  instruments to manage certain of
those risks, consistent with its business plans and prudent practices.  PSEG has
a Risk Management  Committee comprised of executive officers,  which utilizes an
independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies
and prudent risk management  practices for all of its subsidiaries.  The January
1, 2001 accounting  change  described above affected only the pattern and timing
of non-cash accounting recognition.

     At January 1, 2001,  PSEG's recorded a cumulative effect from adopting this
accounting change, as follows:

                                                                      Other
                                                                  Comprehensive
                                                 Earnings            Income
                                              --------------    ----------------
                                                   (Millions of Dollars)
Fair value of derivative assets.............    $22.7              $  0.4
Fair value of derivative liabilities........       --               (41.0)
Income tax effects..........................     (7.9)               14.2
Minority interests effects..................     (6.0)               12.0
                                              -----------      ----------------
Total cumulative effect of a change in
  accounting principle......................    $ 8.8              $(14.8)
                                              -----------      ----------------

     The  cumulative  effect  on  earnings  included  one  significant   element
associated with a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). An Energy Holdings'  affiliate
entered into a PPA that provides for indexation of foreign currencies to the $US
over the tariff  collection  period.  The  indexation  provides for an increased
amount of foreign currency to be provided to the affiliated  entity in the event
of currency devaluation.

     The indexation portion of the PPA is considered an embedded  derivative and
has been  recognized  and  valued  separately  as a  derivative  instrument.  As
currencies   devalue/revalue   in   relation   to  the   $US,   the   derivative
increases/decreases in value equal to the discounted present value of additional
units of  foreign  currency  (measured  in $US)  over the life of the PPA.  This
increased/decreased   value   is   reported   on  the   balance   sheet   as  an
asset/liability. To the extent that such indexation is provided to hedge foreign
currency debt exposure, the offsetting amount is recorded in Other Comprehensive
Income.  Amounts will be amortized from Other  Comprehensive  Income to Earnings
over the life of the debt upon commercial operation of the project,  expected to
occur in the third quarter of 2001. To the extent such indexation is provided to
hedge an equity  return in $US, the  offsetting  amount is recorded in Earnings.
The total value of this embedded derivative was recorded on January 1, 2001 as a
transition  adjustment  to Earnings as required by SFAS 133. All changes in fair
value of this embedded  derivative recorded subsequent to January 1, 2001 impact
both Other Comprehensive Income and Earnings, as described above.

     The cumulative  effect on Other  Comprehensive  Income was  attributable to
marking to market  interest rate swaps used to hedge  variable-rate  borrowings.
Decreases in the fair values of these instruments subsequent to January 1, 2001,
were  attributable  to declines in interest rates since inception of the hedging
arrangements  and will be  recognized  contemporaneously  in  earnings in future
periods by offsetting lower interest expense associated with the hedged items.

     A reconciliation of current period changes, net of applicable income taxes,
in the separate component of Other Comprehensive Income follows.


                                                       (Millions of Dollars)
Transition adjustment as of January 1, 2001.......           $(14.8)
Current period declines in fair value - net.......             (0.6)
Reclassification to earnings - net................              0.2
                                                         --------------
Balance at March 31, 2001.........................           $(15.5)
                                                         --------------

     As of March  31,  2001 the fair  values  of PSEG's  derivative  assets  and
liabilities were $31 million and $46 million,  respectively.  The fair values of
such derivative assets and liabilities were recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet in Other Assets and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively.

     Additional  disclosures  required  by  SFAS  No.  133 are  provided  in the
following paragraphs.

     Hedges of Future Cash Flows

     The  ineffective  portion of changes in fair values of interest rate swaps,
reported in first  quarter  earnings,  amounted to $0.6  million,  net of income
taxes and minority interest. This amount was recorded in Other Income.

     At March 31, 2001,  the maximum term of derivative  instruments  that hedge
forecasted transactions, except those related to payment of variable interest on
existing financial instruments,  was twenty years subsequent to the commencement
of  commercial  operation  of an  electric  generation  facility  of  an  Energy
Holdings' affiliate in Rades, Tunisia, expected to occur in the third quarter of
2001.

     Hedges of Recognized  Assets,  Liabilities and Firm  Commitments - Embedded
Derivative

     The  indexation  portion of the PPA that  hedged  foreign  currency  equity
exposure  reported in first  quarter  earnings,  amounted to $1 million,  net of
income taxes and minority interest.

     The FASB's Derivative  Implementation  Group has issued tentative  guidance
regarding  certain  derivative  contracts and eligibility of those contracts for
the normal purchases and sales exceptions.  Energy Holdings and its subsidiaries
are  currently  evaluating  this  tentative  guidance in light of its  potential
impacts on the  implementation  of SFAS 133 and cannot predict the impact on its
financial  position or results of  operations,  however,  such  impact  could be
material.

Note. 11  Subsequent Events

     On April 9 2001,  Power,  in a private  placement,  issued $500  million of
6.875%  Senior  Notes due 2006,  $800 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2011 and
$500 million 8.625% Senior Notes due 2031. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were used  primarily  for the  repayment of loans from PSEG.  Power
plans to file a  registration  statement  with the SEC  relating  to an exchange
offer for, or the resale of, these  Senior  Notes later in 2001.  Each series of
Senior Notes received  investment grade ratings from Moody's Investors  Service,
Fitch,  Inc. and  Standard & Poor's  Rating  Services.  In  connection  with the
issuance of the Senior  Notes,  the forward  starting  interest  rate swaps were
terminated for $5.3 million .

*    Includes after tax effect of interest on certain financing transactions and
     certain general and administrative costs.

     Basic and diluted  earnings per share of PSEG common stock  (Common  Stock)
were $1.25 for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, representing no change from the
comparable 2000 period.

     PSE&G's and Power's  contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for
the quarter ended March 31, 2001 decreased $0.14 or 12% from the comparable 2000
period.  The decrease for the quarter  ended March 31, 2001 was primarily due to
an additional 2% electric rate reduction  combined with the  amortization of the
stranded cost regulatory  asset beginning in February 2001. These decreases were
partially  offset by higher profits from trading  activities and increased sales
due to colder weather.

     Energy Holdings  contribution to earnings per share of Common Stock for the
quarter ended March 31, 2001 increased  $0.15 from the  comparable  2000 period,
primarily  due to payments  received  relating to Global's  withdrawal  from its
interest in the Eagle Point Cogeneration Partnership which are expected to total
up to $290 million over the next five years, subject to certain contingencies.

     As a result of PSEG's  stock  repurchase  program  which began in September
1998,  earnings per share of Common  Stock for the quarter  ended March 31, 2001
increased $0.04 from the comparable 2000 period.  A total of 24.2 million shares
were repurchased at a cost of  approximately  $905 million under this program as
of March 31, 2001.

Revenues

     Generation

     Generation revenues increased $31 million or 6% for the quarter ended March
31,  2001 from the  comparable  period in 2000  primarily  due to an
increase  associated  with  increased  load served under the BGS  contract  with
PSE&G.  This  increased  load is due to customers  returning to PSE&G from third
party suppliers (TPS) as wholesale  market prices have typically  exceeded fixed
BGS  rates.  As of  March  31,  2001 TPS were  serving  approximately  6% of the
customer  load  traditionally  served by PSE&G as compared to the March 31, 2000
level of 11%.  Also  contributing  to the  increase  were $9  million  in higher
ancillary  services  revenues and  approximately $9 million in revenues from new
developments  subsequent  to the  first  quarter  of  2000.  The  increases  was
partially offset by the additional 2% rate reduction,  which was effective as of
February 7, 2001, which reduced revenues by approximately $12 million.

         Transmission and Distribution

     Transmission  and Distribution  revenues  increased $325 million or 29% for
the quarter ended March 31, 2001 from the  comparable  period in 2000  primarily
due to increases in natural gas prices being passed along to gas customers under
certain  transportation  only  contracts.   Under  these  contracts,   PSE&G  is
responsible  only for  delivery  of gas to its  customers.  Such  customers  are
responsible  for payment to PSE&G for the cost of the  commodity  and as PSE&G's
costs on behalf of these customers  increase,  the customer's rates to cover the
costs of gas will increase. Also contributing to this increase were higher sales
resulting  from colder  weather in the first  quarter of 2001 as compared to the
same  period in 2000 and  higher  rates  approved  by the BPU to allow  PSE&G to
recover for increasing natural gas costs.

     Trading

     Trading  revenues  decreased  $27 million or 4% for the quarter ended March
31,  2001  from the  comparable  period  in 2000 due to  lower  trading  volumes
resulting from increased market  volatility.  These decreased revenues were more
than offset by decreased trading costs as discussed below in Energy Costs.

     Other

     Other  revenues  increased $2 million or 2% for the quarter ended March 31,
2001 as  compared to the same  period in 2000.  Revenues in 2001 were  favorably
impacted  by  Global's   withdrawal   from  its  interest  in  the  Eagle  Point
Cogeneration  Partnership  in exchange  for a series of payments  through  2005,
expected to total up to $290 million. Global realized an increase in revenues of
$46 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, as compared to the same period
in 2000 primarily  related to the withdrawal  from the Eagle Point  Cogeneration
Partnership.  In addition,  revenues were further  enhanced by an increase of $9
million due to higher  leveraged  lease  income  from  continued  investment  by
Resources in such financing transactions.  These increases were partially offset
by lower Net  Investments  Gains (Losses) of $46 million  primarily due to a net
decrease  in  the  carrying  value  of  publicly  traded  equity  securities  in
Resources' leveraged buyout funds.


     Energy Costs

     Energy Costs  decreased  $26 million or 3% for the quarter  ended March 31,
2001 from the comparable 2000 period primarily due to $49 million in lower costs
related to  trading  activities,  resulting  from lower  trading  volumes.  Also
contributing  to the  decreased  Energy  Costs  were  lower  costs  for  nuclear
generation.  The  decreases  were  partially  offset  by higher  fuel  costs for
generation, including $31 million resulting from higher natural gas prices.

     Gas Costs

     Gas Costs  increased  $307  million or 64% for the quarter  ended March 31,
2001 from the  comparable  2000 period  primarily  due to the higher  prices for
natural gas. Also contributing to the increase was higher demand for natural gas
due to colder  weather  in the first  quarter  of 2001 as  compared  to the same
period in 2000.

     Operations and Maintenance

     Operations and Maintenance  expense  increased $60 million or 13% primarily
due to planned outage work in the first quarter of 2001,  lower capital  project
work for the  quarter  ended  March 31,  2001 as  compared to the same period in
2000,  higher expenses  relating to projects going into operation  subsequent to
the first quarter of 2000 and a change in the accrual for the  anticipated  cost
of removal for generating stations.

     Depreciation and Amortization

     Depreciation and Amortization  expense increased $18 million or 20% for the
quarter ended March 31, 2001 from the comparable  2000 period.  The increase was
primarily due the  amortization  of the  regulatory  asset  recorded for PSE&G's
stranded costs beginning in February 2001.

     Interest Expenses

     Interest  Expense  increased $22 million or 16% for the quarter ended March
31, 2001 from the comparable  2000 period  primarily due to increased  long-term
debt.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     PSEG

     PSEG is a holding  company and, as such,  has no operations of its own. The
following  discussion  of  PSEG's  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is  on  a
consolidated  basis,  noting the uses and  contributions  of PSEG's three direct
operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

     Dividend  payments  on Common  Stock  were  $0.54  per  share  and  totaled
approximately  $112 million and $117  million for the  quarters  ended March 31,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Future dividends  declared will be dependent upon
PSEG's future earnings, cash flows, financial requirements, alternate investment
opportunities and other factors.

     PSE&G

     On January 31, 2001, $2.525 billion of transition bonds (non-recourse asset
backed   securities)   were   issued  by  PSE&G   Transition   Funding   LLC,  a
bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned subsidiary of PSE&G. PSE&G also received payment
from Power on its $2.786 billion Promissory Note used to finance the transfer of
PSE&G's generation  assets to Power. The proceeds from these transactions were
used to pay for certain  debt  issuance  and related  costs for  securitization,
redeem a portion of PSE&G's  outstanding  short-term  debt,  reduce PSE&G common
equity by $2.265 billion,  loan funds to PSEG of $1.084 billion and make various
short-term  investments.  These funds are  expected to be used for further  debt
and/or  equity  reductions  in 2001  including  payment of maturing  and certain
redeemable  securities.  Any inability to obtain  required  additional  external
capital or to extend or replace  maturing  debt and/or  existing  agreements  at
current  levels  and  reasonable  interest  rates may affect  PSE&G's  financial
condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

     Cash  generated  from PSE&G's  transmission  and  distribution  business is
expected to provide the majority of the funds for PSE&G's business needs.  Since
1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash  payments to PSEG in the form of dividends on
outstanding shares of PSE&G's common stock. PSE&G paid common stock dividends of
$112 million and $117 million to PSEG for the quarters  ended March 31, 2001 and
2000,  respectively.  These  amounts  were  used to  fund  PSEG's  Common  Stock
dividends.

     In March 2001,  PSE&G  redeemed all of its $150 million of 9.375%  Series A
cumulative  income  preferred  securities,  all  of its  $75  million  of  5.97%
preferred stock, $15 million of its 6.75% preferred stock and $52 million of its
floating rate notes due December 7, 2002.

     Power

     In 2000, Power financed the transfer of the generation assets from PSE&G
through the issuance of a $2.786 billion  promissory  note. On January 31, 2001,
through $1.2 billion of equity  infusions  and $1.62 billion of loans from PSEG,
Power repaid this note to PSE&G. On April 9, 2001,  Power issued $1.8 billion of
its Senior  Notes,  the  proceeds  of which were used  primarily  to replace its
interim  financing  from PSEG. It is expected that Power's  future capital needs
will be funded with cash generated from operations and may be supplemented  with
external  financings,  equity  infusions  from PSEG and other project  financing
alternatives  as dictated by Power's  growth  strategy.  Any inability to obtain
required  additional  external  capital at reasonable  interest rates may affect
Power's financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

     Energy Holdings

     It is  intended  that  Global and  Resources  will  continue to provide the
earnings  and cash  flow  for  Energy  Holdings'  long-term  growth.  Resources'
investments are designed to produce immediate cash flow and earnings that enable
Global and Energy  Technologies to focus on longer investment  horizons.  During
the next five years,  Energy  Holdings  will need  material  capital to fund its
planned growth. In addition to cash generated from operations,  Energy Holdings'
growth will be funded  through  external  financings  and equity  infusions from
PSEG.

     Over the next  several  years,  Energy  Holdings,  certain  of its  project
affiliates and PSEG Capital will be required to refinance  maturing debt,  incur
additional debt and provide equity to fund investment activity. Any inability to
obtain required  additional  external  capital or to extend or replace  maturing
debt and/or existing  agreements at current levels and reasonable interest rates
may affect Energy Holdings' financial  condition,  results of operations and net
cash flows.

Regulatory Restrictions

     As a result  of a 1992 BPU  proceeding  concerning  the  impact  of  PSEG's
non-utility investments (Focused Audit) on PSE&G, the BPU approved a plan which,
among other things,  provided that: (1) PSEG would not permit PSEG's non-utility
assets to exceed 20% of PSEG's  consolidated  assets without prior notice to the
BPU (as of December 31,  2000,  these assets were in excess of the 20% limit and
the  required  notice had been given);  (2) the PSE&G Board of  Directors  would
provide an annual  certification that the business and financing plans of Energy
Holdings  will not  adversely  affect  PSE&G;  (3) PSEG  would  (a)  limit  debt
supported by the minimum net worth  maintenance  agreement between PSEG and PSEG
Capital to $650  million  and (b) make a  good-faith  effort to  eliminate  such
support by May 2003; and (4) Energy  Holdings would pay PSE&G an affiliation fee
of up to $2 million a year to be applied by PSE&G to reduce utility rates.

     The  Final  Order   addressed  the  Focused   Audit,   noting  that  PSEG's
non-regulated  assets  would  likely  exceed  20% and that,  due to  significant
changes in the industry  and, in  particular,  PSEG's  corporate  structure as a
result of the Final  Order,  modifications  to or relief from the Focused  Audit
might be warranted. In March 2000, PSE&G submitted a letter to the BPU notifying
the BPU of its  intention  to make a filing to modify  the terms of the  Focused
Audit within 120 days after the Final Order becomes final and non-appealable. In
December  2000,  the New Jersey  Supreme Court  affirmed the appellate  decision
upholding the Final Order (see Note 2. Regulatory Issues). Also, Energy Holdings
believes that, if still required,  it is capable of eliminating  PSEG support of
PSEG Capital debt within the time period set forth in the Focused Audit.

     Regulatory  oversight by the BPU to ensure that there is no harm to utility
customers from PSEG's non-utility  investments is expected to continue. PSEG and
PSE&G  believe that these issues will be  satisfactorily  resolved,  although no
assurances  can be given.  In addition,  if PSEG were no longer exempt under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA),  PSEG and its subsidiaries  would be
subject  to  additional  regulation  by the SEC with  respect to  financing  and
investing activities,  including the amount and type of non-utility investments.
PSEG believes,  however,  that this would not have a material  adverse impact on
its financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

Capital Requirements

     PSE&G

     PSE&G  has  substantial  commitments  as part of its  ongoing  construction
programs. These programs are continuously reviewed and periodically revised as a
result of changes in  economic  conditions,  revised  load  forecasts,  business
strategies,   site  changes,  cost  escalations  under  construction  contracts,
requirements  of regulatory  authorities  and laws,  the timing of and amount of
electric and gas transmission  and/or  distribution rate changes and the ability
of PSE&G to raise necessary capital.

     Construction   expenditures   are  related  to   improvements   in  PSE&G's
transmission and distribution system, gas system and common facilities.  For the
quarter  ended  March 31,  2001 PSE&G had net plant  additions  of $63  million,
excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFDC).

     Power

     Construction  expenditures  were  related  to  acquisitions  by  Power  and
improvements in Power's existing power plants. Power had net plant additions for
the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2001 of  $282  million,  excluding  capitalized
interest.  Power's  growth  strategy  is  designed  to  increase  its  operating
generating portfolio to 20,000 MW by 2005. Changes in environmental  regulations
and  unexpected  impacts of  existing  regulations  could  impact  both  Power's
construction and growth strategy as well as the capital expenditure amounts. For
further information,  including New Source Review requirements under the Federal
Clean Air Act (CAA), see Note. 4. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

     Energy Holdings

     Energy  Holdings  plans to  continue  the growth of Global  and  Resources.
Energy Holdings will assess the growth  prospects and  opportunities  for Energy
Technologies'  business  before  committing  substantial  amounts of  additional
capital.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2001,  Energy  Holdings'  subsidiaries
made net investments  totaling  approximately  $124 million.  These  investments
included $59 million by Global,  primarily related to incremental investments in
certain  existing  generation  and  distribution  projects  including  those  in
operation  and  currently  under  construction.  In addition,  Global loaned $60
million to TIE. Factors  affecting actual  expenditures and investments  include
availability of capital and suitable investment opportunities, market volatility
and local economic trends.

     In March 2001,  Global reached  agreement to purchase a 94% equity stake in
Sociedad Austral de Electricidad  S.A. (SAESA) and all of its subsidiaries  from
Compania  de  Petroleos  de Chile S.A.  (COPEC).  Additionally,  Global  reached
agreement to purchase from COPEC  approximately  14% of Empresa  Electrica de la
Frontera  S.A.  (Frontel)  not owned by  SAESA.  The  SAESA  group of  companies
consists  of four  distribution  companies  and one  transmission  company  that
provide  service in the southern part of Chile.  Additionally,  SAESA owns a 50%
interest in the Argentine  distribution  company Empresa Electrica del Rio Negro
S.A. Collectively, the companies serve more than 615,000 customers. The purchase
price to be paid by Global will total approximately $460 million.

     In May 2001, Resources closed its investment of $140 million in a leveraged
lease  financing  of two  electric  power  stations  to Dynegy  Power  Corp,  an
affiliate of Dynegy Inc. The generating stations leased include Roseton, a 1,200
MW gas/oil-fired  plant and Danskammer,  a 370 MW coal-fired  plant,  located in
Newburgh, New York.

External Financings

     PSEG

     At March 31,  2001,  PSEG had a committed  $150  million  revolving  credit
facility  which will expire in December  2002. At March 31, 2001,  there were no
borrowings under this revolving  credit facility.  In 1999, PSEG entered into an
uncommitted  line of credit with a bank with no stated limit. At March 31, 2000,
PSEG had $93 million outstanding under this line of credit.

     PSEG has an $850  million  commercial  paper  program to provide  funds for
general corporate purposes. On March 31, 2001, PSEG had commercial paper of $206
million outstanding under this program.

     To provide  liquidity for its  commercial  paper  program,  PSEG has a $570
million  revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2002 and a $280  million
revolving  credit  facility  expiring in March 2005.  These  agreements are with
groups of banks and provide for borrowings with maturities of up to one year. As
of March 31, 2001 there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

     PSE&G

     Under its Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
against  previous  additions and  improvements  and/or  retired  Mortgage  Bonds
provided  that its ratio of earnings to fixed  charges  calculated in accordance
with its Mortgage is at least 2:1. At March 31, 2001,  PSE&G's Mortgage coverage
ratio was XX:1. As of March 31, 2001, the Mortgage would permit up to $1 billion
aggregate  principal  amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against previous
additions and improvements. In addition to the refinancing of existing long-term
debt  authorized  by the BPU in the Final  Order,  PSE&G will need to obtain BPU
authorization to issue any incremental debt financing  necessary for its capital
program.  The BPU has  authorized  PSE&G to issue up to $1 billion of  long-term
debt on the basis of  previously  matured,  redeemed or  purchased  debt through
December 31, 2001, of which $590 million has been issued.

     As   discussed   previously,   on  January  31,  2001,   transition   bonds
(non-recourse  asset  backed  securities)  in the amount of $2.525  billion were
issued  by PSE&G  Transition  Funding  LLC,  a  bankruptcy-remote,  wholly-owned
subsidiary of PSE&G, in eight classes with maturities  ranging from 1 year to 15
years.

     In March  2001,  PSE&G  reduced the maximum  size of its  commercial  paper
program  from $1.5  billion  to $900  million.  To  provide  liquidity  for this
program,  PSE&G maintains a $450 million  revolving credit facility that expires
in June 2001 and a $450 million credit facility that expires in June 2002. As of
March 31, 2001, there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

     PSE&G has several  uncommitted  lines of credit  with  banks.  On March 31,
2001,  PSE&G had $155 million of short-term debt  outstanding,  borrowed against
its uncommitted bank lines of credit.

     Power

     On April 9, 2001,  Power,  in a private  placement,  issued $500 million of
6.875%  Senior  Notes due 2006,  $800 million of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2011 and
$500 million 8.625% Senior Notes due 2031. The net proceeds from the sale of the
Senior Notes were used  primarily  for the  repayment of loans from PSEG.  Power
plans to file a  registration  statement  with the SEC  relating  to an exchange
offer for, or the resale of, these  Senior  Notes later in 2001.  Each series of
Senior Notes received  investment grade ratings from Moody's Investors  Service,
Fitch, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services.

     Power has various lines of credit extended by banks to support the issuance
of letters of credit. As of March 31, 2001, letters of credit were issued in the
amount of approximately $90 million.

     Energy Holdings

     On March 31, 2001, Energy Holdings had two separate senior revolving credit
facilities with a syndicate of banks; a $495 million five-year  revolving credit
and  letter of credit  facility  and a $165  million  364-day  revolving  credit
facility.  The  interest  rate on these  facilities  is  based on LIBOR  and the
average  borrowing rate at Energy Holdings'  current rating level is 1.375% over
the one, three or six month LIBOR rate.  The revolving  credit  facilities  also
permit  shorter-term  base rate  borrowings  at the prime  rate.  The  five-year
facility also permits up to $250 million of letters of credit to be issued.  The
five-year  facility  matures  on May 12,  2004 and the  364-day  facility  which
matured  on May 9,  2001,  was  extended  to May 8, 2002 and  increased  to $200
million  with no other  changes to the terms of the  facility.  At December  31,
2000,  Energy Holdings had $329 million  outstanding  under the revolving credit
facilities.

     In February 2001,  Energy  Holdings,  in a private  placement,  issued $400
million of 8.625%  Senior Notes due 2008.  The net  proceeds  from the sale were
used for repayment of the revolving credit facilities.  Energy Holdings plans to
file a registration statement with the SEC relating to an exchange offer for, or
the resale of, these Senior Notes in 2001.  On March 31, 2001,  Energy  Holdings
had no outstanding balances under its existing revolving credit facilities.

     In March 2001, $160 million of non-recourse  bank debt originally  incurred
to fund a portion of the  purchase  price of  Global's  interest  in  Chilquinta
Energia,  S.A.  was  refinanced.  The  private  placement  by offering of senior
secured  notes  was  structured  in two  tranches:  $60  million  due 2008 at an
interest rate of 6.47% and $100 million due 2011 at an interest rate of 6.62%.

Accounting Matters

     In July 2000,  the  Emerging  Issues Task Force  (EITF)  99-19,  "Reporting
Revenue  Gross as a Principal  versus Net as an Agent"  (EITF  99-19),  provided
guidance on the issue of whether a company  should  report  revenue based on the
gross  amount  billed to the customer or the net amount  retained.  The guidance
states that whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount
billed or the net retained requires significant  judgment,  which depends on the
relevant  facts and  circumstances.  In the first quarter of 2001,  based on the
analysis and  interpretation  of EITF 99-19,  PSEG reported all the revenues and
cost of goods sold on a gross  basis for the energy  related  transactions.  The
prior year financial statements for PSEG and its subsidiaries have been restated
for comparability purposes.

     The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Statement  of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  133,  Accounting  for  Derivative
Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,  as amended,  which  became  effective  on
January  1, 2001.  Under  SFAS 133,  certain  contracts  that were not  formerly
considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a derivative. PSEG adopted
SFAS  133  effective  January  1,  2001.  See  Notes  2 and 9 of  Notes  to  the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

     As of March 31, 2001, Global and Resources had approximately $2.023 billion
and $1.210 billion, respectively, of international assets. As of March 31, 2001,
foreign assets represented 59% of Energy Holdings'  consolidated  assets and the
revenues  related  to  those  foreign  assets  contributed  23% to  consolidated
revenues  for the  quarter  ended March 31,  2001.  For  discussion  of Global's
foreign currency risk, see Note 6. Financial Instruments and Risk Management.

     In April 2001, Global announced that the PPN Generation  Station located in
India began commercial operations.  The 330 MW combined-cycle plant is currently
being run on naphtha  and will switch to a mixture of naphtha and natural gas as
offshore gas wells are completed. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board will purchase
the entire output of the plant under a PPA.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The market risk inherent in PSEG's market risk  sensitive  instruments  and
positions  is the  potential  loss  arising  from  adverse  changes in commodity
prices,  pollution credits,  equity security prices,  interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates as discussed below.  PSEG's policy is to use derivatives
to manage risk  consistent with its business plans and prudent  practices.  PSEG
has a Risk Management  Committee  comprised of executive officers which utilizes
an  independent  risk  oversight  function to ensure  compliance  with corporate
policies and prudent risk management practices.

     PSEG is  exposed  to  credit  losses  in the  event of  non-performance  or
non-payment by  counterparties.  PSEG also has a credit management process which
is used to assess,  monitor and mitigate  counterparty exposure for PSEG and its
subsidiaries.  In  the  event  of  non-performance  or  non-payment  by a  major
counterparty,  there  may  be a  material  adverse  impact  on  PSEG's  and  its
subsidiaries' financial condition,  results of operations or net cash flows. For
discussion of interest rates and Energy Holdings' commodity-related instruments,
equity securities and foreign currency risks, see Note 6. Financial  Instruments
and Risk Management of Notes.

     Commodity-Related Instruments

     The   availability   and  price  of  energy   commodities  are  subject  to
fluctuations from factors such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in
supply and demand and state and Federal  regulatory  policies.  To reduce  price
risk caused by market  fluctuations,  PSEG's  subsidiaries enter into derivative
contracts,   including  forwards,  futures,  swaps  and  options  with  approved
counterparties, to hedge its anticipated demand. These contracts, in conjunction
with owned electric generating  capacity and physical gas supply contracts,  are
designed to cover estimated electric and gas customer commitments.

     PSEG uses a value-at-risk  model to assess the market risk of its commodity
business.  This model includes fixed price sales commitments,  owned generation,
native  load  requirements,  physical  and  financial  contracts.  Value-at-risk
represents  the potential  gains or losses for  instruments or portfolios due to
changes in market  factors,  for a specified time period and  confidence  level.
PSEG estimates  value-at-risk  across its commodity  business using a model with
historical volatilities and correlations.

     The measured  value-at-risk using a  variance/co-variance  model with a 95%
confidence   level  over  a  one-week   time  horizon  at  March  31,  2001  was
approximately  $16  million,  compared  to the  December  31,  2000 level of $19
million. PSEG's calculated value-at-risk represents an estimate of the potential
change  in the value of its  portfolio  of  physical  and  financial  derivative
instruments.  These estimates, however, are not necessarily indicative of actual
results,  which may differ due to the fact that actual market rate  fluctuations
may differ from forecasted  fluctuations  and due to the fact that the portfolio
of hedging instruments may change over the holding period.
