NOTE 1.  RATE MATTERS

LEVELIZED GAS ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (LGAC)

     On July 1, 1994, PSE&G petitioned the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities
(BPU) to increase its LGAC rates to recover an additional $23.7 million, to be
effective October 1, 1994.  On August 4, 1994, the matter was transmitted to
the Office of Administrative Law of the State of New Jersey (OAL) for
adjudication.  Due to recent projections of lower gas prices, the parties
reached a stipulated settlement on October 6, 1994 which provides for the
implementation of the Gas Remediation Adjustment Charge (RAC) with an equal
corresponding offsetting adjustment to the current LGAC rate.  These LGAC and
RAC rates, when combined, produce a charge which results in a zero increase to
the firm customers for the LGAC period ending September 30, 1995.  The
settlement was reviewed and approved by the OAL and transmitted to the BPU for
approval on October 25, 1994.  PSE&G cannot predict what action the BPU will
take regarding the OAL's decision.  

ELECTRIC LEVELIZED ENERGY ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE (LEAC)

     On July 1, 1994, PSE&G petitioned the BPU to increase its LEAC rates,
effective October 1, 1994, to recover an additional $130 million of energy
costs.  A significant part of the need for an increase is the larger percentage
of power that PSE&G is obligated to purchase under prior BPU approved contracts
with non-regulated power producers.  On August 4, 1994, the matter was
transmitted to the OAL for adjudication.

     On November 1, 1994, the parties reached a stipulated settlement which
provides for the implementation of provisional LEAC rates, subject to refund,
designed to recover an additional $98 million over the period November 1994
through May 1995.  The stipulation provides sufficient rate relief to recover
current fuel costs and begins reducing the accumulated underrecovered balance
while affording the parties the opportunity to continue litigating this matter
in full to its final conclusion.  The stipulation also preserves the following
issues for litigation: a) rate treatment for the Bergen Phase I repowering
project (See Note 3, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities - Bergen Station
Repowering), b) litigation of alleged overearnings issue, c) recovery of the
costs related to the April 7, 1994 shutdown at Salem 1 nuclear unit and d) the
appropriateness of PSE&G's gas and electric transfer pricing caculations
pertaining to the Bayway agreement (PSE&G's largest industrial customer).  The
stipulation was reviewed and approved by the OAL and transmitted to the BPU on
November 2, 1994 for approval.  At its November 4, 1994 agenda meeting, the BPU
adopted the OAL's decision in full without modification and authorized the
settlement to become effective concurrent with its adoption.  Additional
litigation of this matter is expected to conclude during the first quarter of
1995.

LEAC - (Concluded)

     On July 7, 1994, the BPU approved a stipulation which made permanent the
LEAC rates that went into effect on January 1, 1993 on an interim basis and
closed out the previous LEAC for the period ended December 31, 1992.  The
stipulation also provided a credit of $2.5 million to the deferred fuel balance
for LEAC customers in resolution of all outstanding issues related to the
November 9, 1991 Salem 2 turbine generator outage and a credit of $1.3  million
to reflect an adjustment of partially estimated New Jersey Gross Receipts and
Franchise Tax (NJGRT) unit tax rates to actual unit tax rates.  

NOTE 2.  LONG-TERM DEBT

     Enterprise's long-term debt aggregated $5.278 billion as of September 30,
1994, of which $4.486 billion was attributable to PSE&G and $792 million to
Enterprise Diversified Holdings Incorporated (EDHI), the parent of Enterprise's
nonutility businesses.  During the nine months ended September 30, 1994, PSE&G
issued a total of $692 million principal amount of its First and Refunding
Bonds (Bonds) and $60 million principal amount of Medium Term Notes (MTNs). 
The net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds and MTN's were used by PSE&G to
redeem $376 million aggregate principal amount of higher cost Bonds, including
sinking funds requirements, to defease in substance $122.5 million of higher
cost Bonds and to pay a portion of its current construction program.

NOTE 3.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE STANDARD

   The BPU has established a nuclear performance standard (Standard) for
nuclear generating stations owned by New Jersey electric utilities, including
the five nuclear units in which PSE&G has an ownership interest: Salem 1&2 --
42.59%; Hope Creek -- 95%; and Peach Bottom 2&3 -- 42.49%. PSE&G operates Salem
and Hope Creek, while Peach Bottom is operated by PECO Energy Inc. (PECO).

     The penalty/reward under the Standard is a percentage of replacement power
costs (see table below).  The Standard provides that the penalties will be
calculated to the edge of each capacity factor range. For example, a 30%
penalty applies to replacement power costs incurred in the 55% to 65% range and
a 40% penalty applies to replacement power costs in the 45% to 55% range.

     Under the Standard, the capacity factor is calculated annually using
maximum dependable capability of the five nuclear units in which PSE&G owns an
interest. This method takes into account actual operating conditions of the
units.

     While the Standard does not specifically have a gross negligence
provision, the BPU has indicated that it would consider allegations of gross
negligence brought upon a sufficient factual basis (See Note 1, Rate Matters 
- - Electric Levelized Energy Adjustment Clause). A finding of gross negligence
could result in penalties other than those prescribed under the Standard.
During 1993, the five nuclear units in which PSE&G has an ownership interest

NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE STANDARD (Concluded)

aggregated a 77% combined capacity factor.  In accordance with the Standard,
PSE&G's combined capacity factor exceeded the 75% reward threshold, entitling
PSE&G to a reward of approximately $3.9 million.  PSE&G has petitioned the BPU
to recover the 1993 reward through the next LEAC (See Note 1).  PSE&G expects
that the 1994 combined capacity factor under the Standard will fall within the
capacity factor range equal to or greater than 65% and less than 75%, although
no assurances can be given.

(A)  Retrospective premium program under the Price-Anderson liability
     provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (Price-Anderson).
     Subject to retrospective assessment with respect to loss from an incident
     at any licensed nuclear reactor in the United States. Assessment adjusted
     for inflation effective August 20, 1993.

(B)  Limit of liability for each nuclear incident under Price-Anderson.

(C)  Industry aggregate limit representing the potential liability from workers
     claiming exposure to the hazard of nuclear radiation. This policy includes 
     automatic reinstatements up to an aggregate of $200 million, thereby
     providing total coverage of $400 million. This policy does not increase 
     PSE&G's obligation under Price-Anderson.
 
(D)  Effective November 15, 1994, a new policy NEIL III issued by Nuclear
     Electric Insurance, Inc. will replace the coverage currently afforded by
     ANI and NEIL I.  Under NEIL III and the new NEIL II policy (also effective
     November 15), the potential assessment for a single incident rises to
     $26.5 million.

(E)  Includes $100 million sublimit for premature decommissioning costs.
 
(F)  New policy effective January 1, 1994.

(H)  In the event of a second industry loss triggering NEIL II - coverage, the
     maximum retrospective premium assessment can increase to $16.7 million. 
     ($17.5 million effective November 15, 1994).
 
(I)  Weekly indemnity for 52 weeks which commences after the first 21 weeks of
     an outage. Beyond the first 52 weeks of coverage, indemnity of $2.8
     million per week for 104 weeks is afforded. Total coverage amounts to
     $473.2 million over three years.
 
     Price-Anderson sets the "limit of liability" for claims that could arise
from an incident involving any licensed nuclear facility in the nation. The
"limit of liability" is based on the number of licensed nuclear reactors and
is adjusted at least every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. The
current "limit of liability" is $9 billion. All utilities owning a nuclear
reactor, including PSE&G, have provided for this exposure through a combination
of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial protection pool
as established by Price-Anderson. Under Price-Anderson, each party with an
ownership interest in a nuclear reactor can be assessed its share of $79.3 0.
million per reactor per incident, payable at $10 million per

reactor per incident per year. If the damages exceed the "limit of liability",
the President is to submit to Congress a plan for providing additional
compensation to the injured parties. Congress could impose further revenue
raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims. PSE&G's maximum
aggregate assessment per incident is $210.2 million (based on PSE&G's ownership
interests in Hope Creek, Peach Bottom and Salem) and its maximum aggregate
annual assessment per incident is $26.5 million.

     PSE&G purchases property insurance, including decontamination expense
coverage and premature decommissioning coverage, with respect to loss or damage
to its nuclear facilities. PECO has advised PSE&G that it maintains similar
insurance coverage with respect to Peach Bottom. Under the terms of the various
insurance agreements, PSE&G could be subject to a maximum retrospective
assessment for a single incident of up to $19.4 million. Certain of the
policies also provide that the insurer may suspend coverage with respect to all
nuclear units on a site without notice if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) suspends or revokes the operating license for any unit on a site, issues
a shutdown order with respect to such unit or issues a confirmatory order
keeping such unit shut down.

     PSE&G is a member of an industry mutual insurance company, NEIL, which
provides replacement power cost coverage in the event of a major accidental
outage at a nuclear station. The policies provide for a weekly indemnity
payment of $3.5 million for 52 weeks, subject to a 21-week waiting period. The
policies provide for weekly indemnity payments of $2.8 million for a 104 week
period beyond the first year's indemnity. The premium for this coverage is
subject to retrospective assessment for adverse loss experience. Under the
policies, PSE&G's present maximum share of any retrospective assessment in any
year is $12.4 million.
 
PSE&G URANIUM ENRICHMENT DECONTAMINATION AND DECOMMISSIONING FUND
 
     In accordance with the National Energy Policy Act of 1992 (NEPA), domestic
utilities that own nuclear generating stations are required to pay a cumulative
total of $150 million each year (adjusted for inflation) into a decontamination
and decommissioning fund, based on their past purchases of enrichment services
from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) Uranium Enrichment Enterprise
(now a federal government corporation known as the United States Enrichment
Corporation (USEC)).  These amounts are being collected over a period of 15
years or until $2.25 billion (adjusted for inflation) has been collected. 
Under this legislation, PSE&G's obligation for the nuclear generating stations
in which it has an interest is $66.0 million.  To date PSE&G has paid $13.0
million, resulting in a balance of $53.0 million.  While PSE&G expects to
recover its costs in the next LEAC, it cannot predict the outcome, amount or
timing of any recovery associated with this matter.  In addition, as of
September 30, 1994, PSE&G has recorded a liability of $1.3 million relating to
low level radioactive waste costs incurred at its nuclear generating stations.

CONSTRUCTION AND FUEL SUPPLIES

     PSE&G has substantial commitments as part of its ongoing construction
program which includes capital requirements for nuclear fuel. PSE&G's
construction program is continuously reviewed and periodically revised as a
result of changes in economic conditions, revised load forecasts, changes in
the scheduled retirement dates of existing facilities, changes in business
plans, site changes, cost escalations under construction contracts,
requirements of regulatory authorities and laws, the timing of and amount of
electric and gas rate changes and the ability of PSE&G to raise necessary
capital. Pursuant to an Integrated Electric Resource Plan (IRP), PSE&G
periodically reevaluates its forecasts of future customers, load and peak
growth, sources of electric generating capacity and Demand Side Management
(DSM) to meet such projected growth, including the need to construct new
electric generating capacity. The IRP takes into account assumptions concerning
future demands of customers, effectiveness of conservation and load management
activities, the long-term condition of PSE&G's plants, capacity available from
electric utilities and other suppliers and the amounts of cogeneration and
other nonutility capacity projected to be available.

     Based on PSE&G's 1994-1998 construction program, construction expenditures
are expected to aggregate approximately $4.2 billion, which includes $483
million for nuclear fuel and $133 million of AFDC and capitalized interest
during the years 1994 through 1998. The estimate of construction requirements
is based on expected project completion dates and includes anticipated
escalation, due to inflation, of approximately 4%, annually. Therefore,
construction delays or higher inflation levels could cause significant
increases in these amounts. PSE&G expects to generate internally a majority of
the funds necessary to satisfy its construction expenditures over the next five
years. In addition, PSE&G does not presently anticipate any difficulties in
obtaining sufficient sources of fuel for electric generation or adequate gas
supplies during the years 1994 through 1998.

SALEM STATION

     The NJDEP issued a draft New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NJPDES) permit on October 3, 1990 pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act with respect to Salem 1 and 2 which, if adopted as proposed, would
have required the immediate shutdown of both units pending retrofit with
cooling towers.  On June 24, 1993, NJDEP issued a revised draft permit that
permitted Salem to continue to operate with once-through cooling and requires 
PSE&G to make certain plant modifications and to take certain other actions to
enhance the ecology of the affected water body.  The final five year permit,
with essentially the same provisions as the revised draft permit, was issued
on July 20, 1994.  Certain environmental groups and other entities, including
the State of Delaware, have filed requests for hearings with the NJDEP
challenging the final permit.  The NJDEP granted the hearing requests on
certain of the issues and PSE&G has been named as a respondent along with the
NJDEP in these matters which are pending in the OAL.  The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), which has authority to review the final permit issued
by the NJDEP, completed its review and has not raised any objections.  PSE&G
is implementing the final permit.  Additional permits from various agencies are
required to be obtained to implement the permit.  No assurances can be given
as to receipt of any such additional permits.  Estimated capital cost of
compliance with the final permit is approximately $100 million, of which
PSE&G's share would be 42.59% and is included in PSE&G's 1994-1998 construction
program.

BERGEN STATION REPOWERING 

     PSE&G is presently engaged in Phase I of a construction project to
renovate (or "repower") the Bergen Station pursuant to an air pollution control
permit issued by the NJDEP on May 27, 1993. The current effort would maintain
the existing electric supply of the station (with a small increase from 629 MW
to 669 MW), improve operational reliability and efficiency and significantly
improve the environmental effects of operation of the facility.  At this point
in time, it is highly unlikely that PSE&G will pursue Bergen Phase II; however,
in the event that this project is undertaken, it would increase the capacity
of Bergen by an additional 650 MW.

     On July 12, 1993, the Independent Energy Producers of New Jersey (IEPNJ),
an association of competitors of PSE&G, appealed the NJDEP's issuance of the
air permit for Phase I of the project to the Appellate Division of the New
Jersey Superior Court, alleging that PSE&G is first required to obtain a
Certificate of Need (CON) under the New Jersey Need Assessment Act (NJNAA). 
The NJDEP determined that the NJNAA was inapplicable to this renovation project
and, as more fully described below, the Appellate Division of New Jersey
Superior Court affirmed this determination on July 8, 1994. Obtaining a CON
would be a complex procedure entailing proceedings of at least a two year
duration before the NJDEP, the outcome of which could not be assured.

BERGEN STATION REPOWERING (Concluded)

As of September 30, 1994, Phase I of the renovation project was about 86%
complete and PSE&G had spent approximately $250 million on this effort. The
final cost is estimated to be approximately $400 million.  In accordance with
PSE&G's BPU approved LEAC settlement of November 4, 1994, PSE&G intends to file
a proposal with the BPU seeking rate treatment for  the Bergen Phase I

     On July 8, 1994, the Appellate Division issued a decision affirming the
determination of the NJDEP that a CON was not required for Phase I of the
project.  The Appellate Division, however, concluded that the NJDEP erred by
granting a conditional air pollution control permit for Phase II of the project
and, accordingly, remanded this matter to NJDEP for modification of the permit
to indicate that it only applies to Phase I.  By Notice of Petition for
Certification dated July 27, 1994, IEPNJ petitioned the Supreme Court of New
Jersey for review of the Appellate Division decision that a CON was not
required for Phase I of the project.  PSE&G has opposed this appeal.  Review
by the Supreme Court of New Jersey of this matter is discretionary.  PSE&G
believes that a CON is not required for Phase I of the project.  However, if
a CON were ultimately required by the courts after exhaustion of all appeals,
the permits needed to operate the plant could not be issued until after a CON
was obtained. PSE&G intends to continue this renovation project and to
vigorously defend its position through all available means.

ENVIRONMENT

GENERAL

     Certain Federal and State laws authorize the United States EPA and NJDEP,
among other agencies, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel
responsible parties to take investigative and remedial actions at any site that
is determined to present an imminent and substantial danger to the public or
the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more
hazardous substances. Because of the nature of PSE&G's business, including the
production of electricity, the distribution of gas and, formerly, the
manufacture of gas, various by-products and substances are or were produced or
handled which contain constituents classified as hazardous. PSE&G generally
provides for the disposal or processing of such substances through licensed
independent contractors. However, these statutory provisions impose joint and
several responsibility without regard to fault on all responsible parties,
including the generators of the hazardous substances, for certain investigative
and remediation costs at sites where these substances were disposed of or
processed. PSE&G has been notified with respect to a number of such sites and
the remediation of these potentially hazardous sites is receiving greater
attention from the government agencies involved. Generally, actions directed
at funding such site investigations and remediation include all suspected or
known responsible parties. PSE&G does not expect its expenditures for any such
site to be material.

PSE&G MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT REMEDIATION PROGRAM 

     In March 1988, NJDEP notified PSE&G that it had identified the need for
PSE&G, pursuant to a formal arrangement, to systematically investigate and, if
necessary, resolve environmental concerns extant at PSE&G's former manufactured
gas plant sites. To date, NJDEP and PSE&G have identified 38 former gas plant
sites. PSE&G is currently working with NJDEP under a program to assess,
investigate and, if necessary, remediate environmental concerns at its former
gas plant sites (Remediation Program). The Remediation Program is periodically
reviewed and revised by PSE&G based on regulatory requirements, experience with
the Remediation Program and available technologies. The cost of the Remediation
Program cannot be reasonably estimated, but experience to date indicates that
costs of at least $20 million per year could be incurred over a period of more
than 30 years and that the overall cost could be material. 

     Costs incurred through September 30, 1994 for the Remediation Program
amounted to $49.9 million, net of insurance recoveries. In addition, at
September 30, 1994, PSE&G's liability for estimated remediation costs, net of
insurance recoveries, through March 31, 1996 aggregated $105.5 million. In
accordance with a Stipulation approved by the BPU on January 21, 1992, PSE&G
is recovering $32 million of its actual remediation costs to reflect costs
incurred through September 30, 1992, net of insurance recoveries, over a six-
year period.  PSE&G will recover $5.3 million in each of its next three LGAC
periods ending in 1996, net of insurance recoveries. The regulatory treatment
of the remediation costs covered by this Stipulation was not changed in the
BPU's September 15, 1993 written order, allowing continued collection under the
terms of the January 21, 1992 Stipulation. The decision of September 15, 1993
concluded that PSE&G had met its burden of proof for establishing the
reasonableness and prudence of remediation costs incurred in operating and
decommissioning these facilities in the past. The remediation costs incurred
during the period July 1, 1992 through September 30, 1992 were subject to audit
and verification in PSE&G's 1992-93 LGAC. The audit has been completed and
resulted in no disallowance of any costs. The order also approved a mechanism
for costs incurred since October 1, 1992, allowing the recovery of actual costs
plus carrying charges, net of insurance recoveries, over a seven-year period
through PSE&G's LEAC and LGAC, with 60% charged to gas customers and 40%
charged to electric customers.  (See Note 1 - Rate Matters - Remediation
Adjustment Clause). 
 
     In November 1988, PSE&G filed suit against certain of its insurers to
recover the costs associated with addressing and resolving environmental issues
of the Remediation Program. PSE&G has settled its claim with one insurer and
there is a trial scheduled for January 1995 with the remaining insurers. 
Pending full recovery of Remediation Program costs through rates or under its
insurance policies, neither of which can be assured, PSE&G will be required to
finance the unreimbursed costs of its Remediation Program.

                        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Following are the significant changes in or additions to information 
reported in Enterprise's Annual Report to the SEC on Form 10-K for 1993 and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for March and June 1994, affecting the
consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of Enterprise
and its subsidiaries.  This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and related Notes of Enterprise and should be read in conjunction
with such statements and notes.

     As of September 30, 1994, PSE&G comprised 86% of Enterprise assets. 
PSE&G's revenues were 93% of Enterprise's revenues for the three, nine, and
twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994, and PSE&G's earnings available
to Enterprise for such periods were 96%, 93%, and 98%, respectively, of
Enterprise's net income. 

COMPETITION

     Ongoing initiatives affecting PSE&G's electric and gas utility businesses
associated with the continuing transition to a competitive market environment
will have an increasingly significant impact on Enterprise and PSE&G.  Federal
legislation, including the National Energy Policy Act (NEPA), as well as
regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels that are designed
to promote competition and lessen regulation of the energy supply industry can
be expected to result in additional pressures on customer retention due to
energy prices, especially with respect to larger industrial and commercial
customers.  Growth potential is limited in PSE&G's mature service territory. 
 Currently, the BPU is addressing these issues in collaboration with the
State's utilities and other interested parties in the context of a revision of
the New Jersey Energy Master Plan.  Phase 1 of the Energy Master Plan is
scheduled to be released in January 1995.  The BPU has publicly stated that it
intends to recommend proposed legislation addressing the issue of regulatory
flexibility in December 1994.

     The shifting of rate regulation from traditional concepts based upon rate
base rate of return to concepts based upon market competition and service
appears to be accelerating.  As a result, added emphasis will be placed upon
cost containment, and utilities and their regulators will need to develop
flexible ratemaking strategies to minimize adverse impacts which might
otherwise occur to revenues and earnings and maximize potential opportunities
presented by deregulation.  The manner in which regulators address evolving
competitive issues will also affect utility credit quality.  

     This transition to a competitive market environment may also affect
utilities' asset values as a result of changes from traditional utility 
ratemaking.  A shift to a market-price determination of asset values could
result in transition costs, including costs related to power purchase
contracts, and create "stranded assets".  Such assets could include electric
generating units constituting excess capacity, less efficient units whose cost
may be too high to be fully supported by competitively set

rates and/or certain regulatory assets whose costs may not be fully recoverable
in a deregulated environment.  If changes in rate regulation ultimately require
a recognition of any such stranded assets, write-downs for utilities, including
PSE&G, may occur.  At this time management cannot predict the level of
transition costs or stranded assets resulting from industry deregulation, if
any, or whether utility regulators will allow recovery of any such transition
costs from customers.  However, such amounts could be material.

     PSE&G has signed each of its three existing wholesale electric customers,
aggregating 40 mw of load, to new 5-year full service agreements with mid-term
extension options.  Two of these agreements, are pending approval by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

  PSE&G

     PSE&G's earnings available to Enterprise increased by $1 million, or 1%
for the quarter ended September 30, 1994 from the quarter ended September 30,
1993.  The increase was due to lower operating expenses principally due to a
decrease in federal income taxes resulting from lower pre-tax operating income
and lower maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher amortization
expenses due to more utility plant in service and other operation expenses 
(comprised primarily of  labor and employee benefits). Also adversely affecting
earnings were higher interest expense resulting from an increase in long-term
debt outstanding and higher rates for commmercial paper.

     PSE&G's earnings available to Enterprise increased by $31 million, or 6%
for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 from the comparable nine month
period ended September 30, 1993.  The increase was primarily due to increased
electric commercial sales  and firm gas residential and commercial sales. 
Electric (kilowatthour) and gas (therm) sales increased 1.2% and 6.1%,
respectively, principally due to weather and a modest improvement in New
Jersey's economy.  In addition, lower interest expense resulting from
refinancing debt also contributed to the increase in earnings.  The major
factors adversely affecting earnings were higher depreciation and amortization
expenses due to more utility plant in service, higher maintenance expenses at
Hope Creek nuclear station due to the spring 1994 refueling outage, increased
federal income taxes due to higher pre-tax operating income and increased other
operation expenses (comprised primarily of labor and employee benefits costs).

     Excluding the $14 million net effect of the 1992 settlement of litigation
against  PECO in connection with the 1987 shutdown of Peach Bottom by the NRC, 
PSE&G's earnings available to Enterprise increased by $29 million  or 5%, for
the twelve month period ended September 30, 1994 from the comparable twelve
month period ended September 30, 1993.  The principal factors contributing to
the increase were PSE&G's increased weather-related electric and gas sales, a
modest improvement in New Jersey's economy and higher electric and gas base
rates that became effective January 1, 1993.   In addition, lower interest
expense resulting from refinancing of debt also contributed to the increase in
earnings. Partially offsetting the increase in earnings were higher other
operation expenses (comprised primarily of labor, employee benefits costs and
miscellaneous nuclear production expenses), increased maintenance expenses at
the Mercer generating station, increased maintenance expenses at Hope Creek 
nuclear station due to the spring 1994 refueling outage, higher federal income
taxes resulting from higher pre-tax operating income and  higher depreciation
and amortization expenses.

  EDHI

     EDHI's decrease in net income of $6 million, or 48% for the quarter ended
September 30, 1994 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 1993  was
primarily due to lower gas volumes and prices and higher exploration and
development expenses due to increased drilling activities for EDC.  Partially
offsetting the decrease were lower income taxes for EDHI due to the increase
in the Federal income tax rate in August 1993 and higher income from certain
CEA projects.

     EDHI's net income for the nine month period ended September 30, 1994
decreased $11 million, or 23%,  from the comparable nine month period ended
September 30, 1993. The primary factors contributing to the decrease were lower
gas volumes and lower gas and  oil  prices and higher exploration and
development expenses due to increased drilling activities for EDC.  Partially
offsetting the decrease was higher income from PSRC due to lower interest
expense, higher partnership income and higher gains from marketable securities, 
partially offset by lower interest and  dividend income.   CEA's income
increased due to higher income from various projects and EGDC's net loss
decreased due to lower interest  expense.  Also, EDHI experienced lower income
taxes due to the increase in the Federal income tax rate in August 1993.

     Excluding the recorded 1993 impairment related to certain of EGDC's
properties, which reduced net income by $51 million,  EDHI's net income for the
twelve month period ended September 30, 1994 increased by $9 million, or 16%,
compared to the twelve month period ended September 30, 1993. The increase was
due principally to PSRC's higher income from investments and increased
productivity at certain CEA projects, partially offset by lower EDC gas volumes
and lower gas and oil prices.

DIVIDENDS

     Dividends paid to holders of Enterprise Common Stock during the three,
nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994 increased $1.5 million,
$5.5 million and $10.1 million, respectively, over the comparable 1993 periods. 
The increase in dividend payments was due to the issuance of additional shares
of Enterprise Common Stock.  (See Liquidity and Capital Resources.)

     Dividends paid to holders of PSE&G's Preferred Stock, during the three,
nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994 increased $377 thousand,
$2.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively, over the comparable 1993 periods. 
The increase in such dividends was due to the issuance of additional shares of
PSE&G's Preferred Stock, partially offset by reduced expense resulting from the
redemption of certain higher cost series of Preferred Stock.  (See Liquidity
and Capital Resources.)

  PSE&G ELECTRIC - (Concluded)

     The 2% decrease in revenues during the three month period ended September 30, 1994, was primarily due to lower
sales to residential customers resulting from cooler 1994 weather conditions (THI down 11.3%).  Commercial and
industrial sales increased due to an improving New Jersey economy, however, industrial sales were partially offset
by lost sales due to a maintenance shutdown at PSE&G's largest industrial customer.  The decrease in the recovery
of energy costs for the quarter was primarily attributable to lower sales.

     Revenues for the nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994, remained relatively unchanged.  Sales
to commercial customers increased due to an improving New Jersey economy, while industrial sales were partially
offset by lost sales due to a maintenance shutdown at PSE&G's largest industrial customer.  Contributing to the
slight increase in revenues for the twelve month period was the base rate increase which became effective January
1, 1993.  The decrease in the recovery of fuel costs for the nine and twelve months ended September 30, 1994, was
due to lower sales.

     Revenues increased $17 million, or 9% during the three months ended September 30, 1994, $210 million, or 19%,

     The gas revenue increase of 9% for the quarter ended September 30, 1994 from the comparable quarter of 1993
is primarily attributable to an increase in industrial cogeneration sales as a result of increased average customer
usage due to an improving economy and recovery of fuel costs.

     The gas revenue increase of 19% and 13% for the nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994,
respectively, from the comparable periods of 1993 is primarily attributable to an increase in the recovery of fuel
costs principally due to higher fuel rates, higher sales and significantly lower customer refunds. Residential,
commercial and industrial sales increased due to favorable weather conditions and an improving economy.  Sales to
cogenerators was the largest contributor to the increase in industrial sales as cogeneration average customer usage
for electric generation continues to increase.  Also contributing to the increase in revenues for the twelve months
ended September 30, 1994, was the base rate revenue increase which became effective January 1, 1993.

     EDC's revenues were lower compared to prior periods due to lower gas volumes and prices and lower oil prices. 
PSRC's revenues were lower for the three months ended September 30, 1994 due to lower gains from security
investments and lower interest and dividend income and were higher for the nine and twelve months ended September
30, 1994 due to higher income from partnerships, leases and gains from security investments, partially offset by
lower interest and dividend income.  CEA's revenues were higher for all 1994 periods due to increased productivity
at certain projects.

<FN>

(A)  Reflects the change in deferred over(under) recovered energy costs.

     The decrease in total costs during the third quarter of 1994 from the comparable 1993 quarter was principally
due to the underrecovery of energy costs and a 1% decrease in kilowatthour generation, partially offset by a 17%
increase in purchased power, principally from the PJM interconnection.

     The decrease in total costs during the first nine months of 1994 from the comparable 1993 period was
principally due to the underrecovery of energy costs, partially offset by a 16% increase in purchased power costs
and a 1% increase in kilowatthour generation.

     The decrease in total costs for the twelve month period ended September 30, 1994 from the comparable 1993
period was principally the result of an adjustment in the recovery of energy costs resulting from the BPU base rate
case decision effective January 1, 1993, partially offset by a 17% increase in purchased power costs and a 1%
increase in kilowatthour generation.

<FN>
(A)  Reflects the change in deferred over(under) recovered gas costs.

     For the quarter ended September 30, 1994, lower gas prices were offset by greater sendout, increased sales
to Nonutility Generators (NUGS) and overrecovered  gas costs.  The increases in total costs for the nine and twelve
month periods ended September 30, 1994 compared to similar periods in 1993 were primarily attributable to increased
sendout as a result of the colder winter, higher gas prices and increased sales to NUGS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Enterprise's liquidity is affected by maturing debt (See Note 2 - Long-
Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), investment and
acquisition activities, the capital requirements of PSE&G's construction
program and permitted regulatory recovery of expenses and collection of
revenues. (For additional information see Note 3 - Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

  PSE&G

     For the nine month period ended September 30, 1994, PSE&G had utility
plant additions, excluding AFDC, of $551 million, an increase of $17 million
from the corresponding period in 1993.  For the twelve month period ended
September 30, 1994, PSE&G had utility plant additions, excluding AFDC, of $880
million, an increase of $79 million from the corresponding period in 1993. 
Construction expenditures were related to improvements in PSE&G's existing
power plants, transmission and distribution system, gas system and common
facilities.

     PSE&G expects that it will be able to generate internally a majority of
its capital requirements, including construction expenditures, over the next
five years.  (See Note 1 - Rate Matters and Note 3 - Commitments and Contingent
Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

     Legislation effective January 1, 1992 phased in an acceleration of payment
of the New Jersey Gross Receipts and Franchise Tax (NJGRT) during 1992-94, so
that for 1994 and for each year thereafter PSE&G will be paying its estimated
current year's NJGRT liability in April of each such year. In April 1993, PSE&G
paid $899 million (its 1992 NJGRT plus 50% of its estimated 1993 NJGRT). In
April 1994, PSE&G paid $847 million (the remainder of its 1993 NJGRT plus its
1994 estimated NJGRT). Such prepayment had been partially funded by PSE&G
through the issuance of short-term debt.  On September 20, 1994, the BPU
approved a petition filed by PSE&G to replace a portion of such short-term
funding with $100 million of long-term debt.  (See External Financing)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)

  EDHI

     During the next five years, a majority of EDHI's capital requirements are
expected to be provided from operational cash flows. EDHI intends to focus its
efforts on CEA and EDC, its energy-related core businesses. CEA is expected to
be the primary vehicle for its business growth and EDC is projected to attain
and maintain a reserve base, principally through exploration and drilling, at
approximately 900 billion cubic feet equivalent (BCFE), approximately 11% above
the December 1993 level. During 1994, EDC has expended approximately $121
million to acquire or discover domestic and international reserves.  At
September 30, 1994, EDC had reserves of 808 BCFE.  PSRC will make limited new
investments related to EDHI's core business, while EGDC will exit the real
estate business in a prudent manner. Over the next several years, EDHI and its
subsidiaries will also be required to refinance a portion of their maturing
debt in order to meet their capital requirements. Any inability to extend or
replace maturing debt at current levels and interest rates may affect future
earnings and result in an increase in EDHI's cost of capital.

     A partnership, in which EGDC is an 80% partner ($21 million equity
investment), is currently negotiating to extend or replace a mortgage financing
of $40.2 million which is maturing on January 2, 1995.  EGDC has guaranteed
$5.3 million of the financing.  No assurances can be given that EGDC or the
partnership will be able to extend this loan or obtain a replacement loan in
the amount of the existing loan.  Failure to extend or replace the existing
loan at the current outstanding loan balance, or at current interest rates, may
result in an increase in the amount of equity capital which EGDC will require.

     PSRC is a limited partner in various limited partnerships and is committed
to make investments from time to time, upon the request of the respective
general partners. At September 30, 1994, $118 million remained as PSRC's
unfunded commitment subject to call.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Continued)

     EDHI and each of its subsidiaries are subject to restrictive business and
financial covenants contained in existing debt agreements and are required to
not exceed various debt to equity ratios which vary from 3:1 to 1.75:1. EDHI
is also required to maintain a twelve months earnings before interest and taxes
to interest (EBIT) coverage ratio of at least 1.35:1. As of September 30, 1994
and 1993, EDHI had consolidated debt to equity ratios of 1.15:1 and 1.63:1 and,
for the twelve months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993, EBIT coverage ratios,
as defined to exclude the effects of EGDC, of 2.01:1 and 1.90:1, respectively.
Compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future levels
of earnings, among other things, as to which no assurance can be given. (See
Note 4 -  Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

  INTERNAL GENERATION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS

     Enterprise's cash provided by operating activities increased $81 million
to $728 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 compared to the
corresponding period in 1993.  This increase was primarily due to a decrease
in accounts receivable, an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation
and amortization and  a decrease in NJGRT payments, partially offset by a
decrease in accounts payable.  (For more information see Enterprise Earnings
and Revenues.)

     Enterprise's cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months
ended September 30, 1994 decreased $45 million to $1.089 billion when compared
to the corresponding period in 1993.  This decrease was primarily due to the
lower recovery of electric energy and gas costs through PSE&G's LEAC and LGAC
and a decrease in accounts payable. Partially offsetting these cash outflows
were a decrease in accounts receivables, the loss from property impairments and
a decrease in inventories.  (For additional information see Enterprise Earnings
and Revenues.)

(A)   During the first nine months of 1994, Enterprise issued and sold
1,009,674 shares of Common Stock through its DRIP and Employee Stock Purchase
Plan. All such sales of Common Stock took place during the first quarter of
1994.  The net proceeds from such sales, aggregated approximately $28 million
and were used by Enterprise to make equity investments in EDHI.

EDHI utilized such funds to repay outstanding debt at maturity.  Book value per
share was $21.71 at September 30, 1994, compared to $21.26 at September 30,
1993 and $21.07 at December 31, 1993.  

(B)  See DIVIDENDS.

(C) Under the terms of PSE&G's Mortgage and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation at September 30, 1994, PSE&G would qualify to issue an additional
$4.204 billion of its Bonds at a rate of 8.875% or $3.668 billion of Preferred
Stock at a rate of 8.875%.  PSE&G's Restated Certificate of Incorporation
limits the issuance of Preferred Stock to $1.0 billion, of which $610 million
is outstanding.

     In addition, as a prerequisite to the issuance of additional Bonds,
PSE&G's Mortgage requires a 2:1 ratio of earnings to fixed charges as computed
thereunder.  For the twelve months ended September 30, 1994 such ratio was
3.43:1.

     On September 20, 1994, the BPU approved PSE&G's petition to replace a
portion of its short-term debt funding for NJGRT with $100 million of long-term
debt.  Under authority previously granted by the BPU and expiring on December
31, 1994, PSE&G is authorized to issue an additional $441 million principal
amount of its Bonds or MTNs for the purpose of refunding higher cost
securities.  PSE&G filed a Petition on October 11, 1994 for authority to issue
$370 million of Bonds/MTNs through 1996 for refunding purposes and to extend
the authority for the $100 million of Bonds/MTNs approved in the September 20th
Order.

     The BPU has authorized PSE&G to issue not more than $800 million of its
short-term obligations at any one time outstanding, consisting of commercial
paper and other unsecured borrowings from banks and other lenders through
December 31, 1994.  On November 2, 1994, PSE&G filed a Petition with the BPU
requesting authority to issue short-term interim obligations not exceeding $1
billion through January 1, 1997.  On September 30, 1994, PSE&G had $563 million
of short-term debt outstanding.  

     PSE&G renewed and increased to $800 million a revolving credit agreement
with a group of commercial banks through September 30, 1995.  On September 30,
1994, there was no short-term debt outstanding under this credit agreement.

(D)  Includes commercial paper issued and/or redeemed by PSE&G Fuel Corporation
(Fuelco) and guaranteed by PSE&G pursuant to a commercial paper program
supported by a bank revolving credit facility to finance the acquisition of a
42.49% undivided interest in the nuclear fuel for Peach Bottom.  Fuelco has a
$150 million commercial paper program through September 1996.  On September 30,
1994, Fuelco had $80 million of its commercial paper outstanding.

(E)  Enterprise's long-term debt aggregated $5.278 billion as of September 30,
1994, of which $4.486 billion was attributable to PSE&G and $792 million to
EDHI.

     During the nine months ended September 30, 1994, PSE&G issued a total of
$692 million principal amount of its Bonds and $60 million principal amount of
MTN's. The net proceeds from the sale of the Bonds and MTNs were used by PSE&G
to redeem $376 million principal amount, including sinking funds requirements,
of its higher cost Bonds, to defease in substance $122.5 million principal
amount of higher cost Bonds and to pay a portion of its current construction
program.

     On October 31, 1994, PSE&G issued a total of $98 million principal amount
of its Bonds and on November 1, 1994 redeemed a total of $98 million principal
amount of its Bonds.

For additional detail see Note 2 - Long-Term Debt of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

(F)  In February 1994, PSE&G issued and sold $75 million of its Cumulative
Preferred Stock. In March 1994, PSE&G used the funds from the above sale to
redeem $45 million of its higher priced Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
remaining funds were added to the general funds of PSE&G and used to pay a
portion of its then outstanding short-term debt obligations, which were
principally incurred to fund a portion of its construction expenditures.

     On November 4, 1994, the BPU approved an Order extending through December
31, 1995 PSE&G's authority to issue an additional $330 million of Preferred
Stock, including the guarantee of $210 million of Monthly Income Preferred
Securities (MIPS) of Public Service Electric and Gas Capital, L. P., a limited
partnership of which PSE&G is general partner.

(G)  Funding has a commercial paper program, supported by a commercial bank
letter of credit and credit facility, through November 18, 1995 in the amount
of $225 million. As of September 30, 1994, Funding had no borrowings
outstanding under this program.

NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

     Salem

     Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 (Salem 1) experienced an
automatic reactor shutdown which occurred on April 7, 1994 due to excessive
grass from the Delaware River clogging the station's water intake structure.
Subsequent to the shutdown a Precautionary Alert was declared at 1:16 p.m. and
this emergency classification was terminated at 8:20 p.m.  No abnormal releases
of radiation to the environment occurred during the event and there was no
threat to the public health and safety.  Salem 1  remained out of service while
PSE&G and the NRC investigated the event and PSE&G implemented remedial
actions.  PSE&G agreed not to restart the unit until approval was obtained from
the NRC. 

    On April 7, 1994, the NRC sent an Augmented Inspection Team (AIT) to Salem
to investigate the event.  The AIT completed its on-site investigation on April
15, 1994 and presented its preliminary findings at a public meeting held at the
station site on April 26, 1994.  The AIT concluded that the event had
challenged the reactor coolant system pressure boundary, that operator error
had occurred which complicated the event, that management had allowed equipment
problems to exist which made operations difficult for plant operators and that
some equipment was degraded by the event, but overall the plant performed as
designed.  The AIT further concluded that operator use of emergency operating
procedures was good and that investigation and trouble-shooting efforts were
good.  PSE&G's investigation of the event resulted in conclusions similar to
those of the AIT.  On May 9, 1994, PSE&G and the NRC staff presented their
findings to the NRC Commissioners, and PSE&G described the actions it had taken
to prepare Salem 1 for restart.  On May 11, 1994, Senator Joseph Biden of
Delaware wrote to the NRC expressing his concerns regarding early restart of
the unit and requested assurances "that all outstanding mechanical and
management problems have been resolved and that a fine in the maximum amount
will be levied upon the licensees".  The unit returned to service on June 4,
1994.  

     PSE&G has continued to address matters to improve Salem's operations
identified by itself, the NRC and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations
(INPO), an independent industry group consisting of utilities, including PSE&G,
that provides self critical analysis of nuclear operations to member utilities. 
Actions are being taken to improve the plant's material condition, to upgrade
procedures and to enhance personnel performance, as well as other efforts to
such end, including appointment of a new station manager and senior plant
staff.  In addition, PSE&G, effective September 29, 1994, established its
nuclear operations as a separate business unit reporting directly to the

NUCLEAR OPERATIONS - (Concluded)

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PSE&G and hired Leon R. Eliason as its
Chief Nuclear Officer and President of its new Nuclear Business Unit.

     On October 5, 1994, the NRC, as a result of the AIT inspection, as well
as a follow-up inspection, issued a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition
of Civil Penalty to PSE&G advising that it proposed to impose an aggregate fine
of $500,000 for violations relating to the April 7, 1994 event, including:  the
failure to identify and correct significant conditions adverse to quality at
the facility related to spurious steam flow signals and inoperable atmospheric
relief valves, both of which, it concluded, led to unnecessary safety
injections during the event; the failure to identify and correct significant
conditions adverse to quality at the facility related to providing adequate
training, guidance and procedures for the operators to cope with the event; and
the failure by supervisors to exercise appropriate command and control of the
operations staff and the reactor during the event.  In assessing its fine, the
NRC advised PSE&G that it "expects an aggressive and prompt response to this
matter as neither PSE&G nor the NRC can accept (1) such performance in the
future and (2) the large number of equipment related events that have recently
occurred at Salem."  The NRC has stated that, after reviewing PSE&G's response
to the Notice, including PSE&G's proposed corrective actions and the results
of future inspections, it will determine whether further NRC enforcement action
is necessary to ensure compliance with NRC regulatory requirements.  

    PSE&G's own assessments, as well as those by the NRC and INPO, indicate
that additional efforts are required to further improve operating performance,
and  PSE&G is committed to taking the necessary actions to address Salem's
performance needs.  PSE&G has indicated that the proposed $500,000 fine will
be paid without challenge.  No assurance can be given as to what, if any,
further or additional actions may be taken by the NRC or what further or
additional actions may be taken by PSE&G, or required by the NRC, to improve
Salem's performance.

     Peach Bottom

     PSE&G has been advised by PECO that, by letter dated October 18, 1994, the
NRC has approved PECO's request to rerate the authorized maximum reactor core
power levels of both Peach Bottom units by 5% to 3,458 megawatts thermal (Mwt)
from the current limits of 3,293 Mwt.  The amendment of the Peach Bottom 2
facility operating license was effective upon the date of the NRC approval
letter.   The amendment of the Peach Bottom 3 facility operating license will
be effective upon completion of the implementation of associated hardware
changes, which are to be completed during Peach Bottom 3's next refueling
outage scheduled for the fall of 1995.

 (A) Reflects the change in deferred over(under) recovered gas costs.

     For the quarter ended September 30, 1994, lower gas prices, were offset by greater sendout, increased sales
to NUGs and overrecovered gas costs.  The increases in total costs for the nine and twelve month periods ended
September 30, 1994 compared to similar periods in 1993 were primarily attributable to increased sendout as a result
of the colder winter, higher gas prices and increased sales to NUGS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

INTERNAL GENERATION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS

     PSE&G's cash provided by operating activities increased $99 million to
$577 million for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 compared to the
corresponding period in 1993. This increase was primarily due to an increase
in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization, a decrease in
accounts receivable and a decrease in NJGRT payments, partially offset by a
decrease in accounts payable.  (For additional information see  PSE&G -
Earnings and Revenues.)

     PSE&G's net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months
ended September 30, 1994 decreased by $5 million to $922 million when compared
to the corresponding period in 1993.  This decrease was primarily due to a
lower recovery of electric energy and gas costs through PSE&G's LEAC and LGAC
and a decrease in accounts payable. Substantially offsetting these cash
outflows were the increase in net income, an increase in deferred income taxes,
a decrease in accounts receivable, a decrease in inventories and a decrease in
NJGRT payments.

     Certain information reported under Item 1 of Part I of Enterprise's  and
PSE&G's Annual Reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K
for 1993 (Form 10-K) and Item 2 of Part II of Enterprise's and PSE&G's
Quarterly Reports to the SEC on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 1994
(March 10-Q) and June 30, 1994 (June 10-Q) are updated below.  References are
to the related pages and paragraph(s) of the Form 10-K, March 10-Q and June 10-
Q.

     On March 31, 1994, PSE&G filed proposed new rate schedules to implement
the BPU guidelines on unbundled gas services.  This will enable PSE&G's
remaining 175,000 industrial and commercial gas customers to participate in the
competitive market after regulatory approval is received.  The proposed
transportation rate schedules produce the same non-fuel revenue per therm as
the customers' existing sales service rate schedules.  Thus, PSE&G's earnings
would be unaffected whether the customers remain on sales service or convert
to transportation service.  It is expected that the BPU will approve the
proposal in late 1994 and that interested customers would be transporting gas
soon thereafter.  (See Note 1 - Rate Matters of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements)

     For a discussion of the recent outage at the Salem Nuclear Generating
Station, Unit 1 see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations - Nuclear Operations.

     As by-products of their operations, nuclear generating units, including
those in which PSE&G owns an interest, produce low level radioactive waste
(LLRW).  Such wastes include paper, plastics, protective clothing, water
purification materials and other materials which must be properly disposed. 
Prior to July 1, 1994 such materials were accumulated on site and disposed of
at a federally licensed permanent disposal facility.  However, in accordance
with the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, as amended, operating disposal
sites have exercised their authority to either cease operations or deny access
to states which are not members of their regional compact.  For PSE&G and all
other New Jersey LLRW generators, this means that  effective July 1, 1994 waste
must be temporarily stored on site until New Jersey provides for permanent
disposal.

     Form 10-K, page 11, paragraph 1 and June 10-Q, page 52, paragraph 1 -
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     In June 1991, New Jersey enacted legislation providing for funding of the
estimated $90 million cost of establishing a disposal facility.  The state
recovers the costs through fees paid by LLRW generators.  PSE&G's overall share
is expected to be about 40% of the total cost.  New Jersey has introduced a
volunteer siting process as its plan for establishing a LLRW disposal facility
by the year 2000.  Public meetings are being held across the state in an effort
to provide information to, and obtain feedback from the public.  The plan is
to be approved by November 1994 and an official invitation to municipalities
to become volunteer hosts for a disposal facility will be announced sometime
in 1995.

     Until  New Jersey provides for disposal, PSE&G will temporarily store LLRW
in a newly constructed facility at the plant site.  This facility was completed
in September 1994 at a total cost of $7.1 million.  It will provide five years'
storage for LLRW from Hope Creek and Salem.  PECO has advised PSE&G that:  the
Peach Bottom plants located in Pennsylvania and operated by PECO are also
providing temporary on-site storage which began July 1, 1994; Pennsylvania is
pursuing site development via state selected candidate sites along with a
volunteer plan option; PECO has constructed an on-site storage facility at
Peach Bottom; and adequate space is available for its waste for at least five
years.  PSE&G will continue to accrue monies for stored LLRW from Salem, Hope
Creek and Peach Bottom with a concurrent liability for the amount to be paid
at the time of ultimate disposal when New Jersey and Pennsylvania provide
storage facilities.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     On May 25, 1994, the DOE published a Notice of Inquiry indicating its
preliminary view on waste acceptance.  The DOE stated that it has no statutory
obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998 in the absence of an
operational repository or other facility constructed under the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982, as amended, although the DOE in implementing the standard
contract may have created an expectation that it would begin accepting such
spent nuclear fuel in 1998.  The Notice of Inquiry is intended to elicit the
views of the affected parties on 1) The Department's preliminary view on the
1998 obligation issue, 2) the need for an interim, away-from-reactor storage
facility prior to repository operations, 3) options for offsetting, through the
use of a nuclear waste fund, a portion of the financial burden that may be
incurred by utilities to store spent fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998.
Moreover, with respect to safety, on October 18, 1990, the NRC determined that
spent nuclear fuel generated in any reactor can be stored safely and without
significant environmental impact in reactor facility storage pools or in
independent spent fuel storage installations located at reactor or away-from-
reactor sites for at least 30 years beyond the licensed life for operation 
(which may include the term of a  revised or renewed license).

     In June 1994, two separate lawsuits were filed by a group of states and
a group of utilities, respectively, in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit to compel DOE to accept spent fuel by 1998.  On
July 19, 1994, the BPU voted to join the lawsuit brought by the group of
states.  PSE&G is not a party to the lawsuit brought by the group of utilities.

     Salem 1 and 2 have adequate on-site temporary storage capability through
March 1998 and March 2002, respectively, when operational full core discharge
capability requirements are considered.  PSE&G has developed an integrated
strategy to meet the longer term Salem and Hope Creek spent fuel storage needs. 
In May 1994, PSE&G received a license from the NRC to replace the existing high
density racks in the spent fuel pools of Salem 1 and 2 with maximum density
racks.  The Salem re-racking project is ongoing and is expected to extend the
storage capability through March 2008 for Salem 1 and March 2012 for Salem 2,
considering operational full core discharge requirements.  The Hope Creek pool
is fully racked and it has capacity to hold spent fuel through September 2007,
considering operational full core discharge requirements.  PECO has advised
PSE&G that spent fuel racks at Peach Bottom 2 have storage capacity until 2000
for Unit 2 and 1999 for Unit 3 prior to loss of full core reserve occurring,
and that expansion of storage capacity beyond such dates is being investigated.

     In response to a BPU directive, PSE&G surveyed EMF levels at 19 schools
located within 100 feet of its electric transmission lines.  In April 1994, the
survey results were provided to the BPU and officials of such schools.  The
survey has generated requests by five schools for additional information and
has resulted in a heightened concern about the emerging EMF issue.  One Board
of Education has agreed to pay PSE&G to reconfigure certain transmission
facilities.  That work has been completed.  A second Board of Education
requested estimates of engineering costs to reconfigure transmission lines at
its expense.

     As a member of a group of utility companies against whom EPA has asserted
a claim for clean-up of the Metal Bank superfund site in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania and pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent, PSE&G has
participated in the funding and oversight of an Remedial Investment and
Feasibility Study (RI/FS) of the site.  The RI/FS was recently completed and
the RI/FS Report was submitted to EPA on October 14, 1994.  The RI/FS Report
proposes various remedial alternatives for consideration by EPA in its
selection of a remedy for the site.  The alternatives proposed in the RI/FS
range in cost from approximately $2 million to approximately $90 million. 
However, the RI/FS proposes a remedy ranging in cost from $15 to $30 million. 
It is expected that during 1995 EPA will select a remedy and issue a Record of
Decision memorializing this remedy selection.  At that time it is anticipated
that EPA will assess a claim against PSE&G and the other similarly situated
utility companies, and perhaps others as well, for the performance or funding
of the selected remedy.  PSE&G's share of the costs of the proposed remedy may
approximate $7 million.

     In October 1990, General Electric (GE) reported that crack indications
were discovered near the seam welds of the core shroud assembly in a GE Boiling
Water Reactor (BWR) located outside the United States.  As a result, GE issued
a letter requesting that the owners of GE BWR plants take interim corrective
actions, including a review of fabrication records and visual examinations of
accessible areas of the core shroud seam welds.   PSE&G (Hope Creek) and PECO
(Peach Bottom) are participating in a GE BWR Owners Group to evaluate this
issue and develop long-term corrective actions.  During the spring 1994
refueling outage, PSE&G inspected the shroud of Hope Creek in accordance with
GE's recommendations and found no cracks.  PSE&G is working closely with GE and
the BWR Owners Group on coordination of inspections, evaluations and repair
options, if required.  PSE&G expects minimal impact due to the age and
materials of the Hope Creek shroud and the historical maintenance of low
conductivity water chemistry.  For these reasons Hope Creek has been placed in
the lowest susceptibility category by the BWR Owner Group.

          PECO has advised PSE&G that Peach Bottom 3 was examined in October
1993 during the last refueling outage and crack indications were identified at
two locations.  In November 3, 1993, PECO presented its findings to the NRC and
provided justification for continued operation of Unit 3 for another two year
cycle with crack indications.  PECO has also advised that Peach Bottom 2 was
examined in October 1994 during its recently completed refueling outage. 
Although some crack indications were identified, they were considered to be
much less severe than those previously found on Unit 3, and no repairs were
required to operate Unit 2 for another two-year cycle.

                           POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES Q

     Public Service Electric and Gas Company (hereinafter called the

hereby promises to pay to First Fidelity Bank, National Association, as trustee
under the Authority Indenture, or registered assigns, the principal sum of One

2031, and to pay interest thereon from the date hereof, at the rate of 6.25%
per annum, and until payment of said principal sum, such interest to be payable

     Both the principal hereof and interest hereon shall be paid at the
principal office of First Fidelity Bank, National Association in the City of
Newark, State of New Jersey, or at the corporate trust office of any paying
agent appointed by the Company, in such coin or currency of the United States
of America as at the time of payment shall constitute legal tender for the
payment of public and private debts.

     This Bond is one of the First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds of the Company
issued and to be issued under and pursuant to, and all equally secured by, an
indenture of mortgage or deed of trust dated August 1, 1924, between the
Company and First Fidelity Bank, National Association (formerly known as
Fidelity Union Trust Company), a national banking association of the United
States of America, as Trustee, as supplemented and amended by the supplemental
indentures thereto, including the supplemental indenture dated June 1, 1994.
This Bond is one of the Bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q, which series
is limited to the aggregate principal amount of $104,365,000 and is issued
pursuant to said supplemental indenture dated June 1, 1994. Reference is hereby
made to said indenture and all supplements thereto for a specification of the
principal amount of Bonds from time to time issuable thereunder, and for a

Trustee or its successors, the nature and extent of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

the security, and the rights of the holders of said Bonds and any coupons
appurtenant thereto, and of the Trustee in respect of such security.

     In and by said indenture, as amended and supplemented, it is provided that
with the written approval of the Company and the Trustee, any of the provisions
of said indenture may from time to time be eliminated or modified and other
provisions may be added thereto provided the change does not alter the annual
interest rate, redemption price or date, date of maturity or amount payable on
maturity of any then outstanding Bond or conflict with the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939 as then in effect, and provided the holders of 85% in principal amount
of the Bonds secured by said indenture and then outstanding (including, if such
change affect the Bonds of one or more series but less than all series then
outstanding, a like percentage of the then outstanding Bonds of each series
affected by such change, and excluding Bonds owned or controlled by the Company
or by the parties owning at least 10% of the outstanding voting stock of the
Company, as more fully specified in said indenture) consent in writing thereto,
all as more fully set forth in said indenture, as amended and supplemented.

     First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds issuable under said indenture are
issuable in series, and the Bonds of any series may be for varying principal
amounts and in the form of coupon Bonds and of registered Bonds without
coupons, and the Bonds of any one series may differ from the Bonds of any other
series as to date, maturity, interest rate and otherwise, all as in said
indenture provided and set forth. The Bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q,
in which this Bond is included, are designated "First and Refunding Mortgage
Bonds, Pollution Control Series Q".

     In case of the happening of an event of default as specified in said
indenture and in the supplemental indenture dated March 1, 1942 supplemental
thereto, the principal sum of the Bonds of this issue may be declared or may
become due and payable forthwith, in the manner and with the effect in said
indenture provided.

     The Bonds of this series are subject to redemption as provided in said
supplemental indenture dated June 1, 1994.

     This Bond is transferable, but only as provided in the Indenture of Trust
dated as of May 1, 1993, as supplemented and amended, made by The
<PAGE>

Pollution Control Financing Authority of Salem County (New Jersey) to First
Fidelity Bank, National Association, New Jersey (now known as First Fidelity
Bank, National Association), as trustee, upon surrender hereof, by the
registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing, at the
principal office of the Trustee; upon any such transfer a new Bond similar
hereto will be issued to the transferee. No service charge shall be made for
any such transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto.  The Company and the Trustee and any paying agent may deem and treat
the person in whose name this Bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof
for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof
and the interest hereon and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor
the Trustee nor any paying agent shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

     The Bonds of this series are issuable only in fully registered form, in
any denomination authorized by the Company.

     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained
in said indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto, or in any Bond or
coupon issued thereunder, or because of any indebtedness arising thereunder,
shall be had against any incorporator, or against any past, present or future
stockholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor
corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor
corporation, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by
the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or
otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that said indenture, any
indenture supplemental thereto and the obligations issued thereunder, are
solely corporate obligations, and that no personal liability whatever shall
attach to, or be incurred by, such incorporators, stockholders, officers or
directors, as such, of the Company, or of any successor corporation, or any of
them, because of the incurring of the indebtedness thereby authorized, or under
or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in
the indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto or in any of the Bonds
or coupons issued thereunder, or implied therefrom.

     This Bond shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under said
indenture, as amended and supplemented, and shall not become valid or
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

obligatory for any purpose, until the certificate of authentication, hereon
endorsed, shall have been signed by First Fidelity Bank, National Association,
as Trustee, or by its successor in trust under said indenture.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Bond to be duly executed
by its proper officers under its corporate seal.

considerations aforesaid, it is hereby covenanted between the Company and the
Trustee as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                    BONDS OF THE POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES Q.

     The series of bonds authorized by this supplemental indenture to be issued
under and secured by the Indenture shall be designated "First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series Q"; shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount of $104,365,000; shall be issued initially to the Authority
Trustee, as assignee of the Authority, to evidence the Company's obligation to
repay the loan to finance a portion of the costs of the Project made pursuant
to the Agreement; and shall mature and bear interest as set forth in the form
of bond hereinbefore described; provided, however, that the Company shall
receive certain credits against principal and interest obligations as set forth
in Section 3.06 hereof. The date of each bond of the Pollution Control Series

in which case the date shall be the date of authentication, or unless such date
of authentication be prior to the first semi-annual interest payment date, in
which case the date shall be June 1, 1994.

as provided in the Authority Indenture) upon surrender thereof for cancellation
by the registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing at
said office of the Trustee.

     The Company hereby waives any right to make a charge for any transfer of
bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q, but the Company may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto.

                                  ARTICLE II.

   or destruction, or (c) it would not be practicable or desirable to
   rebuild, repair or restore the Hope Creek Generating Station or the
   Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the Project; or

          (2) title to, or the temporary use of, all or substantially all
   of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station
   or a substantial portion of the facilities of the Project shall have
   been taken or condemned by a competent authority which taking or
   condemnation results or is likely to result in the Company being
   thereby prevented or likely to be prevented from carrying on its
   normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem
   Generating Station or the facilities of the Project for a period of
   six months; or

          (3) changes in the cost or availability of raw materials,
   operating supplies, or facilities or technological or other changes
   have made the continued operation of all or substantially all of the
   Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or a
   substantial portion of the facilities of the Project uneconomical; or

          (4) any laws, rules, regulations or orders of any governmental or

   portion of the facilities of the Project or prevent the Company from
   carrying on its normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating

    Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the
    Project, in each case for a period of six months.

         (c) in, whole or in part (if, in the opinion of nationally
    recognized bond counsel, such partial redemption will preserve the
    exclusion from gross income for Federal income tax purposes of interest
    on the 1994 Series B Authority Bonds) at 100% of the principal amount
    thereof to be redeemed, within 180 days after a "final determination"
    (i.e., the issuance of a     published or private ruling or technical
    advice) of the Internal Revenue Service or a judicial decision in a
    proceeding by any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States
    (from which ruling, advice or decision no further right of appeal
    exists), in all cases in which the Company has participated or been a
    party or has been given an opportunity to participate and has failed to
    do so (no such decree or judgment by any court or action by the Internal
    Revenue Service to be considered final unless the owner of the 1994
    Series B Authority Bonds involved in such proceeding or action has given
    the Company and the Authority Trustee prompt written notice of the
    commencement thereof and offered the Company, at the Company's expense,
    the opportunity to control the defense thereof) that, as a result of a
    failure by the Company to observe any covenant, agreement, representation
    or warranty in the Agreement, the interest payable on the 1994 Series B
    Authority Bonds is includable in the gross income for Federal income tax
    purposes of the holder thereof, other than a "substantial user" of the
    Project or a "related person" as provided in Section 147(a) of the 
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

    SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Redemption.  (a) The election of the Company under
subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof to redeem any of the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series Q shall be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of
Directors of the Company calling for redemption on a stated date of all or, in
the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount thereof. To exercise its
option to redeem the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q under subsection
(a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee,
the Authority and the Authority Trustee a certified copy of said resolution
calling all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount of the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q for redemption on a date not less than
40 days nor more than 90 days from the date said resolution is delivered. The
delivery to the Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17

resolution shall constitute notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption
referred to therein, on the terms specified therein. The Company shall on or
before such redemption date deposit with the Trustee, as paying agent
hereunder, the total applicable redemption price of all the bonds so called,
with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any credits to which
the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof, and the Trustee,
as such paying agent, shall apply such funds on the redemption date to the
redemption of the bonds so called.

     (b) The Company shall, within 10 days after the occurrence of a "final
determination" under subsection (c) of Section 2.01 hereof, deliver to the
Trustee written notice of such "final determination". The Company shall, by
resolution of its Board of Directors, fix a redemption date for such redemption
and shall deliver to the Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a
certified copy of said resolution at least 40 days prior to the date so
selected for redemption. Such redemption date may be any day not more than 180
days after the occurrence of such "final determination". If the Trustee does
not receive written notice of such selection by the Company within 140 days
after the date of the occurrence of such "final determination", then the
redemption date shall be the 180th day after the occurrence of such "final
determination". On or before such redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, the total redemption price of the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds, on the
redemption date, to the redemption of the bonds so called. The delivery to the
Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution shall constitute
notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption referred to therein on the
terms specified therein.

<PAGE> 18

     SECTION 2.03.  Interest on Called Bonds to Cease.  Each bond or portion
thereof of the Pollution Control Series Q called for redemption under Section
2.02 hereof shall be due and payable at the office of the Trustee, as paying
agent hereunder, at the applicable redemption price and on the specified
redemption date, anything herein or in such bond to the contrary
notwithstanding. From and after the date when each bond or portion thereof of
the Pollution Control Series Q shall be due and payable as aforesaid (unless
upon said date the full amount due thereon shall not be held by or provided to
the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, and be immediately available for
payment), all further interest shall cease to accrue on such bond or on such
portion thereof, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.04.  Bonds Called in Part.  If only a portion of any bond of the
Pollution Control Series Q shall be called for redemption pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, the notice of redemption hereinbefore provided for shall specify
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Upon payment of the
portion so called for redemption, the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Company.

     SECTION 2.05.  Provisions of Indenture Not Applicable.  The provisions of
Article Four of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, shall not apply to
the procedure for the exercise of any right of redemption reserved by the
Company, or to any mandatory redemption provided in this Article in respect of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q. There shall be no sinking fund for
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS.

     SECTION 3.01.  Authentication of Bonds of Pollution Control Series Q. 
None of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q, the issue of which is
provided for by this supplemental indenture, shall be authenticated by the
Trustee except in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended
and supplemented, and this supplemental indenture, and upon compliance with the
conditions in that behalf therein contained.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 19

     SECTION 3.02.  Additional Restrictions on Authentication of Additional
Bonds Under Indenture.  The Company covenants that from and after the date of
execution of this supplemental indenture, no additional bonds (as defined in
Section 1 of Article Two of the Indenture) shall be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under Subdivision A of Section 4 of said Article Two on account
of additions or improvements to the mortgaged property

          (1) unless the net earnings of the Company for the period required
     by Subdivision C of Section 6 of said Article Two shall have been at least
     twice the fixed charges (in lieu of 1 3/4 times such fixed charges, as
     required by said Subdivision C); and for the purpose of this condition (a)
     such fixed charges shall in each case include interest on the bonds
     applied for, notwithstanding the parenthetical provision contained in
     clause (4) of said Subdivision C, and (b) in computing such net earnings
     there shall be included in expenses of operation (under paragraph (c) of
     said Subdivision C) all charges against earnings for depreciation,
     renewals or replacements, and all certificates with respect to net
     earnings delivered to the Trustee in connection with any authentication
     of additional bonds under said Article Two shall so state; and

          (2) except to the extent of 60% (in lieu of 75% as permitted by
     Subdivision A of Section 7 of said Article Two) of the cost or fair  value
     to the Company of the additions or improvements forming the basis for such
     authentication of additional bonds.

     SECTION 3.03.  Restriction on Dividends.  The Company will not declare or
pay any dividend on any shares of its common stock (other than dividends
payable in shares of its common stock) or make any other distribution on any
such shares, or purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares (except shares
acquired without cost to the Company) whenever such action would reduce the
earned surplus of the Company to an amount less than $10,000,000 or such lesser
amount as may remain after deducting from said $10,000,000 all amounts
appearing in the books of account of the Company on December 31, 1948, which
shall thereafter, pursuant to any order or rule of any regulatory body entered
after said date, be required to be removed, in whole or in part, from the books
of account of the Company by charges to earned surplus.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 20

     SECTION 3.04.  Use of Facsimile Seal and Signatures.  The seal of the
Company and any or all signatures of the officers of the Company upon any of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q may be facsimiles.

     SECTION 3.05. Effective Period of Supplemental Indenture.  The preceding
provisions of Articles I, II and III of this supplemental indenture shall
remain in effect only so long as any of the bonds of the Pollution Control
Series Q shall remain outstanding.

     SECTION 3.06.  Credits with Respect to Payments.  (a) The Company shall
be entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay interest on the bonds of
the Pollution Control Series Q equal to interest paid on the 1994 Series B
Authority Bonds out of the accrued interest received upon the original issuance
of the 1994 Series B Authority Bonds and the earnings on the investment
thereof, as provided in the Authority Indenture, which are held by the
Authority Trustee at the time of the interest payment date.

     (b) The Company shall be entitled to credits against amounts otherwise
payable in respect of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q in an amount
corresponding to (i) the principal amount of any 1994 Series B Authority Bond
surrendered to the Authority Trustee by the Company or the Authority, or
purchased by the Authority Trustee, for cancellation and (ii) the amount of
money held by the Authority Trustee and available and designated for the
payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the 1994 Series B
Authority Bonds, as the case may be, regardless of the source of payment to the
Authority Trustee of such moneys, and the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder,
shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any such credit with respect
to the payment of interest.

     (c) The Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of each deposit in the Debt Service Fund under the Authority Indenture,
(ii) provide evidence to the Company that such deposit has been credited to
such Fund and (iii) give prompt written notice to the Company of any credits
with respect to payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q.

       (d) A certificate of the Company signed by the President or any Vice
President, and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and consented to 

<PAGE> 21

by the Authority Trustee, stating that the Company is entitled to a credit
under this Section 3.06 and setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, shall be conclusive evidence of such entitlement, and the Trustee shall
accept such certificate without further investigation or verification of the
matters stated therein.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21
     SECTION 3.07.  Time for Making of Payment.  All payments of principal or
redemption price of and interest on the bonds of the Pollution Control Series
Q shall be made to the Authority Trustee in such funds as shall constitute
immediately available funds when payment is due. In any case where the date of
payment of the principal or redemption price of or interest on the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series Q or the date fixed for redemption of any such bonds
shall be in the city of payment a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday or a day
on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close, then such payment
need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding business
day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the
date fixed for redemption, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the
period after such date.

     SECTION 3.08.  Effect of Approval of Board of Regulatory Commissioners of
the State of New Jersey.  The approval of the Board of Regulatory Commissioners
of the State of New Jersey of the execution and delivery of these presents and
of the issue of any bonds of the Pollution Control Series Q shall not be
construed as approval of said Board of any other act, matter or thing which
requires approval of said Board under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

     SECTION 3.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  For the purpose of facilitating
the recording hereof, this supplemental indenture has been executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be and shall be taken to be an original, and
all collectively but one instrument.

                    BONDS OF THE POLLUTION CONTROL Series P.

     The series of bonds authorized by this supplemental indenture to be issued
under and secured by the Indenture shall be designated "First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series P"; shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount of $100,000,000; shall be issued initially to the Authority
Trustee, as assignee of the Authority, to evidence the Company's obligation to

in which case the date shall be the date of authentication, or unless such date
of authentication be prior to the first semi-annual interest payment date, in
which case the date shall be May 1, 1994.

     Bonds of the Pollution Control Series P shall be issued as fully
registered bonds in any denomination authorized by the Company. Interest on

1 and November 1 of each year, payable initially on November 1, 1994, and shall

 <PAGE>
<PAGE> 14
   or a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of

   continuing, and describing the same:

          (1) (i) the Station or a substantial portion of the facilities of  
  the Project shall have been damaged or destroyed to such extent that (a) 
   the Station or such facilities cannot be reasonably restored within a
   period of six months from the date of such damage or destruction to
   the condition thereof immediately preceding such damage or
   destruction, or (b) the Company is thereby prevented or likely to be
   prevented from carrying on its normal operation of the Station or such  
   facilities for a period of six months from the date of such damage or
   destruction, or (c) it would not be practicable or desirable to

   operation of Station or such facilities for a period of six months; or

          (3) changes in the cost or availability of raw materials,

         (c) in, whole or in part (if, in the opinion of nationally
    recognized bond counsel, such partial redemption will preserve the
    exclusion from gross income for Federal income tax purposes of interest
    on the 1994 Series B Authority Bonds) at 100% of the principal amount
    thereof to be redeemed, within 180 days after a "final determination"
    (i.e., the issuance of a published or private ruling or technical
    advice) of the Internal Revenue Service or a judicial decision in a
    proceeding by any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States
    (from which ruling, advice or decision no further right of appeal
    exists), in all cases in which the Company has participated or been a
    party or has been given an opportunity to participate and has failed to
    do so (no such decree or judgment by any court or action by the Internal
    Revenue Service to be considered final unless the owner of the 1994
    Series B Authority Bonds involved in such proceeding or action has given
    the Company and the Authority Trustee prompt written notice of the
    commencement thereof and offered the Company, at the Company's expense,
    the opportunity to control the defense thereof) that, as a result of a
    failure by the Company to observe any covenant, agreement, representation
    or warranty in the Agreement, the interest payable on the 1994 Series B
    Authority Bonds is includable in the gross income for Federal income tax
    purposes of the holder thereof, other than a "substantial user" of the
    Project or a "related person" as provided in Section 147(a) of the 
    Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Redemption.  (a) The election of the Company under
subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof to redeem any of the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series P shall be evidenced by a resolution of the Board of
Directors of the Company calling for redemption on a stated date of all or, in
the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount thereof. To exercise its
option to redeem the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P under subsection
(a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee,
the Authority and the Authority Trustee a certified copy of said resolution
calling all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount of the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series P for redemption on a date not less than
40 days nor more than 90 days from the date said resolution is delivered. The
delivery to the Authority Trustee of
 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16 

a certified copy of such  resolution shall constitute notice to the Authority
Trustee of the redemption referred to therein, on the terms specified therein.
The Company shall on or before such redemption date deposit with the Trustee,
as paying agent hereunder, the total applicable redemption price of all the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds on the redemption
date to the redemption of the bonds so called.

     (b) The Company shall, within 10 days after the occurrence of a "final
determination" under subsection (c) of Section 2.01 hereof, deliver to the
Trustee written notice of such "final determination". The Company shall, by
resolution of its Board of Directors, fix a redemption date for such redemption
and shall deliver to the Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a
certified copy of said resolution at least 40 days prior to the date so
selected for redemption. Such redemption date may be any day not more than 180
days after the occurrence of such "final determination". If the Trustee does
not receive written notice of such selection by the Company within 140 days
after the date of the occurrence of such "final determination", then the
redemption date shall be the 180th day after the occurrence of such "final
determination". On or before such redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, the total redemption price of the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds, on the
redemption date, to the redemption of the bonds so called. The delivery to the
Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution shall constitute
notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption referred to therein on the
terms specified therein.

<PAGE> 17

     SECTION 2.03.  Interest on Called Bonds to Cease.  Each bond or portion
thereof of the Pollution Control Series P called for redemption under Section
2.02 hereof shall be due and payable at the office of the Trustee, as paying
agent hereunder, at the applicable redemption price and on the specified
redemption date, anything herein or in such bond to the contrary
notwithstanding. From and after the date when each bond or portion thereof of
the Pollution Control Series P shall be due and payable as aforesaid (unless
upon said date the full amount due thereon shall not be held by or provided to
the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, and be immediately available for
payment), all further interest shall cease to accrue on such bond or on such
portion thereof, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.04.  Bonds Called in Part.  If only a portion of any bond of the
Pollution Control Series P shall be called for redemption pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, the notice of redemption hereinbefore provided for shall specify
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Upon payment of the
portion so called for redemption, the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Company.

     SECTION 2.05.  Provisions of Indenture Not Applicable.  The provisions of
Article Four of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, shall not apply to
the procedure for the exercise of any right of redemption reserved by the
Company, or to any mandatory redemption provided in this Article in respect of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P. There shall be no sinking fund for
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS.

     SECTION 3.01.  Authentication of Bonds of Pollution Control Series P. 
None of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P, the issue of which is
provided for by this supplemental indenture, shall be authenticated by the
Trustee except in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended
and supplemented, and this supplemental indenture, and upon compliance with the
conditions in that behalf therein contained.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 18

     SECTION 3.02.  Additional Restrictions on Authentication of Additional
Bonds Under Indenture.  The Company covenants that from and after the date of
execution of this supplemental indenture, no additional bonds (as defined in
Section 1 of Article Two of the Indenture) shall be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under Subdivision A of Section 4 of said Article Two on account
of additions or improvements to the mortgaged property

          (1) unless the net earnings of the Company for the period required
     by Subdivision C of Section 6 of said Article Two shall have been at least
     twice the fixed charges (in lieu of 1 3/4 times such fixed charges, as
     required by said Subdivision C); and for the purpose of this condition (a)
     such fixed charges shall in each case include interest on the bonds
     applied for, notwithstanding the parenthetical provision contained in
     clause (4) of said Subdivision C, and (b) in computing such net earnings
     there shall be included in expenses of operation (under paragraph (c) of
     said Subdivision

         C) all charges against earnings for depreciation, renewals or
     replacements, and all certificates with respect to net earnings delivered
     to the Trustee in connection with any authentication of additional bonds
     under said Article Two shall so state; and 

          (2) except to the extent of 60% (in lieu of 75% as permitted by
     Subdivision A of Section 7 of said Article Two) of the cost or fair  value
     to the Company of the additions or improvements forming the basis for such
     authentication of additional bonds.

     SECTION 3.03.  Restriction on Dividends.  The Company will not declare or
pay any dividend on any shares of its common stock (other than dividends
payable in shares of its common stock) or make any other distribution on any
such shares, or purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares (except shares
acquired without cost to the Company) whenever such action would reduce the
earned surplus of the Company to an amount less than $10,000,000 or such lesser
amount as may remain after deducting from said $10,000,000 all amounts
appearing in the books of account of the Company on December 31, 1948, which
shall thereafter, pursuant to any order or rule of any regulatory body entered
after said date, be required to be removed, in whole or in part, from the books
of account of the Company by charges to earned surplus.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 19

     SECTION 3.04.  Use of Facsimile Seal and Signatures.  The seal of the
Company and any or all signatures of the officers of the Company upon any of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P may be facsimiles.

provisions of Articles I, II and III of this supplemental indenture shall
remain in effect only so long as any of the bonds of the Pollution Control
Series P shall remain outstanding.

     SECTION 3.06.  Credits with Respect to Payments.  (a) The Company shall
be entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay interest on the bonds of
the Pollution Control Series P equal to interest paid on the 1994 Series A
Authority Bonds out of the accrued interest received upon the original issuance
of the 1994 Series A Authority Bonds and the earnings on the investment
thereof, as provided in the Authority Indenture, which are held by the
Authority Trustee at the time of the interest payment date.

     (b) The Company shall be entitled to credits against amounts otherwise
payable in respect of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series P in an amount
corresponding to (i) the principal amount of any 1994 Series A Authority Bond
surrendered to the Authority Trustee by the Company or the Authority, or
purchased by the Authority Trustee, for cancellation and (ii) the amount of
money held by the Authority Trustee and available and designated for the
payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the 1994 Series A
Authority Bonds, as the case may be, regardless of the source of payment to the
Authority Trustee of such moneys, and the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder,
shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any such credit with respect
to the payment of interest.

     (c) The Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of each deposit in the Debt Service Fund under the Authority Indenture,
(ii) provide evidence to the Company that such deposit has been credited to
such Fund and (iii) give prompt written notice to the Company of any credits
with respect to payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series P.

President, and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and consented to 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 20

by the Authority Trustee, stating that the Company is entitled to a credit
under this Section 3.06 and setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, shall be conclusive evidence of such entitlement, and the Trustee shall
accept such certificate without further investigation or verification of the
matters stated therein.

     SECTION 3.07.  Time for Making of Payment.  All payments of principal or
redemption price of and interest on the bonds of the Pollution Control Series
P shall be made to the Authority Trustee in such funds as shall constitute
immediately available funds when payment is due. In any case where the date of
payment of the principal or redemption price of or interest on the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series P or the date fixed for redemption of any such bonds
shall be in the city of payment a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday or a day
on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close, then such payment
need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding business
day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the
date fixed for redemption, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the
period after such date.

     SECTION 3.08.  Effect of Approval of Board of Regulatory Commissioners of
the State of New Jersey.  The approval of the Board of Regulatory Commissioners
of the State of New Jersey of the execution and delivery of these presents and
of the issue of any bonds of the Pollution Control Series P shall not be
construed as approval of said Board of any other act, matter or thing which
requires approval of said Board under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

     SECTION 3.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  For the purpose of facilitating
the recording hereof, this supplemental indenture has been executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be and shall be taken to be an original, and
all collectively but one instrument.

of said indenture may from time to time be eliminated or modified and other
provisions may be added thereto provided the change does not alter the annual

indenture provided and set forth. The Bonds of the Pollution Control Series R,

Bank, National Association, New Jersey (now known as First Fidelity Bank,
National Association), as trustee, upon surrender hereof, by the registered
owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing, at the principal
office of the Trustee; upon any such transfer a new Bond similar hereto will

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Bond to be duly executed
by its proper officers under its corporate seal.

<PAGE>
                                   ARTICLE I.

                    BONDS OF THE POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES R.

     The series of bonds authorized by this supplemental indenture to be issued
under and secured by the Indenture shall be designated "First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series R"; shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount of $87,880,000; shall be issued initially to the Authority
Trustee, as assignee of the Authority, to evidence the Company's obligation to
repay the loan to finance a portion of the costs of the Project made pursuant
to the Agreement; and shall mature and bear interest as set forth in the form
of bond hereinbefore described; provided, however, that the Company shall
receive certain credits against principal and interest obligations as set forth
in Section 3.06 hereof. The date of each bond of the Pollution Control Series
R shall be the semi-annual interest payment date next preceding the date of
authentication, unless such date of authentication be an interest payment date,
in which case the date shall be the date of authentication, or unless such date
of authentication be prior to the first semi-annual interest payment date, in
which case the date shall be August 1, 1994.

     Bonds of the Pollution Control Series R shall be issued as fully
registered bonds in any denomination authorized by the Company. Interest on
bonds of the Pollution Control Series R shall be payable semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1 of each year, payable initially on February 1, 1995,
and shall be payable as to both principal and interest in such coin or currency
of the United States of America as at the time of payment shall constitute
legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, at the principal
office of the Trustee, or at the corporate trust office of any paying agent
appointed by the Company.

     Bonds of the Pollution Control Series R shall be transferable (but only
as provided in the Authority Indenture) upon surrender thereof for cancellation
by the registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing at
said office of the Trustee.

     The Company hereby waives any right to make a charge for any transfer of
bonds of the Pollution Control Series R, but the Company may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto.

     expressed in percentages of the principal amount of the bonds to be

          (b)  at the option of the Company, as a whole at any time at 100% of
     the principal amount thereof, if any of the following events shall have
     occurred and if, within one year of the occurrence of any of the following
     events, the Company shall have given evidence to the Trustee and the
     Authority Trustee, in each case by a certificate signed by the President
     or a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of
     the Company to the effect that one of such events has occurred and is
     continuing, and describing the same:

               (1) the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating
          Station or a substantial portion of the facilities of the Project
          shall have been damaged or destroyed to such extent that (a) the Hope
          Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or the 
          facilities of the Project cannot be reasonably restored within a 
          period of six months from the date of such damage or destruction to 
          the condition thereof immediately preceding such damage or
          destruction, or (b) the Company is thereby prevented or likely to be
          prevented from carrying on its normal operation of the Hope Creek 
          Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities 
          of the Project for a period of six months from the date of such
          damage or destruction, or (c) it would not be practicable or
          desirable to rebuild, repair or restore the Hope Creek Generating
          Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the
          Project; or
<PAGE>
               (2) title to, or the temporary use of, all or substantially all 
          of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station 
          or a substantial portion of the facilities of the Project shall have 
          been taken or condemned by a competent authority which taking or
          condemnation results or is likely to result in the Company being
          hereby prevented or likely to be prevented from carrying on its
          normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem
          Generating Station or the facilities of the Project for a period of
          six months; or

               (3) changes in the cost or availability of raw materials,
          operating supplies, or facilities or technological or other changes 
          have made the continued operation of all or substantially all of the
          Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or a
          substantial portion of the facilities of the Project uneconomical;
          or

               (4) any laws, rules, regulations or orders of any governmental
          or regulatory entity shall require a shutdown of the Hope Creek
          Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or a substantial 
          portion of the facilities of the Project or prevent the Company from
          carrying on its normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating 
          Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the
          Project, in each case for a period of six months.

               (c) in, whole or in part (if, in the opinion of nationally
          recognized bond counsel, such partial redemption will preserve the
          exclusion from gross income for Federal income tax purposes of
          interest on the remaining 1994 Series C Authority Bonds) at any time
          at 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, within 180
          days after a "final determination" (i.e., the issuance of a published
          or private ruling or technical advice) of the Internal Revenue
          Service or a judicial decision in a proceeding by any court of
          competent jurisdiction in the United States (from which ruling,
          advice or decision no further right of appeal exists), in all cases 
          in which the Company has participated or been a party or has been
          given an opportunity to participate and has failed to do so (no such
          decree or judgment by any court or action by the Internal Revenue
          Service to be considered final unless the owner of the 1994 Series
          C Authority Bonds involved in such proceeding or action has given the
          Company and the Authority Trustee prompt written notice of the
          commencement thereof and offered the Company, at the Company's
          expense, the opportunity to control the defense thereof) that, as a
          result of a failure by the Company to observe any covenant,
          agreement, representation or warranty in the Agreement, the interest
          payable on the 1994 Series C Authority Bonds is includable in the
          gross income for Federal income tax purposes of the holder thereof,
          other than a "substantial user" of the Project or a "related person"
          as provided in Section 147(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
          as amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder.

<PAGE>
     SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Redemption.  (a) The election of the Company
under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof to redeem any of the bonds
of the Pollution Control Series R shall be evidenced by a resolution of the
Board of Directors of the Company calling for redemption on a stated date of
all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount thereof. To
exercise its option to redeem the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R under
subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a certified copy of said
resolution calling all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal
amount of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R for redemption on a date
not less than 40 days nor more than 90 days from the date said resolution is
delivered. The delivery to the Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such
resolution shall constitute notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption
referred to therein, on the terms specified therein. The Company shall on or
before such redemption date deposit with the Trustee, as paying agent
hereunder, the total applicable redemption price of all the bonds so called,
with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any credits to which
the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof, and the Trustee,
as such paying agent, shall apply such funds on the redemption date to the
redemption of the bonds so called.

     (b) The Company shall, within 10 days after the occurrence of a "final
determination" under subsection (c) of Section 2.01 hereof, deliver to the
Trustee written notice of such "final determination". The Company shall, by
resolution of its Board of Directors, fix a redemption date for such redemption
and shall deliver to the Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a
certified copy of said resolution at least 40 days prior to the date so
selected for redemption. Such redemption date may be any day not more than 180
days after the occurrence of such "final determination". If the Trustee does
not receive written notice of such selection by the Company within 140 days
after the date of the occurrence of such "final determination", then the
redemption date shall be the 180th day after the occurrence of such "final
determination".  On or before such redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, the total redemption price of the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds, on the
redemption date, to the redemption of the bonds so called. The delivery to the
Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution shall constitute
notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption referred to therein on the
terms specified therein.

<PAGE>
     SECTION 2.03.  Interest on Called Bonds to Cease.  Each bond or portion
thereof of the Pollution Control Series R called for redemption under Section
2.02 hereof shall be due and payable at the office of the Trustee, as paying
agent hereunder, at the applicable redemption price and on the specified
redemption date, anything herein or in such bond to the contrary
notwithstanding. From and after the date when each bond or portion thereof of
the Pollution Control Series R shall be due and payable as aforesaid (unless
upon said date the full amount due thereon shall not be held by or provided to
the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, and be immediately available for
payment), all further interest shall cease to accrue on such bond or on such
portion thereof, as the case may be. 

     SECTION 2.04.  Bonds Called in Part.  If only a portion of any bond of the
Pollution Control Series R shall be called for redemption pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, the notice of redemption hereinbefore provided for shall specify
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Upon payment of the
portion so called for redemption, the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Company.

     SECTION 2.05.  Provisions of Indenture Not Applicable.  The provisions of
Article Four of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, shall not apply to
the procedure for the exercise of any right of redemption reserved by the
Company, or to any mandatory redemption provided in this Article in respect of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R. There shall be no sinking fund for
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS.

     SECTION 3.01.  Authentication of Bonds of Pollution Control Series R. 
None of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R, the issue of which is
provided for by this supplemental indenture, shall be authenticated by the
Trustee except in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended
and supplemented, and this supplemental indenture, and upon compliance with the
conditions in that behalf therein contained.

     SECTION 3.02.  Additional Restrictions on Authentication of Additional
Bonds Under Indenture.  The Company covenants that from and after the date of
execution of this supplemental indenture, no additional bonds (as defined in
Section 1 of Article Two of the Indenture) shall be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under Subdivision A of Section 4 of said Article Two on account
of additions or improvements to the mortgaged property 

<PAGE>
          (1) unless the net earnings of the Company for the period required
     by Subdivision C of Section 6 of said Article Two shall have been at least
     twice the fixed charges (in lieu of 1 3/4 times such fixed charges, as
     required by said Subdivision C); and for the purpose of this condition (a)
     such fixed charges shall in each case include interest on the bonds
     applied for, notwithstanding the parenthetical provision contained in
     clause (4) of said Subdivision C, and (b) in computing such net earnings
     there shall be included in expenses of operation (under paragraph (c) of
     said Subdivision C) all charges against earnings for depreciation,
     renewals or replacements, and all certificates with respect to net
     earnings delivered to the Trustee in connection with any authentication
     of additional bonds under said Article Two shall so state; and

          (2) except to the extent of 60% (in lieu of 75% as permitted by 
     Subdivision A of Section 7 of said Article Two) of the cost or fair value
     to the Company of the additions or improvements forming the basis for such
     authentication of additional bonds.

     SECTION 3.03.  Restriction on Dividends.  The Company will not declare or
pay any dividend on any shares of its common stock (other than dividends
payable in shares of its common stock) or make any other distribution on any
such shares, or purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares (except shares
acquired without cost to the Company) whenever such action would reduce the
earned surplus of the Company to an amount less than $10,000,000 or such lesser
amount as may remain after deducting from said $10,000,000 all amounts
appearing in the books of account of the Company on December 31, 1948, which
shall thereafter, pursuant to any order or rule of any regulatory body entered
after said date, be required to be removed, in whole or in part, from the books
of account of the Company by charges to earned surplus.

     SECTION 3.04.  Use of Facsimile Seal and Signatures.  The seal of the
Company and any or all signatures of the officers of the Company upon any of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R may be facsimiles.

     SECTION 3.05.  Effective Period of Supplemental Indenture.  The preceding
provisions of Articles I, II and III of this supplemental indenture shall
remain in effect only so long as any of the bonds of the Pollution Control
Series R shall remain outstanding.

     SECTION 3.06.  Credits with Respect to Payments.  (a) The Company shall
be entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay interest on the bonds of
the Pollution Control Series R equal to interest paid on the 1994 Series C
Authority Bonds out of the accrued interest received upon the original issuance
of the 1994 Series C Authority Bonds and the earnings on the investment
thereof, as provided in the Authority Indenture, which are held by the
Authority Trustee at the time of the interest payment date.
<PAGE>
     (b) The Company shall be entitled to credits against amounts otherwise
payable in respect of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series R in an amount
corresponding to (i) the principal amount of any 1994 Series C Authority Bond
surrendered to the Authority Trustee by the Company or the Authority, or
purchased by the Authority Trustee, for cancellation and (ii) the amount of
money held by the Authority Trustee and available and designated for the
payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the 1994 Series C
Authority Bonds, as the case may be, regardless of the source of payment to the
Authority Trustee of such moneys, and the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder,
shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any such credit with respect
to the payment of interest.

     (c) The Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of each deposit in the Debt Service Fund under the Authority Indenture,
(ii) provide evidence to the Company that such deposit has been credited to
such Fund and (iii) give prompt written notice to the Company of any credits
with respect to payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series R.

     (d) A certificate of the Company signed by the President or any Vice
President, and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and consented to 
by the Authority Trustee, stating that the Company is entitled to a credit
under this Section 3.06 and setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, shall be conclusive evidence of such entitlement, and the Trustee shall
accept such certificate without further investigation or verification of the
matters stated therein.

     SECTION 3.07.  Time for Making of Payment.  All payments of principal or
redemption price of and interest on the bonds of the Pollution Control Series
R shall be made to the Authority Trustee in such funds as shall constitute
immediately available funds when payment is due. In any case where the date of
payment of the principal or redemption price of or interest on the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series R or the date fixed for redemption of any such bonds
shall be in the city of payment a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday or a day
on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close, then such payment
need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding business
day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the
date fixed for redemption, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the
period after such date.

     SECTION 3.08.  Effect of Approval of Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey.  The approval of the Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey of the execution and delivery of these presents and of the
issue of any bonds of the Pollution Control Series R shall not be construed as
approval of said Board of any other act, matter or thing which requires
approval of said Board under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

     SECTION 3.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  For the purpose of facilitating
the recording hereof, this supplemental indenture has been executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be and shall be taken to be an original, and
all collectively but one instrument.

indenture provided.

Trustee as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.

                    BONDS OF THE POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES S.

     The series of bonds authorized by this supplemental indenture to be issued
under and secured by the Indenture shall be designated "First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series S"; shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount of $92,955,000; shall be issued initially to the Authority
Trustee, as assignee of the Authority, to evidence the Company's obligation to
repay the loan to finance a portion of the costs of the Project made pursuant
to the Agreement; and shall mature and bear interest as set forth in the form
of bond hereinbefore described; provided, however, that the Company shall
receive certain credits against principal and interest obligations as set forth
in Section 3.06 hereof. The date of each bond of the Pollution Control Series
S shall be the semi-annual interest payment date next preceding the date of
authentication, unless such date of authentication be an interest payment date,
in which case the date shall be the date of authentication, or unless such date
of authentication be prior to the first semi-annual interest payment date, in
which case the date shall be October 1, 1994.

     Bonds of the Pollution Control Series S shall be issued as fully
registered bonds in any denomination authorized by the Company. Interest on
bonds of the Pollution Control Series S shall be payable semi-annually on April
1 and October 1 of each year, payable initially on April 1, 1995, and shall be
payable as to both principal and interest in such coin or currency of the
United States of America as at the time of payment shall constitute legal
tender for

                                       12
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 14
the payment of public and private debts, at the principal office of the
Trustee, or at the corporate trust office of any paying agent appointed by the
Company.

       Bonds of the Pollution Control Series S shall be transferable (but only
as provided in the Authority Indenture) upon surrender thereof for cancellation
by the registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing at
said office of the Trustee.

     The Company hereby waives any right to make a charge for any transfer of
bonds of the Pollution Control Series S, but the Company may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto.

                                  ARTICLE II.

                REDEMPTION OF BONDS--POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES S.

     SECTION 2.01.  Redemption--Redemption Prices.  Bonds of the Pollution
Control Series S shall be subject to redemption prior to maturity, but if in
part only in integral multiples of $5,000, under the conditions and upon the
payment of the amounts specified in the following subsections, together in each
case with interest accrued to the redemption date:

          (a) at the option of the Company, on any date on or after October 1,
     2004, either as a whole or in part, at the following redemption prices,
     expressed in percentages of the principal amount of the bonds to be
     redeemed:



     Redemption Period                                   Redemption Price
- -------------------------------------------------------- -----------------
October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005..............       102%
October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006..............       101%
October 1, 2006 and thereafter..........................       100%

         (b) at the option of the Company, as a whole at any time at 100% of
    the principal amount thereof, if any of the following events shall have
    occurred and if, within one year of the occurrence of any of the following
    events, the Company shall have given evidence to the Trustee and the
    Authority Trustee, in each case by a certificate signed by the President 
 

                                       13
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15
    a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the
    Company to the effect that one of such events has occurred and is
    continuing, and describing the same:

            (1) the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating
        Station or a substantial portion of the facilities of the Project
        shall have been damaged or destroyed to such extent that (a) the Hope
        Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or the
        facilities of the Project cannot be reasonably restored within a
        period of six months from the date of such damage or destruction to
        the condition thereof immediately preceding such damage or
        destruction, or (b) the Company is thereby prevented or likely to be
        prevented from carrying on its normal operation of the Hope Creek
        Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities
        of the Project for a period of six months from the date of such  
        damage or destruction, or (c) it would not be practicable or
        desirable to rebuild, repair or restore the Hope Creek Generating
        Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the
        Project; or

            (2) title to, or the temporary use of, all or substantially all
        of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station
        or a substantial portion of the facilities of the Project shall have
        been taken or condemned by a competent authority which taking or
        condemnation results or is likely to result in the Company being
        thereby prevented or likely to be prevented from carrying on its
        normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem
        Generating Station or the facilities of the Project for a period of
        six months; or

            (3) changes in the cost or availability of raw materials,
        operating supplies, or facilities or technological or other changes
        have made the continued operation of all or substantially all of the
        Hope Creek Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or a
        substantial portion of the facilities of the Project uneconomical;
        or

            (4) any laws, rules, regulations or orders of any governmental or 
        regulatory entity shall require a shutdown of the Hope Creek
        Generating Station or the Salem Generating Station or a substantial
        portion of the facilities of the Project or prevent the Company from
        carrying on its normal operation of the Hope Creek Generating
                                       14
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16
        Station or the Salem Generating Station or the facilities of the
        Project, in each case for a period of six months.

        (c) in, whole or in part (if, in the opinion of nationally recognized
  bond counsel, such partial redemption will preserve the exclusion from
  gross income for Federal income tax purposes of interest on the remaining
  1994 Series D Authority Bonds) at any time at 100% of the principal amount
  thereof to be redeemed, within 180 days after a "final determination"
  (i.e., the issuance of a published or private ruling or technical advice)
  of the Internal Revenue Service or a judicial decision in a proceeding by
  any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States (from which
  ruling, advice or decision no further right of appeal exists), in all cases
  in which the Company has participated or been a party or has been given an
  opportunity to participate and has failed to do so (no such decree or
  judgment by any court or action by the Internal Revenue Service to be
  considered final unless the owner of the 1994 Series D Authority Bonds
  involved in such proceeding or action has given the Company and the
  Authority Trustee prompt written notice of the commencement thereof and
  offered the Company, at the Company's expense, the opportunity to control
  the defense thereof) that, as a result of a failure by the Company to
  observe any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in the
  Agreement, the interest payable on the 1994 Series D Authority Bonds is
  includable in the gross income for Federal income tax purposes of the
  holder thereof, other than a "substantial user" of the Project or a
  "related person" as provided in Section 147(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
  of 1986, as amended, and the applicable regulations thereunder.

     SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Redemption.  (a) The election of the Company
under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof to redeem any of the bonds
of the Pollution Control Series S shall be evidenced by a resolution of the
Board of Directors of the Company calling for redemption on a stated date of
all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount thereof. To
exercise its option to redeem the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S under
subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a certified copy of said
resolution calling all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal
amount of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S for redemption on a date
not less than 40 days nor more than 90 days from the date said resolution

                                       15
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17
is delivered. The delivery to the Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such
resolution shall constitute notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption
referred to therein, on the terms specified therein. The Company shall on or
before such redemption date deposit with the Trustee, as paying agent
hereunder, the total applicable redemption price of all the bonds so called,
with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any credits to which
the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof, and the Trustee,
as such paying agent, shall apply such funds on the redemption date to the
redemption of the bonds so called.

     (b) The Company shall, within 10 days after the occurrence of a "final
determination" under subsection (c) of Section 2.01 hereof, deliver to the
Trustee written notice of such "final determination". The Company shall, by
resolution of its Board of Directors, fix a redemption date for such redemption
and shall deliver to the Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a
certified copy of said resolution at least 40 days prior to the date so
selected for redemption. Such redemption date may be any day not more than 180
days after the occurrence of such "final determination". If the Trustee does
not receive written notice of such selection by the Company within 140 days
after the date of the occurrence of such "final determination", then the
redemption date shall be the 180th day after the occurrence of such "final
determination". On or before such redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, the total redemption price of the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds, on the
redemption date, to the redemption of the bonds so called. The delivery to the
Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution shall constitute
notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption referred to therein on the
terms specified therein.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 18
     SECTION 2.03.  Interest on Called Bonds to Cease.  Each bond or portion
thereof of the Pollution Control Series S called for redemption under Section
2.02 hereof shall be due and payable at the office of the Trustee, as paying
agent hereunder, at the applicable redemption price and on the specified
redemption date, anything herein or in such bond to the contrary
notwithstanding. From and after the date when each bond or portion thereof of
the Pollution Control Series S shall be due and payable as aforesaid (unless
upon said date the full amount due thereon shall not be held by or provided to
the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, and be immediately available for
payment), all further interest shall cease to accrue on such bond or on such
portion thereof, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.04.  Bonds Called in Part.  If only a portion of any bond of the
Pollution Control Series S shall be called for redemption pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, the notice of redemption hereinbefore provided for shall specify
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Upon payment of the
portion so called for redemption, the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Company.

     SECTION 2.05.  Provisions of Indenture Not Applicable.  The provisions of
Article Four of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, shall not apply to
the procedure for the exercise of any right of redemption reserved by the
Company, or to any mandatory redemption provided in this Article in respect of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S. There shall be no sinking fund for
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S.

                                  ARTICLE III. 

                                 MISCELLANEOUS. 

     SECTION 3.01.  Authentication of Bonds of Pollution Control Series S. 
None of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S, the issue of which is
provided for by this supplemental indenture, shall be authenticated by the
Trustee except in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended
and supplemented, and this supplemental indenture, and upon compliance with the
conditions in that behalf therein contained.

    SECTION 3.02.  Additional Restrictions on Authentication of Additional
Bonds Under Indenture.  The Company covenants that from and after the date of
execution of this supplemental indenture, no additional bonds (as defined in
Section 1 of Article Two of the Indenture) shall be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under Subdivision A of Section 4 of said Article Two on account
of additions or improvements to the mortgaged property 

     (1) unless the net earnings of the Company for the period required by
   Subdivision C of Section 6 of said Article Two shall have been at least
   twice the fixed charges (in lieu of 1 3/4 times such fixed charges, as
   required by said Subdivision C); and for the purpose of this condition (a)
   such fixed charges shall in each case include interest on the bonds     
   applied for, notwithstanding the parenthetical provision contained in
   clause (4) of said Subdivision C, and (b) in computing such net earnings
   there shall be included in expenses of operation (under paragraph (c) of
   said Subdivision

   C) all charges against earnings for depreciation, renewals or replacements,
   and all certificates with respect to net earnings delivered to the Trustee
   in connection with any authentication of additional bonds under said
   Article Two shall so state; and

        (2) except to the extent of 60% (in lieu of 75% as permitted by
   Subdivision A of Section 7 of said Article Two) of the cost or fair value
   to the Company of the additions or improvements forming the basis for such
   authentication of additional bonds.

     SECTION 3.03.  Restriction on Dividends.  The Company will not declare or
pay any dividend on any shares of its common stock (other than dividends
payable in shares of its common stock) or make any other distribution on any
such shares, or purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares (except shares
acquired without cost to the Company) whenever such action would reduce the
earned surplus of the Company to an amount less than $10,000,000 or such lesser
amount as may remain after deducting from said $10,000,000 all amounts
appearing in the books of account of the Company on December 31, 1948, which
shall thereafter, pursuant to any order or rule of any regulatory body entered
after said date, be required to be removed, in whole or in part, from the books
of account of the Company by charges to earned surplus.

     SECTION 3.04.  Use of Facsimile Seal and Signatures.  The seal of the
Company and any or all signatures of the officers of the Company upon any of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S may be facsimiles.

     SECTION 3.05.  Effective Period of Supplemental Indenture.  The preceding
provisions of Articles I, II and III of this supplemental indenture shall
remain in effect only so long as any of the bonds of the Pollution Control
Series S shall remain outstanding.

     SECTION 3.06.  Credits with Respect to Payments.  (a) The Company shall
be entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay interest on the bonds of
the Pollution Control Series S equal to interest paid on the 1994 Series D
Authority Bonds out of the accrued interest received upon the original issuance
of the 1994 Series D Authority Bonds and the earnings on the investment
thereof, as provided in the Authority Indenture, which are held by the
Authority Trustee at the time of the interest payment date.

     (b) The Company shall be entitled to credits against amounts otherwise
payable in respect of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series S in an amount
corresponding to (i) the principal amount of any 1994 Series D Authority Bond
surrendered to the Authority Trustee by the Company or the Authority, or
purchased by the Authority Trustee, for cancellation and (ii) the amount of
money held by the Authority Trustee and available and designated for the
payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the 1994 Series D
Authority Bonds, as the case may be, regardless of the source of payment to the
Authority Trustee of such moneys, and the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder,
shall give prompt written notice to the Company of any such credit with respect
to the payment of interest.

     (c) The Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of each deposit in the Debt Service Fund under the Authority Indenture,
(ii) provide evidence to the Company that such deposit has been credited to
such Fund and (iii) give prompt written notice to the Company of any credits
with respect to payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series S.

     (d) A certificate of the Company signed by the President or any Vice
President, and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and consented to 

                                       19
<PAGE>

by the Authority Trustee, stating that the Company is entitled to a credit
under this Section 3.06 and setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, shall be conclusive evidence of such entitlement, and the Trustee shall
accept such certificate without further investigation or verification of the
matters stated therein.

     SECTION 3.07.  Time for Making of Payment.  All payments of principal or
redemption price of and interest on the bonds of the Pollution Control Series
S shall be made to the Authority Trustee in such funds as shall constitute
immediately available funds when payment is due. In any case where the date of
payment of the principal or redemption price of or interest on the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series S or the date fixed for redemption of any such bonds
shall be in the city of payment a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday or a day
on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close, then such payment
need not be made on such date but may be made on the next succeeding business
day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the
date fixed for redemption, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the
period after such date.

     SECTION 3.08.  Effect of Approval of Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey.  The approval of the Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey of the execution and delivery of these presents and of the
issue of any bonds of the Pollution Control Series S shall not be construed as
approval of said Board of any other act, matter or thing which requires
approval of said Board under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

     SECTION 3.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  For the purpose of facilitating
the recording hereof, this supplemental indenture has been executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be and shall be taken to be an original, and
all collectively but one instrument.

                           POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES T

     Public Service Electric and Gas Company (hereinafter called the

hereby promises to pay to First Fidelity Bank, National Association, as trustee

     Both the principal hereof and interest hereon shall be paid at the

     This Bond is one of the First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds of the Company

Company and First Fidelity Bank, National Association (formerly known as
Fidelity Union Trust Company), a national banking association of the United
States of America, as Trustee, as supplemented and amended by the supplemental
indentures thereto, including the supplemental indenture dated October 1, 1994
(No. 2). This Bond is one of the Bonds of the Pollution Control Series T, which
series is limited to the aggregate principal amount of $4,600,000 and is issued
pursuant to said supplemental indenture dated October 1, 1994 (No. 2).
Reference is hereby made to said indenture and all supplements thereto for a
specification of the principal amount of Bonds from time to time issuable
thereunder, and for a description of the

                                       6

<PAGE> 8
properties mortgaged and conveyed or assigned to said Trustee or its
successors, the nature and extent of the security, and the rights of the
holders of said Bonds and any coupons appurtenant thereto, and of the Trustee
in respect of such security.

     In and by said indenture, as amended and supplemented, it is provided that
with the written approval of the Company and the Trustee, any of the provisions
of said indenture may from time to time be eliminated or modified and other
provisions may be added thereto provided the change does not alter the annual
interest rate, redemption price or date, date of maturity or amount payable on
maturity of any then outstanding Bond or conflict with the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939 as then in effect, and provided the holders of 85% in principal amount
of the Bonds secured by said indenture and then outstanding (including, if such
change affect the Bonds of one or more series but less than all series then
outstanding, a like percentage of the then outstanding Bonds of each series
affected by such change, and excluding Bonds owned or controlled by the Company
or by the parties owning at least 10% of the outstanding voting stock of the
Company, as more fully specified in said indenture) consent in writing thereto,
all as more fully set forth in said indenture, as amended and supplemented.

       First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds issuable under said indenture are
issuable in series, and the Bonds of any series may be for varying principal
amounts and in the form of coupon Bonds and of registered Bonds without
coupons, and the Bonds of any one series may differ from the Bonds of any other
series as to date, maturity, interest rate and otherwise, all as in said
indenture provided and set forth. The Bonds of the Pollution Control Series T,
in which this Bond is included, are designated "First and Refunding Mortgage
Bonds, Pollution Control Series T".

     In case of the happening of an event of default as specified in said
indenture and in the supplemental indenture dated March 1, 1942 supplemental
thereto, the principal sum of the Bonds of this issue may be declared or may
become due and payable forthwith, in the manner and with the effect in said
indenture provided.

     The Bonds of this series are subject to redemption as provided in said
supplemental indenture dated October 1, 1994 (No. 2).

upon any such transfer a new Bond similar hereto will be issued to the

otherwise; it being expressly agreed and understood that said indenture, any
indenture supplemental thereto and the obligations issued thereunder, are
solely corporate obligations, and that no personal liability whatever shall

them, because of the incurring of the indebtedness thereby authorized, or under
or by reason of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements contained in
the indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto or in any of the Bonds
or coupons issued thereunder, or implied therefrom.

     This Bond shall not be entitled to any security or benefit under said

                                   ARTICLE I.

                    BONDS OF THE POLLUTION CONTROL SERIES T.

     The series of bonds authorized by this supplemental indenture to be issued
under and secured by the Indenture shall be designated "First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds, Pollution Control Series T"; shall be limited to the aggregate
principal amount of $4,600,000; shall be issued initially to the Authority
Trustee, as assignee of the Authority, to evidence the Company's obligation
under the Agreement with respect to the 1994 Authority Bonds; and shall mature
and bear interest as set forth in the form of bond hereinbefore described;
provided, however, that the Company shall receive certain credits against
principal and interest obligations as set forth in Section 3.06 hereof. The
date of each bond of the Pollution Control Series T shall be the semi-annual
interest payment date next preceding the date of authentication, unless such
date of authentication be an interest payment date, in which case the date
shall be the date of authentication, or unless such date of authentication be

by the registered owner in person or by attorney duly authorized in writing at
said office of the Trustee.

     The Company hereby waives any right to make a charge for any transfer of
bonds of the Pollution Control Series T, but the Company may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in relation thereto.

     expressed in percentages of the principal amount of the bonds to be

          (b) at the option of the Company, as a whole at any time at 100% of
     the principal amount thereof, if any of the following events shall have
     occurred and if, within one year of the occurrence of any of the following
     events, the Company shall have given evidence to the Trustee and the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15
     a Vice President, and by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the
     Company to the effect that one of such events has occurred and is
     continuing, and describing the same:

             (1) the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 or a
        substantial portion of the facilities of the Project shall have been
        damaged or destroyed to such extent that (a) such Station or the
        facilities of the Project cannot be reasonably restored within a
        period of six months from the date of such damage or destruction to
        the condition thereof immediately preceding such damage or
        destruction, or (b) the Company is thereby prevented or likely to be
        prevented from carrying on its normal operation of such Station or the
        facilities of the Project for a period of six months from the date of
        such damage or destruction, or (c) it would not be practicable or
        desirable to rebuild, repair or restore such Station or the facilities
        of the Project; or

             (2) title to, or the temporary use of, all or substantially all
        of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 or a
        substantial portion of the facilities of the Project shall have been
        taken or condemned by a competent authority which taking or
        condemnation results or is likely to result in the Company being
        thereby prevented or likely to be prevented from carrying on its
        normal operation of such Station or the facilities of the Project for
        a period of six months; or

             (3) changes in the cost or availability of raw materials,
        operating supplies, or facilities or technological or other changes
        have made the continued operation of all or substantially all of the
        Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 and 3 or a substantial
        portion of the facilities of the Project uneconomical; or

             (4) any laws, rules, regulations or orders of any governmental or
        regulatory entity shall require a shutdown of the Peach Bottom Atomic
        Power Station Units 2 and 3 or a substantial portion of the facilities
        of the Project or prevent the Company from carrying on its normal
        operation of such Station or the facilities of the Project, in each
        case for a period of six months.

        (c) in, whole or in part (if, in the opinion of nationally recognized
   bond counsel, such partial redemption will preserve the exclusion from

                                       14
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16
   gross income for Federal income tax purposes of interest on the remaining
   1994 Authority Bonds) at any time at 100% of the principal amount thereof
   to be redeemed, within 180 days after a "final determination" (i.e., the
   issuance of a published or private ruling or technical advice) of the
   Internal Revenue Service or a judicial decision in a proceeding by any
   court of competent jurisdiction in the United States (from which ruling,
   advice or decision no further right of appeal exists), in all cases in
   which the Company has participated or been a party or has been given an
   opportunity to participate and has failed to do so (no such decree or
   judgment by any court or action by the Internal Revenue Service to be
   considered final unless the owner of the 1994 Authority Bonds involved in
   such proceeding or action has given the Company and the Authority Trustee
   prompt written notice of the commencement thereof and offered the Company,
   at the Company's expense, the opportunity to control the defense thereof)
   that, as a result of a failure by the Company to observe any covenant,
   agreement, representation or warranty in the Agreement, the interest
   payable on the 1994 Authority Bonds is includable in the gross income for
   Federal income tax purposes of the holder thereof, other than a
   "substantial user" of the Project or a "related person" as provided in
   Section 147(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the
   applicable regulations thereunder.

     SECTION 2.02.  Notice of Redemption.  (a) The election of the Company
under subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof to redeem any of the bonds
of the Pollution Control Series T shall be evidenced by a resolution of the
Board of Directors of the Company calling for redemption on a stated date of
all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal amount thereof. To
exercise its option to redeem the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T under
subsection (a) or (b) of Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall deliver to the
Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a certified copy of said
resolution calling all or, in the case of subsection (a), a stated principal
amount of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T for redemption on a date
not less than 40 days nor more than 90 days from the date said resolution is
delivered. The delivery to the Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such
resolution shall constitute notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption
referred to therein, on the terms specified therein. The Company shall on or
before such redemption date deposit with the Trustee, as paying agent
hereunder, the total applicable redemption price of all the bonds so called,
with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any credits to which
the

                                       15
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17
Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof, and the Trustee, as
such paying agent, shall apply such funds on the redemption date to the
redemption of the bonds so called.

     (b) The Company shall, within 10 days after the occurrence of a "final
determination" under subsection (c) of Section 2.01 hereof, deliver to the
Trustee written notice of such "final determination". The Company shall, by
resolution of its Board of Directors, fix a redemption date for such redemption
and shall deliver to the Trustee, the Authority and the Authority Trustee a
certified copy of said resolution at least 40 days prior to the date so
selected for redemption. Such redemption date may be any day not more than 180
days after the occurrence of such "final determination". If the Trustee does
not receive written notice of such selection by the Company within 140 days
after the date of the occurrence of such "final determination", then the
redemption date shall be the 180th day after the occurrence of such "final
determination". On or before such redemption date, the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, the total redemption price of the
bonds so called, with interest accrued thereon to the redemption date, less any
credits to which the Company may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.06 hereof,
and the Trustee, as such paying agent, shall apply such funds, on the
redemption date, to the redemption of the bonds so called. The delivery to the
Authority Trustee of a certified copy of such resolution shall constitute
notice to the Authority Trustee of the redemption referred to therein on the
terms specified therein.
 
     SECTION 2.03.  Interest on Called Bonds to Cease.  Each bond or portion
thereof of the Pollution Control Series T called for redemption under Section
2.02 hereof shall be due and payable at the office of the Trustee, as paying
agent hereunder, at the applicable redemption price and on the specified
redemption date, anything herein or in such bond to the contrary
notwithstanding. From and after the date when each bond or portion thereof of
the Pollution Control Series T shall be due and payable as aforesaid (unless
upon said date the full amount due thereon shall not be held by or provided to
the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, and be immediately available for
payment), all further interest shall cease to accrue on such bond or on such
portion thereof, as the case may be.

                                       16
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 18
     SECTION 2.04.  Bonds Called in Part.  If only a portion of any bond of the
Pollution Control Series T shall be called for redemption pursuant to Section
2.02 hereof, the notice of redemption hereinbefore provided for shall specify
the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Upon payment of the
portion so called for redemption, the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall
give prompt written notice thereof to the Company.

     SECTION 2.05.  Provisions of Indenture Not Applicable.  The provisions of
Article Four of the Indenture, as amended and supplemented, shall not apply to
the procedure for the exercise of any right of redemption reserved by the
Company, or to any mandatory redemption provided in this Article in respect of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T. There shall be no sinking fund for
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                 MISCELLANEOUS.

     SECTION 3.01.  Authentication of Bonds of Pollution Control Series T. 
None of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T, the issue of which is
provided for by this supplemental indenture, shall be authenticated by the
Trustee except in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, as amended
and supplemented, and this supplemental indenture, and upon compliance with the
conditions in that behalf therein contained.

     SECTION 3.02.  Additional Restrictions on Authentication of Additional
Bonds Under Indenture.  The Company covenants that from and after the date of
execution of this supplemental indenture, no additional bonds (as defined in
Section 1 of Article Two of the Indenture) shall be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee under Subdivision A of Section 4 of said Article Two on account
of additions or improvements to the mortgaged property

        (1) unless the net earnings of the Company for the period required by
     Subdivision C of Section 6 of said Article Two shall have been at least
     twice the fixed charges (in lieu of 1 3/4 times such fixed charges, as
     required by said Subdivision C); and for the purpose of this condition (a)
     such fixed charges shall in each case include interest on the bonds

                                       17

<PAGE> 19
    applied for, notwithstanding the parenthetical provision contained in
    clause (4) of said Subdivision C, and (b) in computing such net earnings
    there shall be included in expenses of operation (under paragraph (c) of
    said Subdivision C) all charges against earnings for depreciation, renewals
    or replacements, and all certificates with respect to net earnings
    delivered to the Trustee in connection with any authentication of
    additional bonds under said Article Two shall so state; and

         (2) except to the extent of 60% (in lieu of 75% as permitted by
    Subdivision A of Section 7 of said Article Two) of the cost or fair value
    to the Company of the additions or improvements forming the basis for such
    authentication of additional bonds.

    SECTION 3.03.  Restriction on Dividends.  The Company will not declare or
pay any dividend on any shares of its common stock (other than dividends
payable in shares of its common stock) or make any other distribution on any
such shares, or purchase or otherwise acquire any such shares (except shares
acquired without cost to the Company) whenever such action would reduce the
earned surplus of the Company to an amount less than $10,000,000 or such lesser
amount as may remain after deducting from said $10,000,000 all amounts
appearing in the books of account of the Company on December 31, 1948, which
shall thereafter, pursuant to any order or rule of any regulatory body entered
after said date, be required to be removed, in whole or in part, from the books
of account of the Company by charges to earned surplus.

     SECTION 3.04.  Use of Facsimile Seal and Signatures.  The seal of the
Company and any or all signatures of the officers of the Company upon any of
the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T may be facsimiles.

     SECTION 3.05.  Effective Period of Supplemental Indenture.  The preceding
provisions of Articles I, II and III of this supplemental indenture shall
remain in effect only so long as any of the bonds of the Pollution Control
Series T shall remain outstanding.

     SECTION 3.06.  Credits with Respect to Payments.  (a) The Company shall
be entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay interest on the bonds of
the Pollution Control Series T equal to interest paid on the 1994 Authority

                                       18
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 20
Bonds out of the accrued interest received upon the original issuance of the
1994 Authority Bonds and the earnings on the investment thereof, as provided
in the Authority Indenture, which are held by the Authority Trustee at the time
of the interest payment date.

     (b) The Company shall be entitled to credits against amounts otherwise
payable in respect of the bonds of the Pollution Control Series T in an amount
corresponding to (i) the principal amount of any 1994 Authority Bond
surrendered to the Authority Trustee by the Company or the Authority, or
purchased by the Authority Trustee, for cancellation and (ii) the amount of
money held by the Authority Trustee and available and designated for the
payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the 1994 Authority
Bonds, as the case may be, regardless of the source of payment to the Authority
Trustee of such moneys, and the Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall give
prompt written notice to the Company of any such credit with respect to the
payment of interest.

     (c) The Trustee, as paying agent hereunder, shall (i) promptly notify the
Company of each deposit in the Debt Service Fund under the Authority Indenture,
(ii) provide evidence to the Company that such deposit has been credited to
such Fund and (iii) give prompt written notice to the Company of any credits
with respect to payment of principal or redemption price of and interest on the
bonds of the Pollution Control Series T.

     (d) A certificate of the Company signed by the President or any Vice
President, and by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, and consented to
by the Authority Trustee, stating that the Company is entitled to a credit
under this Section 3.06 and setting forth the basis therefor in reasonable
detail, shall be conclusive evidence of such entitlement, and the Trustee shall
accept such certificate without further investigation or verification of the
matters stated therein.

     SECTION 3.07.  Time for Making of Payment.  All payments of principal or
redemption price of and interest on the bonds of the Pollution Control Series
T shall be made to the Authority Trustee in such funds as shall constitute
immediately available funds when payment is due. In any case where the date of
payment of the principal or redemption price of or interest on the bonds of the
Pollution Control Series T or the date fixed for redemption

                                       19
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21
of any such bonds shall be in the city of payment a Saturday, Sunday or a legal
holiday or a day on which banking institutions are authorized by law to close,
then such payment need not be made on such date but may be made on the next
succeeding business day with the same force and effect as if made on the date
of maturity or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest on such payment
shall accrue for the period after such date.

     SECTION 3.08.  Effect of Approval of Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey.  The approval of the Board of Public Utilities of the
State of New Jersey of the execution and delivery of these presents and of the
issue of any bonds of the Pollution Control Series T shall not be construed as
approval of said Board of any other act, matter or thing which requires
approval of said Board under the laws of the State of New Jersey.

     SECTION 3.09.  Execution in Counterparts.  For the purpose of facilitating
the recording hereof, this supplemental indenture has been executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be and shall be taken to be an original, and
all collectively but one instrument.
