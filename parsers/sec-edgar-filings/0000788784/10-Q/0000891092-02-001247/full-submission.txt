Basis of Presentation

The financial  statements  included  herein have been  prepared  pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange  Commission  (SEC) for Form
10-Q.  Certain  information and note disclosures  normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  However,
in the opinion of management,  the  disclosures  herein are adequate to make the
information  presented not misleading.  These consolidated  financial statements
and  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  (Notes)  should  be read in
conjunction with and update and supplement  matters discussed in our 2001 Annual
Report on Form 10-K and our  Amended  Quarterly  Report on Form  10-Q/A  for the
quarter  ended  March  31,  2002 and our  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended June 30, 2002.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                            (UNAUDITED) -- Continued

The unaudited  financial  information  furnished herein reflects all adjustments
which are, in the opinion of  management,  necessary to fairly state the results
for  the  interim  periods  presented.  All  such  adjustments  are of a  normal
recurring nature. The year-end consolidated balance sheets were derived from the
audited consolidated  financial statements included in our 2001 Annual Report on
Form 10-K.  Certain  reclassifications  of prior  period  data have been made to
conform with the current presentation.

Several factors impacting us in the quarter ended September 30, 2002 also impact
the  presentation of our financial  statements  presented  herein.  In the third
quarter,  we adopted  Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3,  which requires
that we report energy trading  revenues and energy trading costs on a net basis.
See Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements.  In addition, as a result of these
and other changes in our business,  we also reevaluated our segment presentation
and have determined that Power operates in one integrated business segment.  See
Note 9. Financial Information By Business Segment.

Under the Basic Generation Service (BGS) contract,  which terminated on July 31,
2002,  Power sold energy directly to PSE&G which in turn sold this energy to its
customers. These revenues were properly recognized on each company's stand-alone
financial  statements  and  were  eliminated  when  preparing  our  consolidated
financial statements.  For the new BGS contract period beginning August 1, 2002,
Power sells  energy to third party  suppliers  and other load  serving  entities
(LSEs) and PSE&G purchases the energy for its customers'  needs from third party
suppliers.  Due to this change in the BGS model, these revenues and expenses are
no longer  intercompany  revenues and expenses and are no longer  eliminated  in
consolidation.

Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142)

On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS 142. Under this  standard,  we were required
to  complete  an  impairment  analysis  of  goodwill  during 2002 and record any
required impairment  retroactive to the first quarter.  Under SFAS 142, goodwill
is  considered  a  nonamortizable  asset and is subject to an annual  review for
impairment and an interim review when certain events or changes in circumstances
occur.  The effect of no longer  amortizing  goodwill on an annual basis was not
material to our  financial  position and results of  operations  upon  adoption.
Under SFAS 142,  we had a  transitional  period of six  months  from the date of
adoption to complete our goodwill impairment testing,  which was completed as of
June 30,  2002.  We  evaluated  the  recoverability  of the  recorded  amount of
goodwill  based on certain  operating and  financial  factors.  Such  impairment
testing included  discounted cash flow tests which require broad assumptions and
significant  judgment to be exercised by management.  As a result, in the second
quarter of 2002 we recorded after-tax charges to reflect the goodwill impairment
of $120  million,  retroactive  to  January 1,  2002,  and such  amount has been
recognized  as a  Cumulative  Effect  of a Change  in  Accounting  Principle  in
accordance with the new standard.  See Goodwill  Impairment  Analysis in Note 3.
Asset  Impairments  for  further  details.  In  future  periods,   any  goodwill
impairments   will  be  recorded  as  a  component  of  income  from  continuing
operations.

SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets"
(SFAS 144)

On January 1, 2002 we adopted  SFAS 144. On  adoption,  SFAS 144 did not have an
effect on our  financial  position  or  results of  operations.  Under SFAS 144,
long-lived assets to be disposed of are measured at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell, whether reported in continued operations or in
discontinued  operations.  Also under SFAS 144,  discontinued  operations are no
longer measured at net realizable  value or include amounts for operating losses
that have not yet occurred. Under SFAS 144, discontinued operations are measured
at fair value, less costs to sell. For additional  information see Note 3. Asset
Impairments and Note 4. Discontinued Operations.

SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" (SFAS 143)

In July 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 143.
Under SFAS 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation
(ARO) is required  to be recorded in the period in which it is incurred  with an
offsetting  amount recorded as an asset.  Upon  settlement of the liability,  an
entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or
loss. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.

In August 2002,  PSE&G filed a petition  requesting  clarification  from the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) regarding the future cost  responsibility
for nuclear  decommissioning  and  whether,  as a matter of law and policy:  (a)
PSE&G's  customers  will  continue to pay for such costs  through  the  Societal
Benefits Clause (SBC); or (b) such customer responsibility will terminate at the
end of the  four-year  transition  period on July 31, 2003.  The outcome of this
petition will affect the treatment of the liability recorded for Power's nuclear
decommissioning obligation. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

Upon  adoption  of the  standard,  we will be  required  to adjust  our  Nuclear
Decommissioning  Liability  ($768 million,  pre-tax as of September 30, 2002) to
reflect the present value of our expected asset  retirement  obligation which we
believe is substantially lower than the recorded amount of our liability. If the
BPU determines that PSE&G's customers  continue to pay for these costs, then the
difference  between  the  recorded  amount of the  liability  and the  liability
calculated  under the new ARO standard will be deferred on the balance sheet. If
the BPU determines  that such customer  responsibility  terminates at the end of
the transition  period,  then the difference  between the recorded amount of our
liability  and the  liability  calculated  under  the new ARO  standard  will be
recorded as a one-time benefit as a Cumulative  Effect of a Change in Accounting
Principle.  The impact of adopting  SFAS 143 is still being  determined,  and is
likely to be a material  benefit to our results of operations  and our financial
position by reducing our liability and increasing shareholders' equity.

In conjunction with the  implementation of SFAS 143, we may change our method of
accounting   for  Cost  of  Removal  for  our  Fossil   Stations,   which  would
substantially reduce the Cost of Removal Liability that we have recorded for our
Fossil  stations,  $142 million,  pre-tax as of September 30, 2002. We currently
believe that we will have no material legal retirement  obligation under the new
standard for our Fossil stations,  therefore the amount of that liability at the
time we adopt SFAS 143 will reverse into income.

Although  the  impact  of this  standard  on  future  expenses  is  still  being
determined,   our  present  analyses  indicate  that  ongoing  depreciation  and
operating  expense (to accrete from the ARO liability,  which is recorded at its
present value, to the ultimate  liability) will approximate our current expected
expense levels over our five year planning  horizon,  and therefore would have a
minimal  impact on earnings.  However,  under  current GAAP we could  experience
significant  volatility  in  earnings  since the Nuclear  Decommissioning  Trust
Fund's assets would be required to be marked to market with unrealized gains and
losses  recognized in Other  Comprehensive  Income (OCI) and realized  gains and
losses  recognized  through  earnings.  Previously,  these gains and losses were
offset by changes in the  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Liability  with no effect on
earnings.  We  are  currently  considering  various  methods  to  mitigate  this
volatility, including multiple financial products, although no assurances can be
given.

SFAS No. 145,  "Rescission of FASB  Statements  Nos. 4, 44 and 64,  Amendment of
FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections" (SFAS 145)

During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted SFAS 145. This  Statement  rescinds
SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from  Extinguishments of Debt," (SFAS 4)
and an amendment of that Statement,  SFAS No. 64,  "Extinguishments of Debt Made
to Satisfy Sinking Fund Requirements"  (SFAS 64). SFAS 4 required that gains and
losses from  extinguishments  of debt that were included in the determination of
net income be aggregated, and if material,  classified as an extraordinary item.
Since the issuance of SFAS 4, the use of debt extinguishments has become part of
the risk  management  strategy of many  companies,  representing  a type of debt
extinguishment  that  does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  classification  as an
extraordinary item. Based on this trend, the FASB issued this rescission of SFAS
4 and SFAS 64. Accordingly, under SFAS 145, we now record these gains and losses
in Other Income and Other Deductions, respectively. We recorded pre-tax gains of
$4  million  ($3  million  after-tax)  from the  early  retirement  of debt as a
component of Other Income for the quarter and nine months ended September

30,  2002.  Also,  we  reclassified  a pre-tax  loss of $3 million  ($2  million
after-tax) from the early  retirement of debt to a component of Other Deductions
for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 in accordance with SFAS 145.

SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities"
(SFAS 146)

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146 which addresses the financial  accounting
and reporting for costs  associated with exit or disposal  activities.  SFAS 146
states that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal  activity
shall be recognized and measured  initially at its fair value in the period when
the  liability  is  incurred.  A  liability  is  established  only when  present
obligations  to  others  are  determined.  SFAS  146  does  not  apply  to costs
associated  with the  retirement  of long-lived  assets  covered in SFAS 143. It
applies  to costs  associated  with an exit  activity  that does not  involve an
entity  newly  acquired in a business  combination  or with a disposal  activity
covered  by SFAS 144.  We will apply  SFAS 146 for exit or  disposal  activities
initiated  after December 31, 2002 in accordance  with the effective date of the
standard.

Emerging  Issues Task Force  (EITF) Issue No. 02-3,  "Accounting  for  Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities" (EITF 02-3)

In June 2002,  the EITF  addressed  certain  issues  related  to energy  trading
activities,  including  gross  versus  net  presentation  in  the  statement  of
operations and additional disclosure requirements for energy trading activities.
The EITF determined that gains and losses on energy trading  contracts should be
shown net in the statement of operations. This change is applicable to financial
statements  for  periods  ending  after July 15,  2002 and  requires  that prior
periods be restated  for  comparability.

Pursuant to EITF Issue No. 99-19, "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent" (EITF 99-19),  we had been  recording our trading  revenues and
trading  related costs on a gross basis for physical  energy and capacity  sales
and purchases.  In accordance with EITF 02-3,  beginning in the third quarter of
2002, we started reporting energy trading revenues and energy trading costs on a
net  basis  and  have  reclassified  prior  periods  to  conform  with  this net
presentation.  As a result, both trading revenues and trading costs were reduced
by approximately  $748 million and $636 million for the quarters ended September
30, 2002 and 2001,  respectively  and $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion for the nine
month periods ended  September 30, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  This change in
presentation  did not have an  effect on  trading  margins,  net  income or cash
flows.

In October 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus regarding the accounting for
contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities.  Management
does not yet know the impact of adopting this consensus on January 1, 2003.

Note 3.  Asset Impairments

As of December 31,  2001,  Energy  Holdings'  aggregate  investment  exposure in
Argentina  was  $632  million,  including  certain  loss  contingencies.   These
investments included a 90% owned distribution company,  Empresa Distribuidora de
Electricidad  de  Entre  Rios  S.A.  (EDEERSA);   minority  interests  in  three
distribution  companies,  Empresa  Distribuidora  de Energia Norte S.A.  (EDEN),
Empresa  Distribuidora de Energia Sur S.A. (EDES), and Empresa  Distribuidora La
Plata S.A. (EDELAP);  and two generating companies,  Central Termica San Nicolas
(CTSN), and Parana which are under contract for sale to certain  subsidiaries of
The AES  Corporation  (AES). In June 2002,  Energy Holdings  determined that the
carrying value of its Argentine investments was impaired. The combination of the
year-to-date  operating losses,  goodwill  impairment at EDEERSA,  write-down of
$506 million for all Argentine assets, and certain loss  contingencies  resulted
in a pre-tax charge to earnings of $632 million ($410 million after-tax) for the
nine months ended  September  30, 2002.  In  connection  with the  write-down of
Energy  Holding's  Argentine  assets,  we recorded a deferred  tax asset of $222
million. We believe that we will have sufficient future capital gains to realize

our Argentine investments, see Note 6. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

The tables below provide pre-tax and after-tax impacts of the various impairment

EDEERSA

Given  the  year-to-date  and  projected  operating  losses at  EDEERSA  and the
continued economic uncertainty in Argentina,  Energy Holdings determined that it
was necessary to test these assets for impairment.  Such impairment analysis was
completed as of June 30, 2002.  As a result of this  analysis,  Energy  Holdings
determined  that these assets were  completely  impaired under SFAS 144.  Energy
Holdings recorded total charges and losses of $213 million,  pre-tax, related to
this  investment  for the nine months ended  September  30, 2002.  These pre-tax
charges  consisted of goodwill  impairment  charges of $56  million,  nine month
operating losses of $59 million,  of which $45 million was recorded in the first
quarter of 2002, a complete asset impairment of $94 million pursuant to our SFAS
144 impairment  analysis and loss  contingencies  and other items of $4 million.
The total  after-tax  charges and losses  related to this  investment  were $139
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

In addition,  Energy  Holdings has  developed an exit strategy to dispose of its
equity  interest  in  EDEERSA.  This exit is expected to be complete by June 30,
2003 and Energy Holdings  intends to operate EDEERSA while carrying out its exit
plans.  However,  due to  uncertainties  related  to the  timing  and  method of
disposal of the  investment in EDEERSA,  the  impairment  charges and results of
EDEERSA's  operations  will not be reported as a  discontinued  operation  until
EDEERSA  has been  disposed of or a sale is  probable.  Global is  currently  in
discussions  with potential  acquirers of EDEERSA.  During the second quarter of

                            (UNAUDITED) -- Continued

As of January 1,  2002,  goodwill  related  to Energy  Holdings'  investment  in
EDEERSA  was  approximately  $56 million  and was  included in Energy  Holdings'
previously disclosed  investment exposure.  As part of the adoption of SFAS 142,
Energy  Holdings has  determined  that this goodwill was impaired and all of the
goodwill has been  written-down as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle as of January 1, 2002 and is reflected in our  Consolidated  Statement
of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. See below,  Goodwill
Impairment Analysis, for a further discussion of our goodwill analysis.

Stock Purchase Agreement

On August 24, 2001,  Global entered into a Stock Purchase  Agreement with AES to
sell its minority interests in EDEN, EDES,  EDELAP,  CTSN and Parana, to certain
subsidiaries  of AES.  In  connection  with  the  terms  of the  Stock  Purchase
Agreement,  Global has accrued  interest  and other  receivables  of $17 million
through February 6, 2002, which are direct  obligations of AES and represent the
total remaining  exposure  associated with these investments on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. On February 6, 2002, AES notified Global that it was terminating
the Stock Purchase Agreement.  In the Notice of Termination,  AES alleged that a
Political Risk Event,  within the meaning of the Stock Purchase  Agreement,  had
occurred by virtue of certain  decrees of the  Government of Argentina,  thereby
giving AES the right to terminate  the Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  Global filed
suit in New York State Supreme Court for New York County  against AES to enforce
its rights  under the Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  A  settlement  was reached in
October 2002 between the parties  under which Global will transfer its shares of
EDEN,  EDES,  EDELAP,  Parana and CTSN to AES.  AES has paid Global $15 million,
plus  interest  under the  settlement  and has issued  notes that would yield an
additional  $15 million when the notes mature on various dates ending July 2003.
The litigation is stayed pending AES performance of settlement obligations.

Since AES  disputed  its  obligation  to close and Global  could not predict the
outcome of the  litigation,  Global  determined  it was  necessary to test these
assets for  impairment.  As a result of this analysis,  it was  determined  that
these assets were fully  impaired and we recorded a write-down  in the amount of
$412 million (pre-tax) ($268 million after-tax) and loss contingencies and other
items of $7 million  (pre-tax) ($4 million  after-tax) for the nine months ended
September  30,  2002.

Goodwill Impairment Analysis

In the second quarter of 2002, we finalized our evaluation of the effect of SFAS
142 on the recorded amount of goodwill. The total amount of goodwill impairments
is $120  million,  net of tax of $66  million and was  comprised  of $36 million
(after-tax) at EDEERSA,  $34 million  (after-tax) at Rio Grande Energia (RGE), a
Brazilian distribution company of which Global owns 32%, $32 million (after-tax)
at Energy  Technologies and $18 million  (after-tax) at Tanir Bavi Power Company
Private Ltd.  (Tanir Bavi), a generating  facility in India 74% owned by Global.
All of the  goodwill  related  to these  companies,  other  than RGE,  was fully
impaired. As noted above, this impairment charge has been recorded as of January
1,  2002 as a  Cumulative  Effect  of a Change in  Accounting  Principle  and is
reflected  in  Consolidated  Statement of  Operations  for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002. The $53 million of goodwill at Energy  Technologies  and the
$27  million of  goodwill  at Tanir  Bavi,  as of  December  31,  2001 have been
reclassified into Current Assets of Discontinued  Operations on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. For further detail regarding the goodwill  impairments at Energy
Technologies and Tanir Bavi, see Note 4. Discontinued Operations.

As of September  30, 2002,  the  remaining  carrying  value of goodwill was $464
million,  of which  $434  million  was  recorded  in  connection  with  Global's
acquisitions  of Sociedad  Austral de Electricidad  S.A.  (SAESA) and Empresa de
Electricidad  de los Andes S.A.  (Electroandes)  in Chile and Peru in August and
December  of 2001,  respectively.  For the year ended  December  31,  2001,  the
amortization expense related to goodwill was $3 million.

As of September 30, 2002, our pro-rata share of the remaining  goodwill included
in equity method  investees  totaled $271 million.  In accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, such goodwill is not consolidated on our balance
sheet.  Our share of the  amortization  expense  related to such goodwill was $8
million for the year-ended December 31, 2001.

As of September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,  our goodwill and pro-rata share
of goodwill in consolidated equity method projects was as follows:

                                                               As of

(1)   The decrease at SAESA relates to final  purchase  price  adjustments  that
      resulted in higher value allocated to deferred tax assets.

(2)   The decrease at EDEERSA relates to an impairment of $56 million under SFAS
      142 and to purchase  price  adjustments  of $7 million made  subsequent to

Note 4. Discontinued Operations

Energy Technologies' Investments

Energy Technologies is comprised of 11 heating, ventilating and air conditioning
(HVAC) and mechanical  operating  companies and an asset  management group which
includes  various Demand Side Management (DSM)  investments.  DSM investments in
long-term contracts represent  expenditures made by Energy Technologies to share
DSM  customers'  costs  associated  with the  installation  of energy  efficient
equipment.  DSM revenues are earned  principally from monthly payments  received
from utilities, which represent shared electricity savings from the installation
of the energy efficient equipment.

During the second  quarter of 2002,  Energy  Holdings  completed its  impairment
testing of all recorded  goodwill in accordance  with guidance set forth in SFAS
142  including the goodwill  associated  with the 11  HVAC/mechanical  operating
companies  acquired by Energy  Technologies.  Such analysis  indicated  that the
entire $53 million of goodwill associated with the HVAC/mechanical companies was
impaired, which resulted in a $32 million (after-tax) charge (net of $21 million
in taxes).  In accordance  with SFAS 142, this charge was recorded as of January
1, 2002 as a Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle and reflected
in our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

In June  2002,  Energy  Holdings  adopted  a plan to sell its  interests  in the
HVAC/mechanical  operating companies. The sale of these companies is expected to
be  completed  by  June  30,  2003.   We  have   retained  the  services  of  an
investment-banking  firm to market these  companies to interested  parties.  The
HVAC/mechanical  operating  companies  meet the criteria for  classification  as
components  of   discontinued   operations  and  all  prior  periods  have  been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

In the second quarter of 2002, Energy Holdings  initiated a process for the sale
of Energy  Technologies' DSM investments,  which we had expected to sell by June
30, 2003.  Based on our  assessments,  we believe the fair market value of these
assets  approximates  their  carrying  value  as of  September  30,  2002 and no
reduction in the  carrying  amount is  indicated.  For the period ended June 30,
2002,  Energy  Technologies'  DSM investments  were classified as a component of
discontinued  operations.  In the third quarter of 2002, Energy Holdings decided
to continue to own the DSM investments. For the period ended September 30, 2002,
all DSM investments were reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing
operations and the consolidated  statements for all periods  presented have been
restated to reflect this reclassification.

In addition to the goodwill impairment,  Energy Holdings has further reduced the
carrying value of the investments in the 11 HVAC/mechanical  operating companies
to their fair value less costs to sell,  and recorded a loss on disposal for the
six months ended June 30, 2002 of $20 million,  net of $11 million in taxes.  As
of September  30,  2002,  the carrying  value of the  HVAC/mechanical  operating
companies approximates the fair value and accordingly no additional reduction in
the carrying  value was required for the three months ended  September 30, 2002.
Energy  Holdings'  remaining  investment  position  in  Energy  Technologies  is
approximately  $110  million,  of which  approximately  $32  million  relates to
deferred  tax  assets  from  discontinued  operations,  for  which no  valuation
allowance  is  deemed   necessary.   Excluding  the  deferred  tax  assets  from
discontinued  operations,  approximately $40 million of our remaining investment
balance relates to the asset management group.  Although we believe that we will
be able to sell the HVAC/mechanical companies, we can give no assurances that we
will be able to realize their total carrying values.

Operating results of Energy Technologies'  HVAC/mechanical  operating companies,
less certain  allocated costs from Energy Holdings,  have been reclassified into
discontinued  operations  in our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.  The
results of operations of these discontinued  operations for the quarter and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2002,  yielded  additional  losses of $3  million

Tanir Bavi

At September  30, 2002,  Global owned a 74% interest in Tanir Bavi Power Company
Private  Ltd.  (Tanir  Bavi),  which owns and  operates a 220 MW barge  mounted,
combined-cycle  generating  facility  in India.  A plan to exit  Tanir  Bavi was
adopted in June 2002.  Global  signed an agreement in August 2002 under which an
affiliate  of its partner in this  venture,  GMR Vasavi  Group,  a local  Indian
company,  purchased  Global's  majority  interest  in Tanir  Bavi.  The sale was
completed in October 2002. Tanir Bavi meets the criteria for classification as a
component  of   discontinued   operations   and  all  prior  periods  have  been
reclassified  to  conform  to the  current  year's  presentation.  In the second
quarter of 2002, we reduced the carrying  value of Tanir Bavi to the  contracted
sales  price of $45  million  and  recorded a loss on  disposal  of $14  million
(after-tax).  The operating  results of Tanir Bavi for the six months ended June
30, 2002 yielded income of $5 million (after-tax).

Note 6. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

We, our  consolidated  subsidiaries and our equity method investees are involved
in various  legal actions  arising in the normal  course of business.  We do not
expect that there will be a material adverse effect on our financial  condition,
results  of  operations  and net cash  flows as a result  of these  proceedings,
although no assurances can be given.

Guaranteed Obligations

Power

Power has  guaranteed  payment of  obligations  incurred  under  energy  trading
contracts of its subsidiary, ER&T, with various counterparties up to established
dollar limits.  The established  dollar limits of those  guarantees on behalf of
counterparties  totaled  approximately  $1 billion at  September  30,  2002.  In
addition,  Power  has  guaranteed  payment  of all  amounts  owed to PJM by ER&T
without a stated dollar limit.  The  outstanding  amount of exposure under those
guarantees totaled $166 million as of September 30, 2002 representing the amount
payable  under these  contracts  and the net amount by which open  contracts are
below market.

As of September 30, 2002,  letters of credit issued by Power were outstanding in
the amount of  approximately  $73  million  in  support  of various  contractual
obligations of its subsidiaries.

In  addition,  certain  International  Swap Dealer  Agreements  (ISDA) and other
supply  contracts  contain margin  requirements  that, as of September 30, 2002,
could require  Power to post  collateral  of  approximately  $270 million if our
credit ratings are downgraded  below  investment  grade.

Energy Holdings

Energy Holdings and/or Global have  guaranteed  certain  obligations of Global's
subsidiaries or affiliates, including the successful completion,  performance or
other  obligations  related  to  certain  projects  in an  aggregate  amount  of
approximately $244 million as of September 30, 2002. The guarantees consist of a
$61 million equity  commitment  for ELCHO in Poland,  $55 million of support for
Skawina in Poland, $56 million of various guarantees for Dhofar Power Company in
Oman, a $25 million guarantee related to bond payment  obligations of Chilquinta
Energia  Finance Co. LLC in connection with electric  distribution  companies in
Chile  and Peru and  various  other  guarantees  comprising  the  remaining  $47
million.  A substantial  portion of such guarantees is cancelled upon successful
completion,   performance   and/or   refinancing  of   construction   debt  with
non-recourse  project  debt.  Any  downward  revision in the current  ratings of
Energy Holdings' Senior Notes would require the issuance of letters of credit to
replace  the  existing  guarantee  of $61  million for ELCHO and $25 million for
Chilquinta.


In the normal  course of  business,  Energy  Technologies  secures  construction
obligations with performance bonds issued by insurance  companies.  In the event
that Energy  Technologies'  tangible  equity  falls below $100  million,  Energy
Holdings  would be required to provide  additional  support for the  performance
bonds.  Tangible equity is defined as net equity less goodwill.  As of September
30, 2002, Energy Technologies' tangible equity was $105 million. Energy Holdings
is in the  process  of  negotiating  alternate  support  arrangements  with bond
issuers,  including an indemnification agreement, which is likely to be executed
in the near future.  As of  September  30, 2002,  Energy  Technologies  had $220
million of such bonds  outstanding,  of which $46 million was at risk in ongoing
construction  projects.  Energy Holdings expects to reduce this amount over time
as part of its exit from this business.  The performance  bonds are not included
in the $244 million of guaranteed  obligations,  discussed  above. No assurances
can be given that Energy  Holdings  will be successful  in  extinguishing  these
obligations.

SAESA has guaranteed its share of a $35 million debt  obligation for a 50% owned
affiliate in Argentina, Edersa. This obligation was recorded on our Consolidated
Balance  Sheets as it was  considered  in the  valuation of SAESA at the date of
purchase in August  2001.  Global may be  required to make a $35 million  equity
contribution  to SAESA to repay the  obligation.  Since this obligation has been
previously  recorded,  there will be no impact to our Consolidated  Statement of
Operations if the  transaction is funded.  For further  discussion of this loan,
see Energy Holdings - Global - Chile.

Defaults in non-recourse project finance debt agreements do not cross-default to
any of our or Energy  Holdings'  other  credit  agreements.  In June  2002,  the
Administrative  Agent for the EDELAP project loan notified  Global that the loan
was in default and Global paid $2 million in sponsor  guarantees  that were due.
This amount is included in the $632  million of  Argentine  investment  exposure
that was impaired and recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The
Parana  project loan is in default.  Although a waiver has been  negotiated,  it
expired in May 2002 and lenders have taken no further action.  See Note 3. Asset
Impairments.

Environmental

Hazardous Waste

The New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection  (NJDEP)  regulations
concerning site investigation and remediation  require an ecological  evaluation
of  potential  injuries  to  natural  resources  in  connection  with a remedial
investigation  of contaminated  sites.  The NJDEP is presently  working with the
industry  to  develop  procedures  for  implementing  these  regulations.  These
regulations may substantially increase the costs of remedial  investigations and
remediations,  where necessary,  particularly at sites situated on surface water
bodies.  PSE&G,  Power and predecessor  companies own or owned and/or operate or
operated certain facilities  situated on surface water bodies,  certain of which
are currently the subject of remedial activities.  The financial impact of these
regulations on these projects is not currently  estimable.  We do not anticipate
that the compliance with these  regulations  will have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or net cash flows.

PSE&G Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation Program

PSE&G is currently working with the NJDEP under a program (Remediation  Program)
to assess, investigate and, if necessary,  remediate environmental conditions at
PSE&G's former  manufactured  gas plant (MGP) sites. To date, 38 sites have been
identified.  The  Remediation  Program is  periodically  reviewed and revised by
PSE&G based on regulatory requirements,  experience with the Remediation Program
and available remediation  technologies.  The long-term costs of the Remediation
Program cannot be reasonably estimated, but experience to date indicates that at
least $20  million  per year could be  incurred  over a period of about 30 years
since  inception  of the  program  in 1988 and that the  overall  cost  could be
material. The costs for this remediation effort are recovered through the SBC.

At September  30, 2002 and December 31, 2001,  PSE&G's  estimated  liability for
remediation costs through 2004 aggregated $87 million.  Expenditures beyond 2004
cannot be reasonably estimated.

Passaic River Site

The United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA) has determined that a
stretch of the Passaic  River in the area of Newark,  New Jersey is a "facility"
within the  meaning of that term under the Federal  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response,  Compensation  and  Liability  Act of 1980 and that, to date, at least
thirteen  corporations,  including us, may be potentially  liable for performing
required  remedial actions to address potential  environmental  pollution in the
Passaic River "facility."

In a separate matter,  we and certain of our predecessors  conducted  industrial
operations  at  properties  within the Passaic River  facility.  The  operations
included  one  operating  electric  generating  station,  one former  generating
station, and four former MGPs. Our costs to clean up former MGPs are recoverable
from utility customers under the SBC. We have contracted to sell the site of the
former generating site,  contingent upon approval by state regulatory  agencies,
to a third party that would release and  indemnify us for claims  arising out of
the site. We cannot predict what action,  if any, the EPA or any third party may
take against us with respect to this matter, or in such event, what costs we may
incur to address any such claims. However, such costs may be material.

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)/New Source Review (NSR)

In January  2002,  Power  reached an  agreement  with the state and the  federal
government to resolve  allegations of  noncompliance  with federal and state NSR
regulations.  Under that  agreement,  Power will install  advanced air pollution
controls over 12 years that are expected to  significantly  reduce  emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2) particulate matter, and mercury from
its Hudson and Mercer coal burning  units.  The estimated cost of the program is
$355  million  and such  costs,  when  incurred,  will be  capitalized  as plant
additions.

Power

New Generation and Development

Power has revised its schedules for  completion of several of its projects under
development  to provide  better  sequencing  of its  construction  program  with
anticipated  market demand.  This delay will allow Power to conserve  capital in
2003 and allow it to take  advantage  of the  expected  recovery of the electric
markets and their need for capacity in 2005.

PSEG Power New York Inc.,  an indirect,  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Power,  is
developing the Bethlehem Energy Center, a 763 MW combined-cycle power plant that
will replace the 380 MW Albany,  NY Steam Station.  Total costs for this project
are  expected to be  approximately  $465 million  with  expenditures  to date of
approximately  $114  million.  Construction  began  in 2002  with  the  expected
completion date in 2005, at which time the existing station will be retired.

Power is constructing a 1,218 MW combined cycle generation plant at Linden,  New
Jersey with costs estimated at  approximately  $694 million and  expenditures to
date of  approximately  $520  million.  Completion is expected in 2005, at which
time 451 MW of existing generating capacity will be retired.

Power is constructing through indirect,  wholly-owned subsidiaries,  two natural
gas-fired combined cycle electric generation plants in Waterford,  Ohio (821 MW)
and  Lawrenceburg,  Indiana (1,096 MW) at an estimated  aggregate  total cost of
$1.2  billion.   Total   expenditures  to  date  on  these  projects  have  been
approximately  $1.1 billion.  The required  estimated equity investment in these
projects is approximately  $400 million,  with the remainder being financed with
non-recourse  bank  financing.  As of  September  30, 2002,  approximately  $247
million of equity has been invested in these projects.  In connection with these
projects,  ER&T has entered into a five-year tolling agreement pursuant to which
it is obligated to purchase the output of these  facilities.  The  agreement may
expire if the current  financing is repaid within five years.  Additional equity
contributions  may be required by Power to the project  company if the  purchase
price of  electricity  under this  contract,  which will be determined  prior to
commercial  operations,  results  in  revenues  that are less than the  required
payments  under  the bank  financing.  Based on  current  market  prices,  it is
anticipated that additional equity contributions will be required. The Waterford
facility is currently  scheduled to achieve  commercial  operation in June 2003.
The Lawrenceburg facility is currently scheduled to achieve commercial operation
in December 2003.

Power has entered into an agreement to purchase  Wisvest-Connecticut  LLC, which
holds  two  electric  generating  stations  in  Connecticut,  at a cost  of $220
million.  The agreement also calls for purchase  price  adjustments of up to $20
million  for  various  expenditures  made prior to  closing,  as well as closing
adjustments for fuel and inventory.  The coal, oil, and gas-fired  plants have a
total  capacity  of 1,019 MW. The  transaction  is  subject  to various  Federal
approvals.  The transfer of the two stations triggered the Connecticut  Transfer
Act, which requires the commencement of any necessary remedial activities within
three years of the transfer of the  property.  While the cost to comply with the
Transfer Act to clean up former petroleum coke operations at one of the stations
is still unknown,  estimated  costs are between $10 million and $20 million.  No
assurances  can  be  given  as  to  the  ultimate  remediation  costs  at  these
facilities,  however  they  could be  material.  Power  expects to close on this
acquisition  in the  fourth  quarter  of  2002,  subsequent  to  Federal  Energy
Regulatory  Commission (FERC) approval and Power's  performance based testing of
the units.

                            (UNAUDITED) -- Continued

Power also has contracts with outside parties to purchase  upgraded turbines for
the Salem  Nuclear  Generating  Station  Units 1 and 2 and to purchase  upgraded
turbines  and to purchase a power  uprate for Hope Creek  Generating  Station to
increase  its  generating  capacity.   The  contracts  are  subject  to  nuclear
regulatory  approval  and are  currently  scheduled  to be completed by 2004 for
Salem  Unit 1 and Hope  Creek  and  2006 for  Salem  Unit 2.  Power's  aggregate
estimated costs for these projects are $210 million.

Power has commitments to purchase gas turbines and/or other services to meet its
current plans to develop additional  generating  capacity.  The aggregate amount
due under these commitments is approximately  $480 million,  approximately  $370
million of which is  included  in  estimated  costs for the  projects  discussed
above. The approximate $110 million remaining relates to obligations to purchase
hardware and services that have not been designated to any specific projects. If
Power does not contract to satisfy its  commitment  relating to the $110 million
in  obligations  by July  2003,  it will be subject  to  penalties  of up to $24
million.

Minimum Fuel Purchase Requirements

Power  has  several  long-term   purchase   contracts  with  uranium  suppliers,
converters,  enrichers  and  fabricators  to meet the currently  projected  fuel
requirements  for Salem  and Hope  Creek.  Power's  remaining  minimum  purchase
requirement  for 2002 under these  contracts is  approximately  $20 million.  On
average,  Power has various multi-year  requirements-based  purchase commitments
that total  approximately  $100 million per year to meet  Salem-Hope  Creek fuel
needs.  Power has been advised by Exelon that it has similar purchase  contracts
to satisfy the fuel requirements of Peach Bottom.

Power  uses coal for its  fossil  fueled  electric  generation  stations.  Power
purchases  coal through  various  contracts  and in the spot  market.  The total
minimum   purchase   requirements   included  in  these   contracts   amount  to
approximately $72 million through 2003.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal

Under the Nuclear  Waste  Policy Act of 1982  (NWPA),  as  amended,  the Federal
government has entered into contracts with the operators of nuclear power plants
for  transportation  and  ultimate  disposal of the spent fuel.  To pay for this
service, the nuclear plant owners were required to contribute to a Nuclear Waste
Fund  at a rate  of one  mil per  kWh of  nuclear  generation,  subject  to such
escalation  as may be  required  to assure  full cost  recovery  by the  Federal
government.  These costs were being recovered  through the BGS contract  through
July 2002.  Payments  made to the United  States  Department of Energy (DOE) for
disposal costs are based on nuclear  generation and are included in Energy Costs
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Under the NWPA,  the DOE was  required to begin taking  possession  of the spent
nuclear  fuel by no later  than  1998.  The DOE has  announced  that it does not
expect a facility to be available  earlier than 2010. Exelon has advised us that
it had signed an agreement  with the DOE  applicable to Peach Bottom under which
Exelon would be reimbursed for costs resulting from the DOE's delay in accepting
spent  nuclear fuel.  The agreement  allows Exelon to reduce the charges paid to
the Nuclear  Waste Fund to reflect  costs  reasonably  incurred due to the DOE's
delay.  Past and future  expenditures  associated  with Peach Bottom's  recently
completed  on-site dry storage  facility would be eligible for this reduction in
future DOE fees.  Under this  agreement,  our portion of Peach Bottom's  Nuclear
Waste Fund fees have been reduced by  approximately  $18 million  through August
2002 at which  point the  credits  were fully  utilized  and covered the cost of
Exelon's  storage  facility.  For  additional  information,  see Note 2.  Recent
Accounting Pronouncements.

In 2000,  a group of eight  utilities  filed a petition  against DOE in the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh  Circuit,  seeking to set aside the receipt of
credits  by Exelon out of the  Nuclear  Waste  Fund as  stipulated  in the Peach
Bottom  agreement.  On  September  24,  2002 the U.S.  Court of Appeals  for the
Eleventh  Circuit,  issued an opinion upholding the challenge by the petitioners
regarding the settlement agreement's compensation provisions. Under the terms of


                                       18

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the  agreement,  DOE and Exelon  Generation  are  required  to meet and  discuss
alternative funding sources for the settlement  credits.  The agreement provides
that if such negotiations are unsuccessful, the agreement will be null and void.
Any payments  required by Power  resulting from a disallowance of the previously
reduced fees would be included in Energy Costs in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

In February  2002,  President Bush announced that Yucca Mountain in Nevada would
be the permanent  disposal  facility for nuclear  wastes.  On April 8, 2002, the
Governor of Nevada submitted his veto to the sitting decision.  On July 9, 2002,
Congress  affirmed  the  President's  decision.  The DOE must still  license and
construct  the facility.  No assurances  can be given as to the final outcome of
this matter.

Energy Holdings

Global

      Argentina

Global has certain  obligations  that are likely to occur if certain projects in
Argentina  continue to default on their debt and  performance  obligations.  The
estimated amount to cover this exposure is $7 million and has been recorded as a
component of general and administrative operating expenses.

Under  certain  circumstances,  Global  could be  obligated  to settle its share
(approximately  $26  million)  of a  project  loan for  EDELAP  should it or the
majority  owner of the  project,  take  certain  actions  including  forcing  or
permitting  certain  loan  parties  to  declare  bankruptcy.  In  addition,  the
guarantee  can be triggered by  transferring  the shares of certain loan parties
without  lender  consent.  Breach  of this  transfer  covenant  can be  cured by
delivering  certain pledge agreements  relating to the ownership of loan parties
to the lenders.  Global could also be liable for any incremental  direct damages
arising from the breach of these covenants.  Given the likely cure of any breach
by the project sponsors,  such a contingent  obligation has a low probability of
being  triggered,  and therefore no provision has been made in our  Consolidated
Financial Statements.

      California

In May 2001,  GWF Energy LLC (GWF Energy),  a joint venture  between  Global and
Harbinger GWF LLC entered into a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the
California  Department of Water Resources (CDWR) to provide approximately 340 MW
of electric  capacity to  California  from three new natural  gas-fired  peaking
plants, the Hanford, Henrietta and Tracy Peaker Plants.

On August 22,  2002,  negotiations  between GWF Energy and the Public  Utilities
Commission  of the  State of  California  (CPUC)  and the  State  of  California
Electricity  Oversight Board  (collectively the California  Parties) relating to
complaints  filed with FERC under  Section 206 of the Federal Power Act resulted
in the  execution of (i) an amended and  restated PPA that has been  affirmed by
the CPUC as "just  and  reasonable"  and (ii) a  settlement  agreement  with the
California  Parties,  the Governor of the State of California  and the People of
California  by and through the Attorney  General.  In addition,  the  California
Parties withdrew with prejudice their FERC complaints against GWF Energy.

The Hanford and  Henrietta  Peaker  Plants were  completed in August 2001 and in
June 2002,  respectively,  and the Tracy Peaker Plant, a 166 MW facility, is now
under construction.  The commercial operations date deadline of the Tracy Peaker
Plant has been  extended  to July 1, 2003 under the  amended  and  restated  PPA
discussed   above.   Total  project  cost  for  these  plants  is  estimated  at

approximately  $345  million.  Global's  permanent  equity  investment  in these
plants,  including  contingencies,  is not expected to exceed $150 million after
completion  of project  financing,  which is currently  expected to occur in the
first  quarter of 2003.  In the event  financing  does not occur,  our ownership
interest  in these  plants  could  increase  to  approximately  85% of the total
project costs,  noted above. Our current ownership  interest in this project was
74% as of September  30, 2002.  For a  description  of turbine loans and working
capital loans from Global to GWF Energy pending completion of project financing,
see Note 12. Related-Party Transactions.

      Chile

Global owns  SAESA,  a group of  companies  that  consists of four  distribution
companies  and  one  transmission  company  that  provide  electric  service  to
customers in southern  Chile.  SAESA has a $150  million loan  facility in place
that had an  original  maturity  date of October  18,  2002 and is recorded as a
component of Commercial Paper and Loans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
September  30, 2002.  The  principal  payment was not made as scheduled  and the
lending  group has agreed not to declare  any payment  defaults or exercise  any
remedies  with regard to that loan before  November 8, 2002. A term sheet for an
extension  of the loan to April 2003 has been  agreed to and is  expected  to be
finalized by November 8, 2002. We expect to refinance this loan facility  during
this  extended  period.  No assurances  can be given that the extension  will be
granted and that other refinancing options will be available in a timely manner.

      Peru

In  December  2001,  Global  acquired  an  interest  in  Electroandes,  a 183 MW
hydroelectric  facility in Peru.  Part of the purchase price was financed with a
$100 million one year bridge loan maturing in December  2002.  The loan facility
provides  that the  maturity  date may be  extended  for six  months if  certain
conditions are met. No assurances can be given that the loan will be extended.

      India

Energy Holdings has a 20% interest in a 330 MW  Naphtha/natural  gas fired plant
(PPN) in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Energy Holdings' investment exposure in
this  facility is  approximately  $44  million.  Power from the facility is sold
under a long-term power purchase agreement with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board
(TNEB) which sells the power to retail end user customers. The TNEB has not been
able to make full payment to the plant for the purchase of energy under contract
due to its overall poor liquidity situation.  The current past due receivable at
the  project  company  is  approximately  $55  million,  our  share  of which is
approximately $11 million.

      Poland

In June 2002,  Global  completed its acquisition of a 35% interest in the 590 MW
(electric) and 618 MW (thermal) coal-fired Skawina CHP Plant (Skawina),  located
in Poland and in June 2002  increased  its ownership  interest to  approximately
50%. The transaction  includes the obligation to purchase  additional  shares in
2004 that will bring  Global's  aggregate  interest in Skawina to  approximately
75%. Skawina supplies electricity to three local distribution companies and heat
mainly to the city of Krakow, under annual one-year contracts.  The sale is part
of the Polish Government's energy privatization program. Global has expended $31
million during 2002 for its approximately  50% ownership  interest and the total
equity investment is expected to be approximately $44 million.

      Tunisia

Global owns a 60% interest in Carthage  Power Company  (CPC), a 471 MW gas-fired
combined-cycle  electric generation facility located in Rades,  Tunisia. CPC has
entered  into a  20-year  power  purchase  contract  for the sale of 100% of the

output to Societe  Tunisienne de l' Electricite  et du Gaz (STEG).  The contract
called for the plant to be  operational  by November 24, 2001,  however,  due to
delays in construction,  this deadline was not met. STEG has declared that it is
entitled to liquidated  damages at the rate of $67 thousand a day since November
24, 2001 in accordance  with the terms of the power  purchase  contract.  CPC is
contesting  STEG's claim and the two parties are currently under  negotiation to
settle this dispute. The facility was built by Alstom Centrales Energetiques SA,
(Alstom)  an  independent  contractor,   who  was  also  obligated  to  complete
construction  by  September 3, 2001.  CPC believes it is entitled to  liquidated
damages from Alstom in amounts  greater than the claims by STEG. Such liquidated
damages are secured by letters of credit totaling $30 million.

Note 7. Financial Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management

Our  operations  are exposed to market risks from  changes in commodity  prices,
foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  interest rates and equity prices that could
affect our results of operations and financial condition. We manage our exposure
to these market risks through our regular  operating  and  financing  activities
and,  when deemed  appropriate,  hedge these risks through the use of derivative
financial  instruments.  We use the term  hedge to mean a strategy  designed  to
manage  risks of  volatility  in prices or rate  movements  on  certain  assets,
liabilities or  anticipated  transactions  by creating a  relationship  in which
gains or losses on derivative  instruments  are expected to  counterbalance  the
losses or gains on the assets,  liabilities or anticipated  transactions exposed
to such market risks.  We use derivative  instruments as risk  management  tools
consistent with our business plans and prudent business practices and for energy
trading purposes.

Energy Trading Contracts

Power  maintains a strategy of entering  into trading  positions to optimize the
value of its  portfolio  of  generation  assets and its  electric and gas supply
obligations.  Power does not engage in the practice of simultaneous  trading for
the purpose of increasing  trading volume or revenue.  Power engages in physical
and financial  transactions in the electricity wholesale markets and executes an
overall risk management strategy to mitigate the effects of adverse movements in
the  fuel  and   electricity   markets.   Power   actively   trades  energy  and
energy-related products, including electricity,  natural gas, electric capacity,
fixed transmission  rights, coal and emission  allowances,  in the spot, forward
and futures markets,  primarily in Pennsylvania-New  Jersey-Maryland  Power Pool
(PJM),  and  electricity  in the Super  Region,  which extends from Maine to the
Carolinas  and the  Atlantic  Coast to Indiana and natural gas in the  producing
region,  the Henry Hub Basin, as well as the Super Region.  These contracts also
involve financial transactions including swaps, options and futures.

These  contracts  are recorded  under  Emerging  Issues Task Force (EITF) 98-10,
"Accounting  for  Contracts  Involved  in  Energy  Trading  and Risk  Management
Activities"  (EITF 98-10) which requires these contracts to be  marked-to-market
with the resulting  realized and unrealized gains and losses included in current
earnings.  In prior periods Power  disclosed gains and losses related to certain
activities within its trading segment. Commencing with Power's change in segment
reporting  discussed in Note 9. Financial  Information by Business Segments,  we
have excluded certain  transactions,  such as firm transmission rights and Basic
Gas Supply Service (BGSS) results, from this table and solely report those gains
and losses on  transactions  accounted for pursuant to EITF 98-10.  There was no
change in Power's  margins,  net income or cash flows as a result of this change
in  presentation.  Prior  periods  have been  reclassified  to  conform  to this
presentation.

For the three months and nine months ended  September 30, 2002,  Power  recorded
net margins of $9 million and $36 million, respectively, as shown below:

</TABLE>

Power routinely enters into exchange-traded futures and options transactions for
electricity   and   natural   gas  as   part  of  its   operations.   Generally,
exchange-traded futures contracts require deposit of margin cash, the amount of
which is subject  to change  based on market  movement  and in  accordance  with
exchange  rules.  The amount of the margin deposits as of September 30, 2002 was
approximately $9 million.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Commodity Contracts

The  availability  and price of energy  commodities  are subject to fluctuations
from  factors  such as weather,  environmental  policies,  changes in supply and
demand,  state and federal regulatory policies and other events. To reduce price
risk caused by market fluctuations,  Power enters into forwards,  futures, swaps
and options with approved  counterparties to hedge its anticipated demand. These
contracts,  in conjunction with owned electric generation capacity, are designed
to cover estimated wholesale electric customer commitments.

In February 2002, New Jersey  conducted an auction to identify energy  suppliers
for the BGS of the State's  regulated  distribution  utilities  for the one-year
period  beginning on August 1, 2002.  Power did not participate  directly in the
auction  but  agreed  to  supply  power  to  several  of  the  direct   bidders.
Subsequently,  a portion of the contracts  with those bidders was  reassigned to
Power.  Therefore,  for a limited  portion of the New Jersey retail load,  Power
will be a direct supplier to one non-affiliated utility.

In order to hedge a portion of Power's  forecasted  energy purchases to meet its
electric supply  requirements,  Power entered into forward  purchase  contracts,
futures,  options and swaps.  Power has also forecasted the energy delivery from
its generating stations based on the forward price curve movement of energy and,
as a result,  entered into swaps,  options and futures transactions to hedge the
price  of gas to meet  its gas  purchases  requirements  for  generation.  These
transactions  qualified  for  hedge  accounting  treatment  under  SFAS No.  133
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133). As of
September  30,  2002,  the fair  value of these  hedges  were $17  million  with
offsetting  charges  to  Other   Comprehensive   Income  (OCI)  of  $10  million
(after-tax). These hedges will mature through 2003.

Also, prior to May 2002, PSE&G had entered into gas forwards,  futures,  options
and  swaps to hedge its  forecasted  requirements  for  natural  gas,  which was
required under an agreement with the BPU in 2001. Effective with the transfer of
PSE&G's gas  contracts to Power on May 1, 2002,  Power also  acquired all of the
derivatives   entered  into  by  PSE&G.  Power  accounts  for  these  derivative
instruments  pertaining to  residential  customers in a similar manner to PSE&G.
Gains or losses from these  derivatives will be recovered from customers as part
of the  monthly  billing  to  PSE&G.  Derivatives  relating  to  commercial  and
industrial  customers  will be accounted for in  accordance  with SFAS 133 where
appropriate. Gains or losses on these derivatives are deferred and reported as a
component of OCI. There were no ineffective  hedges. The accumulated OCI will be
reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged  transaction  affects
earnings.  As of September 30, 2002,  Power had  approximately  328 MMBTU of gas
forwards,  futures,  options and swaps to hedge forecasted  requirements  with a
fair value of  approximately  $7 million.  As of December  31, 2001,  PSE&G had
approximately  330 MMBTU of gas  forwards,  futures,  options and swaps to hedge
forecasted  requirements with a fair value of approximately  $(137) million. The
maximum term of these contracts is approximately one year.

Power also enters into certain other  contracts which are derivatives but do not
qualify for hedge  accounting  under SFAS 133, nor are they classified as energy
trading contracts under EITF 98-10. Most of these contracts are option contracts
on gas  purchases  for  generation  requirements  that do not  qualify for hedge
accounting.  Therefore,  the  changes in fair market  value of these  derivative
contracts  are  recorded in the income  statement  at the end of each  reporting
period.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2002,  Power recorded
gains (losses) on these contracts of $(6) million and $24 million, respectively,
as shown below:

Interest Rates

We are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of
business.  Our policy is to manage  interest  rate risk through the use of fixed
rate debt,  floating rate debt,  interest rate derivatives.  As of September 30,
2002,  a  hypothetical  10% change in market  interest  rates would  result in a
consolidated  change  of  $12  million  in  annual  interest  costs  related  to
short-term  and floating  rate debt  consisting  of $2 million,  $3 million,  $3
million and $4 million at PSEG, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings, respectively.

We  construct  a  hypothetical  swap to  mirror  all the  critical  terms of the
underlying debt and utilize  regression  analysis to assess the effectiveness of
the actual swap at inception and on an ongoing  basis.  The  assessment  will be
done periodically to ensure the swaps continue to be effective.  PSEG determines
the fair value of interest rate swaps through counterparty valuations,  internal
valuations  and the  Bloomberg  swap  valuation  function.  There  have  been no
material  changes in the  techniques or models used in the valuation of interest
rate swaps during the periods presented. There is minimal impact of counterparty
credit risk on the fair value of the hedges since our policies  require that our
counterparties have investment grade credit ratings.

We have  entered into  interest  rate swaps to lock in fixed  interest  rates on
certain of our construction  loans to hedge forecasted future interest payments.
We  have  elected  to  use  the  Hypothetical   Derivative   Method  to  measure
ineffectiveness of the hedges as described under Derivative Implementation Group
(DIG) Issue No. G7.

Ineffectiveness  may occur if the actual draw down of the debt and the  notional
amount of the swap during the  construction  phase are different.  The amount of
ineffectiveness,  if any, is  recorded  in earnings at the end of the  reporting
period.  The impact of  ineffectiveness  on net income should be minimal because
the  interest  rate  swaps  and the  underlying  debt  are  indexed  to the same
benchmark interest rate. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations should be offset.
The amount of ineffectiveness, if any, is recorded in earnings at the end of the
reporting period.

The following  table shows  details of the interest  rate swaps at PSEG,  PSE&G,
Power  and  Energy  Holdings  and  their  associated  values  that  were open at

Global holds investments in various  generation  facilities in the United States
that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, therefore, are
not consolidated in Global's financial  statements.  Global holds a 50% indirect
ownership in two investments  located in Texas and a 50% direct ownership in one
investment  in  Hawaii  (collectively  the  investees),  which  hold  US  Dollar
denominated debt with variable  interest  payments tied to LIBOR rates. In order
to lock in fixed  interest  rates on such debt,  the investees each entered into
interest  rate  swaps to hedge  the  value  of the  cash  flows of their  future
interest  payments.  As of September 30, 2002, the aggregate notional balance of
these swaps was $307 million  (Global's  share was $154  million),  the weighted
average  fixed  interest  rate paid was  6.9%,  and  Global's  share of the loss
position of these  swaps was $15  million  and is  recorded  as a  reduction  to
Long-Term  Investments.  These swaps were  designated  as hedges for  accounting
purposes and, as a result,  changes in the fair value of the hedge were recorded
in OCI.

The fair value of interest  rate swaps,  designated  and  effective as cash flow
hedges, are initially recorded in OCI.  Reclassification  of unrealized gains or
losses  on cash flow  hedges of  variable-rate  debt  instruments  from OCI into
earnings  occurs as interest  payments  are accrued on the debt  instrument  and
generally offsets the change in the interest accrued on the underlying  variable

rate debt.  We  estimate  reclassifying  $18  million  of losses  from cash flow
hedges, including our pro-rata share from our equity method investees,  from OCI
to our  Consolidated  Statements  of Operations  over the next 12 months.  As of
September 30, 2002, there was a $67 million balance remaining in the Accumulated
Other  Comprehensive  Loss  account,  as indicated  in the table above.  For the
quarter and nine months ended  September  30, 2002,  losses of $3 million and $9
million, respectively, were reclassified from OCI to our Consolidated Statements
of Operations.  The ineffective portion of these interest rate swaps is recorded
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the quarter and nine months
ended  September  30,  2002,  we  recorded  losses  of  less  than  $1  million,
respectively,  after taxes and minority interests, due to the ineffectiveness of
such interest rate swaps.

Equity Securities

During the nine month period ended  September 30, 2002,  Resources  recognized a
loss for  investment  where there is not a liquid  market of  approximately  $26
million pre-tax,  which is included in Operating  Revenues.  As of September 30,
2002,  Resources had investments in leveraged buyout funds of approximately  $91
million,  of which $21 million was comprised of public securities with available
market prices and $70 million was comprised of non-publicly  traded  securities.
Comparably,  as of December 31, 2001,  Resources  had  investments  in leveraged
buyout funds of approximately  $130 million,  of which $35 million was comprised
of public  securities with available market prices and $95 million was comprised
of non-publicly traded securities.

Foreign Currencies

As of September 30, 2002,  net foreign  currency  devaluations  have reduced the
reported amount of our total Stockholder's Equity by $324 million, of which $212
million and $105 million were caused by the  devaluation  of the Brazilian  Real
and the Chilean Peso,  respectively.  For the net foreign currency  devaluations
for the quarter and nine months ended  September 30, 2002 and 2001, see Note 10.
Comprehensive Income.

In May 2002, Energy Holdings purchased foreign currency call options in order to
hedge its average 2002 earnings  denominated in Brazilian  Reais and in Peruvian
Nuevo Sols for the remainder of 2002. As of September 30, 2002, there were three
call  options  outstanding  on the  Brazilian  Real,  one expiring in each month
through December 2002. The aggregate notional and fair values of these contracts
were approximately $4 million and $1 million,  respectively, as of September 30,
2002.  In addition,  there were three call options  outstanding  on the Peruvian
Nuevo Sol, one  expiring in each month  through  December  2002.  The  aggregate
notional value of these contracts was  approximately  $7 million as of September
30,  2002.  The  fair  value of  those  options  as of  September  30,  2002 was
immaterial.  These options are not  considered  hedges for  accounting  purposes
under  SFAS 133 and,  as a result,  changes  in their  fair  value are  recorded
directly to earnings.  Global recorded a gain of $1 million related to Brazilian
and Peruvian option contracts that expired during the third quarter of 2002.

The fair value of foreign currency derivatives, designated and effective as cash
flow hedges, are initially recorded in OCI. Reclassification of unrealized gains
or losses on cash flow hedges from OCI into earnings  generally  occurs when the
hedged  transaction is recorded in earnings and generally  offsets the change in
the value of the hedged item.  We estimate  reclassifying  $1 million of foreign
exchange  gains from foreign  currency cash flow hedges,  including our pro-rata
share from our equity method investees,  from OCI to our Consolidated Statements
of  Operations  over the next 12 months.  For the quarter and nine months  ended
September 30, 2002, losses  transferred from OCI to our Consolidated  Statements
of Operations were less than $1 million.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The estimated fair values were determined using the market  quotations or values
of instruments  with similar terms,  credit  ratings,  remaining  maturities and
redemptions at September 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.

As of  October  30,  2002,  the fair value of the  long-term  debt for Power and
Energy Holdings had declined in value to an estimated fair value of $3.1 billion
and $2.1 billion, respectively. The capital markets have experienced a period of
unusual  volitility,  especially for the energy sector.  While we cannot predict
when the markets  will  stabilize,  we believe the current  volatility  yielding
discounted trading values for our debt will subside.

Participating Equity Units

In  September  2002,  we issued 9.2  million  Participating  Units with a stated
amount  of $50  per  unit.  These  securities  are  reflected  as  subsidiaries'
preferred securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Each unit consists of a
6.25% trust preferred security due 2007 having a liquidation value of $50, and a
stock purchase  contract  obligating  the  purchasers to purchase  shares of our
common stock in an amount equal to $50 on November 16, 2005. In exchange for the
obligations under the purchase  contract,  the purchasers will receive quarterly
contract  adjustment  payments at the annual rate of 4.00% until such date.  The
number of new shares issued will depend upon the average closing price per share
of our common stock for the 20 consecutive trading days ending the third trading
day immediately  preceding  November 16, 2005. Based on the formula described in
the  purchase  contract,  at that  time we will  issue  between  11,429,139  and
13,714,967 shares of our common stock. Prior to such conversion,  the securities
will  be  accounted  for  under  the  Treasury  Stock  method  for  purposes  of
calculating fully diluted earnings per share.  These securities will be dilutive
to earnings  per share to the extent that the market  price of our common  stock
exceeds $40.248.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Participating Units were
$446.2 million.

</TABLE>

The increase in the  effective  tax rate,  for the quarter and nine months ended
September  30, 2002,  as compared to the same periods for 2001, is primarily due
to 2001  adjustments  as a result the 1994-1996 IRS audit upon filing our actual
tax return for the year 2000.

Note 9. Financial Information by Business Segment

Power's  business has evolved during 2002.  With the transfer of the BGSS (i.e.,
natural gas supply requirements  contact) contract to Power and the commencement
of the new BGS Contracts with wholesale electric suppliers, Power's business has
become a fully integrated wholesale energy supply business.  As a result of that
evolution of Power's  business,  trading  activities  changed from a stand-alone
operation to a function  that has become  fully  integrated  with the  wholesale
energy  supply  business,  and  primarily  serves to optimize  the value of that
business.   Therefore,  upon  review  and  in  accordance  with  SFAS  No.  131,
"Disclosures  About  Segments of an Enterprise  and Related  Information"  (SFAS
131),  we have  determined  that Power's  generation  and trading  components no
longer  meet  the  definition  of  separate  operating  segments  for  financial
reporting  purposes and,  effective with this filing,  we have reported  Power's
financial  position and results of operations as one segment.  All prior periods
have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Note 12. Related Party Transactions

Loans to TIE

Global  and  its  partner,  Panda  Energy  International,  Inc.,  through  Texas
Independent  Energy,  L.P.  (TIE), a 50/50 joint venture,  owns and operates two
electric  generation  facilities in Texas. As of September 30, 2002 and December
31, 2001,  Global's  investments in the TIE partnership  include $74 million and
$165 million, respectively, of loans that earn interest at an annual rate of 12%
that are  expected  to be  repaid  over the next 10  years.  Cash  payments  are
currently  being  received  from the projects for the full amount of interest on
such loans to TIE.  However,  only 50% of the interest  income is  recognized in
earnings, representative of the portion of the project not owned by Global.

Loans to GWF Energy

GWF Energy, a joint venture between Global and Harbinger GWF LLC is constructing
three new peaking plants.  Global's  permanent equity investment in GWF Energy's
plants,  including  contingencies,  is not expected to exceed $150 million after
completion  of project  financing,  which is currently  expected to occur in the
first quarter of 2003. Pending completion of project financing,  Global provided
GWF Energy approximately $98 million of secured loans to finance the purchase of
turbines.  The turbine  loans bear interest at rates ranging from 12% to 15% per
annum and are  payable  in  installments  beginning  May 31,  2002,  with  final
maturity no later than December 31, 2002. As of September 30, 2002,  the secured
loans to finance  the  purchase  of turbines  was $87  million.  Global has also
provided  GWF  Energy  up to $74  million  of  working  capital  loans  to  fund
construction  costs  pending  completion of project  financing.  Such loans earn
interest at 20% per annum and are  convertible  into equity at Global's  option.
During the third quarter of 2002,  Global  converted $55 million of such working
capital loans to equity,  which  increased  Global's  ownership of GWF Energy to
74%, and reduced the working capital loan balance to $19 million as of September
30, 2002.  Since the  partnership  agreement  stipulates  that the condition for
control is ownership of 75% of the voting stock, our investment in GWF Energy is
recorded in accordance  with the equity method.  Harbinger GWF LLC has the right
to buy back from Global up to one-half of the reduction of its equity  ownership
in GWF Energy from the 50% ownership level. Such right terminates at the earlier
of project  financing or June 30, 2003. The loan structures were put in place to
provide  Global with a  preferential  cash and  earnings  distribution  from the
project  similar  to our  subordinated  loans  for  our  Texas  facility.  For a
discussion of the commercial  dates of operation and issues of the  construction
process matters with respect to these three plants,  see Note 6. Commitments and
Contingent Liabilities.

For the three and nine month periods ended  September 30, 2002,  excluding these
charges, earnings were $207 million or $1.00 per share and $535 million or $2.59
per  share,  respectively.  Comparable  earnings  for the three  and nine  month
periods  ended  September 30, 2001 were $175 million or $0.84 per share and $584
million or $2.80 per share, respectively.

The increase in earnings,  excluding the charges  discussed above, for the three
month  period  ended  September  30,  2002 as compared to the same period in the
prior year is primarily due to higher BGS margins at Power due to its successful
participation  as an  indirect  supplier  of energy to New  Jersey's  utilities,
including PSE&G,  involved in New Jersey's recent basic generation service (BGS)
auction.  The BGS auction had a meaningful effect on our earnings,  particularly
since  August  1,  2002,  when the new BGS  contracts  went  into  effect.  Also
contributing to the increase were lower  Operations and Maintenance  expenses at
PSE&G, increased earnings from Global, primarily due to the acquisitions late in
2001, increased earnings at RGE, a Brazilian electric  distribution  company, as
well as the  commencement  of  operations at the  generation  facility in Rades,
Tunisia (Rades) and higher Net Investment Gains (Losses) in Resources' leveraged
buyout funds.

<PAGE>

The  decrease in  earnings,  excluding  the  charges  discussed  above,  for the
nine-month  period  ended  September  30, 2002 as compared to the same period in
2001 resulted  primarily  from lower  margins at PSE&G and higher  Operation and
Maintenance  expense at Power.  These decreases were partially  offset by higher
BGS margins at Power.

      and the adoption of SFAS No. 133  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments
      and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133) in 2001.

(D)   Excludes  after-tax charges  previously  presented the summary table of $3
      million  or $0.01 per share  and $535  million  or $2.59 per share for the
      three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2002, respectively.

Future Outlook

We expect to meet our  revised  earnings-per-share  targets for 2002 of $3.70 to
$3.90,  excluding the charges  described  above.  For 2002, Power is expected to
earn $460  million to $500  million,  PSE&G is expected to earn $175  million to
$185  million  and Energy  Holdings  is  expected  to earn $145  million to $155
million,   excluding  the  previously  discussed  charges.   Power's  successful
participation  as an  indirect  supplier  of energy to New  Jersey's  utilities,
including  PSE&G,  in New  Jersey's  recent BGS  auction is  expected  to have a
meaningful  effect on our earnings for the remainder of the year and should help
to partially  offset the lack of earnings  contributions  from Energy  Holdings'
investments in Argentina.  The fourth quarter is expected to be strong, as Power
benefits from its fixed price BGS contracts while it is able to source energy at
economically attractive prices during this period of low demand.

While Global realized substantial growth in 2001,  significant  challenges which
began  developing  during the fourth  quarter of 2001 have  continued into 2002.
These challenges  include the Argentine  economic,  political and social crisis,
the soft power market in Texas,  recent  developments in India and the worldwide
economic  downturn.  The financial  effects of several of these  challenges were
recorded  in the  second  quarter  of 2002.  Also,  we have  recently  reached a
settlement  with AES  related  to our  investments  held for sale in  Argentina,
receiving  $15 million in October 2002 and  receiving $15 million in notes which
mature on various dates ending in July 2003.  Similarly,  we have  completed the
sale of our investment in Tanir Bavi at its reduced  carrying  value,  receiving
proceeds of  approximately  $45 million in October 2002.  Going forward,  Global
will limit its  spending to  contractual  commitments  and refocuse its strategy
from one of  accelerated  growth to one that places  emphasis on increasing  the
efficiency and returns of its existing assets.

We have  taken  significant  steps to  address  the  pressures  in the  volatile
financial marketplace. We issued $460 million of participating equity preference
units, a mandatorily  convertible  preferred security,  in September 2002 and we
continue to issue approximately $80 million of equity on an annual basis through
our dividend  reinvestment  program.  In addition to these equity issuances,  we
have further trimmed our capital  expenditure  program by recently  revising the
timeline for the completion of three generating station  construction  projects,
which is in addition to previous reductions at Global and Resources.  After this
year,  which is an end of a peak period of capital  expenditures,  our  internal
cash generation will significantly exceed our capital and dividend requirements.
In addition,  we would also consider an additional equity issuance to accelerate
the further strengthening of our balance sheet.

Looking  ahead,  our  business  fundamentals  remain  strong and we  continue to
produce  solid  cash  flows.  However,  several of the  assumptions  in our 2003
planning   process  have  changed  in  this   evolving   economic   environment.
Specifically,  two factors,  increased pension expense due to the erosion of the
value of the  investments in our pension plans,  and the need to improve capital
structures in this volatile  marketplace,  are currently being  considered as we
develop our 2003  business  plan. As a result of these  factors,  we will likely
reduce our previous 2003 earnings target of $4.00 to $4.20.  However, even if we
issued  equity,  we expect our 2003  earnings per share to be comparable to this
year's results due to our strong business fundamentals.

Other  assumptions  in our 2003 business  plan are that:  Power will continue to
benefit from its  performance  as a wholesale BGS provider with the new one year
BGS contract  that began August 1, 2002 and a reasonable  outcome to next year's
contract  beginning August 1, 2003; PSE&G will have a successful  outcome to its
recently filed electric rate case seeking an approximately $250 million increase
in  electric  rates  beginning  in August  2003,  and  benefit  from more normal
weather;  Global,  with its  major  risks in  Argentina  and  India  behind  it,
significant cost-cutting measures in place and limited spending planned over the
five year planning horizon,  expects  improvements in earnings through its focus
on increasing  the return on its existing  assets;  and  Resources,  with recent
investments  and less exposure to its  investment  in the KKR  leveraged  buyout
funds,  expects to continue  to be a steady  contributor  to  earnings  and cash
flows.

Factors Affecting Future Outlook

As a result of more than 70% of our earnings,  excluding  the changes  discussed
above, coming from unregulated  businesses,  the continued changes in political,
legislative,  regulatory and economic  conditions in the many countries in which
we do  business,  the  inherent  price  volatility  of  the  commodities  in our
businesses,  and many other  factors,  it is much more  difficult to  accurately
forecast our future  earnings.  Some of the key  sensitivities  and risks of our
businesses are discussed below.

Power's  success as a BGS provider will depend,  in part, on its ability to meet
its obligations under its full requirements  contracts with the BGS suppliers in
a profitable  manner.  Power expects to accomplish this by producing energy from
its own generation and/or energy purchases in the market. Power also enters into
trading positions related to its generation  assets and supply  obligations.  To
the extent it does not hedge its obligations,  whether long or short, Power will
be  subject  to the risk of price  fluctuations  that  could  affect  its future
results,  such as increases in the price of energy  purchased to meet its supply
obligations,  the cost of fuel to generate  electricity,


                                       37
<PAGE>
the cost of  congestion  credits  that Power needs to transmit  electricity  and
other  factors.  In addition,  Power is subject to the risk of subpar  operating
performance of its fossil and nuclear  generating units. To the extent there are
unexpected outages at Power's generating facilities, changes in environmental or
nuclear  regulations  or other factors which impact the production by such units
or the ability to generate and transmit electricity in a cost-effective  manner,
it may cost us more to produce  electricity  or we may be  required  to purchase
higher cost energy to replace the energy we anticipated  producing.  These risks
can be  exacerbated  by, among other  things,  changes in demand in  electricity
usage, such as those due to extreme weather and economic conditions.

Power's future revenue  stream is also  uncertain.  Due to the timing of the New
Jersey BGS auction process,  the majority of Power's revenues for August 1, 2003
and  thereafter  cannot be accurately  predicted.  Also,  certain of Power's new
projects,  such as our investments in the Lawrenceburg and Waterford projects in
the Midwest,  the plants we are acquiring from Wisvest in  Connecticut,  and our
development  of the Bethlehem  Energy Center in New York are also subject to the
risk of changes in future  energy  prices as Power has not entered  into forward
sale contracts for the majority of their  expected  generation  capacity.  Also,
since  the  majority  of  our  generation  facilities  are  concentrated  in the
Northeast region,  changes in future energy supply and demand and energy-related
prices in this region could materially affect our results.  Also, changes in the
rules and  regulation  of these  markets  by FERC,  particularly  changes in the
ability to maintain  market  based  rates,  could have an adverse  impact on our
results.  As a result of these variables and risks, we cannot predict the impact
of these  potential  future  changes on our  forecasted  results of  operations,
financial position, or net cash flows, however such impact could be material.

In addition,  our earnings  projections assume that we will continue to optimize
the value of our portfolio of generating assets and supply  obligations  through
our energy trading operations. This will depend, in part, on our, as well as our
counterparties',  ability to maintain sufficient creditworthiness and to display
a  willingness  to  participate  in energy  trading  activities  at  anticipated
volumes.  Potential  changes in the mechanisms of conducting  trading  activity,
such as the continued availability of energy trading exchanges, could positively
or  negatively  affect  trading  volumes and  liquidity in these energy  trading
markets  compared to the  assumptions of these factors  embedded in our business
plans.  As a result of these  variables,  we cannot  predict the impact of these
potential  future  changes on our forecasted  results of  operations,  financial
position, or net cash flows, however such impact could be material.

PSE&G's  success  will be  dependent,  in  part,  on its  ability  to  obtain  a
reasonable outcome, which cannot be assured, to its recently filed electric rate
case as well as its ability to continue to recover the regulatory  assets it has
deferred  and  the  investments  it  plans  to  make  in its  electric  and  gas
transmission  and  distribution  systems.   Mitigating  this  rate  increase  to
customers are overrecoveries of the SBC and NTC and the potential securitization
of  the  expected  BGS  underrecovery.  As of  September  30,  2002,  PSE&G  has
implemented  BPU mandated rate  reductions  totaling 13.9% since August 1, 1999,
including  a 4.9% rate  reduction  effective  August 1,  2002,  which will be in
effect until July 31, 2003.  This rate reduction  reduces the Market  Transition
Charge (MTC) rate paid to Power and therefore reduces Power's revenues.

Energy Holdings' success will be dependent,  in part, on its ability to mitigate
risks  presented by its  international  strategy.  The  economic  and  political
conditions in certain countries where Global has investments  present risks that
may be different than those found in the United States including:  renegotiation
or  nullification  of  existing  contracts,   changes  in  law  or  tax  policy,
interruption  of business,  risks of  nationalization,  expropriation,  war, and
other factors.  Operations in foreign  countries  also present risks  associated
with  currency  exchange  and  convertibility,  inflation  and  repatriation  of
earnings. In some countries in which Global has interests, economic and monetary
conditions and other factors could affect  Global's  ability to convert its cash
distributions  to US Dollars or other  freely  convertible  currencies  and move
funds. Furthermore,  the central bank of any such country may have the authority
to  suspend,  restrict  or  otherwise  impose  conditions  on  foreign  exchange
transactions or to approve  distributions to foreign investors.  Although Global
generally seeks to structure power purchase  contracts and other project revenue
agreements to provide for payments to be made in, or indexed to, US Dollars or a
currency freely  convertible into US Dollars,  its ability to do so in all cases
may be limited.

The international  risks discussed above can potentially be magnified due to the
volatility of foreign  currencies.  The foreign  exchange rates of the Brazilian
Real,  Chilean  Peso and  Peruvian  Sol have  recently  weakened  due to various
political  and  economic  factors.  This  could  result in  comparatively  lower
contributions  from our  distribution  investments in US Dollar terms.  While we
still  expect  certain  of Energy  Holdings'  investments  in Latin  America  to

                                       38
<PAGE>

contribute  significantly  to our  earnings in the  future,  the  political  and
economic risks  associated with this region could have a material adverse impact
on our remaining investments in the region.

Certain of Global's  projects  are also  subject to the risk of changing  future
energy  prices,  including  its  investment  in two 1,000 MW facilities in Texas
which have performed below  expectations  due to lower energy prices than we had
anticipated,  primarily  resulting  from the  over-supply of energy in the Texas
power market.  Global  expects this trend to continue  until the 2004-2005  time
frame when market  prices are  expected  to  increase,  as older less  efficient
plants in the Texas power  market are  expected to be retired and the demand for
electricity  is expected to increase and has included these  assumptions  within
its business  plans.  However,  no assurances can be given as to the accuracy of
these  estimates and changes in these  estimates could have a material impact on
its forecasted results of operations, financial position, or net cash flows.

Energy  Holdings,  through  Resources,  also  faces  risks  with  regard  to the
creditworthiness of its  counterparties,  as well as the risk of a change in the
current tax treatment of its investments in leveraged leases.  The manifestation
of either of these risks could cause a materially adverse effect on its strategy
and its forecasted results of operations, financial position, or net cash flows.
For  discussion  of  certain  counterparties  to  these  leases  who  have  been
downgraded to below investment grade by at least one of the rating agencies, see
Item 3. Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

In  addition,  we have  exposure  to the equity  and debt  markets  through  our
substantial use of short-term financing, lower pension fund balances, the effect
of lower assumed rate of investment  returns on our pension expense,  the effect
of a  lower  discount  rate on our  pension  plan  liabilities  and  costs,  the
potential impact to Resources' investment in the KKR leveraged buyout funds, and
other equity and debt  investments  held by us.  Also,  increases in the cost of
capital,  which could result from market and lender  concerns  regarding us, our
industry, United States and international economic conditions and other factors,
could make it more difficult for us to enter into profitable investments. Recent
market  trends  could also  affect our  ability to access  capital,  potentially
impacting  both our business plans and  opportunities  as well as our liquidity.
Also,  changes in our  credit  ratings by rating  agencies  could  significantly
impact  our  access  to  capital,  cost of  capital,  ability  to meet  earnings
expectations  and  future  business  plans.  Also,  as a result of market  price
volatility,  the fair  value  of the debt of  certain  of our  subsidiaries  has
experienced significant volatility. We are also subject to credit risk. See Item
3.  Qualitative  and  Quantitative  Disclosures  about  Market  Risk for further
discussion.

Results of Operations

Operating Revenues

For the three months ended September 30, 2002,  Operating  Revenues increased by
$711 million or 44%, due  primarily to a $407 million  increase in revenues from
Power.  Also  contributing  to the increase for the three months ended September
30, 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001 were  increases  of $44 million,
$10 million and $7 million at Global, PSE&G and Resources, respectively.

Included in  Power's increase were increases of $172 million of gas revenues
relating  to its BGSS  contract  and  off-system  sales  resulting  from the Gas
Contract  transfer from PSE&G in May 2002. Also contributing to Power's increase
was a $268 million increase in electric  revenues,  primarily due to the new BGS
contracts with third party wholesale  electric  suppliers which went into effect
August 1, 2002 and  comparably  warmer  weather which were  partially  offset by
lower MTC revenues  primarily due to a 4.9% rate  reduction in August 2002 and a
2% rate reduction in August 2001. These rate reductions  reduce the MTC revenues
that PSE&G  remits to Power as part of its BGS  contract.  Also  offsetting  the
increases were lower net trading  revenues of  approximately  $23 million due to
lower  trading  volumes and prices  during the three months ended  September 30,
2002 as compared to the same period in 2001.


                                       39
<PAGE>
The increase in Operating Revenues at Global was due primarily to $31 million of
increases related to the acquisition late in the third quarter of 2001 of SAESA,
a Chilean  distribution  company  and $10  million of  increases  related to the
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2001 of Electroandes, a Peruvian generation
company.  Global's  Operating  Revenues  also  increased  $32 million due to the
generation  facility  located  in  Rades,  Tunisia  commencing  operation  via a
retroactive  commercial  operating  date in the  second  quarter  of 2002.  Also
contributing  $16 million to the  increase in revenues  was Skawina in Poland in
which we  purchased  a majority  ownership  late in the second  quarter of 2002.
Revenues  further  increased by $8 million due to improved  earnings from RGE as
new regulatory  changes allow RGE to recover from customers prior tariff charges
previously  expensed.  Partially  offsetting  these  increases was a decrease at
EDEERSA of $18 million, which reflects the ongoing economic crisis in Argentina.
There were also  decreased  earnings  totaling $9 million at our GWF  generation
facilities due to a reversal of an accounts  receivable  reserve in 2001 related
to  California  Power  exchange  pricing  in 2001 and  lower  prices  in 2002 as
compared to 2001;  and  decreased  earnings of $8 million at our TIE  generation
facilities due to lower energy prices in 2002 as compared to 2001.

The increase in Operating  Revenues  from PSE&G related to $41 million of higher
electric  transmission and distribution  revenues offset by $31 million of lower
gas distribution revenues.

The $7 million  increase at Resources was primarily  related to higher Net Gains
(Losses) on  Investments  resulting  from no net change in the carrying value of
publicly  traded and private  securities  held within the KKR  leveraged  buyout
funds in the third quarter of 2002, as compared to a $8 million loss in the same
period of 2001.

The remaining $243 million increase is due primarily to Power's BGS or commodity
revenues in August and September of 2002 not being  eliminated in  consolidation
by PSEG.  Under the BGS contract which  terminated on July 31, 2002,  Power sold
energy directly to PSE&G which in turn sold this energy to its customers.  These
revenues  were  properly  recognized  on each  company's  stand-alone  financial
statements  and  were  eliminated  when  preparing  our  consolidated  financial
statements.  For the new BGS contract  period  beginning  August 1, 2002,  Power
sells to third party suppliers and other load serving  entities (LSEs) and PSE&G
purchases the energy for its customers' needs from third party suppliers. Due to
this change in the BGS model, these revenues are no longer intercompany revenues
and therefore are not eliminated in  consolidation.  This amount would have been
approximately  $366  million for August and  September  2002,  representing  the
amount  which  PSE&G's  cost to  supply  electricity  to its  customers,  and is
partially  offset by $118 million of intercompany  eliminations  relating to the
BGSS contract between Power and PSE&G which began in May 2002.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2002,  Operating  Revenues  increased by
$373 million or 7%, due  primarily to a $422 million  increase in revenues  from
Power and $161 million from Global.  These increases were partially  offset by a
$364 million decrease in revenues from PSE&G.

For the nine months  ended  September  30,  2002,  Power's  increased  Operating
Revenues included $273 million of gas revenues relating to its BGSS contract and
off-system  sales  resulting  from the Gas Contract  transfer  from PSE&G in May
2002. Also  contributing to the increase was a $228 million increase in electric
revenues,  primarily  due to the new BGS  contracts  with third party  wholesale
electric  suppliers which went into effect August 1, 2002 and comparably  warmer
weather  which were  partially  offset by lower MTC revenues  primarily due to a
4.9% rate reduction in August 2002 and two 2% rate reductions in August 2001 and
February 2001. Also offsetting the increases were lower net trading  revenues of
approximately  $79 million due to lower  trading  volumes and prices  during the
nine months ended September 30, 2002 as compared to the same period in 2001.

The  increase  at  Global  was due  primarily  to $142  million  related  to the
acquisitions of SAESA and  Electroandes  and $32 million due to the inception of
operations at Rades, as discussed  previously.  Also contributing $16 million to
the increase in revenues was Skawina, in which we purchased a majority ownership
late in the  second  quarter  of  2002  as  discussed  above.  Revenues  further
increased at Global by $21 million due to improved earnings from RGE as a result
of the new  regulatory  changes  described  above.  Partially  offsetting  these
increases  were  decreases  in  earnings  of $18  million  at GWF Energy and $17
million at TIE as a result of lower energy prices.

The decrease in PSE&G's Operating  Revenues  primarily related to a $344 million
decrease in gas  distribution  revenues  primarily  due to  decreased  commodity
rates,  approximately  $176  million,  lower sales to  interruptible


                                       40
<PAGE>

customers,  approximately  $111 million,  lower sales volumes primarily from the
warmer  winter in 2002,  approximately  $90 million and lower  off-system  sales
revenues,  approximately  $14 million.  In addition,  electric  transmission and
distribution  revenues  decreased $20 million.  These  decreases  were partially
offset by increased gas base rates,  approximately  $43 million and higher other
operating revenues (approximately $7 million).

The remaining $154 million increase is due primarily to Power's BGS or commodity
revenues in August and September of 2002 not being  eliminated in  consolidation
by PSEG as discussed previously.  This amount would have been approximately $366
million for August and  September  2002,  representing  the amount which PSE&G's
cost to supply  electricity  to its customers,  and is partially  offset by $217
million of intercompany eliminations relating to the BGSS contract between Power
and PSE&G which began in May 2002.

Operating Expenses

Energy Costs

For the three  months ended  September  30, 2002,  Energy Costs  increased  $590
million or 104% due  primarily  to  increases of $332 million and $34 million at
Power and Global,  respectively,  partially  offset by a $17 million decrease at
PSE&G.  The  remaining  increase  in  Energy  Costs  is due  primarily  to a net
difference in intercompany eliminations of approximately $248 million, discussed
above in Operating Revenues.

Power's  increases were primarily due to increased  energy purchases for the BGS
and third party wholesale  electric  supplier  contracts of  approximately  $122
million due to higher  volumes and $197  million of increased  gas  purchases to
satisfy  Power's  BGSS  contract  and  its  fuel  needs  for  generation.   Also
contributing to the increase were approximately $43 million of increased network
transmission expenses in the Pennsylvania-New  Jersey-Maryland Power Pool (PJM).
These  increases were offset by $22 million of gains on fuel hedges,  $5 million
of reduced congestion charges due to more efficient unit scheduling by PJM and a
$3 million decrease in nuclear fuel usage.

The  increases  at Global for the three  months  ended  September  30, 2002 were
primarily  due to operating  expenses  incurred at SAESA and  Electroandes.  The
operating  expenses for the comparable  periods in 2001 did not include expenses
for Electroandes as it was purchased in the fourth quarter of 2001, and included
only a  portion  of  expenses  for SAESA as it was  purchased  late in the third
quarter of 2001.

The decrease at PSE&G primarily related to a decrease in gas costs primarily due
to lower commodity  rates,  approximately  $16 million,  which became  effective
January 9, 2002, lower revenues from interruptible customers,  approximately $12
million,  due to lower  volumes  at  lower  rates  and  lower  off-system  sales
revenues,  approximately $5 million, due to lower volumes.  These decreases were
partially  offset by increased  electric  energy costs  primarily  due to higher
commodity  sales  volumes  under the BGS  contract,  approximately  $43 million,
increases in the amortization of the excess electric  distribution  depreciation
reserve,   approximately  $6  million   (discussed  below  in  Depreciation  and
Amortization),  increases in MTC charges from Power, other than rate reductions,
approximately  $6 million and  increases in  Non-Utility  Generation  Transition
Charge  (NTC)  costs due to higher  sales  volumes,  approximately  $3  million.
Partially  offsetting  the  increases  is the  impact  of the  rate  reductions,
approximately $42 million, discussed above in Operating Revenues.

Under the BGSS,  our gas costs in excess of (or below) the  amount  included  in
current  commodity  rates, are probable of being recovered from (returned to) to
customers through future commodity rates. Under SFAS 71, we defer (record) costs
in  excess of (or  below)  the  amount  included  in  current  commodity  rates.
Therefore any increase or decrease in our gas  commodity  revenue is offset by a
corresponding increase or decrease in gas costs on the income statement.

For the nine months ended  September  30,  2002,  Energy  Costs  increased  $279
million or 14% due  primarily  to  increases  of $377 million and $92 million at
Power and Global,  respectively,  partially offset by a $341 million


                                       41
<PAGE>

decrease at PSE&G. The remaining  increase in Energy Costs is due primarily to a
net  difference in  intercompany  eliminations  of  approximately  $149 million,
discussed above in Operating Revenues.

Power's  increases were primarily due to increased  energy purchases for the BGS
and third party  wholesale  electric  supplier  contacts of  approximately  $144
million due to higher  volumes and $276  million of increased  gas  purchases to
satisfy  Power's  BGSS  contract  and  its  fuel  needs  for  generation.   Also
contributing  to the increase was higher  network  transmission  expenses of $35
million  for PJM and $11  million of  increased  coal  purchases.  These  higher
expenses were partially  offset by a $13 million  decrease in nuclear fuel usage
and a $36 million decrease in oil consumption. Further expense reductions can be
attributed to $14 million of decreases in fuel hedges,  $13 million  decrease in
Non-Utility  Generation  (NUG)  purchases  and $13  million in lower  congestion
charges due to less constraint in the system.

The  increases  at Global for the nine  months  ended  September  30,  2002 were
primarily  due  to  operating  expenses  incurred  at  SAESA  and  Electroandes,
discussed above.

PSE&G's decreases were due primarily to a decrease in gas costs of approximately
$350 million primarily due to lower commodity costs, approximately $176 million,
lower revenues from interruptible customers,  approximately $111 million, due to
lower  volumes at lower  rates,  lower  sales  volumes as a result of the warmer
weather in 2002,  approximately $52 million and lower off-system sales revenues,
approximately  $9 million.  These  decreases were partially  offset by increased
electric  energy costs of $9 million  primarily  due to higher  commodity  sales
volumes under the BGS  contract,  approximately  $90 million and higher  amounts
paid to Power relating to the  amortization of the excess electric  distribution
depreciation  reserve,  approximately  $22  million.  Partially  offsetting  the
increases  is the  impact of the rate  reductions,  approximately  $85  million,
discussed above in Operating Revenues, lower NUG energy sales, approximately $13
million and lower market rates and lower MTC charges from Power, other than rate
reductions, approximately $4 million.

Operation and Maintenance

For the three  months  ended  September  30, 2002,  Operations  and  Maintenance
expense decreased $2 million as compared to same period in 2001 due primarily to
a decrease at PSE&G  resulting  from a management  initiative  to lower  PSE&G's
Operation and Maintenance costs. This decrease was partially offset by increases
at Power,  primarily  from  scheduled  outage  work at its  electric  generating
stations,  and  increases  at Global,  relating to the  operations  of SAESA and
Electroandes, discussed previously.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, Operations and Maintenance expense
increased $13 million or 1% as compared to the same period in 2001 due primarily
to  increases at Power and Global,  partially offset by the decreases at PSE&G,
discussed above.

Depreciation and Amortization

For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2002,  Depreciation and
Amortization  increased $15 million or 10% and $61 million or 16%, respectively,
as compared to the same  periods in 2001,  primarily  due to increases at PSE&G,
resulting  from an increase in  depreciable  fixed assets,  higher  depreciation
expense  recorded in accordance  with increased gas base rates and  amortization
related  to  securitization.  The  increases  were  partially  offset  by higher
amortization of the excess electric  distribution  depreciation reserve.

Interest Expense

Interest Expense increased $9 million or 5% and $58 million or 11% for the three
and nine-month  periods ended September 30, 2002,  respectively,  as compared to
the same periods in 2001 primarily due to additional long-term debt at Power and
Energy Holdings issued to finance recent acquisitions and development.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $75 million for the three months ended September 30, 2002
as  compared to the same period in 2001 due  partially  to higher  income in the
current  quarter.  Prior period tax adjustments  recorded in 2001 reflecting the
conclusion of the 1994-96 IRS audit settlement and the actual filing of the 2000
tax return also contributed to the increase.

Income taxes decreased $173 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002
as  compared  to the same period in 2001  primarily  due to lower  income in the
current year, offset by the prior period adjustments discussed above.

Losses From Discontinued Operations

Energy Technologies

Energy Technologies is comprised of 11 heating, ventilating and air conditioning
(HVAC) and mechanical  operating  companies and an asset  management group which
includes  various Demand Side Management (DSM)  investments.  DSM investments in
long-term contracts represent  expenditures made by Energy Technologies to share
DSM  customers'  costs  associated  with the  installation  of energy  efficient
equipment.  DSM revenues are earned  principally from monthly payments  received
from utilities, which represent shared electricity savings from the installation
of the energy efficient equipment.

During the second  quarter of 2002,  Energy  Holdings  completed its  impairment
testing of all recorded  goodwill in accordance  with guidance set forth in SFAS
142  including the goodwill  associated  with the 11  HVAC/mechanical  operating
companies  acquired by Energy  Technologies.  Such analysis  indicated  that the
entire $53 million of goodwill associated with the HVAC/mechanical companies was
impaired, which resulted in a $32 million (after-tax) charge (net of $21 million
in taxes).  In accordance  with SFAS 142, this charge was recorded as of January
1, 2002 as a Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle and reflected
in our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

In June  2002,  Energy  Holdings  adopted  a plan to sell its  interests  in the
HVAC/mechanical  operating companies. The sale of these companies is expected to
be  completed  by  June  30,  2003.   We  have   retained  the  services  of  an
investment-banking  firm to market these  companies to interested  parties.  The
HVAC/mechanical  operating  companies  meet the criteria for  classification  as
components  of   discontinued   operations  and  all  prior  periods  have  been
reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

In the second quarter of 2002, Energy Holdings  initiated a process for the sale
of Energy  Technologies' DSM investments,  which we had expected to sell by June
30, 2003.  Based on our  assessments,  we believe the fair market value of these
assets  approximates  their  carrying  value  as of  September  30,  2002 and no
reduction in the  carrying  amount is  indicated.  For the period ended June 30,
2002,  Energy  Technologies'  DSM investments  were classified as a component of
discontinued  operations.  In the third quarter of 2002, Energy Holdings decided
to continue to own the DSM investments. For the period ended September 30, 2002,
all DSM investments were reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing
operations and the consolidated  statements for all periods  presented have been
restated to reflect this reclassification.

In addition to the goodwill impairment,  Energy Holdings has further reduced the
carrying value of the investments in the 11 HVAC/mechanical  operating companies
to their fair value less costs to sell,  and recorded a loss on disposal for the
six months ended June 30, 2002 of $20 million,  net of $11 million in taxes.  As
of September  30,  2002,  the carrying  value of the  HVAC/mechanical  operating
companies approximates the fair value and accordingly no additional reduction in
the carrying  value was required for the three months ended  September 30, 2002.
Energy  Holdings'  remaining  investment  position  in  Energy  Technologies  is
approximately  $110  million,  of which  approximately  $32  million  relates to
deferred  tax  assets  from  discontinued  operations,  for  which no  valuation
allowance is deemed


                                       43
<PAGE>

necessary.  Excluding  the  deferred  tax assets from  discontinued  operations,
approximately  $40 million of our remaining  investment  balance  relates to the
asset  management  group.  Although we believe  that we will be able to sell the
HVAC/mechanical  companies,  we can give no  assurances  that we will be able to
realize their total carrying values.

Operating results of Energy Technologies'  HVAC/mechanical  operating companies,
less certain  allocated costs from Energy Holdings,  have been reclassified into
discontinued  operations  in our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Operations.  The
results of operations of these discontinued  operations for the quarter and nine
months  ended  September  30,  2002,  yielded  additional  losses of $3  million
(after-tax) and $12 million (after-tax), respectively, and are disclosed below:

Tanir Bavi

At September  30, 2002,  Global owned a 74% interest in Tanir Bavi Power Company
Private  Ltd.  (Tanir  Bavi),  which owns and  operates a 220 MW barge  mounted,
combined-cycle  generating  facility  in India.  A plan to exit  Tanir  Bavi was
adopted in June 2002.  Global  signed an agreement in August 2002 under which an
affiliate  of its partner in this  venture,  GMR Vasavi  Group,  a local  Indian
company,  purchased  Global's  majority  interest  in Tanir  Bavi.  The sale was
completed in October 2002. Tanir Bavi meets the criteria for classification as a
component  of   discontinued   operations   and  all  prior  periods  have  been
reclassified  to  conform  to the  current  year's  presentation.  In the second
quarter of 2002, we reduced the carrying  value of Tanir Bavi to the  contracted
sales  price of $45  million  and  recorded a loss on  disposal  of $14  million
(after-tax).  The operating  results of Tanir Bavi for the six months ended June
30, 2002 yielded income of $5 million (after-tax).

See Note 4. Discontinued Operations for further discussion.

Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle

In the  second  quarter of 2002 we  finalized  our  evaluation  of the effect of
adopting SFAS 142 on the recorded  amount of goodwill.  Under this standard,  we
were  required to complete an impairment  analysis of our recorded  goodwill and
record any resulting  impairment.  The total amount of goodwill  impairments was
$120  million,  net of tax of $66  million  and  was  comprised  of $36  million
(after-tax) at EDEERSA, $34 million (after-tax) at Rio Grande Energia (RGE), $32
million  (after-tax) at Energy Technologies and $18 million (after-tax) at Tanir
Bavi.  All of the  goodwill  on these  companies,  other  than  RGE,  was  fully
impaired. In accordance with SFAS 142, this impairment charge was recorded as of
January  1,  2002  as a  component  of the  Cumulative  Effect  of a  Change  in
Accounting  Principle and is reflected in  Consolidated  Statement of Operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

Operations in Argentina

We,  through our Energy  Holdings  subsidiary,  have  significant  operations in
Argentina.  Over the past year,  the business and  economic  conditions  in that
region have  deteriorated.  As of December 31, 2001, Energy Holdings'  aggregate
investment exposure in Argentina was $632 million.  These investments included a
90% owned distribution  company,  Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Entre
Rios S.A. (EDEERSA); minority interests in three distribution companies, Empresa
Distribuidora de Energia Norte S.A. (EDEN), Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Sur
S.A.  (EDES),  and  Empresa  Distribuidora  La  Plata  S.A.  (EDELAP);  and  two
generating  companies,  Central Termica San Nicolas (CTSN), and Parana which are
under contract for sale to certain  subsidiaries of The AES  Corporation  (AES).
Net  operating  losses  relating to these  investments  of $59 million have been
incurred  year-to-date  and are mainly  attributable to the falling value of the
Argentine peso.  Additionally,  certain loss  contingencies have been accrued of
$11 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2002. In June 2002,
Energy Holdings determined that the carrying value of its Argentine  investments
was impaired. Energy Holdings recorded charges in connection with the impairment
of $506 million ($329 million  after-tax)  during the second quarter of 2002. No
such  impairment  charges were incurred during the third quarter ended September
30, 2002.  For the three and nine periods ended  September  30, 2001,  operating
expenses of $6 million and $11 million were incurred,  respectively. See Note 3.
Asset Impairments for further discussion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The  following  discussion  of  our  liquidity  and  capital  resources  is on a
consolidated  basis,  noting  the uses and  contributions  of our  three  direct
operating subsidiaries, PSE&G, Power and Energy Holdings.

Financing Methodology

Our capital  requirements  are met  through  liquidity  provided  by  internally
generated cash flow and external  financings.  PSEG,  Power and Energy  Holdings
from time to time make equity  contributions or otherwise provide credit support
to their  respective  direct and  indirect  subsidiaries  to provide for part of
their   capital  and  cash   requirements,   generally   relating  to  long-term
investments.  As of September 30, 2002, PSEG does not have any guaranteed equity
contribution commitments.  As of September 30, 2002, Power had guaranteed equity
contribution  commitments  with respect to its  subsidiaries of $153 million and
has other  guarantees  and  commitments  of $73 million and Energy  Holdings has
guaranteed equity commitment  guarantees of $153 million and other guarantees of
$91  million  and  $1  million  relating  to  Global  and  Energy  Technologies,
respectively. At times, we utilize intercompany dividends and intercompany loans
(except that PSE&G may not make loans to us or our  subsidiaries and affiliates)
to  satisfy  various  subsidiary  needs  and  efficiently  manage  our  and  our
subsidiaries' short-term cash needs. Any excess funds are invested in accordance
with guidelines adopted by our Board of Directors.

External  funding to meet our needs and the needs of PSE&G,  the majority of the
requirements  of Power and a substantial  portion of the  requirements of Energy
Holdings, is comprised of corporate finance  transactions.  The debt incurred is
the direct  obligation  of those  respective  entities.  Some of the proceeds of
these  debt  transactions  are used by the  respective  obligor  to make  equity
investments in its subsidiaries.

As discussed below, depending on the particular company,  external financing may
consist of public and private capital market debt and equity transactions,  bank
revolving  credit and term loans,  commercial  paper and/or project  financings.
Some of these  transactions  involve special purpose entities (SPEs),  formed in
accordance  with  applicable  tax and  legal  requirements  in order to  achieve
specified  beneficial  financial  advantages,  such as  favorable  tax and legal
liability  treatment.  Substantially  all SPEs are  consolidated,  where we have
controlling interest.


                                       45
<PAGE>

Global has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, an amount
is recorded on our balance sheet that is primarily  Global's  equity  investment
and is  increased  for  Global's  pro-rata  share of earnings  less any dividend
distribution from such  investments.  The companies in which Global invests that
are  accounted  for under the equity  method have an aggregate  $1.89 billion of
debt on their combined,  consolidated  financial  statements.  Global's pro-rata
share of such debt is $697  million  and is  non-recourse  to  Energy  Holdings,
Global and us.  Energy  Holdings is  generally  not required to support the debt
service obligations of these companies.

The  availability  and  cost of  external  capital  could  be  affected  by each
subsidiary's  performance  as well as by the  performance  of  their  respective
subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  This  could  include  the  degree of  structural
separation between us and our subsidiaries and the potential impact of affiliate
ratings  on  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  credit  quality.   Additionally,
compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon future financial
position  and levels of earnings and net cash flows,  as to which no  assurances
can be given.

Financing  for  Global's  projects  and  investments  is  generally  provided by
non-recourse project financing  transactions.  These consist of loans from banks
and other  lenders that are  typically  secured by project and SPE assets and/or
cash flows. Two of Power's projects  currently under  construction  have similar
financing.  Non-recourse transactions generally impose no material obligation on
the  parent-level  investor to repay any debt incurred by the project  borrower.
However,  in some cases,  certain  obligations  relating to the investment being
financed,  including  additional equity  commitments,  are guaranteed by Global,
Energy   Holdings,   and/or  Power  for  their  respective   subsidiaries.   The
consequences of permitting a project-level  default include loss of any invested
equity by the parent.  PSEG has not currently  provided any guarantees or credit
support to PSE&G,  Power or Energy  Holdings,  except for the  minimum net worth
maintenance  support  agreement to PSEG  Capital  Corporation,  a subsidiary  of
Energy  Holdings,  which we plan to  eliminate  upon  maturity  of PSEG  Capital
Corporation's debt in May 2003.

Over the next  several  years,  PSEG and its  subsidiaries  will be  required to
refinance  maturing debt and expect to incur  additional debt and provide equity
to fund  investment  activity.  Any  inability  to  obtain  required  additional
external  capital  or  to  extend  or  replace  maturing  debt  and/or  existing
agreements at current levels and reasonable  interest rates may adversely affect
our financial condition, results of operations and net cash flows.

During the third quarter of 2002,  Energy Holdings  purchased  approximately $19
million of Senior  Notes at prices  below par value.  In  October  2002,  Energy
Holdings purchased an additional $20 million of Senior Notes at prices below par
value.  From time to time, PSEG and its subsidiaries  may repurchase  additional
debt securities using funds from operations, asset sales, commercial paper, debt
issuances, equity issuances and other sources of funding, and may make exchanges
of new securities,  including  common stock,  for outstanding  securities.  Such
repurchases  may be at variable  prices  below,  at or above  prevailing  market
prices  and  may  be  conducted  by way of  privately  negotiated  transactions,
open-market purchases,  tender or exchange offers or other means. We may utilize
brokers or dealers or effect such repurchases directly. Any such repurchases may
be commenced or discontinued at any time without notice.

Debt Covenants,  Cross Default Provisions,  Material Adverse Clause Changes, and
Ratings Triggers

The PSEG credit agreements  contain default  provisions under which a default by
it or its major  subsidiaries  (PSE&G,  Power,  Energy Holdings) in an aggregate
amount of $50 million would result in a default and the  potential  acceleration
of payment under the agreements.

The Energy Holdings credit  agreements  contain default  provision under which a
default by it or its major  subsidiaries  (Resources,  Global)  in an  aggregate
amount of $5 million, or a default by PSEG in an aggregate amount of $75 million
would result in an event of default and the  potential  acceleration  of payment
under the  agreements.  The  Energy  Holdings  Senior  Note  Indenture  contains
cross-default  provisions under which a default by it or its major  subsidiaries
(Resources,  Global) in an  aggregate  amount of $25 million  would  result in a
default and the potential acceleration of payment under the indenture.

The Power  Senior  Debt  Indenture  contains a default  provision  under which a
default by it or its subsidiaries (Nuclear, Fossil, ER&T) in an aggregate amount
of $50 million  would  result in a default  and the  potential  acceleration  of
payment  under  the  indenture.  There  are  no  cross-defaults  within  Power's
indenture from PSEG, Energy Holdings or PSE&G.

The PSE&G First and Refunding Mortgage  (Mortgage) and credit agreements have no
cross-


                                       46
<PAGE>

defaults.  The PSE&G Medium Term Note Indenture has a cross-default to the PSE&G
Mortgage.  The credit  agreements have  cross-defaults  under which a default by
PSE&G  in the  aggregate  of $50  million  would  result  in a  default  and the
potential acceleration of payment under the credit agreements.

A failure to make  principal  and/or  interest  payments,  when due,  would be a
default under the respective  credit  agreements and indentures of PSEG,  PSE&G,
Power and Energy Holdings.  Any inability to satisfy  required  covenants and/or
borrowing  conditions  would have a similar impact.  If a default were to occur,
the respective  lenders and debt holders,  after giving effect to any applicable
grace and/or cure periods,  could determine that debt payment obligations may be
accelerated.  In the event of any likely default or failure to satisfy covenants
or conditions,  we, or the relevant subsidiary,  would seek to renegotiate terms
of the  agreements  with the lenders.  No assurances  can be given as to whether
these efforts would be successful. A declaration of cross-default could severely
limit PSEG's and the applicable subsidiaries' liquidity and restrict the ability
to meet  respective  debt,  capital  and,  in extreme  cases,  operational  cash
requirements  which  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  financial
condition,  results  of  operations  and  net  cash  flows,  and  those  of  our
subsidiaries.

The credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could
refuse  to  advance  loans in the  event of a  material  adverse  change  in the
borrower's business or financial condition. In that event, loan funds may not be
advanced.

As  explained in detail  below,  some of these  credit  agreements  also contain
maximum debt to equity  ratios,  minimum  cash flow tests and other  restrictive
covenants and  conditions to borrowing.  Compliance  with  applicable  financial
covenants  will  depend  upon our  future  financial  position  and the level of
earnings and cash flow, as to which no assurances can be given.

The debt indentures and credit  agreements do not contain any material  "ratings
triggers"  that  would  cause  an  acceleration  of the  required  interest  and
principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of
a downgrade,  we and/or our  subsidiaries  may be subject to increased  interest
costs on  certain  bank  debt.  Also,  in  connection  with its  energy  trading
business,  Power must meet certain credit  quality  standards as are required by
counterparties.  If Power loses its investment  grade credit rating,  ER&T would
have to  provide  credit  support  (letters  of  credit or  cash),  which  would
significantly  impact  the  cost of the  energy  trading  business.  These  same
contracts provide  reciprocal  benefits to Power.  Providing this credit support
would increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to successfully
conduct our energy  trading  operations.  In addition,  our  counterparties  may
require us to meet margin or other security  requirements  that may include cash
payments.  Global and Energy Holdings may have to provide collateral for certain
of their  equity  commitments  if Energy  Holdings'  ratings  should  fall below
investment grade.  Similarly,  Power may also have to provide credit support for
certain of its equity commitments if Power loses its investment grade rating.

Credit Ratings

The current ratings of securities of PSEG and its  subsidiaries  are shown below
and  reflect  the  respective  views  of  the  rating  agencies,  from  whom  an
explanation of the  significance  of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no
assurance  that these ratings will continue for any given period of time or that
they will not be revised or withdrawn  entirely by the rating  agencies,  if, in
their respective  judgments,  circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or
withdrawal may adversely  effect the market price of PSEG's,  Energy  Holdings',
Power's and PSE&G's  securities and serve to increase those  companies'  cost of
capital, and access to capital.

$1.657  billion,  including $673 million and $94 million of commercial  paper at
PSEG and PSE&G, respectively,  $271 million of non-recourse short-term financing
at Global and $329  million,  $37 million  and $253  million  outstanding  under
credit  facilities  and through the  uncommitted  bilateral  agreements at PSEG,
PSE&G and Energy Holdings,  respectively.  In addition,  we have a total of $742
million of  long-term  debt due within one year,  comprised  of $300  million at
PSE&G,  $128 million at Transition  Funding and $314 million at Energy  Holdings
including $32 million of non-recourse debt.

PSEG

In 2002,  we began  issuing  new  shares  under our  Dividend  Reinvestment  and
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (DRASPP),  rather than  purchasing them on the open
market. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002 we issued approximately 1.5
million shares for approximately $57 million.

Dividend  payments  on  Common  Stock  for the  quarter  and nine  months  ended
September 30, 2002 were $0.54 and $1.62 per share and totaled approximately $111
million and $334 million,  respectively. Our dividend rate has remained constant
since 1992 in order to retain additional  capital for reinvestment and to reduce
the payout ratio as earnings  grow.  Although we presently  believe we will have
adequate  earnings and cash flow in the future from our subsidiaries to maintain
common stock dividends at the current level, earnings and cash flows required to
support the dividend  will become more  uncertain  as our business  continues to
change  from one  that  was  principally  regulated  to one that is  principally
competitive.  Future  dividends  declared will necessarily be dependent upon our
future  earnings,  cash  flows,  financial  requirements,  alternate  investment
opportunities and other factors.

Financial  covenants  contained in our credit facilities include a ratio of debt
(excluding non-recourse project financings and securitization debt and including
commercial paper and loans,  certain letters of credit and similar  instruments)
to total capitalization  covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any
quarterly  financial  period,  such  ratio  not be  more  than  0.70 to 1. As of
September 30, 2002, our ratio of debt to capitalization was 0.65 to 1.

Recent  downturns  in the stock  markets  could  affect the value of our pension
plans that may result in a charge to our  stockholders'  equity at year-end.  If
required,  this would result in an increase to our debt to capitalization ratio.
See Accounting Matters for further information.

As part of our  financial  planning  forecast,  we perform  stress  tests on our
financial  covenants  that include a  consideration  of the impacts of potential
asset impairments,  foreign currency  fluctuations,  adjustments relating to our
pension  plans and other items.  Our current  forecasts do not indicate  that we
will exceed the  required  ratio of debt to total  capitalization,  however,  no
assurances  can be given  and,  if an event of default  were to occur,  it could
materially impact our results of operations, cash flow and financial position.

On May 21, 2002, $275 million of Floating Rate Notes matured.

In  September  2002,  we issued 9.2  million  Participating  Units with a stated
amount of $50 per unit. Each unit consists of a 6.25% trust  preferred  security
due  2007  having a  liquidation  value of $50,  and a stock  purchase  contract
obligating  the  purchasers to purchase  shares of our common stock in an amount
equal to $50 on November 16, 2005.  In exchange  for the  obligations  under the
purchase  contract,  the purchasers will receive quarterly  contract  adjustment
payments at the annual  rate of 4.00% until such date.  The number of new shares
issued will depend upon the average  closing price per share of our common stock
for the 20  consecutive  trading days ending the third  trading day  immediately
preceding  November  16,  2005.  Based on the formula  described in the purchase
contract, at that time we will issue between 11,429,139 and 13,714,967 shares of
its common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of the Participating  Units was
$446.2 million.

In October 2002, we closed on a $245 million private  placement debt transaction
with a five-year average life, with the proceeds being used to reduce short-term
debt.

In the third  quarter of 2002, we  contributed  $100 million of equity to Energy
Holdings and we expect to contribute  an  additional  $100 million in the fourth
quarter of 2002.

PSE&G

Under its  Mortgage,  PSE&G may issue  new First and  Refunding  Mortgage  Bonds
against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings
to fixed charges  calculated  in  accordance  with its Mortgage is at least 2:1,
and/or against retired  Mortgage Bonds. At September 30, 2002,  PSE&G's Mortgage
coverage  ratio was 3:1. As of September 30, 2002,  the Mortgage would permit up
to approximately $1 billion aggregate  principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to
be issued  against  previous  additions and  improvements.  PSE&G is required to
obtain  BPU  authorization  to issue any  financing  necessary  for its  capital
program,  including  refunding of maturing debt and  opportunistic  refinancing.
PSE&G has  authorization  from the BPU to issue up to an aggregate of $1 billion
of long-term  debt through  December 31, 2003 for the refunding of maturing debt
and opportunistic  refinancing of debt. We currently have authorization from the
BPU to issue up to $2 billion in short-term  debt through  December 31, 2002. In
October 2002, we filed a petition with the BPU requesting  authority to issue up
to $750 million of short-term debt through January 4, 2005. In addition, PSE&G
expects to  securitize  approximately  $250 million of deferred  BGS costs,  the
proceeds of which will be used to reduce short-term debt.

Financial  covenants  contained in PSE&G's credit facilities  include a ratio of
Long-Term  Debt  (excluding  Long-Term  Debt  Maturing  within  1 Year) to Total
Capitalization covenant. This covenant requires that at the end of any quarterly
financial  period,  such ratio will not be more than 0.65 to 1. As of  September
30, 2002, our ratio of Long-Term Debt to Total Capitalization was 0.508 to 1.

In August 2002, $257 million of 6.125% Series RR Mortgage Bonds matured.

In September  2002,  PSE&G issued $300 million of 5.125%  Medium-Term  Notes due
2012, the proceeds of which were used to repay $290 million of 7.19% Medium-Term
Notes that matured.

During 2002, PSE&G Transition  Funding LLC, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of PSE&G,
has repaid $85 million of securitization bonds.

Since 1986,  PSE&G has made regular cash payments to us in the form of dividends
on outstanding  shares of its common stock. PSE&G paid common stock dividends of
$150 million and $112 million to us for the nine months ended September 30, 2002
and 2001, respectively.

Power

Power's  short-term  financing needs will be met using PSEG's  commercial  paper
program or lines of credit discussed above.

In June 2002,  Power  issued $600 million of 6.95%  Senior  Unsecured  Notes due
2012.  The proceeds  were used to repay  short-term  funding from us,  including
amounts related to the Gas Contract Transfer from PSE&G in May 2002.

Energy Holdings

As of September  30, 2002,  Energy  Holdings had two separate  revolving  credit
facilities  with a  syndicate  of banks as  discussed  in the table  above.  The
five-year  facility permits up to $250 million of letters of credit to be issued
of which $12 million were outstanding as of September 30, 2002.

Financial covenants contained in these facilities include the ratio of cash flow
available for debt service (CFADS) to fixed charges. At the end of any quarterly
financial period such ratio shall not be less than 1.50x for the 12-month period
then ending.  As a condition of borrowing,  the pro-forma CFADS to fixed charges
ratio shall not be less than 1.75x as of the quarterly  financial  period ending
immediately  following  the first  anniversary  of each  borrowing  or letter of
credit  issuance.  CFADS includes,  but is not limited to, operating cash before
interest and taxes,  pre-tax cash  distributions from all asset liquidations and
equity  capital  contributions  from us to the extent not used to fund


                                       50
<PAGE>

investing activity. In addition, the ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness
to recourse  capitalization,  as at the end of any quarterly  financial  period,
shall not be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. This ratio is calculated by dividing the
total  recourse   indebtedness   of  Energy   Holdings  by  the  total  recourse
capitalization. This ratio excludes the debt of PSEG Capital, which is supported
by us. As of September 30, 2002,  the latest 12 months CFADS  coverage ratio was
6.3 and the ratio of recourse  indebtedness to recourse  capitalization was 0.47
to 1.00.

PSEG Capital has a $650 million  Medium-Term Note program which provides for the
private  placement  of  Medium-Term  Notes.  This  Medium-Term  Note  program is
supported by a minimum net worth maintenance  agreement between PSEG Capital and
us which  provides,  among other  things,  that we (1) maintain  its  ownership,
directly or indirectly,  of all  outstanding  common stock of PSEG Capital,  (2)
cause  PSEG  Capital to have at all times a  positive  tangible  net worth of at
least $100,000 and (3) make  sufficient  contributions  of liquid assets to PSEG
Capital in order to permit it to pay its debt obligations. We will eliminate our
support of PSEG Capital  debt by the second  quarter of 2003.

In July 2002,  an  additional  $100 million of PSEG Capital MTNs with an average
borrowing  rate of 6.95%  matured.  These MTNs were  refunded with proceeds from
borrowings under Energy Holdings' bank facilities with current interest costs of
approximately 2.7%.

As  of  September  30,  2002,   remaining  maturities  under  the  PSEG  Capital
Corporation  program were $282 million,  $30 million of which matured in October
2002,  and $252  million of which  matures  in May 2003.  These  issues  will be
refunded  with  proceeds  of  borrowings  at  Energy   Holdings  and  cash  from
operations.

Capital Requirements

We have substantially  reduced our capital  expenditure  forecast in response to
tightening market conditions resulting from market and lender concerns regarding
the overall  economy and our industry in  particular,  including an investor and
rating  agency  focus on leverage  ratios.  These  conditions  have made it more
difficult  for  us  to  access   capital,   impacting  our  business  plans  and
opportunities to enter into profitable investments.

Power's capital needs will be dictated by its strategy to continue to develop as
a profitable,  growth-oriented supplier in the wholesale power market. Power has
revised its schedule for  completion of several  projects  under  development to
provide better  sequencing of its construction  program with anticipated  market
demand.  This will allow  Power to  conserve  capital in 2003 and allow Power to
take advantage of the expected  recovery of the electric  markets and their need
for capacity in 2005. Power's subsidiaries have substantial  commitments as part
of their  growth  strategies  and  ongoing  construction  programs.  Power  will
continue to evaluate its development and  construction  requirements in relation
to the energy and financial markets.

We expect that the majority of each subsidiaries'  capital requirements over the
next five years will come from internally  generated funds,  with the balance to
be  provided  by the  issuance of debt at the  subsidiary  or project  level and
equity   contributions   from  us.   Projected   construction   and   investment
expenditures,  excluding  nuclear fuel purchases for Power, for our subsidiaries
for the next five years are as follows:

All of the  forecasted  expenditures  in 2004  through  2006  related  to Energy
Holdings are discretionary.

For the nine months ended  September  30, 2002,  we made net plant  additions of
$1,310 million. The majority of these additions, $792 million, primarily related
to  Power  for  developing  the  Lawrenceburg,   Indiana,  Waterford,  Ohio  and
Bethlehem,  NY  (Albany)  sites and  adding  capacity  to the  Bergen and Linden
stations in New  Jersey.  In  addition,  PSE&G had net plant  additions  of $322
million related to improvements in its transmission and distribution system, gas
system  and  common  facilities.   Also,  Energy  Holdings'   subsidiaries  made
investments  totaling  approximately  $390  million  for the nine  months  ended
September 30, 2002,  respectively.  These investments include an approximate 50%
interest of a coal-fired  generation  facility,  currently under construction in
Poland,  and  additional  investments in existing  generation  and  distribution
facilities and projects by Global and investment in capital leases by Resources.
Partially  offsetting  these  investments was an $88 million loan repayment from
TIE.  For a  discussion  of the  loans  to  TIE,  see  Note  12.  Related  Party
Transactions.  The $1,310  million of net plant  additions  and $390  million of
investments were included in our forecasted expenditures for the year.

ACCOUNTING MATTERS

For a discussion  of SFAS 142,  SFAS 143,  SFAS 144, SFAS 145, SFAS 146 and EITF
02-03, see Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

SFAS 87 - "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"

SFAS 87 requires a pension  plan  sponsor to  recognize  an  additional  minimum
pension  liability to the extent that its accumulated  benefit  obligation under
any of its pension  plans exceeds the fair market value of its plan assets as of
its  annual   measurement  date.  This  additional   minimum  pension  liability
represents  the  amount by which its  unfunded  accumulated  benefit  obligation
exceeds the fair market value of the plan's assets,  and is partially  offset by
an intangible asset no larger than the  unrecognized  net transition  obligation
and prior  service  cost,  with no  impact to  earnings.  At this  time,  we are
monitoring the fair market value of our investments and our accumulated  benefit
obligation  and are  evaluating  options  available  to us with  respect to this
issue.  Since our measurement date is December 31, 2002 we are unable to predict
what the impact could be,  however the impact could be material to our financial
position and, more specifically, could result in a decrease in equity.

            of our competitors;

      o     insurance coverage may not be sufficient;

      o     acquisition, construction and development may not be successful;

      o     changes in  technology  may make our power  generation  assets  less
            competitive; and

      o     recession, acts of war or terrorism could have an adverse impact.

                      ITEM 3. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE
                          DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The market risk inherent in our market risk sensitive  instruments and positions
is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency  exchange
rates, commodity prices, equity security prices, and interest rates as discussed
in the notes to the financial  statements.  Our policy is to use  derivatives to
manage risk consistent with our business plans and prudent practices.  We have a
Risk  Management  Committee  comprised of executive  officers  which utilizes an
independent risk oversight function to ensure compliance with corporate policies
and prudent risk management practices.

Commodity Contracts

The measured VAR using a variance/co-variance  model with a 95% confidence level
and assuming a one-week time horizon as of September 30, 2002 was  approximately
$19 million, compared to the December 31, 2001 level of $18 million.

Credit Risk

Credit  risk  relates  to the risk of loss  that we would  incur as a result  of
non-performance  by  counterparties  pursuant to the terms of their  contractual
obligations.  We have established credit policies that we believe  significantly
minimize  credit  risk.  These  policies  include  an  evaluation  of  potential
counterparties'  financial  condition  (including  credit  rating),   collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements,
which may allow for the netting of positive  and negative  exposures  associated
with a single counterparty.

Power

Counterparties  expose us to credit  losses in the event of  non-performance  or
non-payment.  We have a  credit  management  process  which  is used to  assess,
monitor and mitigate counterparty  exposure for us and our subsidiaries.  In the
event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty,  there may be a
material  adverse  impact  on our and  our  subsidiaries'  financial  condition,
results of  operations  or net cash flows.  As of September 30, 2002 over 97% of
the credit  exposure  (mark to market plus net  receivables  and  payables)  for
Power's  trading  operations was with  investment  grade  counterparties.  As of
September   30,  2002,   Power's   trading   operations   had  over  145  active
counterparties.

As a result of the New  Jersey  BGS  auction,  Power has  contracted  to provide
energy to the direct  suppliers  of New  Jersey  electric  utilities,  including
PSE&G, commencing August 1, 2002. Subsequently,  a portion of the contracts with
those bidders was reassigned to Power.  Therefore,  for a limited portion of the
New Jersey retail load, Power will be a direct supplier to one utility, although
this utility is not PSE&G. These bilateral contracts are subject to credit risk.
This  risk is  substantially  higher  than the risk  that  was  associated  with
potential  nonpayment by PSE&G under the BGS contract  which expired on July 31,
2002,  since PSE&G is a rate-regulated  entity.  This credit risk relates to the
ability  of  counterparties  to meet  their  payment  obligations  for the power
delivered under each BGS contract. Power sells electricity to approximately nine
supplier-counterparties  that serve the load of the  utilities,  and one utility
directly. Four of these  supplier-counterparties  pay Power directly, and one of
the  four  prepays  its   purchases.   The  revenue  from  the  remaining   five
counterparties  is paid directly from the utilities that those suppliers  serve,
and the related margin due to the  counterparties is recorded as a liability and
will be  remitted  to those  counterparties  separately.  Any failure to collect
these  payments  under the new BGS  contracts  could have a  material  impact on
Power's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Energy Holdings

Resources also has credit risk related to its  investments in leveraged  leases,
totaling $1.6  billion,  which is net of deferred  taxes of $1.4 billion,  as of
September 30, 2002.  These  investments  are  significantly  concentrated in the

energy  related  industry  and  have  some  exposure  to the  airline  industry.
Resources is the lessor of domestic  generating  facilities in several US energy
markets.  As a result of recent  actions of the rating  agencies due to concerns
over forward energy prices,  the credit of some of the transaction  lessees,  or
ultimate  guarantors of the lease obligations,  was downgraded.  As of September
30,  2002,  75% of the  lease  portfolio  were  with  counterparties  that  were
investment  grade as rated by both S&P and  Moody's,  as compared to 86% at June
30,  2002.  Specifically,   the  lessees  in  the  following  transactions  were
downgraded  over the quarter by the rating  agencies.  Resources'  investment in
such transactions was approximately $451 million,  net of deferred taxes of $266
million as of September 30, 2002.

Resources  leases  1,173 MW of  coal-fired  generation  to  Reliant  Energy  Mid
Atlantic  Power  Holdings LLC (REMA),  an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of
Reliant  Resources  Incorporated  (RRI).  The leased  assets  are the  Keystone,
Conemaugh and Shawville  generating  facilities  located in the Pennsylvania New
Jersey Maryland Power Pool (PJM) West market in Pennsylvania. In addition to the
leased assets,  REMA also owns and operates another 2,830 MW located within PJM.
REMA is  capitalized  with over $1  billion  of equity  from RRI and has no debt
obligations senior to the lease obligations. REMA is currently rated BB+ by S&P,
and Baa3 by Moody's. As the lessor/equity participant in the lease, Resources is
protected with  significant  lease covenants that restrict the flow of dividends
from  REMA  to its  parent,  and  by  over-collateralization  of  REMA  with  an
additional  2,830 MWs of non-leased  assets,  transfer of which is restricted by
the financing  documents.  Restrictive  covenants include historical and forward
cash flow coverage tests that prohibit  discretionary  capital  expenditures and
dividend  payments to the parent/lessee if stated minimum coverages are not met,
and  similar  cash flow  restrictions  if ratings are not  maintained  at stated
levels.  The covenants are designed to maintain cash reserves in the transaction
entity  for the  benefit  of the  non-recourse  lenders  and  the  lessor/equity
participants  in the event of a market  downturn,  or  degradation  in operating
performance of the leased assets.  Resources' investment in the REMA transaction
was $125 million, net of deferred taxes of $88 million at September 30, 2002.

Resources  is the  lessor of the  Collins  facility  to Midwest  Generation  LLC
(Midwest),  an indirect  subsidiary of Edison Mission  Energy (EME).  Collins is
comprised of 2,698 MWs of oil and natural gas fired  assets  located in the MAIN
power market located in the mid-western region of the United States. Midwest has
a contract  with Exelon to supply  capacity and energy for 1,078 MWs for Collins
through  December 2003 with an option to extend.  Both Midwest and EME are rated
BBB- by S&P and Ba3 by Moody's.  In addition to the leased assets,  Midwest owns
and operates an  additional  4,459 MWs of  generation  assets.  The  restrictive
covenants   protecting  us  are  similar  to  those  noted  above  in  the  REMA
transaction. Resources' investment in the Collins facility was $108 million, net
of deferred taxes of $69 million at September 30, 2002.

Resources also leases the Powerton and Joliet generating stations located in the
Mid-American  Interconnected Network (MAIN) market to Midwest. Both Powerton and
Joliet are coal fired stations comprising 2,896 MWs of generating capacity.  The
lease  obligations  are  guaranteed  by  EME.  The  guarantee  contains  certain
restrictive  covenants  including,  but not limited to,  additional  investment,
liens,  and sales of  non-leased  collateral.  In  addition,  EME is required to
maintain a minimum net worth equal to $400 million plus cumulative, consolidated
net income earned by it and its  subsidiaries  since 1992  (without  subtracting
losses).  Resources'  investment in the Powerton and Joliet  transaction was $87
million, net of deferred taxes of $74 million at September 30, 2002.

Resources  is the  lessor of the 370 MW coal  fired  Danskammer  plant to Dynegy
Danskammer  LLC  (Danskammer),  and the 1,200 MW natural  gas/oil  fired Roseton
plant to Dynegy Roseton LLC (Roseton).  Both Danskammer and Roseton are indirect
subsidiaries of Dynegy Holdings Inc (DHI). The lease  obligations are guaranteed
by DHI  which  is  currently  rated  B+ by S&P  and  B3 by  Moody's.  Resources'
investment in the Danskammer and Roseton  transaction  was $131 million,  net of
deferred taxes of $34 million as of September 30, 2002.

In the domestic lease transactions  described above, Resources has protected its
equity  investment by providing  for the right to assume the debt  obligation at
its discretion in the event of default by the lessee with the condition that the
debt is investment grade. If we were pursuing a debt assumption,  we would first
seek to renegotiate  all relevant terms of the agreement with the lenders.  Debt
assumption  normally  only would occur if an  appraisal  of the leased  property
yielded a value that


                                       55
<PAGE>

exceeds  the  present  value  of the debt  outstanding.  Should  Resources  ever
directly assume a debt  obligation,  the fair value of the underlying  asset and
the  associated  debt would be recorded on the balance  sheet instead of the net
equity investment in the lease. As of September 30, 2002,  Resources  determined
that the  collectibility of the minimum lease payments under its leveraged lease
investments is still reasonably  predictable and therefore  continues to account
for these investments as leveraged leases.

Resources  has  leasehold  interests  in the 340 MW natural gas fired Kings Lynn
generating  facility  and the 360 MW natural gas fired  Peterborough  generating
facility  located  in the  United  Kingdom.  The  counter-party  is an  indirect
subsidiary of TXU Europe, which is wholly owned by the TXU Corporation.  The TXU
Corporation   recently  announced  their  decision  to  reduce  their  financial
commitment to TXU Europe further noting their  intention to sell the subsidiary.
Moody's  recently  reduced  their  ratings  to Ca citing  that the entity is not
meeting its financial  commitments to suppliers or creditors when due. Our lease
transactions are secured,  and we believe that in any event of default,  we will
be able to  recover  our lease  investment  which  totals  $65  million,  net of
deferred taxes of $109 million as of September 30, 2002,  although no assurances
can be given.

Foreign Operations

As of September 30, 2002, Global and Resources had approximately  $2.870 billion
and $1.425 billion,  respectively,  of international assets. As of September 30,
2002, foreign assets represented 17% of our consolidated assets and the revenues
related to those foreign assets contributed 6% to consolidated  revenues for the
quarter and nine months ended  September  30, 2002.  For  discussion  of foreign
currency risk and asset impairments related to our investments in Argentina, see
Note 3. Asset  Impairments,  Note 6. Commitments and Contingent  Liabilities and
Note 7. Financial Instruments, Energy Trading and Risk Management.

                   ITEM 4. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

We have has established and maintained  disclosure controls and procedures which
are designed to provide reasonable  assurance that material information relating
to us,  including our consolidated  subsidiaries,  is made known to us by others
within those  entities,  particularly  during the period in which this quarterly
report is being prepared.  We have  established a Disclosure  Committee which is
made up of several key  management  employees and reports  directly to the Chief
Financial  Officer and Chief  Executive  Officer,  to monitor and evaluate these
disclosure  controls  and  procedures.  The Chief  Financial  Officer  and Chief
Executive  Officer have evaluated the  effectiveness of our disclosure  controls
and  procedures  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the  filing  date of this
quarterly report (the  "Evaluation  Date").  Based on this  evaluation,  we have
concluded  that  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  were  effective  in
providing  reasonable  assurance  during  the period  covered in this  quarterly
report.  There were no  significant  changes in  internal  controls  or in other
factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date
of our most recent evaluation.

                           PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

                            ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Certain information reported under Item 3 of Part I of our 2001 Annual Report on
Form 10-K,  Amended  Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March
31, 2002 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2002 is updated below.

March 31, 2002 Form  10-Q/A,  Page 44 and June 30,  2002 Form 10-Q,  Page 55. On
November 15, 2001,  Consolidated  Edison,  Inc.  (Con Edison)  filed a complaint
against PSE&G at FERC pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act asserting
that  PSE&G  had  breached  agreements  covering  1,000  MW of  transmission  by
curtailing service and failing to maintain sufficient system capacity to satisfy
all of its service  obligations.  PSE&G denied the  allegations set forth in the
complaint.  While finding that Con Edison's  presentation  of evidence failed to
demonstrate  several of the  allegations  in April 2002,  FERC found  sufficient
reason to set the  complaint  for  hearing.  An  initial  decision  issued by an
administrative  law judge in April 2002 upheld  PSE&G's claim that the contracts
do not require the  provision of "firm"  transmission  service to Con Edison but
also  accepted  Con  Edison's  contentions  that PSE&G was  obligated to provide
service to Con Edison  utilizing all the  facilities  comprising  its electrical
system   including   generation   facilities  and  that  PSE&G  was  financially
responsible for  above-market  generation costs needed to effectuate the desired
power flows. Under FERC procedures, an administrative law judge initial decision
is not binding  unless and until its findings have been approved by FERC.  PSE&G
filed a brief  taking  exception  to the adverse  findings of the April 25, 2002
order.  A FERC decision  concerning the findings of the April 25, 2002 order was
expected on July 31, 2002.  Settlement  discussions  between the companies  with
respect to this matter have been on-going and, on July 17, 2002, representatives
of  the  companies   met  for   settlement   discussions   mediated  by  a  FERC
administrative  law  judge.  Based  on  progress  made at these  and  subsequent
discussions,  Con Edison has twice sought to extend the date for the issuance of
the FERC decision  addressing the April 25, 2002 initial  decision and to extend
the date for the  commencement  of a hearing  with respect to issues in the case
not addressed by the April 25,


                                       56
<PAGE>

2002 initial decision.  At present, in the event the dispute is not settled, the
FERC  decision  is  expected in  mid-November,  2002 and the hearing  before the
administrative  law judge will commence in early  December 2002. The findings in
the April 25,  2002  initial  decision  notwithstanding,  PSE&G  believes it has
complied  with  the  terms of the  Agreements  and will  vigorously  defend  its
position. The nature and cost of any remedy, which is expected to be prospective
only, cannot be predicted. Further, even in the event settlement is reached with
Con  Edison,  PSE&G  could  still be  required  to bear  substantial  levels  of
additional costs. Docket No. EL02-23-000.

June 30, 2002 Form 10-Q,  Page 56. On July 12, 2002,  the United States Court of
Appeals, D.C. Circuit, issued an opinion in favor of PSE&G and the other utility
petitioners, reversing an order of the FERC relating to the restructuring of PJM
into an Independent System Operator.  The Court agreed with PSE&G's position and
ruled that FERC lacks  authority to require the utility  owners to give up their
statutory  rights under  Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  Hence,  FERC was
wrong to  require a  modification  to the PJM ISO  Agreement  eliminating  their
rights to file changes to rate design.  The court  further noted that FERC lacks
authority  under  Section  203 of the  Federal  Power Act to require the utility
owners to obtain approval of their withdrawal from the PJM ISO. Hence,  FERC had
no right  under  Section 203 to  eliminate  the  withdrawal  rights to which the
utilities had agreed. Further, in ruling on a specific argument raised by PSE&G,
the Court held that FERC had not justified its decision to generically  abrogate
wholesale   power   requirements   contracts;   FERC  was  required  to  make  a
particularized  finding with respect to the public interest,  which was not done
here. This matter is now pending on remand before the FERC.

                            ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION

Certain information  reported under our 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Amended
Quarterly  Report on Form  10-Q/A  for the  quarter  ended  March  31,  2002 and
Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the  quarter  ended June 30,  2002 is updated
below.  References  are to the related  pages on the Form 10-K,  Form 10-Q/A and
Form 10-Q as printed and distributed.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)

Form 10-K, page 18 and March 31, 2002 Form 10-Q/A,  Page 46. A pressurized water
reactor  nuclear  unit  (PWR) not  owned by us was  recently  identified  with a
degradation  of the  reactor  vessel  head,  which  forms  part of the  pressure
boundary for the reactor coolant system. In August 2002, the NRC issued bulletin
2002-02,   requiring  that  all  operators  of  PWR  units  submit   information
concerning:  (i) a summary  discussion  of the  supplemental  inspections  to be
implemented,  and (ii) if no changes are to be  implemented,  justification  for
reliance on visual examinations as the primary method to detect degradation.  In
September  2002  we  provided  the  requested   information  for  Salem  Nuclear
Generating  Station  (Salem).  The  response  stated  that a bare  metal  visual
examination  will be  performed  on the Salem  reactor  vessel heads during each
unit's next refueling  outage,  in compliance with the bulletin.  If repairs are
determined  to be  necessary,  it is estimated  that the repair would extend the
outage  by  approximately  four  weeks.  Our  Hope  Creek  nuclear  unit and our
interests in the Peach Bottom units 2 and 3 are  unaffected  as they are Boiling
Water Reactor  nuclear  units.  We cannot predict what other actions the NRC may
take on this issue.

Electric Base Rate Case

June 30, 2002 Form 10-Q, Page 56. On May 24, 2002,  PSE&G filed an electric rate
case with the BPU. In this filing,  PSE&G  requested an annual $250 million rate
increase for its electric  distribution  business.  The proposed  rate  increase
includes $187 million of increased  revenues relating to a $1.7 billion increase
in PSE&G's rate base,  which is primarily due to the  investment  that PSE&G has
made in its electric  distribution  facilities since the last rate case in 1992;
$18  million in higher  depreciation  rates and $45  million to recover  various
other  expenses,  such as wages,  fringe  benefits,  and the need to enhance the
security and  reliability  of the electric  distribution  system.  The requested
increase proposes a return on equity of 11.75% for PSE&G's electric distribution
business.

Assuming  current cost levels and a normal  business  environment,  the proposed
rate increase would significantly  impact our earnings and operating cash flows.
The  non-depreciation  portion of the rate increase  ($232 million) would have a
positive  effect on our  earnings and  operating  cash flows.  The  depreciation
portion of the rate increase ($18 million) would have no impact on our earnings,
as the  increased  operating  cash flows would be offset by higher  depreciation
charges.

In accordance with BPU's Final Order,  which  implemented  parts of New Jersey's
Electric  Discount and  Competition  Act, PSE&G was required to reduce  electric
rates in four steps totaling 13.9% during the four year transition  period.  The
last step, a 4.9%  decrease,  took effect on August 1, 2002.  If  approved,  the
proposed  rate  increase  would be  effective  August  1,  2003,  the end of the
transition  period.  While the proposed rate increase  would  increase  electric
distribution  rates by 12.8% from the July 31,  2003 level,  rates would  remain
2.6% lower than the levels in April 1999,  when the BPU issued its Final  Order.
We cannot predict the outcome of these rate proceedings at the current time.

As directed by the BPU in its July 22, 2002  Order,  on August 28,  2002,  PSE&G
filed supplemental  testimony to address the use of securitization  proceeds and
proceeds from the sale of generation assets. The issue of electronic meters must
also be addressed in a separate  filing in an expedited  timeframe.  We are also
working to  resolve  the open  Service  Company  filing and its Street  Lighting
Tariff.  If not resolved,  these issues may be consolidated  into the rate case.
The electric  base rate case is scheduled to be  transferred  from the Office of
Administrative  Law back to the BPU by May 1, 2003.  The Ratepayer  Advocate and
other  parties  filed  testimony in this case in October 2002 and the case is on
schedule.

Standard Market Design Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR)

Form 10-K, Page 17. On July 31, 2002 the FERC issued a NOPR to create a Standard
Market Design for the wholesale  electricity  markets in the United States.  The
NOPR seeks to improve the  consistency  of market rules  throughout the country,
including  issues related to reliability,  market power concerns,  transmission,
pricing, congestion,  governance and other issues. We cannot predict the outcome
of this  matter or its impact  upon us if  adopted,  which  could  significantly
affect transmission and generation in the various markets in which we operate.

Deferral Proceeding

New Matter. In August 2002, PSE&G filed a petition  proposing changes to the SBC
and NTC. The proposed result, if adopted, will result in a reduction of revenues
of about $122  million or  approximately  a 3.4%  reduction  in amounts  paid by
customers  effective  on August 1, 2003.  The case has been  transferred  to the
Office of Administrative Law.

Deferral Audit

New Matter.  In September 2002, the BPU retained the services of two audit firms
to  conduct  a review  of the  State's  electric  utility's  deferred  costs for
compliance  with BPU orders.  PSE&G has  estimated  an  overrecovery  balance of
approximately $30 million by the end of July 2003.

BGSS Filing

New  Matter.  In  September  2002,  PSE&G  filed  with the BPU to  increase  its
Residential BGSS Commodity  Charge by November 1, 2002 to recover  approximately
$89 million in additional  revenues ($83 million of which is associated  with an
underrecovered  balance) or a 7.4% rate increase for the typical residential gas
heating customer.

                                TERMS OF OPTIONS

Section 6.1 Option Provisions. The Committee may grant Options within the limits
of the express provisions of the Plan. An Option shall enable the Participant to
purchase from the Company,  at any time during a specified  exercise  period,  a
specified  number of shares of Common  Stock at a specified  Option  Price.  The

following: -

      (a) The Option Price of the shares of Common  Stock of Options  granted in
tandem with Dividend Equivalents and/or Performance Units shall not be less than
the Fair Market  Value of such shares of Common Stock as of the time such Option
is granted.

      (b)  Any  Option  granted  in  tandem  with  Dividend  Equivalents  and/or
Performance  Units  shall  be  administered  in  Award  Cycles  relating  to the
performance  of the Company  and/or one or more of its  Affiliates  throughout a
period determined by the Committee. The Committee shall define the length of any
such Award  Cycle,  as well as one or more  goals for each such  Award  Cycle to
measure such performance.

      (c) The Option  Price of the shares of Common Stock of Options not granted
in tandem with Dividend Equivalents and Performance Units shall be determined by
the Committee, in its sole discretion.

      (d) In no event shall  Option  granted  under the Plan have an  expiration
date  later  than ten (10)  years  from the date of its  grant  and all  Options
granted  under the Plan shall,  be subject to earlier  termination  as expressly
provided in this Article VI.

      (e) Unless  otherwise  provided in any option agreement under the Plan, an
Option granted under the Plan shall become exercisable,  in whole at any time or
in part from time to time,  but in no case may an Option (i) be  exercised as to
less than one  hundred  (100)  shares of  Common  Stock at any one time,  or the
remaining  shares of Common Stock covered by the Option if less than one hundred
(100), and (ii) become fully  exercisable more than ten (10) years from the date
of its grant. Except as otherwise provided herein, (i) Options granted in tandem
with Dividend  Equivalents  and/or  Performance  Units shall not be  exercisable
prior to the  conclusion of their related Award Cycle and (ii) all other Options
shall not be exercisable until one (1) year after the date of grant.

      (f) An Option granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the delivery by
the holder  thereof to the Company at its principal  office (to the attention of
the  Compensation  Manager  of Public  Service  Electric  and Gas  Company,  the
Company's  subsidiary)  of written notice of the number of full shares of Common
Stock  with  respect  to which the  Option is being  exercised,  accompanied  by
payment in full,  in cash or by certified or bank check  payable to the order of
the  Company,  of the Option  Price of such shares of Common  Stock,  or, at the
discretion of the Committee,  by the delivery of  unexercised  Options having an
exercise  value equal to the Option Price and/or shares of Common Stock having a
Fair Market Value equal to the Option Price, or, at

<PAGE>

the option of the Committee,  by a combination  of cash and/or such  unexercised
Options and/or shares (subject to the restrictions  above) held by a Participant
that has an exercise  value or a Fair Market Value  together with such cash that
shall  equal the Option  Price.  The Option  Price may also be paid in full by a
broker-dealer   to  whom  the  Participant  has  submitted  an  exercise  notice
consisting of a fully endorsed Option, or through any other medium of payment as
the Committee, in its discretion, shall authorize.

      (g) The holder of an Option shall have none of the rights of a Stockholder
with respect to the shares of Common Stock covered by such holder's Option until
such shares of Common  Stock shall be issued to such holder upon the exercise of
the Option.

      (h) No Options granted under the Plan shall be transferable otherwise than
by will or the laws of descent and  distribution,  and any Option  granted under
the Plan may be exercised  during the lifetime of the holder thereof only by the
holder.  No  Option  granted  under  the Plan  shall be  subject  to  execution,
attachment or other process.

      (i) Except as otherwise  provided herein,  the right to exercise an Option
shall expire when the Participant  shall no longer be an employee of the Company
or Affiliate.

Section 6. 2 Dividend  Equivalents.  Dividend Equivalents granted in tandem with
an Option under the Plan shall be in such form and shall  contain such terms and
conditions as the Committee  shall from time to time  determine,  subject to the
following:

      (a) Number.  The number of Dividend  Equivalents  granted to a Participant
under the Plan with  respect to an Award  Cycle  shall be equal to the number of
shares  of Common  Stock  with  respect  to which  Options  are  granted  to the
Participant for such Award Cycle.

      (b) Amount. The amount of each Dividend  Equivalent granted under the Plan
shall be equal to the  cumulative  cash dividends per share actually paid by the
Company on its Common Stock during the applicable Award Cycle.

      (c) Term of Dividend Equivalents. A Dividend Equivalent shall be paid to a
Participant if, and only if, and to the extent that, the  Participant  exercises
the Option that was granted in tandem with the  Dividend  Equivalent  within the
first nine months that the Option is  initially  exercisable.  If a  Participant
partially  exercises  the Option within the first nine months that the Option is
initially  exercisable,  Dividend Equivalents with respect to the same number of
shares shall be paid to the Participant.  If the Option, or portion thereof,  is
not  exercised  within the first nine months after it is initially  exercisable,
the related  Dividend  Equivalent  or portion  thereof  shall  terminate  and be
forfeited,  and the Participant  shall have no right whatsoever to such Dividend
Equivalent or portion thereof.

      (d) Manner of Payment. Dividend Equivalents shall be paid in cash.

Section 6. 3  Performance  Units.  Performance  Units  granted in tandem with an
Option  under the Plan  shall be in such form and shall  contain  such terms and
conditions as the Committee  shall from time to time  determine,  subject to the
following:

<PAGE>

      (a) Number. The number of Performance Units granted to a Participant under
the Plan with  respect to an Award  Cycle shall be equal to the number of shares
of Common Stock which has been granted to the  Participant  for such Award Cycle
pursuant to the related Option.

      (b)  Amount.  The  Committee  shall  determine  the  target  value of each
Performance  Unit  as of  the  date  it is  granted.  The  actual  value  of the
Performance  Unit at the end of the  Award  Cycle  shall  be  determined  by the
Committee  by  reference  to  performance  by the  Company  and/or  one or  more
Affiliate  relative to the goal or goals  established  by the  Committee for the
Award Cycle at the time of grant;  provided,  however,  that the Committee  may,
subsequent  to the date of  grant,  adjust  such  goal or goals to  account  for
extraordinary extenuating circumstances so as to equitably reflect what would be
a consistent application of the goal or goals over the Award Cycle.

      (c) Term and Manner of Payment for Performance  Units. A Performance  Unit
shall be paid to a  Participant  if, and only if, and to the  extent  that,  the
Participant exercises the Option that was granted in tandem with the Performance
Unit within the first nine months that the Option is initially exercisable.  The
actual  value of the  Performance  Units  granted  in tandem  with such  Option,
determined as of the end of the Award Cycle, shall be paid to the Participant in
cash.  If a  Participant  does not  exercise  the  Option  within  such  initial
nine-month  period,  the  related  Performance  Units  shall  terminate  and  be
forfeited.  If the Participant  partially  exercises the Option within the first
nine months that the Option initially becomes exercisable, the Participant shall
be so paid in cash with respect to the number of Performance  Units equal to the
number of Shares  for which the  Option  is  exercised,  and shall  forfeit  the
balance of such Performance Units.

Section 6.4 Retirement or Disability.  Except as otherwise provided herein, upon
termination  of  employment  with the  Company  or an  Affiliate  on  account of
Retirement or  Disability,  all Options not in tandem with Dividend  Equivalents
and  Performance  Units shall become  exercisable in full,  and any  Participant
holding any such Options may exercise  such Options at any time within three (3)
years after the date of such termination,  subject to the provisions of Section.
6.7. In addition, and anything contained hereto to the contrary notwithstanding,
the term during which a Participant may exercise Options  subsequent to the date
of  termination  may, in the  Committee's  discretion,  be modified,  subject to
applicable law and regulation,  from the term specified above, as of the date of
grant and as specified in an option  agreement  evidencing  the grant of Options
under the Plan.  With  respect  to a  Participant  holding  one or more  Options
granted in tandem with  Dividend  Equivalents  arid/or  Performance  Units,  who
terminates  employment prior to the end of the related Award Cycle(s) on account
of Disability or Retirement,  and who survives to the end of the Award Cycle(s),
then, if the Participant had been actively employed for at least one year during
such Award Cycle(s),  the Committee may, in its sole  discretion,  at the end of
the applicable Award Cycle(s), permit the Participant to participate in the Plan
with respect to such Award Cycle(s). If the Committee permits the Participant to
so participate with respect to such Award Cycle(s),  such participation shall be
upon the  same  terms  and  conditions  as if the  Participant  continued  to be
employed by the Company or an Affiliate, except to the extent that the Committee
in its sole  discretion  shall modify such terms and  conditions and except that
(1) the  Participant's  award  (Options,  Dividend  Equivalents  and Performance
Units) shall be prorated to reflect his or her employment  during the applicable
Award Cycle(s),  (2) any Dividend Equivalents and Performance Units shall expire
no later than nine months following the end of the applicable Award Cycle(s) and

<PAGE>

(3) any related  Options  shall  expire no later than three (3) years  following
termination of employment.

In the event that a  Participant  holding one or more Options  granted in tandem
with  Dividend  Equivalents  and/or  Performance  Units  terminates   employment
following the  conclusion of the related Award Cycle on account of Disability or
Retirement,  then to the extent the Participant has any unexercised Options with
respect  to such  Award  Cycle at the time of  termination  of  employment,  the
Participant  shall have the same rights as an active  employee  with  respect to
such Options,  except that any Dividend  Equivalents and Performance Units shall
expire no later  than nine  months  following  the end of the  applicable  Award
Cycle(s)  and all such  Options  shall  expire on the  sooner of three (3) years
following  termination  of  employment  or on the date  specified in the related
Option agreement.

Section 6.5 Death. If a Participant dies holding an Option granted not in tandem
with Dividend  Equivalents  (Performance Units (i) while employed by the Company
or a Affiliate  or (ii) within three (3) months  after the  termination  of such
Participant's  employment on account of Retirement or  Disability,  such Options
shall become  exercisable in full and, subject to the provisions of Section 6.7,
may be  exercised  by such  Participant's  personal  representative  at any time
within three (3) years after the Participant's death.

With respect to a Participant holding one or more Options granted in tandem with
Dividend  Equivalents and/or Performance Units, who terminates  employment prior
to the end of the related Award  Cycle(s) on account of death,  or dies prior to
the end of the Award Cycle(s) following  Disability or Retirement,  then, if the
Participant  had been  employed by the Company or an Affiliate  for at least one
year during such Award  Cycle(s),  the Committee,  in its sole  discretion,  may
determine that the Participant shall be entitled to an award with respect to the
applicable   Award   Cycle(s),   in  which  case  the   Participant's   personal
representative  shall have rights  similar to the rights the  Participant  would
have had at the end of the applicable Award Cycle(s), except that: (1) the right
of the personal  representative to exercise any Options shall commence as of the
date of the  Participant's  death and shall expire no later than three (3) years
after  the date of the  Participant's  death;  (2) the  amount  of the  prorated
Dividend Equivalents shall be paid to the Participant's personal  representative
in cash as soon as practicable; and (3) if appropriate in the sole discretion of
the  Committee,  a prorated  amount  appropriately  reflecting  the value of the
Performance Units shall be paid to the Participant's personal  representative in
cash as soon as practicable.

If a Participant  holding  Options  granted in tandem with Dividend  Equivalents
and/or Performance Units terminates employment on account of death after the end
of the related Award Cycle, the Participant's personal representative shall have
the same rights as the Participant  had at the time of his or her death,  except
that: (1) the right of the Participant's personal representative to exercise any
unexercised  Option shall expire no later than three (3) years after the date of
the Participant's  death; (2) the amount of any remaining  Dividend  Equivalents
shall be paid to the Participant' s personal  representative  in cash as soon as
practicable; and (3) the final value of any remaining Performance Units shall be
paid  to  the  Participant'  s  personal  representative  in  cash  as  soon  as
practicable.

Section  6.6 Other  Termination  of  Employment.  In the event that  Participant
holding Options granted in tandem with Dividend  Equivalents  and/or Performance
Units terminates employment

<PAGE>

following the  conclusion of an Award Cycle  otherwise than on account of death,
Disability or Retirement, then such Participant shall have the same rights as an
actively employed Participant, except that all Options, Dividend Equivalents and
Performance  Units  shall  expire  on the  earliest  of  nine  months  following
termination of employment,  the date specified in the related Option  agreement,
or the date otherwise  applicable to the Dividend  Equivalent and/or Performance
Unit.

Section  6.7 No  Extension.  An Option  may not be  exercised  pursuant  to this
Article VI except to the extent  that the  Participant  holding  such Option was
entitled to exercise  the Option at the time of  termination  of  employment  or
death and, in any event, may not be exercised after the original expiration date
of the Option.

Section 6.8 Change in Control.

      (a)  Notwithstanding   anything  in  this  Plan  to  the  contrary,  if  a
Participant's  employment  is  terminated  by the Company  following a Change in
Control (as defined below),  (i) all outstanding  Options shall immediately vest
and  become  exercisable  in full  and  (ii)  any  Dividend  Equivalents  and/or
Performance  Units granted in tandem with such Option shall be paid  immediately
in the form of Common Stock (unless the Committee determines that they should be
paid in cash). The amount so payable in respect of such Performance  Units shall
be calculated as if the target value with respect to such Performance  Units had
been achieved and, in respect of such Dividend Equivalents,  shall be calculated
as if the Award Cycle had been completed and the most recent quarterly  dividend
had continued to be paid through the end of such Award Cycle.

      (b) "Change in Control"  shall mean the occurrence of any of the following
events:

            (i) any  "person"  (within  the  meaning  of  Section  13(d)  of the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time (the "Act"))
      is or becomes the beneficial  owner within the meaning of Rule l3d-3 under
      the Act (a "Beneficial Owner"),  directly or indirectly,  of securities of
      the  Corporation  (not including in the securities  beneficially  owned by
      such person any securities  acquired  directly from the Corporation or its
      affiliates)  representing  25% or more of the combined voting power of the
      Corporation's  then  outstanding  securities,  excluding  any  person  who
      becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a transaction described
      in clause (A) of paragraph (iii) below; or

            (ii) the following  individuals cease for any reason to constitute a
      majority of the number of  directors  then  serving:  individuals  who, on
      December 15, 1998,  constitute the Board of Directors and any new director
      (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection
      with an actual or threatened  election contest,  including but not limited
      to a consent  solicitation,  relating to the  election of directors of the
      Corporation)  whose  appointment  or election by the Board of Directors or
      nomination for election by the Corporation's  stockholders was approved or
      recommended by a vote of at least  two-thirds  (2/3) of the directors then
      still in office who either were  directors  on December  15, 1998 or whose
      appointment,  election  or  nomination  for  election  was  previously  so
      approved, or recommended; or

<PAGE>

            (iii)  there  is  consummated  a  merger  or  consolidation  of  the
      Corporation  or any direct or  indirect  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of the
      Corporation  with any  other  corporation,  other  than  (A) a  merger  or
      consolidation   which  would  result  in  the  voting  securities  of  the
      Corporation  outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation
      continuing  to  represent  (either by  remaining  outstanding  or by being
      converted  into voting  securities of the  surviving  entity or any parent
      thereof),  in  combination  with the  ownership  of any  trustee  or other
      fiduciary'  holding  securities  under  an  employee  benefit  plan of the
      Corporation  or any  subsidiary  of the  Corporation,  at least 75% of the
      combined  voting  power  of the  securities  of the  Corporation  or  such
      surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding  immediately after such
      merger or  consolidation,  or (B) a merger or  consolidation  effected  to
      implement a recapitalization  of the Corporation (or similar  transaction)
      in which no  person  is or  becomes  the  Beneficial  Owner,  directly  or
      indirectly,  of securities of the Corporation  representing 25% or more of
      the  combined  voting  power  of  the   Corporation's   then   outstanding
      securities; or

            (ix) the stockholders of the Corporation  approve a plan of complete
      liquidation or  dissolution of the  Corporation or there is consummated an
      agreement  for  the  sale  or  disposition  by the  Corporation  of all or
      substantially  all of  the  Corporation's  assets,  other  than a sale  or
      disposition  by  the  Corporation  of  all  or  substantially  all  of the
      Corporation's  assets to an entity,  at least 75% of the  combined  voting
      power of the voting  securities of which are owned by  stockholders of the
      Corporation in  substantially  the same  proportions as their ownership of
      the Corporation immediately prior to such sale.

Notwithstanding the foregoing subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), a "Change
in Control"  shall not be deemed to have occurred by virtue of the  consummation
of any transaction or series of integrated  transactions  immediately  following
which the  record  holders of the common  stock of the  Corporation  immediately
prior  to  such   transaction  or  series  of  transactions   continue  to  have
substantially  the same  proportionate  ownership in an entity which owns all or
substantially  all of the assets of the Corporation  immediately  following such
transaction or series of transactions.

Section  6.9  Vesting on  Account of Death.  In  addition,  and  notwithstanding
anything  contained  herein to the contrary,  in the event an  Participant  dies
during such time as the  Participant is employed by the Company or an Affiliate,
then any  outstanding  Options which have not vested and are not  exercisable by
the Participant as of the date of death shall be automatically deemed vested and
exercisable by the Participant's personal  representative and/or his legatees in
accordance with Section 6.5.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Section  7.1  Leaves.  For the  purposes of the Plan,  a  Participant  who is on
military or sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence  shall be  considered
as  remaining  in the employ of the Company or of a Affiliate or for ninety (90)
days or such  longer  period  as such  Participant's  right to  reemployment  is
guaranteed either by statute or by contract.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                    ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

Section 8.1 Recapitalization. In the event that the outstanding shares of Common
Stock are  hereafter  changed by reason of  recapitalization,  reclassification,
stock split,  combination  or exchange of shares of Common Stock or the like, or
by the issuance of dividends  payable in shares of Common Stock,  an appropriate
adjustment  shall be made by the Committee in the aggregate  number of shares of
Common Stock  available  under the Plan, in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable  upon  exercise of  outstanding  Options or  Performance  Units and the
Option  Price  per  share.  In the event of any  consolidation  or merger of the
Company with or into another  company or the conveyance of all or  substantially
all of the  assets of the  Company  to another  company,  each then  outstanding
Option  shall,  upon  exercise,  thereafter  entitle the holder  thereof to such
number of shares of Common  Stock or other  securities  or  property  to which a
holder  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  would  have  been  entitled  to upon such
consolidation,  merger  or  conveyance;  and,  in  any  such  case,  appropriate
adjustment,  as  determined by the  Committee,  shall be made as set forth above
with respect to any future changes in the  capitalization  of the Company or its
successor entity. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the
Company,  all outstanding  Options under the Plan will automatically  terminate,
unless  otherwise  provided by the Board or any  authorized  committee  thereof;
provided,  however, that the Committee shall give at least 30 days prior written
notice of such event to each Participant  during which time he or she shall have
a right to  exercise  his or her  unexercised  Options,  and,  subject  to prior
expiration as otherwise  provided in this Plan,  each such Stock Option shall be
exercisable after receipt of such written notice and prior to the effective date
of such transaction.  In the event a Participant  elects to so exercise any such
Option, any related Dividend Equivalents and Performance Units shall also become
payable to the  Participant  adjusted,  in the discretion of the  Committee,  to
proportionately  reflect the partially completed Award Cycle(s).  In the event a
Participant does not elect to so exercise any such Option,  any related Dividend
Equivalent,  adjusted,  in the discretion of the Committee,  to  proportionately
reflect  the  partially  completed  Award  Cycle(s),   shall  terminate  and  be
automatically  paid to the  Participant  in cash,  and any  related  Performance
Units, adjusted, in the discretion of the Committee,  to proportionately reflect
the partially  completed  Award  Cycle(s),  shall be  automatically  paid to the
Participant in Common Stock and/or cash as determined by the Committee,  on such
date  within  30  days  prior  to the  effective  date of  such  transaction  or
dissolution  as the  Committee  shall  determine  and,  in the  absence  of such
determination,  on the last  business day  immediately  prior to such  effective
date.

Section  8.2  Unexercised  Options.  Any  adjustment  in the number of shares of
Common Stock shall apply  proportionately to only the unexercised portion of the
Options granted  hereunder.  If fractions of shares of Common Stock would result
from any such  adjustment,  the  adjustment  shall be revised to the next higher
whole number of shares of Common Stock.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               FURTHER CONDITIONS

Section 9.1 Representation by the Participant. Unless the shares of Common Stock
issuable  upon the exercise of an Option to be awarded  under the Plan have been
registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission under the Securities Act
prior to the exercise of the Option, the Participant  receiving such Option must
represent in writing to the Company that such shares of

<PAGE>

Common Stock are being acquired for investment purposes only and not with a view
towards  the  further  resale or  distribution  thereof  and must  supply to the
Company such other  documentation  as may be required by the Company,  unless in
the  opinion  of  counsel  to the  Company  such  representation,  agreement  or
documentation is not necessary to comply with such law.

Section 9.2 Exchange Listing.  The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any
shares of Common Stock until they have been listed on each  securities  exchange
on which the  shares of Common  Sock may then be listed or until  there has been
qualification  under or  compliance  with such state or federal  laws,  rules or
regulations as the Company may deem applicable. The Company shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain such listing, qualification and compliance.

Section 9.3 Tax  Withholding.  The Committee may make such  provisions  and take
such steps as it may deem  necessary or appropriate  for the  withholding of any
taxes that the Company is required by any law or regulation of any  governmental
authority,  whether federal, state or local, domestic or foreign, to withhold in
connection with the exercise of any Option,  including,  but not limited to, (i)
the  withholding  of  delivery of shares of Common  Stock until the  Participant
reimburses  the Company for the amount the Company is required to withhold  with
respect  to such  taxes,  (ii) the  canceling  of any number of shares of Common
Stock  issuable in an amount  sufficient to reimburse the Company for the amount
it is required to so withhold or (iii)  withholding the amount due from any such
Participant's  wages or other  compensation.  A Participant may request that the
Company  withhold  from the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of
an Option  that  number of shares  having a Fair  Market  Value equal to the tax
withholding amount due in order to provide for such withholding tax.

                                    ARTICLE X

including  any  previously  granted  Option  granted  in tandem  with a Dividend
Equivalent and/or  Performance Unit prior to the completion of the related Award
Cycle.

Section 10.3 Effect on Outstanding  Awards. No action taken pursuant to Sections
10.1 or 10.2 may  materially  and  adversely  affect the rights of a Participant
under any outstanding Option without the consent of such Participant.

the Company, or of any Affiliate, to terminate the employment of any Participant
or to terminate any other relationship with a Participant.

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                            OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS

Section  13.1 No Effect on Other  Plans.  The  adoption  of this Plan  shall not

defined  by Rule  16a-l(c)  under the  Exchange  Act) made under the Plan or any
rights or interests therein shall be assignable or transferable by a Participant
except by will or the laws of descent and  distribution and except to the extent
it is otherwise  permissible  under the Exchange Act, nor shall any  "derivative
security"  be subject to  execution,  attachment  or similar  process,  it being
understood  that no grant of any  "derivative  security"  shall be assignable or
transferable  pursuant to a domestic  relations order.  During the lifetime of a
Participant,   awards  granted  hereunder  shall  be  exercisable  only  by  the
Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative. Any attempted
assignment,   transfer,  pledge,  hypothecation,   other  disposition,  levy  of
attachment or similar process not  specifically  permitted  herein shall be null
and void and without effect.
