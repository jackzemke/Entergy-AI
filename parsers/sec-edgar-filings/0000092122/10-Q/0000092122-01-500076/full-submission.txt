           CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking and historical
information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates,"
"believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. The registrants caution that
there are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly,
there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
factors include the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation
and restructuring of the electric utility industry and also changes in
environmental and other laws and regulations to which SOUTHERN and its
subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of existing laws and
regulations; current and future litigation, including the pending EPA civil
action against certain of the integrated Southeast utilities and the race
discrimination litigation against certain of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; the
effects, extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets
of SOUTHERN's subsidiaries; potential business strategies, including
acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to
be completed or beneficial; internal restructuring or other restructuring
options that may be pursued by SOUTHERN; state and federal rate regulation in
the United States; political, legal and economic conditions and developments in
the United States; financial market conditions and the results of financing
efforts; the impact of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and
customer demand; weather and other natural phenomena; the performance of
projects undertaken by the non-traditional business and the success of efforts
to invest in and develop new opportunities; the timing and acceptance of
SOUTHERN's new product and service offerings; the ability of SOUTHERN to obtain
additional generating capacity at competitive prices; and other factors
discussed elsewhere herein and in other reports (including Form 10-K) filed from
time to time with the SEC.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                   FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Effective April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed a spin off of
its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares to SOUTHERN's shareholders
in a tax free distribution. Shares from the spin off were distributed at a rate
of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every share of SOUTHERN
common stock held at the record date. As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's
March 31, 2001 financial statements reflect Mirant as discontinued operations.

SOUTHERN is now focusing on three main businesses in the Southeast: its
traditional business, represented by its five integrated Southeast utilities
providing electric service in four states; a growing competitive generation
business in the eight state "Super Southeast" region; and energy-related
products and services for its retail customers.

Earnings

SOUTHERN's reported consolidated net income for the first quarter of
2001 was $320 million ($0.47 per share), compared to $245 million ($0.38 per
share) for the corresponding period of 2000. Excluding Mirant's contributions,
SOUTHERN's first quarter 2001 earnings from operations were $180 million ($0.26
per share), compared with $151 million ($0.23 per share) in the first quarter of
2000. The increase in earnings for the current quarter is primarily due to
higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:
                                                 Increase (Decrease)
                                           -------------------------------
                                                     First Quarter
                                           -------------------------------
                                             (in thousands)        %
Retail sales..........................          $99,770            5.6
Sales for resale......................           82,117           46.2
Other revenues........................           36,028           39.6
Fuel expense..........................           83,408           15.9
Purchased power expense...............           39,597           53.2
Maintenance expense...................           14,915            7.1

     Retail sales revenue. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not
affect net income, retail sales revenue was up by $47 million in the first
quarter of 2001 from the same period in 2000 due to a 0.9% increase in retail
energy sales. Retail energy sales were higher during the current quarter due
primarily to weather and growth in the number of customers served by the
integrated Southeast utilities.

     Sales for resale. The increase in this first quarter of 2001 from the same
period in 2000 reflects increased demand for energy by non-affiliates. Since
this energy is usually sold at variable cost, these transactions do not have a
significant impact on earnings. Wholesale energy sales from Plant Dahlberg which
went into service in the second quarter of 2000 also contributed to the sales
for resale revenue increase in the first quarter of 2001.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

     Other revenues. During the first quarter of 2001, other revenues were
higher than the amount recorded in the same period in 2000 due primarily to
increased revenues from gas-fueled cogeneration steam facilities, higher
revenues from transmission of electricity for others and pole attachment rentals
and fuel clause adjustments. Revenues from cogeneration activities are generally
offset by fuel expenses and do not have a significant impact on earnings. The
fuel clause adjustments reflect the difference between recoverable costs and the
amounts actually reflected in current rates; further, the recovery provisions
generally equal related expenses and have no material effect on net income.

     Fuel expense. For the first quarter of 2001, fuel expenses increased from
the same period in 2000 due primarily to increased generation from gas-fueled
plants at a time of higher natural gas prices. Since energy expenses are usually
offset by energy revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on
earnings.

     Purchased power expense. This expense increased during the first quarter of
2001 from the same period in 2000 due primarily to higher costs associated with
these purchases as well as increased demand related to the drought in GEORGIA's
service area. Since energy expenses are usually offset by energy revenues, these
expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. These expenses increased in the first quarter of 2001
when compared to the same period in 2000 due primarily to scheduled work
performed at steam generating, transmission and distribution facilities.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the integrated Southeast
utilities to achieve energy sales growth while containing cost in a more
competitive environment; and the profitability of the new competitive
market-based wholesale generating facilities being added. For additional
information relating to the other businesses, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Other
Business" in the Form 10-K. Also, reference is made to Note (B) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for information relating to the spin
off of Mirant.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SOUTHERN is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Effective January 1, 2001, SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries adopted FASB Statement
No. 133, as amended, and changed the method of accounting for derivative
instruments. All derivatives are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet at fair market value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for additional information on the
adoption of Statement No. 133.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SOUTHERN's financial condition during the first three months of
2001 included $670 million used for gross property additions to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were from
operations and other long-term debt. See SOUTHERN's Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows for further details. Reference is made to SOUTHERN's
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income herein for information
relating to other comprehensive income.

Financing Activities

In February 2001, GEORGIA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes consisting of $200 million of Series F 5.75% Senior Notes due
January 31, 2003 and $150 million Series G 6.20% Senior Notes due February 1,
2006. The proceeds of the sale were applied to redeem $200 million of 6 5/8%
Series First Mortgage Bonds due April 2003 and to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. Also in February 2001, GEORGIA issued $100
million of Series H 6.70% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due March 1, 2011. The
proceeds of this sale were used to repay an additional portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. In April 2001, ALABAMA sold, through a
public authority, $10 million of variable rate demand revenue bonds due April 1,
2031. In May 2001, GEORGIA issued $90 million of Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due
May 8, 2003. The proceeds of this sale will be used to redeem in June 2001 the
$75 million outstanding principal amount of GEORGIA's 6.35% Series, First
Mortgage Bonds due August 1, 2003 and to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     The market price of SOUTHERN's common stock at March 31, 2001 with Mirant
was $35.09 per share and the book value was $15.37 per share, representing a
market-to-book ratio of 228%, compared to $33.25, $15.69 and 212%, respectively,
at the end of 2000. The dividend for the first quarter of 2001 was $0.335 per
share.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements", "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" of
SOUTHERN in the Form 10-K for a description of the SOUTHERN system's capital
requirements for its construction program, sinking fund requirements and
maturing debt, and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately $468 million
will be required by March 31, 2002 for redemptions and maturities of long-term
debt. Also, the integrated Southeast utilities plan to continue, to the extent
possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with
lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, SOUTHERN may
require additional equity capital during the remainder of the year. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2001, as well as in
subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment opportunities. The
integrated Southeast utilities plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past.
The amount, type and timing of any financings--if needed--will depend upon
market conditions and regulatory approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing
Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the SOUTHERN system had at
March 31, 2001 approximately $180 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $5.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support to variable rate
pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. SOUTHERN's integrated
Southeast utilities may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of each of the integrated Southeast utilities. At March 31, 2001,
the SOUTHERN system had short-term notes payable outstanding of $1.9 billion.
Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by
utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

ALABAMA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2001 was $70.0 million compared to $67.5 million for the corresponding period of
2000. The increase in first quarter 2001 earnings was primarily due to increased
operating revenues which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                    Increase (Decrease)
                                            -----------------------------------
                                                       First Quarter
                                            -----------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)          %
Retail sales...........................          $28,646                4.7
Sales for resale - non-affiliates......           14,331               14.9
Sales for resale - affiliates..........           46,464              162.1
Other revenues.........................           14,384               94.3
Fuel expense...........................           64,381               33.0
Purchased power - non-affiliates.......           15,437               81.8
Purchased power - affiliates...........            9,121               34.0

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was up by $4.3 million or 1% during the first
quarter of 2001 when compared to the same period in 2000. Energy sales to
industrial customers decreased as a result of a slower economy during the first
quarter of 2001; however, energy sales to residential and commercial customers
increased due to colder weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. For the first quarter of 2001 these
sales were higher when compared to the same period in 2000 due to increased
demand for energy by non-affiliates. These transactions did not have a
significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable
cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the SOUTHERN system, as
well as purchases of energy, will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. This increase in the first quarter of 2001 when compared to
the same period in 2000 is primarily due to an increase in revenue from
gas-fueled cogeneration steam facilities. Since cogeneration steam revenues are
generally offset by fuel expenses, these revenues did not have a significant
impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. Increased generation from gas-fueled plants at a time of
increased natural gas prices resulted in higher fuel expense for the first
quarter of 2001 when compared to the same period in 2000. Since energy expenses
are generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses did not have a
significant impact on earnings.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates
increased for the first quarter of 2001 when compared to the corresponding
period in 2000 due primarily to higher costs associated with these energy
purchases. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, ALABAMA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in ALABAMA's financial condition during the first three months of
2001 included the addition of approximately $194 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operating activities. See ALABAMA's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for
further details.

Financing Activities

In April 2001, ALABAMA sold, through a public authority, $10 million of variable
rate demand revenue bonds due April 1, 2031. ALABAMA plans to continue, to the
extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of ALABAMA
under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of ALABAMA's capital requirements
for its construction program, maturing debt and environmental compliance
efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, ALABAMA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, ALABAMA had at March 31,
2001 approximately $11 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused committed
lines of credit of approximately $925 million (including $418 million of such
lines under which borrowings may be made only to fund purchase obligations
relating to variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial
note program. ALABAMA may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of ALABAMA. ALABAMA has regulatory authority for up to $750 million
of short-term borrowings. At March 31, 2001, ALABAMA had outstanding $300.7
million of commercial paper, $89.6 million of extendible commercial notes, and
$56 million in notes payable to banks.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GEORGIA's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter
2001 was $107.7 million compared to $93.7 million for the corresponding period
in 2000. Earnings increased $14 million or 14.9% primarily due to increased
operating revenues which were partially offset by increased operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                             -------------------------------
                                                     First Quarter
                                             -------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)        %
Retail sales............................          $40,117            4.4
Sales for resale -  non-affiliates......           43,902          100.5
Sales for resale - affiliates...........           23,844          199.8
Other revenues..........................            8,527           31.6
Fuel expense............................           17,785            8.4
Purchased power - non-affiliates........           10,995           25.5
Purchased power - affiliates............           31,555           66.1
Other operation expense.................           16,591           10.4
Maintenance expense.....................            8,532            8.7

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue in the first quarter of 2001 was higher compared to
the same period in 2000 due primarily to increased energy sales to residential
and commercial customers. Residential and commercial energy sales were up by
7.7% and 7.6%, respectively, due mainly to growth in the number of customers and
weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the first quarter of 2001, these
revenues increased compared to the same period in 2000 as a result of the higher
demand for energy by non-affiliates. These transactions do not have a
significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable
cost. These revenues also reflect sales from Plant Dahlberg which went into
service in the second quarter of 2000.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. These revenues increased in the current quarter of 2001
when compared to the same period in 2000 due principally to higher revenues from
transmission of electricity for others and pole attachment rentals.

     Fuel expense. These expenses increased in the first quarter of 2001 when
compared to the same period in 2000 due primarily to increased generation from
fossil-fueled plants to meet higher energy demands. Since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses do not have a significant
impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. For the first quarter of 2001, power
purchased from non-affiliates increased when compared to the same period in 2000
due primarily to increased demand for energy as well as the effect of the
drought in GEORGIA's service area on hydro generation and increased prices for
natural gas and oil. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings
since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues.

     Other operation expense. Other operation expense increased during the first
quarter of 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000 as a result of
higher costs associated with uncollectible accounts and injuries and damages
expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The increase in this expense for the first quarter of
2001 when compared to the same period in 2000 is primarily attributed to
scheduled work performed at steam generating facilities and at transmission and
distribution facilities.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including weather, regulatory matters and energy sales.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GEORGIA is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K.

     GEORGIA will file a general rate case on July 2, 2001, in response to which
the Georgia PSC is expected to determine whether the current three-year rate
order should be continued, modified or discontinued when it ends on December 31,
2001. Under the order, GEORGIA's earnings are evaluated against a retail return
on common equity range of 10% to 12.5%. Reference is made to Note (H) in the
"Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of GEORGIA in the Form
10-K for additional information.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     On April 12, 2001, GEORGIA filed a fuel cost recovery case with the Georgia
PSC to increase the retail fuel rate. The purpose of the filing is to review the
current fuel price and consider adjusting that price to be more reflective of
current fuel market conditions and to collect the under recovery of prior costs.
Georgia state law allows GEORGIA to recover all fuel costs. As of March 31,
2001, GEORGIA was under recovered by $92.7 million. The Georgia PSC is expected
to decide the case on May 24, 2001.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues could affect earnings. For additional information, see Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Issues" of GEORGIA in the
Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (I) and (L) in the "Notes to the
Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Effective January 1, 2001, GEORGIA adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended,
and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives
are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market
value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in GEORGIA's financial condition during the first three months
of 2001 was the addition of approximately $385.5 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See GEORGIA's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

In February 2001, GEORGIA issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes consisting of $200 million of Series F 5.75% Senior Notes due
January 31, 2003 and $150 million Series G 6.20% Senior Notes due February 1,
2006. The proceeds of the sale were applied to redeem $200 million of 6 5/8%
Series First Mortgage Bonds due April 2003 and to repay a portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. Also in February 2001, GEORGIA issued $100
million of Series H 6.70% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due March 1, 2011. The
proceeds of this sale were used to repay an additional portion of GEORGIA's
outstanding short-term indebtedness. In May 2001, GEORGIA issued $90 million of
Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due May 8, 2003. The proceeds of this sale will be
used to redeem in June 2001 the $75 million outstanding principal amount of
GEORGIA's 6.35% Series, First Mortgage Bonds due August 1, 2003 and to repay a
portion of GEORGIA's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GEORGIA
under "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and "Environmental Issues" in the
Form 10-K for a description of GEORGIA's capital requirements for its
construction program and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GEORGIA
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GEORGIA had at March 31,
2001 approximately $36.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$1.765 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks. The credit arrangements
provide liquidity support to GEORGIA's obligations with respect to variable rate
pollution control bonds and its commercial paper program. GEORGIA may also meet
short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to issue and sell
commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of GEORGIA. At March 31,
2001, GEORGIA had outstanding $533.1 million of commercial paper. Management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.

                               GULF POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

GULF's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first quarter of
2001 was $10.2 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2000.
GULF's earnings were up primarily due to higher operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                  Increase (Decrease)
                                           -------------------------------
                                                     First Quarter
                                           -------------------------------
                                             (in thousands)        %
Retail sales..........................           $8,756            7.5
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.....            9,169           83.5
Other revenues........................            8,663            N/M
Fuel expense..........................            7,689           18.5
Purchased power - non-affiliates......            1,887           28.5
Purchased power - affiliates..........            8,408          266.2
- - - - - - - -------------
N/M - Not meaningful

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased $6.5 million or
9.3% during the first quarter of 2001 when compared to the same period of 2000.
The increase in retail sales revenue is related to increases in energy sales of
13.6%, 4.9% and 10.1% to residential, commercial and industrial customers,
respectively. The primary reasons for the energy sales increase are colder
weather in January, warmer weather in March, and growth in the number of
customers served by GULF.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the first quarter of 2001, these
revenues increased when compared to the same period in 2000 due primarily to
increased unit power energy sales. These transactions do not have a significant
impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at variable cost.

     Other revenues. The increase for the first quarter of 2001 is primarily
related to fuel clause adjustments made to other operating revenues to reflect
the difference between recoverable costs and the amounts actually reflected in
current rates. The recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses and
have no material effect on net income.

     Fuel expense. For the first quarter of 2001, fuel expenses increased when
compared to the same period in 2000 due mainly to increased generation to meet
higher energy demand. Since energy expenses are generally offset by energy
revenues, these expenses do not have a significant impact on net income.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The increase for the first quarter of
2001 when compared to the same period in 2000 is primarily attributed to an
increase in capacity and energy purchases to meet the demand for energy. Since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses do not
have a significant impact on net income.

     Purchased power - affiliates. Purchases of energy from affiliates within
the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, GULF is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
Earnings Potential" of GULF and Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs are not fully recovered through GULF's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.
For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other environmental
issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     In 1999, the Florida PSC approved GULF's plan to reduce its authorized rate
of return, reduce retail base rates and share revenues with its customers. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of GULF in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of GULF in the
Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Effective January 1, 2001, GULF adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended, and
changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives are
now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market value.
Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in GULF's financial condition during the first three months of
2001 included the addition of approximately $46.4 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and capital contributions from SOUTHERN. See GULF's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

GULF plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost
debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of GULF under
"Capital Requirements for Construction" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form
10-K for a description of GULF's capital requirements for its construction
program, environmental compliance efforts and maturing debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, GULF plans
to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, GULF had at March 31, 2001
approximately $2.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $52.5 million of
unused committed lines of credit with banks in addition to $61.9 million of
liquidity support for GULF's obligations with respect to variable rate pollution
control bonds. GULF may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for
the benefit of GULF. At March 31, 2001, GULF had short-term notes payable
outstanding of $20 million. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

MISSISSIPPI's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the first
quarter of 2001 was $9.8 million, compared to $6.7 million for the corresponding
period of 2000. Earnings increased in the first quarter of 2001 when compared to
the same period in 2000 due primarily to higher operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                             -------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                             -------------------------------
                                               (in thousands)        %
Retail sales............................          $13,617           13.5
Sales for resale - non-affiliates.......           13,726           51.7
Sales for resale - affiliates...........            7,407          161.7
Other revenues..........................            1,857           71.4
Purchased power - non-affiliates........           10,615          264.8
Purchased power - affiliates............           19,914          171.3


     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue was up by $0.9 million or 1.4% during the current
quarter of 2001 when compared to the corresponding period in 2000 due primarily
to increased energy sales to residential customers. Energy sales to residential
customers during the first quarter of 2001 increased due mainly to weather.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The increase in sales for resale to
non-affiliates during the first quarter of 2001, as compared to the same period
in 2000, is primarily due to increased demand for energy from these
non-affiliated companies.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other revenues. These revenues increased in the first quarter of 2001 when
compared to the same period in 2000 primarily as a result of sales of inventory.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the first quarter of 2001, purchased
power from non-affiliates was higher when compared to the same period in 2000
due mainly to the need to meet the higher demand for energy. These transactions
do not have a significant impact on net income since energy expenses are
generally offset by energy revenues.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment. Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in
rates under the PEP and ECO plans. The PEP has proven to be a stabilizing force
on electric rates, with only moderate changes in rates taking place. For
additional information, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, MISSISSIPPI is positioning
the business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. MISSISSIPPI's 2001 ECO Plan filing was approved, as
filed, by the Mississippi PSC on March 7, 2001 and resulted in a slight increase
in customer prices. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of MISSISSIPPI in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (G) and (M) in the "Notes to
the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Effective January 1, 2001, MISSISSIPPI adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as
amended, and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All
derivatives are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at
fair market value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed
Financial Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of
Statement No. 133.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in MISSISSIPPI's financial condition during the first three months
of 2001 included the addition of approximately $14.2 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and financing activities. See MISSISSIPPI's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Financing
Activity" and Note 4 to the financial statements of MISSISSIPPI in the Form
10-K. Effective May 4, 2001, in connection with commercial operation of a
1,064-megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility, MISSISSIPPI entered into the
initial 10-year lease term with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership. The
final completion cost will be approximately $370 million. Reference is made to
Note (M) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for
additional information.

     MISSISSIPPI plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
MISSISSIPPI under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of MISSISSIPPI's capital requirements for its
construction program, environmental compliance efforts, sinking fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, MISSISSIPPI
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, MISSISSIPPI had at
March 31, 2001 approximately $3.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $124.3 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks.
MISSISSIPPI may also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit
of MISSISSIPPI. At March 31, 2001, MISSISSIPPI had short-term notes payable
outstanding of $90.2 million. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

                       SAVANNAH ELECTRIC AND POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                    FIRST QUARTER 2001 vs. FIRST QUARTER 2000

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

SAVANNAH's net income for the first quarter of 2001 was $1.5 million as compared
to $1.6 million for the corresponding period of 2000. Earnings were down
slightly due primarily to higher operating expenses which fully offset higher
operating revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the
following:

                                                   Increase (Decrease)
                                              -------------------------------
                                                      First Quarter
                                              -------------------------------
                                                (in thousands)        %
Retail sales.............................           $8,634           17.3
Sales for resale - non-affiliates........              989          173.8
Sales for resale - affiliates............             (494)         (28.7)
Purchased power - affiliates.............            7,698           95.6
Maintenance expense......................            1,382           29.6


     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue increased by $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2001
when compared to the same period in 2000 due mainly to an increase in total
retail energy sales of 7.4%. Total retail energy sales increased as a result of
weather and growth in the number of customers served by SAVANNAH.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the first quarter of 2001, sales
for resale to non-affiliates increased due to higher demand for energy by these
non-affiliates when compared to the corresponding period in 2000. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
usually sold at variable cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the SOUTHERN system will vary from period to period depending on demand
and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Maintenance expense. During the first quarter of 2001, maintenance expenses
were higher when compared to the corresponding period in 2000 due primarily to a
scheduled major maintenance outage at one of SAVANNAH's plants.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     With the enactment of the Energy Act and new legislation being discussed at
federal and state levels to expand customer choice, SAVANNAH is positioning the
business to meet the challenge of increasing competition. For additional
information, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SAVANNAH in the Form
10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be offset. For additional information about the Clean Air Act and
other environmental issues, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of SAVANNAH in the Form 10-K.

     On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected certain elements of SOUTHERN's RTO
proposal. For additional information on the FERC's response to SOUTHERN's
proposal, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated Southeast
Utilities" in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is also made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of SAVANNAH in
the Form 10-K for information on EPA litigation.

     Reference is made to Notes (C) through (E), (G), (L) and (N) in the "Notes
to the Condensed Financial Statements" herein for discussion of various
contingencies and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

Effective January 1, 2001, SAVANNAH adopted FASB Statement No. 133, as amended,
and changed the method of accounting for derivative instruments. All derivatives
are now reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair market
value. Reference is made to Note (C) in the "Notes to the Condensed Financial
Statements" herein for additional information on the adoption of Statement No.
133.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in SAVANNAH's financial condition during the first three months of
2001 included the addition of approximately $11.1 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations and credit arrangements with banks. See SAVANNAH's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

Financing Activities

SAVANNAH plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION



Sources of Capital

SAVANNAH plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings--if needed--will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - - - - - - - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, SAVANNAH had at March 31,
2001 approximately $4.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$65.5 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks. SAVANNAH may
also meet short-term cash needs through a SOUTHERN subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of SAVANNAH.
At March 31, 2001, SAVANNAH had short-term notes payable outstanding of
$59.8 million. Since SAVANNAH has no major generating plants under
construction, management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)  The condensed financial  statements of the registrants included herein have
     been prepared by each registrant,  without audit, pursuant to the rules and
     regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of each registrant's management, the
     information   regarding  such  registrant  furnished  herein  reflects  all
     adjustments  necessary to present  fairly the results of operations for the
     periods  ended March 31, 2001 and 2000.  Certain  information  and footnote
     disclosures   normally  included  in  financial   statements   prepared  in
     accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
     States  have  been  condensed  or  omitted   pursuant  to  such  rules  and
     regulations,   although  each  registrant  believes  that  the  disclosures
     regarding such  registrant are adequate to make the  information  presented
     not misleading.  It is suggested that these condensed financial  statements
     of each registrant be read in conjunction with the financial  statements of
     such  registrant and the notes thereto  included in the Form 10-K.  Certain
     prior period amounts have been  reclassified to conform with current period
     presentation.  Due  to  seasonal  variations  in  the  demand  for  energy,
     operating  results for the periods  presented do not  necessarily  indicate
     operating results for the entire year.

(B)  Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
     Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Overview of
     Consolidated Earnings" and "Discontinued Operations" of SOUTHERN in Item 7
     of the Form 10-K for information on the spin off of Mirant.

     On April 2, 2001, SOUTHERN completed the spin off of Mirant with a tax
     free distribution to SOUTHERN's shareholders of its remaining ownership of
     272 million Mirant shares. Shares from the spin off were distributed at a
     ratio of approximately 0.4 share of Mirant common stock for every share
     of SOUTHERN common stock held at the record date.

     As a result of the spin off, SOUTHERN's financial statements reflect
     Mirant as discontinued operations. All historical financial statements
     presented and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to this
     presentation, with the historical assets and liabilities of Mirant
     presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as net assets of
     discontinued operations.

(C)  On January 1, 2001, SOUTHERN and its subsidiaries adopted FASB Statement
     No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"
     as amended. Statement No. 133 requires that certain derivative instruments
     be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured
     at fair value and that changes in the fair value be recognized currently
     in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

     SOUTHERN utilizes financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes
     in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Such financial
     instruments are generally structured so that their terms are substantially
     identical to (and their changes in market value are highly correlated to)
     those of SOUTHERN's recorded liabilities or unrecorded firm commitments.
     Thus, these instruments generally qualify as hedges under Statement No.
     133.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


      The integrated Southeast utilities also enter into commodity related
      forward and option contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on
      certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. Substantially
      all of the integrated Southeast utilities' bulk energy purchases and sales
      meet the definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many
      cases, these transactions meet Statement No. 133's normal purchase and
      sale exception and the related contracts are accounted for under the
      accrual method. Certain of these contracts qualify as cash flow hedges of
      anticipated transactions, resulting in the deferral of related gains and
      losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur.
      Any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in net income. Certain other
      contracts do not meet the hedge requirements and are marked to market
      through current period income.

      The cumulative effect of adoption was a reduction of approximately $300
      million in comprehensive income, which was all related to discontinued
      operations. The impact on net income was immaterial and less than $0.01
      per share, to each of the integrated Southeast utilities
      individually, as well as to SOUTHERN on a consolidated basis. The mark to
      market adjustments recorded during the first quarter of 2001 were also
      immaterial. However, the application and interpretation of Statement No.
      133's requirements is still evolving and further guidance from the FASB is
      expected, which could further impact the financial statements of SOUTHERN
      and the integrated Southeast utilities. Also, as wholesale energy markets
      mature, the accounting for future transactions could be significantly
      impacted by Statement No. 133, resulting in more volatility in net income
      and comprehensive income.

      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price
      Risk" of SOUTHERN and the integrated Southeast utilities in Item 7 for
      each of the registrants in the Form 10-K, and Note 1 to the financial
      statements of SOUTHERN under the caption "Financial Instruments for
      Non-Trading Activities" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(D)   SOUTHERN, ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH engage in price
      risk management activities. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
      AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" in SOUTHERN; and "Exposure to Market
      Risks," in ALABAMA, GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH. Reference is
      also made to Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for a discussion of these activities.

(E)   The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of FASB
      Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
      Regulation. In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no
      longer subject to these provisions, the company would be required to write
      off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
      recoverable, and determine if any other assets have been impaired. For
      additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of each
      registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(F)   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
      practices of the electric utility industry--including
      SOUTHERN's--regarding the recognition, measurement and classification in
      the financial statements of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating
      facilities. In response to these questions, the FASB is reviewing the
      accounting for liabilities related to the retirement of long-lived assets,
      including nuclear decommissioning. Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of SOUTHERN, ALABAMA
      and GEORGIA in Item 7 and Note 1 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA and GEORGIA under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" in
      Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(G)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN,
      ALABAMA , GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH in Item 8 of the Form
      10-K for information on EPA litigation.

(H)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements  of SOUTHERN
      and GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for  information  concerning  a
      three-year rate order approved by the Georgia PSC effective January 1,
      1999.  The  order  decreased  annual  retail  rates  by  $262  million
      effective  January 1, 1999 and by an additional $24 million  effective
      January 1, 2000. The order further provides for $85 million each year,
      plus up to $50 million  annually of any earnings  above a 12.5% retail
      return on common  equity  during  the second  and third  years,  to be
      applied to accelerated  amortization or depreciation of assets. In May
      2000,  the  Georgia PSC ordered  that these funds be  maintained  in a
      regulatory  liability  account  and that  interest  be  accrued on the
      account at the prime rate.  These amounts are reflected on the balance
      sheets in deferred credits and other liabilities, other. Two-thirds of
      any additional earnings above the 12.5% return will be applied to rate
      reductions and the remaining  one-third retained by GEORGIA.  Pursuant
      to this  provision,  GEORGIA  recognized  accelerated  amortization of
      $37.6  million in the first  quarter of 2001 and $36.6  million in the
      first quarter of 2000.

(I)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN and
      GEORGIA in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding GEORGIA's
      designation as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and other
      environmental contingencies.

(J)   SOUTHERN has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties regarding
      performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's trading and marketing
      subsidiaries.  At March 31, 2001, the total notional amount of guarantees
      was $202.7 million and the estimated fair value of net contractual
      commitments outstanding was approximately $63 million.  Based upon a
      statistical analysis of credit risk, SOUTHERN's potential exposure under
      these contractual commitments would not materially differ from the
      estimated fair value.  SOUTHERN also has guaranteed certain of Mirant's
      foreign currency swap transactions.  At March 31, 2001, notional amounts
      under these swaps were the differences between(pound)22 million and
      $33.7 million and between DM370 million and $205.6 million; however,
      due to favorable exchange rates SOUTHERN had no exposure under these
      guarantees.  The sterling and deutsche mark swaps expire in 2002 and 2003,
      respectively.  Subsequent to the spin off, Mirant began paying SOUTHERN
      a monthly fee of 1 percent on the average aggregate maximum principal
      amount of all guarantees outstanding until they are replaced or
      expire.  Mirant must use reasonable efforts to release SOUTHERN from all
      such support arrangements and will indemnify SOUTHERN
      for any obligations incurred.

      Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN under
      the caption "Guarantees" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

(K)   With respect to Mobile Energy, reference is made to Note 3 to the
      financial statements of SOUTHERN in Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in
      Item 3 of the Form 10-K for information relating to (i) petitions for
      Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief which were filed in the U. S. Bankruptcy
      Court for the Southern District of Alabama and (ii) proposed settlement
      discussions among the affected parties.

(L)   Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
      Item 8 and to Legal Proceedings in Item 3 of the Form
      10-K for information relating to various lawsuits.

(M)   Effective May 4, 2001, in connection with commercial operation of the
      1,064-megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at
      MISSISSIPPI's Plant Daniel (the "Facility"), MISSISSIPPI entered into
      the initial 10-year lease term under its lease arrangement
      for the Facility with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership.  The final
      completion cost will be approximately $370 million.
      The lease provides for a residual value guarantee (approximately 71% of
      the acquisition cost) by MISSISSIPPI that is due upon
      termination of the lease in certain circumstances.  The lease also
      includes purchase and renewal options.  Upon termination of
      the lease, at MISSISSIPPI's option, MISSISSIPPI may either exercise its
      purchase option or the facility can be sold to a third
      party. MISSISSIPPI expects the fair market value of the leased facility
      to substantially reduce or eliminate MISSISSIPPI's
      payment under the residual value guarantee.  The annual amount of future
      minimum operating lease payments exclusive of any
      payment related to this guarantee will approximate $30 million during
      the initial term.

(N)   On March 16, 2001, SAVANNAH submitted a filing with the Georgia PSC to
      establish a new fuel rate in order to better reflect
      current fuel cost and to collect the under-recovered balance.  On
      April 26, 2001, SAVANNAH received an order from the Georgia
      PSC allowing SAVANNAH to set the fuel cost recovery rate to recover its
      approximately $40 million deferred fuel balance over three
      years, and to recover approximately $137 million in projected annual
      fuel and purchased power costs, for a total recovery of
      about $150 million per year.  Reflected in the $137 million is a Georgia
      PSC ordered "cap" of $100 per megawatt on energy
      strips.  Any purchase agreement for summer energy strips priced in excess
      of the "cap" requires that the amount above $100 per
      megawatt be "imputed" as capacity and recovered through non-fuel rates.
      On May 11, 2001, SAVANNAH requested the Georgia PSC
      reconsider part of its order relating to the price of energy strips.
      The outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(O)   SOUTHERN's reportable business segment is the five integrated Southeast
      utilities that provide electric service in four states.
      Net income and total assets for discontinued operations are included in
      the Reconciling Eliminations columns. The All Other category includes
      parent SOUTHERN, which does not allocate operating expenses to business
      segments, and segments below the quantitative threshold for separate
      disclosure. These segments include telecommunications, energy products and
      services, and leasing and financing services. Intersegment revenues are
      not material. Financial data for business segments and products and
      services for the periods covered in the Form 10-Q are as follows:
