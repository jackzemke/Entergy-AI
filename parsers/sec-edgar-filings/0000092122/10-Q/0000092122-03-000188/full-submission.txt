"believes,"  "estimates,"  "projects,"  "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or
the negative of these terms or other  comparable  terminology.  The  registrants
caution that there are various important factors that could cause actual results
to differ  materially  from those indicated in the  forward-looking  statements;
accordingly,  there can be no  assurance  that such  indicated  results  will be
realized.  These  factors  include  the impact of recent and future  federal and
state  regulatory  change,  including  legislative  and  regulatory  initiatives
regarding  deregulation  and  restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in  environmental  and other laws and regulations to which Southern
Company and its subsidiaries  are subject,  as well as changes in application of

United States;  the  performance of projects  undertaken by the  non-traditional
business and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new  opportunities;
internal  restructuring  or other  restructuring  options  that may be  pursued;
potential business strategies,  including acquisitions or dispositions of assets
or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to Southern
Company or its  subsidiaries;  the ability of counterparties of Southern Company
and its  subsidiaries  to make  payments  as and when due;  the  effects of, and
changes  in,  economic  conditions  in the  areas  in which  Southern  Company's

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

                  SECOND QUARTER 2003 vs. SECOND QUARTER 2002
                                       AND
                     YEAR-TO-DATE 2003 vs. YEAR-TO-DATE 2002


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern  Company is focusing on three main  businesses  in the  Southeast:  its
traditional  business,  represented  by its five operating  companies  providing
regulated  retail  electric  service  in  four  states;  a  growing  competitive
generation  business in the Super  Southeast;  and  energy-related  products and
services  for  its  retail  customers.   For  additional  information  on  these
businesses,  see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Operating Companies," "Southern Power" and
"Other Business" in the Form 10-K.

Earnings

Southern Company's second quarter and year-to-date 2003 earnings were
$432 million ($0.60 per share) and $730 million ($1.01 per share), respectively,
compared with $331 million ($0.47 per share) and $556 million ($0.79 per share)
in the second quarter and year-to-date 2002. The second quarter and year-to-date
2003 earnings include a one-time after-tax gain of $88 million associated with
the termination in May 2003 of all PPAs between Southern Company subsidiaries,
Mississippi Power and Southern Power, and subsidiaries of Dynegy. Reference is
made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional
information. Earnings in the second quarter 2003 increased despite mild weather.
As a result of the mild weather, second quarter demand for electricity in the
retail service territory declined; however, the availability of low-cost
generation for the wholesale market resulted in increased sales to other
utilities and strong performance by Southern Company's competitive generation
business. Year-to-date 2003 earnings were also positively impacted by increased
demand for electricity in the first quarter 2003 and the overall impact of
regulatory rate proceedings in Alabama and Florida.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

         Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect
net income, retail sales revenue decreased by $17.5 million, or 1.1%, in the
second quarter 2003 and increased by $40 million, or 1.4%, year-to-date 2003
when compared to the same periods in 2002. Kilowatt-hour energy sales to
residential, commercial and industrial customers were down 4.1%, 1.3% and 1.1%,
respectively, for the second quarter 2003 primarily due to milder-than-normal
temperatures and the sluggish economy in the service territory. Year-to-date
2003 earnings increased due to colder weather in the first quarter 2003 and
customer growth when compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.

     Sales for resale. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases are
primarily attributed to increases of 27% and 33.3%, respectively, in wholesale
capacity and energy sales to these customers due to commercial operation of new
plants placed into service in June 2002 and June 2003 when compared to the same
periods in 2002. In addition, milder-than-normal weather in the retail service
territory resulted in additional available capacity for the wholesale markets.
Increased demand for energy as well as higher sales prices also contributed to
the increases in both of these reporting periods in 2003.

     Other electric revenues. Other electric revenues were higher in the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 when compared to the same periods in 2002
primarily due to $144 million in revenues recorded upon the termination of
Dynegy's PPAs. See Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
further information.

     Other revenues. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases in other
revenues are primarily attributed to revenues from Southern Company GAS, which
began operations in August 2002, as well as increases in revenues from Southern
LINC and from a subsidiary that provides services related to alternative fuel
products, when compared to the same periods in 2002.

     Fuel expense. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2003, fuel expense
increased as a result of an increase in the average cost of fuel; commercial
operation of Southern Power's new units in June 2002 and June 2003 and fuel
expenses associated with Southern Company GAS. Increases in fuel expense at the
operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not affect net
income.

     Purchased power expense. This expense increased in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 mainly due to the availability of power at prices lower than
the cost of self-generation and the Southern Company system power pool when
compared to the same periods in 2002. Increases in purchased power expenses at
the operating companies are generally offset by fuel revenues and do not affect
net income.

     Other operations expense. The increases in other operation expense for the
second quarter and year-to-date 2003 are primarily attributed to higher
administrative and general expenses related to commercial operation of Southern
Power's new units in June 2002 and June 2003; costs incurred in conjunction with
restructuring Mississippi Power's lease agreement for the combined cycle
generating units at Plant Daniel; property insurance and employee benefits and
operations at Southern Company GAS. Southern Company GAS began operations in
August 2002. Reference is made to Note (R) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information on Mississippi Power's restructured lease
agreement.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Losses from unconsolidated
subsidiaries remained stable in the second quarter 2003 but increased
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding period in the prior year
due to higher operating losses from Southern Company's investments in entities
that produce synthetic fuel. These losses are offset by income tax credits
generated by such entities. See Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further information on Southern Company's investments in these
entities and IRS reviews of the related tax credits.

     Interest income. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases when
compared to the same periods in 2002 are primarily a result of a favorable tax
settlement related to IRS audits for the years 1988 through 1999, excluding 1993
through 1995.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. The increases in this expense
in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 are mainly attributed to issuances,
net of redemptions, of $353 million in senior notes by the operating companies
since the corresponding periods in 2002.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The two major factors are the ability of the operating companies to
maintain a stable regulatory environment and achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale
generating business. For additional information relating to these issues, see
Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern
Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K and to Note (B) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information relating to Mirant. On July 14, 2003, Mirant
filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy
Code. Southern Company has various contingent liabilities associated with
Mirant, including guarantees, litigation and joint and several liabilities in
connection with the consolidated federal income tax return, as well as related
indemnifications under the separation agreement. The ultimate outcome of such
contingent liabilities cannot now be determined. Furthermore, the impact of
Mirant's bankruptcy filing on its related indemnity obligations, if any, cannot
now be determined.

     On April 30, 2003, Mirant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2002, which included its restated financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. The effect of these restatements on
Southern Company's financial statements, if any, cannot be determined until
Mirant's 2001 revised quarterly financial statements are filed. The impact of
the bankruptcy filing on the timing of filing 2001 revised quarterly financial
statements, if any, cannot now be determined. However, Southern Company's
management does not currently anticipate that a reaudit of Southern Company's
2000 or 2001 financial statements will be necessary.

     Southern Company's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


filed against Southern Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this
time; however, after consultation with legal counsel, management does not
anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would
have a material adverse effect on Southern Company's financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

     Reference is made to Note (D) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding Southern Company's investments in two entities that
produce synthetic fuel and receive tax credits pursuant to Section 29 of the
Internal Revenue Code. On June 30, 2003 the IRS issued an announcement that
suspended the issuance of new private letter rulings upon its initiation of
additional reviews of the significant chemical change requirement for such tax
credits. The IRS has notified both of the entities in which Southern Company
holds investments of related reviews. From the date of Southern Company's
investments in these entities through June 30, 2003, Southern Company has
recognized approximately $219 million of these synthetic fuel tax credits
through income. The ultimate outcome of the IRS reviews cannot be determined at
this time.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Reference is made to Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit.

     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. The Atlanta area is currently classified as
a "serious"  nonattainment area for the one-hour ozone standard under Title I of
the Clean Air Act.  All  "serious"  areas were  required to attain the  one-hour
ozone  standard by November  1999.  The EPA  provided an extension of the area's
compliance deadline to 2004, but on June 16, 2003, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals  held the EPA's  extension  policy to be invalid and remanded the matter
back to the EPA. In response,  the EPA is expected to  re-classify  Atlanta as a
"severe"  nonattainment  area with  respect  to the  one-hour  standard.  If the
Atlanta area fails to comply with the one-hour  standard by November  2005,  all
major sources of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic  compounds  located in the
nonattainment area,  including Georgia Power's Plants McDonough and Yates, could
be subject to payment of emissions fees currently estimated at $7,800-$8,000 per
ton, of nitrogen  oxides  emitted  above 80% of the  baseline  period.  Based on
average  emissions  at these  units over the past three  years,  such fees could
potentially  reach  $23  million  annually.  However,  Georgia  Power  does  not
anticipate  exceeding 80% of the baseline and,  therefore,  does not  anticipate
incurring  any such fees.  The final  outcome of this  matter will depend on the
development and implementation of applicable regulations.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


will depend on the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted;
however, Southern Company's revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities could be adversely affected by changes in the transmission
regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding a one-time gain of $88 million upon the amendment and
termination of PPAs between Dynegy and Mississippi Power and Southern Power. In
accordance with the amended PPA, Mississippi Power will recognize capacity
revenues totaling approximately $8.8 million for the period from June through
October 2003. Under the original terms of the PPAs, Mississippi Power and
Southern Power would have recognized revenue of approximately $1.8 million and
$5.9 million, respectively, for the remaining period of 2003 following the
terminations. Additionally, Mississippi Power and Southern Power are evaluating
options for their existing capacity. Southern Power has suspended construction
of Plant Franklin Unit 3. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
determined.

     Reference is made to Notes (A) through (I), (L) through (N) and (R) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Southern Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Southern Company's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. The
operating companies are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the
company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities
that are not specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets,
including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Southern Company
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Southern Company and the operating companies
reclassified $2.2 billion of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as
liabilities effective July 1, 2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did
not have a material effect on Southern Company's Statements of Income and Cash
Flows.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION




     FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
requires the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity to consolidate
the related assets and liabilities. On July 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted
Interpretation No. 46 with no financial statement impact following completion of
restructuring Mississippi Power's lease arrangement for the combined cycle
generating units at Plant Daniel. See Financial Condition - "Off-Balance Sheet
Financing Arrangements" below and Note (R) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for further information on the lease restructuring.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Southern Company's financial condition during the first six
months of 2003 included $1.1 billion used for gross property additions to
utility plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were
primarily obtained from operating activities, issuances of senior notes and
other long-term debt. See Southern Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of an operating
lease agreement with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"), a
special purpose entity, to use a combined-cycle generating facility located at
Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel. The facility cost approximately $370 million.
Reference is made to Note 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information. In June 2003, Escatawpa sold
its ownership interests in the facility to Juniper Capital L.P. ("Juniper").
Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement with
Mississippi Power. The terms of the lease with Juniper are substantially the
same as the lease with Escatawpa. In accordance with Interpretation No. 46,
Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities. Furthermore, the restructured lease agreement is an operating lease
under FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases." Reference is made to Note
(R) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company and its subsidiaries do not have any credit agreements that
would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result
of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts that could require
collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. These contracts are primarily for physical
electricity purchases and sales, fixed-price physical gas purchases and
agreements covering interest rate swaps. At June 30, 2003, the maximum potential
collateral requirements under the electricity purchase and sale contracts and
financial instrument agreements were approximately $382 million. Generally,
collateral may be provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit
or cash. At June 30, 2003, there were no material collateral requirements for
the gas purchase contracts.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Southern Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, the operating companies have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the operating companies and Southern Power enter into fixed
price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market and, to a lesser extent, similar contracts for gas purchases.
Also, the operating companies have each implemented fuel-hedging programs at the
instruction of their respective PSCs. The fair value of derivative energy
contracts at June 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the PSC-approved fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory
assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are
included in fuel expense and are recovered through the operating companies' fuel
cost recovery clauses. In addition, unrealized gains and losses on electric and
gas contracts used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in
Other Comprehensive Income. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent
hedges are recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At June 30, 2003,
the fair value of derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial
statements was as follows:

     For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2003, approximately $1
million and $0.5 million, respectively, of gains were recognized in income,
compared to $3.7 million and $(6.1) million, respectively, of gains (losses)
recognized in income during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2002.

     Southern Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of
nonperformance by the parties to the derivative energy contracts. Southern
Company's policy is to enter into agreements with counterparties that have
investment grade credit ratings by Moody's and S&P or that provide adequate
collateral; therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate nonperformance by
the counterparties. For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" of Southern Company
in the Form 10-K, Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company in Item
8 of the Form 10-K and Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

Financing Activities

During the first half of 2003, Southern Company subsidiaries issued $1,970
million of senior notes, $125 million of preferred stock and $75 million of
other long-term debt. The issuances were used to refund long-term senior notes
and other long-term debt. The remainder was used to reduce short-term debt and
fund ongoing construction programs. Reference is made to Southern Company's
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details on
financing activities during the first half of 2003.

     In July 2003, Gulf Power issued $60 million of Series G 4.35% Senior Notes
due July 15, 2013 and $60 million of Series H 5.25% Senior Notes due July 15,
2033. The proceeds of the Series G Senior Notes were used to pay at maturity the
$60 million outstanding principal amount of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes due
August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the Series H Senior Notes will be used to redeem
in August 2003 the $46.7 million outstanding principal amount of the Series A
6.70% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038. The remainder will be
used to repay a portion of Gulf Power's short-term indebtedness.

     In July 2003, Southern Power issued $575 million of 4.875% Senior Notes,
Series C due July 15, 2015. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a
substantial portion of existing short-term indebtedness; to settle interest rate
hedges associated with this financing; and for general corporate purposes.

     In July 2003, Alabama Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swaps
are for a notional amount of $250 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.35% and
mature in December 2006.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In July 2003, Georgia Power entered swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with variable rate pollution control bonds. The swaps are for a
notional amount of $873.3 million at an average fixed interest rate of 1.388%
and mature in December 2004. Also in July 2003, Georgia Power entered a swap to
hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate note with a coupon of
LIBOR plus 10 basis points. The swap is for a notional amount of $50 million at
a fixed interest rate of 1.5625% and matures in January 2005. Further in July
2003, Georgia Power entered a U.S. Treasury lock to hedge interest payments
associated with a 10-year debt issuance planned in August 2003. The swap is for
a notional amount of $100 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.465%.

     In July 2003, Savannah Electric entered a swap to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swap
is for a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.025% and
matures in December 2013.

     The market price of Southern Company's common stock at June 30, 2003 was
$31.16 per share and the book value was $12.67 per share, representing a
market-to-book ratio of 246%, compared to $28.39, $12.16 and 233%, respectively,
at the end of 2002. The dividend for the second quarter 2003 was $0.343 per
share compared to $0.335 per share in the second quarter 2002. In July 2003,
Southern Company increased the dividend to $0.35 per share for the third quarter
2003.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and "Environmental
Matters" of Southern Company in the Form 10-K for a description of the Southern
Company system's capital requirements for its construction program, sinking fund
requirements, maturing debt and environmental compliance efforts. Approximately
$699 million will be required by June 30, 2004 for redemptions and maturities of
long-term debt. Also, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, to
the extent possible, a program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these
securities with lower-cost capital.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described, Southern Company
may require additional equity capital over the next several years. The amounts
and timing of additional equity capital to be raised will be contingent on
Southern Company's investment opportunities. The operating companies and
Southern Power plan to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
internal sources and the issuances of new debt and preferred equity securities,
term loans and short-term borrowings. However, the amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon market conditions and regulatory
approval. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" of Southern Company in
the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Southern Company's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well
as scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

                  THE SOUTHERN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Southern Company
system had at June 30, 2003 approximately $211 million of cash and cash
equivalents and approximately $3.2 billion of unused credit arrangements with
banks, of which $76 million expire in 2003, $2.5 billion expire in 2004 and $665
million expire in 2005 and beyond. Of the facilities maturing in 2003 and 2004,
$2.2 billion contain provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at the
expiration date. These unused credit arrangements also provide liquidity support
to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper programs. Due to a
reduction of commercial paper and variable rate pollution bonds requiring
liquidity support, the Southern Company system reduced its credit arrangements
from $4.3 billion at March 2003 to $3.2 billion by the end of June 2003. The
operating companies may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern
Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of each of the operating
companies. At June 30, 2003, the Southern Company system had extendible
commercial notes outstanding of zero, short-term notes payable outstanding of
$32 million and commercial paper outstanding of $1.4 billion. Management
believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing
lines of credit without maintaining large cash balances.


PART I

Item 3.       Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk"
herein for each registrant and Note 1 to the financial statements of each
registrant in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Reference is also made to Note (L) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information relating to derivative
instruments.

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures.

(a)      Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, Southern Company,
the operating companies and Southern Power conducted separate evaluations under
the supervision and with the participation of each company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon
those evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information relating
to each company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be
included in periodic filings with the SEC.

(b)      Changes in internal controls.

There have been no significant changes in Southern Company's, the operating
companies' or Southern Power's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect these internal controls subsequent to the date each company
carried out its evaluation.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Alabama Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $106.6 million and $198.4 million,
respectively, compared to $115.7 million and $188.3 million, respectively, for
the corresponding periods of 2002. Earnings decreased $9.1 million, or 7.9%, in
the second quarter of 2003 primarily due to higher operating expenses that were
partially offset by the favorable settlement of income tax audits. Earnings
year-to-date 2003 increased by $10.1 million, or 5.4%, principally due to the
effect of increased market based prices in sales for resale - non-affiliates and
the favorable effect of the settlement of income tax audits.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Retail sales. Excluding energy cost recovery revenues and revenues from
Rate CNP, Certificated New Plant, associated with PPAs certificated by the
Alabama PSC which generally do not affect net income, retail sales revenues
decreased by $7.6 million, or 1.4%, for the second quarter 2003, but increased
$12.9 million, or 1.2%, year-to-date 2003, when compared to the same periods in
the prior year. Reference is made to Note (F) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for additional information. During the second quarter 2003,
retail energy sales were impacted by milder-than-normal temperatures and as a
result decreased slightly when compared to the corresponding period in 2002. The
year-to-date 2003 increase can primarily be attributed to favorable weather
conditions and slight sales growth in the first three months of this year, as
well as a 2 percent increase in retail base rates that went into effect in April
2002 as a result of Rate RSE, Rate Stabilization and Equalization.

                              ALABAMA POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the second quarter 2003, the
revenues associated with sales for resale to non-affiliates increased due to an
11.8% increase in market based prices even though overall sales of energy for
the quarter decreased 2.4% when compared to the corresponding period in 2002.
The year-to-date increase in sales for resale to non-affiliates in 2003 is due
to a 7.6% increase in energy sold and a 10.3% increase in price when compared to
the corresponding period in 2002. Sales of energy will vary depending on demand,
market based prices and the availability of Southern Company system generation.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies within the Southern Company
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings since the related
energy is sold at marginal cost, and energy purchases are generally offset by
energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

     Other revenues. During the second quarter 2003, other revenues increased
primarily due to a $3.8 million increase in revenues from Alabama PSC-approved
fees charged to customers for connection, reconnection and collection when
compared to the same period in 2002. The year-to-date 2003 increase is primarily
due to an $11.7 million increase in revenues from cogeneration steam facilities
due to higher gas prices, a $7.3 million increase in revenues from fees charged
to customers for connection, reconnection and collection and a $5.7 million
increase in revenues from transmission for others when compared to the same
period in 2002. Since cogeneration steam revenues are generally offset by fuel
expenses, these revenues do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Fuel expense. During the second quarter 2003, fuel expense remained flat
because generation decreased 8.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2002
while the price of fuel increased 9.9%. However, year-to-date 2003 fuel expense
increased when compared to the corresponding period in 2002 mainly due to a
10.3% increase in fuel prices while generation remained relatively flat. Since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues, these expenses did not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the second quarter and year-to-date
2003, purchased power from non-affiliates increased when compared to the same
periods in the prior year. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases
are primarily attributed to a 103.9% and 119.1% increase in price, respectively.
These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy
expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy
cost recovery clause.

     Other operation expense. The increase in other operation expense for the
second quarter 2003 is mainly a result of a $10.9 million increase in
administrative and general expenses. The increase in administrative and general
expenses primarily relates to a $5.5 million increase in property insurance and
a $3.4 million increase in employee benefits. The year-to-date 2003 increase in
other operation expense when compared to the same period in 2002 is primarily
due to a $20.3 million increase in administrative and general expenses, a $3.4
million increase in nuclear expense and a $2.9 million increase in steam
expense. The increase in administrative and general expenses mainly relates to a
$7.7 million increase in property insurance, a $7.3 million increase in employee
benefits and a $2.2 million increase in injuries and damages expense.

     Depreciation and amortization. The increases for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 are attributed to an increase in utility plant-in-service when
compared to the same periods in 2002.

     Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary. Refinancing of higher
distribution rate trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter 2002 led to
decreases in this item in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003.

     Income taxes. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 decreases in income
tax expenses are primarily attributed to the tax settlement related to tax
audits covering the years 1988 through 1999, excluding the years 1993 through
1995, which increased net income by $4.7 million.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including Alabama Power's ability to achieve energy sales growth while
containing costs and maintaining a stable regulatory environment. Growth in
energy sales is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new short- and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand and the
rate of economic growth in Alabama Power's service area. For additional
information relating to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Alabama Power in the Form 10-K.

     Alabama Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Reference is made to Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "FERC
Matters" of Alabama Power in the Form 10-K for information on the formation of
an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of proposed rulemaking regarding
open access transmission service and standard electricity market design. In
April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related to its proposed rulemaking
regarding open access transmission service and standard electricity market
design in an effort to respond to certain of the public comments received on the
standard market design proposal. Reactions to the White Paper by Southeastern
state regulators reflect significant continuing differences in opinion between
the FERC and various state regulatory commissions over questions of jurisdiction
and protection of retail customers. These significant differences between state
and federal regulators create substantial uncertainty related to the ultimate
approval of SeTrans because state commission approval of the transfer of
operational control of the transmission assets of Southern Company and its
subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of SeTrans. Pending energy
legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of the other FERC proposals
on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on the form in which final
rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Alabama Power's revenues, expenses,
assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by changes in the
transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In June 2003, during a special session of the State of Alabama Legislature,
a tax reform package was passed subject to approval by the voters of Alabama on
September 9, 2003. If the tax reform package passes, the impact to Alabama
Power's overall tax liability should not be significant.

     Reference is also made to Notes (A), (E), (F), (H), (L) and (N) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Alabama Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Alabama
Power's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Alabama Power is
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Alabama Power's
operations is no longer subject to these provisions, Alabama Power would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable and determine if any other assets, including plant,
have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Alabama Power accrued
for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Alabama Power reclassified $300 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on
Alabama Power's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Alabama Power's financial condition during the first six months
of 2003 included the addition of approximately $360 million to utility plant.
The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operating activities. See Alabama Power's Condensed Statements of
Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Alabama Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Alabama Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Alabama Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Alabama Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Alabama Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Alabama Power has also implemented
a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Alabama PSC. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at June 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in
fuel expense and are recovered through Alabama Power's fuel cost recovery
clause. Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are
recognized in the Statements of Income as incurred. At June 30, 2003, the fair
value of derivative energy contracts reflected in the financial statements was
as follows:

     For the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $(0.1)
million and $1 million, respectively, of (losses) gains were recognized in
income. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.3
million and $2.4 million, respectively, of losses were recognized in income.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risk" of Alabama Power in the Form
10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Alabama Power in Item 8 of the
Form 10-K and to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein.

Financing Activities

Alabama Power issued a total of $620 million of Senior Notes in the first
quarter 2003. The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem $557 million of
Senior Notes and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, Alabama
Power redeemed $194 million of Senior Notes in the first quarter 2003 from
proceeds obtained from a December 2002 issuance of $200 million of Senior Notes.

     Also in the first quarter 2003, Alabama Power issued 1,250 shares ($125
million) of Preferred Stock. The proceeds of this issue were used to repay a
portion of Alabama Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness and for other
general corporate purposes.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In April 2003, Alabama Power issued $195 million of Series W Floating Rate
Extendible Senior Notes due April 23, 2006, the initial maturity date, unless
the maturity of all or a portion of the principal amount is extended by
investors to April 23, 2007. The proceeds from the sale were used by Alabama
Power for general corporate purposes, including Alabama Power's continuous
construction program.

     In May 2003, Alabama Power issued $250 million of Series X 3.125% Senior
Notes due May 1, 2008. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay at
maturity $250 million in aggregate principal amount of the Series M 7.85% Senior
Notes due May 15, 2003.

     In the second quarter 2003, Alabama Power issued a total of 625,000 shares
of common stock to Southern Company at $40.00 a share ($25,000,000 aggregate
purchase price). The proceeds from the sale were used by Alabama Power for
general corporate purposes.

     In July 2003, Alabama Power entered into swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swaps
are for a notional amount of $250 million at a fixed interest rate of 2.35% and
mature in December 2006.

     Alabama Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS of Alabama Power under "Capital Requirements," "Other Capital
Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of
Alabama Power's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt
and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described
herein, Alabama Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and
other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type
and timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     Alabama Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of
scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Alabama Power had at June
30, 2003 approximately $29.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, unused
committed lines of credit of approximately $619 million (including $454 million
of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to
variable rate pollution control bonds) and an extendible commercial note
program. These lines of credit, unless extended, will expire at various times
during 2004. Alabama Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a
Southern Company subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and
extendible commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Alabama

Power and other  Southern  Company  subsidiaries.  Alabama Power has
regulatory authority for up to $1 billion of short-term borrowings.  At June 30,
2003,  Alabama Power had $59 million  outstanding  in  commercial  paper and $12
million outstanding in notes payable to banks. Management believes that the need
for working  capital can be adequately met by utilizing  lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Georgia Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the
second quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $158.5 million and $291.8 million,
respectively, compared to $170.8 million and $297.5 million for the
corresponding periods in 2002. Earnings were down by $12.3 million, or 7.2%, for
the second quarter 2003 primarily due to lower operating revenues. Year-to-date
2003 earnings were down slightly by $5.7 million, or 1.9%, as a result of higher
non-fuel operating expenses and lower retail base revenues.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which generally do not affect net
income, retail sales revenue decreased by $30 million, or 4%, in the second
quarter 2003 and $7.3 million, or 0.5%, year-to-date 2003 when compared to the
corresponding periods in 2002. During the second quarter 2003, energy sales to
residential, commercial and industrial customers were down by 6%, 1.5% and 3.5%,
respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year.
Milder-than-normal temperatures and a sluggish economy during the second quarter
2003 are the primary causes for these reductions in energy sales. Year-to-date
2003, energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers remained
relatively flat.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The decrease in the second quarter 2003
and the increase year-to-date 2003 in sales for resale to non-affiliates is
related to the demand for energy by these customers. In the second quarter 2003,
the demand for energy by non-affiliates was down by 17.8%. Year-to-date 2003,
the demand for energy by non-affiliates was up by 9.0%. These transactions did
not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at
variable cost.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. During the
second quarter and year-to-date 2003, energy sales to affiliates increased 83.4%
and 124.6%, respectively, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings since this
energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

     Fuel expense. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2003, fuel expense was
higher primarily due to increases of 9.1% and 7.1%, respectively, in the average
cost of fuel. These expenses do not have a significant impact on earnings since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Georgia Power's
fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. Purchased power from non-affiliates was
down in the second quarter 2003 when compared to the same period in the prior
year principally due to lower demand for energy. Year-to-date 2003, these
purchases were higher due mainly to increased demand for energy and the higher
average unit cost of energy purchased by Georgia Power. These expenses do not
have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset
by energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Purchased  power - affiliates.  During the second quarter and  year-to-date
2003,  purchased  power from  affiliates  increased  as a direct  result of PPAs
between  Georgia Power and Southern Power that began in June 2002 and June 2003.
The capacity  component of these  transactions  increased  $13.2  million in the
second quarter 2003 and $36.8 million  year-to-date 2003 as compared to the same
periods  in 2002.  The  energy  component  of power  purchased  from  affiliated
companies  within the Southern  Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating  resources at each company and will have
no significant  impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through Georgia Power's fuel cost recovery clause.

     Depreciation and amortization. The decreases in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 are attributed to lower regulatory charges necessary to
levelize purchased power costs under the terms of the retail rate order
effective January 1, 2002. These decreases are offset by an increase in
purchased power costs discussed above. All purchased power costs will be
reflected in rates evenly from 2002 through 2004 under the retail rate order
effective January 1, 2002.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. This item increased during
the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 mainly as a result of the issuances of
$1.2 billion in senior notes since the same periods in 2002.

     Other income (expense), net. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003
increases are primarily attributed to increased income related to a new
electricity pricing program and $14.5 million of interest on a favorable tax
settlement as compared to the same periods in 2002. The new electricity pricing
program contributed $7.2 million and $10.1 million to the increase for the
second quarter and year-to-date 2003, respectively.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K.

     In January 2002, Georgia Power began operating under a three-year retail
rate order. Under the terms of the order, earnings will be evaluated annually
against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.95 percent.
Two-thirds of any earnings above the 12.95 percent return will be applied to
rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by Georgia Power. Retail
rates were decreased by $118 million effective January 1, 2002. Purchases under
PPAs will be reflected in rates evenly over the next three years under the
retail rate order effective January 1, 2002. Reference is made to Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and Note 3 to
the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     On May 23, 2003, Georgia Power filed for a fuel cost recovery rate
increase. Reference is made to Note (G) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Georgia
Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected
by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power
market.

     In June 2002, Georgia Power entered into a fifteen-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Southern Power to purchase 1,040 megawatts of capacity from the
planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh to be built and owned by Southern
Power. The annual capacity cost is expected to be approximately $72 million.
Reference is made to Note (P) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the FERC approval process for this PPA.

     Additionally, Georgia Power has entered into a seven-year PPA beginning in
June 2005 with Duke Energy Trading & Marketing to purchase 620 megawatts with an
average annual capacity cost of approximately $48 million. Reference is made to
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" and
Note 4 under "Purchased Power Commitments" to the financial statements of
Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information, including information on the EPA litigation, see Item 7
- - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND Analysis - "Environmental Matters" of Georgia
Power and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the
Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for information regarding a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit.

     Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. The Atlanta area is currently classified as
a "serious" nonattainment area for the one-hour ozone standard under Title I of
the Clean Air Act. All "serious" areas were required to attain the one-hour
ozone standard by November 1999. The EPA provided an extension of the area's
compliance deadline to 2004, but on June 16, 2003, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals held the EPA's extension policy to be invalid and remanded the matter
back to the EPA. In response, the EPA is expected to re-classify Atlanta as a
"severe" nonattainment area with respect to the one-hour standard. If the
Atlanta area fails to comply with the one-hour standard by November 2005, all
major sources of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds located in the
nonattainment area, including Georgia Power's Plants McDonough and Yates, could
be subject to payment of emissions fees currently estimated at $7,800-$8,000 per
ton, of nitrogen oxides emitted above 80% of the baseline period.  Based on
average  emissions  at these  units over the past three  years,  such fees could
potentially  reach  $23  million  annually.  However,  Georgia  Power  does  not
anticipate  exceeding 80% of the baseline and,  therefore,  does not  anticipate
incurring  any such fees.  The final  outcome of this  matter will depend on the
development and implementation of applicable regulations.

     Georgia Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed against
Georgia Power cannot be predicted at this time; however, after consultation with
legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any,
arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Georgia
Power's financial statements.

     Reference is made to Notes (A), (E), (G) through (I), (L) and (P) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies
and other matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Georgia Power's significant  accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial  statements  of Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.  Georgia
Power's critical  accounting  policy involves rate regulation.  Georgia Power is
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,  "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of  Regulation." In the event that a portion of Georgia Power's
operations  is no longer  subject to these  provisions,  Georgia  Power would be
required to write off related  regulatory  assets and  liabilities  that are not
specifically  recoverable  and determine if any other assets,  including  plant,
have been impaired.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No.
143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003.
Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal
obligations associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The
present value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be
recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
asset's useful life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit
non-regulated companies to continue accruing future retirement costs for
long-lived assets that they do not have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to
January 2003, Georgia Power accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most
long-lived assets over the life of the related asset through depreciation
expense.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Georgia Power reclassified $940 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on
Georgia Power's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in Georgia Power's  financial  condition  during the first
six months of 2003 was the  addition of  approximately  $371  million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from  operations.  See Georgia  Power's  Condensed  Statements of Cash
Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Georgia Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sales contracts that could
require collateral -- but not termination -- in the event of a credit rating
change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided for by a
Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At June 30, 2003, the
maximum potential collateral requirements were approximately $228 million.

Exposure to Market Risks

Georgia Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed  materially  compared with the December 31, 2002  reporting  period.  In
addition,  Georgia Power is not aware of any facts or  circumstances  that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Georgia Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Georgia Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Georgia Power has also implemented
a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC. The fair
value of derivative energy contracts at June 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Realized gains and losses are recognized in the Statements of Income as
incurred. For the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately
$(0.1) million and $1.3 million of (losses) gains, respectively, were recognized
in income. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.3
million and $1.2 million of losses, respectively, were recognized in income.

Financing Activities

In February  2003,  Georgia  Power issued $250 million of Series L Floating Rate
Senior Notes due February 18, 2005. The proceeds from this issuance were used to
repay a portion of Georgia Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness.  Also in
February  2003,  Georgia  Power  issued  $150  million of Series M 5.40%  Senior
Insured Quarterly Notes due March 1, 2033. A portion of the proceeds was used to
redeem in March 2003 the $145 million outstanding principal amount of Georgia

Power's Series A 6 7/8% SeniorPublic Income Notes due December 31, 2047 and the
balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes.

     During March 2003, Georgia Power elected to change the interest rate mode
on $316 million of variable rate pollution control bonds. Georgia Power changed
$255 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode," which required backup bank
credit facilities, to the "auction rate mode." In addition, Georgia Power
changed $61 million of the bonds from the "daily rate mode" to the "long-term
interest rate mode."

     In April 2003, Georgia Power issued $100 million of Series N 5.750% Senior
Notes due April 15, 2023, $150 million of Series O 5.90% Senior Notes due April
15, 2033 and $50 million of Series P Floating Rate Senior Notes due April 15,
2005. The proceeds from these sales were used to repay a portion of Georgia
Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness and to repay at maturity all of
Georgia Power's Series I 5.25% Senior Notes due May 8, 2003.

     In July 2003, Georgia Power entered swaps to hedge interest payments
associated with variable rate pollution control bonds. The swaps are for a
notional amount of $873.3 million at an average fixed interest rate of 1.388%
and mature in December 2004. Also in July 2003, Georgia Power entered a swap to
hedge interest payments associated with a variable rate note with a coupon of
LIBOR plus 10 basis points. The swap is for a notional amount of $50 million at
a fixed interest rate of 1.5625% and matures in January 2005. Further in July
2003, Georgia Power entered a U.S. Treasury lock to hedge interest payments
associated with a 10-year debt issuance planned in August 2003. The swap is for
a notional amount of $100 million at a fixed interest rate of 4.465%.

     Georgia Power plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Georgia
Power under "Financing Activities," "Liquidity and Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Georgia Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

Georgia Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     Georgia Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs.

                              GEORGIA POWER COMPANY
                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Georgia Power had at June
30, 2003 approximately $10.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $725 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. These
credit arrangements expire in June 2004 and contain provisions allowing two-year
term loans executable at the expiration date and represent a reduction in the
previous level of credit arrangements due to reduced liquidity support
requirements as outlined in "Financing Activities" above. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to Georgia Power's obligations with
respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Georgia
Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary
organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at
the request and for the benefit of Georgia Power and other Southern Company
subsidiaries. At June 30, 2003, Georgia Power had outstanding $340 million of
commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working capital can be
adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining large cash
balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Gulf Power's net income after dividends on preferred stock for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $18.8 million and $32.8 million, respectively,
compared to $13.5 million and $25.2 million for the corresponding periods in
2002. Earnings in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increased by $5.3
million, or 39.3%, and $7.6 million, or 30%, respectively, as a result of higher
operating revenues that were only partially offset year-to-date 2003 with higher
operating expenses.

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding the recovery of fuel expense and certain other
expenses that do not affect net income, retail sales increased by $8.3 million,
or 8.7%, for the second quarter 2003 and by $21.3 million, or 12.2%,
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002. For both
of the above reporting periods, retail sales revenues were higher than the
corresponding periods in 2002 primarily due to an increase in the number of
customers and the retail rate increase which went into effect in June 2002.
During the second quarter 2003, retail energy sales to residential and
industrial customers increased by 1.2% and 8.1%, respectively, while energy
sales to commercial customers decreased by 1% as compared to the same period in
2002. For year-to-date 2003 as compared to 2002, retail energy sales to
residential, commercial and industrial customers increased by 0.2%, 0.6% and
8.2%, respectively.

     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies and purchases of energy within the
Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the availability and
cost of generating resources at each company. Gulf Power increased its
generating resources with commercial operation of Plant Smith in April 2002 and
thus had greater generation resources to sell to affiliates. These

transactions  do not have a significant  impact on earnings since this energy is
generally  sold at marginal cost and energy  purchases  are generally  offset by
energy revenues through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism.

     Other revenues. The second quarter 2003 decrease in other revenues when
compared to the same period in 2002 is primarily due to a $1.7 million
settlement, recorded in 2002, related to a PPA.

     Fuel expense. During the second quarter 2003, fuel expense increased from
the corresponding period in the prior year mainly due to a 78.5% increase in
natural gas prices and increased generation to meet demand. Year-to-date 2003,
fuel expense was higher because of commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3 in
April 2002, a 60.4% increase in natural gas prices and increased generation to
meet additional demand for energy. Since energy expenses are generally offset by
energy revenues through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism, these
expenses do not have a significant impact on net income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. The decreases in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002 are
directly related to commercial operation of Plant Smith Unit 3 which began
commercial operation in April 2002.

     Other operation expense. A number of factors caused the increases in other
operation expense in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 as compared to the
same periods in the prior year. Customer accounts expenses increased $0.5
million and $1.3 million; distribution expenses increased $0.5 million and $0.6
million; and administrative and general expenses increased $0.5 million and $2.2
million, respectively, for the second quarter and year-to-date 2003. Increased
relocation expenses and severance costs caused the change in the administrative
and general expenses.

     Maintenance expense. The decreases in maintenance expense during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 were primarily due to a decrease in planned
turbine and boiler inspections and repairs in 2003 compared to the same periods
in 2002.

     Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was higher in
the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 and was directly related to an increase
in utility plant-in-service, including Plant Smith Unit 3, when compared to the
corresponding periods in the prior year.

     Taxes other than income taxes. The increases in this item for the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 are primarily attributed to property taxes on
Plant Smith Unit 3 and revenue taxes related to the 2002 base rate increase.

     Other income (expense), net. The decreases in this item during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 as compared to the same periods in the prior year
were primarily a result of reductions in Allowance for Equity Funds Used During
Construction following the completion of Plant Smith Unit 3.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors. The major factors include regulatory matters and the ability to achieve
energy sales growth. For additional information relating to these issues, see

ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K.

     Gulf Power is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. Gulf Power's business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements, has increased generally throughout the United States. In
particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to
hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such
litigation currently filed against Gulf Power cannot be predicted at this time;
however, after consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate
that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a
material adverse effect on Gulf Power's financial statements.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered through
Gulf Power's Environmental Cost Recovery Clause. For additional information
about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note 3 to the financial
statements of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note (E) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding a recent ruling
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

     In 2002, the Florida PSC approved an annual base rate increase for Gulf
Power of $53.2 million which became effective in June 2002. Reference is made to
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Gulf Power in the Form 10-K for
information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Gulf Power's
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected by
changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power market.

     Reference is made to Notes (A), (E), (H), (I) and (L) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Gulf Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Gulf Power's
critical accounting policy involves rate regulation. Gulf Power is subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation." In the event that a portion of Gulf Power's operations is
no longer subject to these provisions, Gulf Power would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
and determine if any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Gulf Power accrued for
the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life of the
related asset through depreciation expense.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Gulf Power reclassified $115 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on
Gulf Power's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Gulf Power's financial condition during the first six months of
2003 included the addition of approximately $40.7 million to utility plant. The
funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily
from operations. See Gulf Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for
further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Gulf Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Gulf Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not
changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Gulf Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Gulf Power has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Gulf Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent,
similar contracts for gas purchases. Gulf Power has received approval from the
Florida PSC to recover prudently incurred costs related to its fuel hedging
program through the fuel cost recovery mechanism. The fair value of derivative
energy contracts at June 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets and
liabilities. Realized gains and losses from these programs are included in fuel
expense and are recovered through Gulf Power's fuel cost recovery clause. Gains
and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
income statement as incurred. At June 30, 2003, the fair value of derivative
energy contracts was reflected in the financial statements as follows:

Financing Activities

In January 2003, Gulf Power redeemed $40 million of 7.625% trust preferred
securities using the proceeds of $40 million in trust preferred securities
issued in December 2002 at a five-year initial fixed rate of 5.60%.

     In March 2003, Gulf Power issued $65 million of Series F Senior Insured
Quarterly Notes due April 1, 2033. The proceeds from this issue were used to
redeem, in April 2003, the $20 million Series B 7.50% Junior Subordinated Notes
due June 30, 2037 and, in May 2003, the $45 million of Series E Senior Notes due
January 30, 2012.

     In April 2003, Gulf Power sold through public authorities $29.075 million
of variable rate pollution control revenue refunding bonds due February 1, 2026
and $32.55 million of variable rate pollution control refunding bonds due June
1, 2023. The proceeds were used to redeem (1) $7.875 million aggregate principal
amount of water pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1993; (2)
$21.2 million of pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series 1996 and (3)
the outstanding amount of pollution control revenue refunding bonds, Series
1993. Both pollution control bonds issued in April 2003 will bear interest at a
rate to be determined by the auction rate process.

     In July 2003, Gulf Power issued $60 million of Series G 4.35% Senior Notes
due July 15, 2013 and $60 million of Series H 5.25% Senior Notes due July 15,
2033. The proceeds of the Series G Senior Notes were used to pay at maturity the
$60 million outstanding principal amount of Series C 4.69% Senior Notes due
August 1, 2003. The proceeds of the Series H Senior Notes will be used to redeem
in August 2003 the $46.7 million outstanding principal amount of the Series A
6.70% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038. The remainder will be
used to repay a portion of Gulf Power's short-term indebtedness.

     Gulf Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Gulf Power
under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital Requirements" and
"Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of Gulf Power's
capital requirements for its construction program, maturing debt and
environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Gulf Power
plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from
sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate earnings,
regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors. See Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Gulf Power had at June 30,
2003 approximately $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $66.3 million
of unused committed lines of credit with banks that expire in 2004. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to Gulf Power's obligations with respect
to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper. Gulf Power may
also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized
to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the
request and for the benefit of Gulf Power and other Southern Company
subsidiaries. At June 30, 2003, Gulf Power had outstanding $20 million of notes
payable and $31.7 million of commercial paper. Management believes that the need
for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without
maintaining large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $53.1 million and $74.5 million, respectively,
compared to $20.8 million and $34.8 million for the corresponding periods of
2002. Earnings increased by $32.3 million, or 155.2%, in the second quarter 2003
and $39.7 million, or 114.1%, year-to-date 2003 due primarily to a pre-tax gain
of $62 million related to the termination of a PPA with Dynegy. Reference is

     Retail sales. Retail sales revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 3.3%, in
the second quarter 2003 and $9 million, or 3.5%, year-to-date 2003 when compared
to the same periods in 2002. During the second quarter and year-to-date 2003,
retail sales revenues were down due mainly to decreased energy sales to
residential and industrial customers. The primary reasons for these decreases in
energy sales were milder weather and the continued economic slowdown in
Mississippi Power's service area.

     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. In the second quarter and year-to-date
2003, sales for resale to non-affiliates increased when compared to the same
periods in 2002 mainly due to increased prices associated with non-territorial
energy sales.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - affiliates and Purchased power - affiliates. Revenues
from sales for resale to affiliated companies, as well as purchases of energy,
within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and the
availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
generally sold at marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by
energy revenues through Mississippi Power's retail and wholesale fuel cost
recovery clauses.

     Contract termination. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2003, this
item reflects the $62 million of revenues recorded upon the termination of a PPA
with Dynegy. Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for additional information.

     Fuel expense and Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003, fuel expense decreased and purchased power from
non-affiliates increased when compared to the same periods in 2002 due to
opportunities to purchase some power more economically than to generate it and
due to a 1.5% reduction in demand for energy on a year-to-date basis. Since
energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi
Power's retail and wholesale fuel cost recovery clauses, these expenses do not
have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operation expense. The increases in this item during the second
quarter and year-to-date 2003 when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002
were caused primarily by the costs incurred in conjunction with restructuring
the lease agreement for the combined cycle generating units at Plant Daniel.
Reference is made to Note (R) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
additional information.

     Maintenance expense. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2003,
maintenance expenses were down when compared to the same periods in 2002
primarily due to scheduled maintenance performed at Plant Watson and Plant
Daniel in 2002.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and the effect of weather and the economy
on energy sales. For additional information relating to these issues, see Item 1
- - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K.

     Mississippi Power's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against Mississippi Power cannot be predicted at this time; however, after
consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse
effect on Mississippi Power's financial statements.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Mississippi Power's 2003 ECO Plan filing was approved, as filed, by the
Mississippi PSC on March 18, 2003 and resulted in a slight increase in rates
effective April 2003. Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other
environmental regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to
be recovered. For additional information about these issues, including the EPA
litigation, see Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental
Matters" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in the Form
10-K. Reference is made to Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Mississippi Power in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Mississippi
Power's revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities could be adversely affected
by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional power
market.

     Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding a one-time gain of $38 million upon the amendment and
termination of a PPA between Dynegy and Mississippi Power. In accordance with
the amended PPA, Mississippi Power will recognize capacity revenues totaling
approximately $8.8 million for the period from June through October 2003. Under
the original terms of the PPAs, Mississippi Power would have recognized revenue
of approximately $1.8 million for the remaining period of 2003 following the
termination. Also as a result of this PPA termination, Mississippi Power
continues to review alternatives for remarketing this capacity. The final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

     Reference is made to Notes (A), (E), (H), (M), (Q) and (R) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Mississippi Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Mississippi Power's critical accounting policies involve rate regulation and
lease accounting.

                            MISSISSIPPI POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Mississippi Power is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of Mississippi Power's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, Mississippi Power would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if
any other assets, including plant, have been impaired.

     Additionally, Mississippi Power accounts for its lease of two generating
units at Plant Daniel totaling 1,064 megawatts of capacity as an operating
lease. Reference is made to Note (R) of the Condensed Financial Statements
herein for an explanation of the restructuring activity that took place during
the second quarter of 2003 to allow for continued off-balance sheet accounting
treatment. Effective July 1, 2003, FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities" would have required Mississippi Power to consolidate
the assets and liabilities of Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), the special purpose entity, from which Mississippi Power leased
the units. Under the restructured lease with Juniper Capital, consolidation is
not required.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Mississippi Power
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

     FASB Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others" requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. This interpretation applies to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Mississippi
Power has recorded a $16 million liability for the fair value of its residual
value guarantee associated with the lease of two generating units at Plant
Daniel.

     FASB  Interpretation No. 46 requires the primary  beneficiary of a variable
interest  entity to consolidate the related assets and  liabilities.  On July 1,
2003,  Mississippi  Power  adopted  Interpretation  No.  46  with  no  financial
statement impact following the completion of restructuring the lease arrangement
for the combined cycle generating units at Plant Daniel. See Financial Condition
- -  "Off-Balance  Sheet  Financing  Arrangements"  and Note (R) to the  Condensed
Financial Statements herein for further information on the lease restructuring.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Mississippi Power reclassified $35 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on
Mississippi Power's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Mississippi Power's financial condition during the first six
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $26.6 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operating activities. See Mississippi Power's Condensed
Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In May 2001,  Mississippi  Power began the initial  10-year term of an operating
lease   agreement  with  Escatawpa,   a  special   purpose  entity,   to  use  a
combined-cycle  generating facility located at Mississippi Power's Plant Daniel.
The facility cost approximately $370 million. Reference is made to Note 8 to the
financial  statements  of  Mississippi  Power in Item 8 of the Form  10-K  under
"Lease  Agreements",  "Critical  Policies"  above and Note (R) to the  Condensed
Financial Statements herein for additional information.  In June 2003, Escatawpa
sold  its  ownership   interests  in  the  facility  to  Juniper   Capital  L.P.
("Juniper"). Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement
with Mississippi  Power.  The terms of the lease with Juniper are  substantially
the same as the lease with Escatawpa. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
46,  Mississippi  Power is not  required to  consolidate  the leased  assets and
related  liabilities.  Furthermore,  the  restructured  lease  agreement  is  an
operating   lease  under  FASB  Statement  No.  13,   "Accounting  for  Leases."
Accordingly,  the  lease is not  reflected  on the  condensed  balance  sheet of
Mississippi Power.

Credit Rating Risk

Mississippi Power does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade. There are certain fixed-price physical gas purchase contracts
that could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the event of
a credit rating change to below investment grade; however, at June 30, 2003,
this exposure was immaterial.

Exposure to Market Risks

Mississippi Power's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Mississippi Power is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Due to cost-based rate regulation, Mississippi Power has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Mississippi Power enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Mississippi Power has also
implemented retail fuel hedging programs at the instruction of its PSC and
wholesale fuel hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers. The
fair value of derivative, fuel and energy contracts was as follows:

     Unrealized  gains and losses from mark to market  adjustments  on contracts
related to the retail and  wholesale  fuel  hedging  programs  are  recorded  as

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     For the quarter and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, the
realized gains and losses recognized in income were immaterial.

     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Market Price Risk" of Mississippi Power in the Form
10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Mississippi Power in Item 8 of
the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In April 2003, Mississippi Power issued $90 million of Series E 5-5/8% Senior
Notes due May 1, 2033. The proceeds from this sale were used to repay at
maturity $35 million of Mississippi Power's Series B 6.05% Senior Notes due May
1, 2003, to redeem the $51.6 million outstanding principal amount of Mississippi
Power's Series A 6.75% Senior Insured Quarterly Notes due June 30, 2038 and to
repay a portion of Mississippi Power's outstanding short-term indebtedness.

     Mississippi Power plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of
Mississippi Power under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Environmental
Matters" and "Other Capital Requirements" and Note 3 to the financial statements
in the Form 10-K for a description of Mississippi Power's capital requirements
for its construction program, environmental compliance efforts and maturities of
long-term debt.

Sources of Capital

In addition to the financing activities previously described herein, Mississippi
Power plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes
from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and timing of
any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of adequate
earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other factors.
See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for additional
information.

     Mississippi Power's current liabilities exceed current assets due to
scheduled maturities of long-term debt.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Mississippi Power had at
June 30, 2003 approximately $55.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $99.5
million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks that expire in 2003
and 2004. Approximately $37 million of these credit arrangements contain
provisions allowing two-year term loans executable at expiration date. The
credit arrangements provide liquidity support to Mississippi Power's obligations
with respect to variable rate pollution control bonds and commercial paper.
Mississippi Power may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Mississippi Power and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At June 30, 2003, Mississippi Power had no
outstanding commercial paper. Management believes that the need for working
capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit without maintaining
large cash balances.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Savannah Electric's net income for the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 was
$6.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively, compared to $7 million and $8.8
million for the corresponding periods of 2002. Earnings in the second quarter
were down $0.7 million, or 10.5%, due primarily to higher operating expenses.
Year-to-date 2003 earnings were up by $1 million, or 11%, as a result of higher
operating revenues and lower interest expenses, which were partially offset by
higher operating expenses.

     Significant income statement items appropriate for discussion include the

</TABLE>

     Retail sales. Excluding fuel revenues, which do not affect net income,
retail sales revenue decreased by $0.5 million, or 1.1%, in the second quarter
2003 and increased by $2.2 million, or 2.7%, year-to-date 2003 when compared to
the corresponding periods in 2002. The second quarter 2003 decrease is primarily
due to a 5.8% decrease in energy sales to retail customers. Residential and
commercial energy sales were down by 8.8% and 6.4%, respectively, reflecting
milder-than-normal temperatures and industrial energy sales were up 3.6% when
compared to the same period in 2002. The year-to-date 2003 increase is primarily
a result of the base rate increase that took effect in June 2002. Year-to-date
2003, energy sales to industrial customers were higher by 10.2% in contrast to
energy sales to residential and commercial customers that were down by 0.3% and
2.5%, respectively. The increases in energy sales to the industrial sector are
attributed to increased usage by several industrial customers. Residential and
commercial energy sales were down slightly reflecting milder than normal
weather.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. The decrease in the second quarter 2003
is mainly due to lower demand for energy by these non-affiliated customers when
compared to the same period in 2002. Year-to-date 2003 sales for resale to
non-affiliates increased when compared to the same period in 2002 primarily due
to increased demand for energy by non-affiliates. These transactions do not have
a significant impact on earnings since the energy is usually sold at marginal
cost.

     Sales for resale - affiliates. Revenues from sales for resale to affiliated
companies within the Southern Company system will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
generally sold at marginal cost.

     Fuel expense. The second quarter 2003 decrease in fuel expense is primarily
due to lower demand as compared to the corresponding period in 2002. Fuel
expense increased year-to-date 2003 due primarily to increased generation
related to the higher demand for energy in the first quarter 2003. Since fuel
expenses are generally offset by fuel revenues through Savannah Electric's fuel
cost recovery clause, these expenses do not have a significant impact on net
income.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. In the second quarter 2003, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased due to reduced demand for energy from
non-affiliates. Year-to-date 2003 purchased power from non-affiliates increased
because of the opportunity to purchase this energy at a cost lower than
self-generation in the first quarter 2003 as compared to the same period in
2002. These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, as energy
costs are generally recovered through Savannah Electric's fuel cost recovery
clause.

     Purchased power - affiliates. The increases in purchased power from
affiliates in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003 were directly related to
the new PPA with Southern Power which became effective June 2002. The annual
capacity costs of this PPA are approximately $14.0 million. Capacity costs of
purchased power are generally recovered through base rates and the energy
component is recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause. Purchased power
from affiliates also includes energy purchases which will vary depending on
demand and cost of generation resources at each company. These energy costs are
recovered through the fuel cost recovery clause and have no significant impact
on earnings.

     Other operation expense. The increases for the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 are attributed to an increase in administrative and general
expenses primarily relating to employee benefits and to new marketing programs
when compared to the same periods in the prior year.

     Maintenance expense. The decreases in the second quarter and year-to-date
2003 are related to scheduled maintenance outages at one of Savannah Electric's
steam plants.

     Depreciation and amortization. During the second quarter and year-to-date
2003, this item decreased mainly due to discontinued accelerated depreciation
and the amortization of the related regulatory liability that began in June
2002, in accordance with the 2002 base rate order.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. This expense decreased in the
second quarter and year-to-date 2003 as a result of a lower amount of debt
outstanding and lower interest rates when compared to the corresponding periods
in 2002.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations discussed above are not necessarily indicative of
future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors which include maintaining a stable regulatory environment and achieving
energy sales growth while containing costs. For additional information relating
to these issues, reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risks Factors" and
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of
Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K.

     Savannah Electric's business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation
over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property
damage, personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements,
has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal
injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have
become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such litigation currently filed
against Savannah Electric cannot be predicted at this time; however, after
consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the
liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material adverse
effect on Savannah Electric's financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

     Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental
regulations could affect earnings if such costs cannot be recovered. For
additional information about these issues, including the EPA litigation, see
Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Environmental Matters" and Note
3 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K. Reference
is made to Note (E) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information
regarding a recent ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted; however, Savannah
Electric's revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities could be adversely
affected by changes in the transmission regulatory structure in its regional
power market.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential" of Savannah Electric in the Form 10-K for
information on plans to retire a 102 megawatt peaking facility in May 2005 and a
fifteen-year PPA with Southern Power to purchase 200 megawatts of capacity
beginning in June 2005 from the planned combined-cycle plant at Plant McIntosh
to be built and owned by Southern Power. The annual capacity cost is expected to
be approximately $14.5 million. Reference is made to Note (P) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for information regarding the FERC approval process
for this PPA.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policy

Savannah Electric's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to
the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.
Savannah Electric's critical accounting policy involves rate regulation.
Savannah Electric is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
"Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
portion of Savannah Electric's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, Savannah Electric would be required to write off related regulatory
assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable and determine if
any other assets have been impaired.

New Accounting Standards

Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Statement No. 143
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for legal obligations
associated with the ultimate cost of retiring long-lived assets. The present
value of the ultimate costs for an asset's future retirement must be recorded in
the period in which the liability is incurred. The cost must be capitalized as
part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful
life. Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit non-regulated companies to
continue accruing future retirement costs for long-lived assets that they do not
have a legal obligation to retire. Prior to January 2003, Savannah Electric
accrued for the ultimate cost of retiring most long-lived assets over the life
of the related asset through depreciation expense.

     In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,"
which requires classification of certain financial instruments within its scope,
including shares that are mandatorily redeemable, as liabilities. Statement No.
150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003 and otherwise on July 1, 2003 for calendar year companies. In
accordance with Statement No. 150, Savannah Electric reclassified $40 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities as liabilities effective July 1,
2003. The implementation of Statement No. 150 did not have a material effect on
Savannah Electric's Statements of Income and Cash Flows.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

Major changes in Savannah Electric's financial condition during the first six
months of 2003 included the addition of approximately $19.6 million to utility
plant. The funds for these additions and other capital requirements were derived
primarily from operations and the issuance of securities. See Savannah
Electric's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Savannah Electric does not have any credit agreements that would require
material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit
rating downgrade.

Exposure to Market Risks

Savannah Electric's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially compared with the December 31, 2002 reporting period. In
addition, Savannah Electric is not aware of any facts or circumstances that
would significantly affect such exposures in the near term.

     Due to cost-based rate regulations, Savannah Electric has limited exposure
to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, Savannah Electric enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and
sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser
extent, similar contracts for gas purchases. Savannah Electric has also
implemented a retail fuel hedging program at the instruction of the Georgia PSC.
The fair value of derivative energy contracts at June 30, 2003 was as follows:

     Unrealized gains and losses from mark to market adjustments on contracts
related to the retail fuel hedging programs are recorded as regulatory assets
and liabilities. At June 30, 2003, Savannah Electric had approximately $0.2
million in regulatory liabilities related to unrealized gains on mark to market
derivative contracts associated with its fuel hedging programs. Gains and losses
on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the Statements of
Income as incurred. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2003 and
2002, these amounts were not material.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     For additional information, reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Exposure to Market Risks" of Savannah Electric in the
Form 10-K and Note 1 to the financial statements of Savannah Electric in Item 8
of the Form 10-K.

Financing Activities

In February 2003, Savannah Electric sold through a public authority an aggregate
principal amount of $13.87 million of variable rate Pollution Control Revenue
Bonds, Series 2003 due February 1, 2038. The proceeds from this sale, together
with any investment proceeds and other moneys of Savannah Electric, were used to
redeem $13.87 million aggregate principal amount of Pollution Control Revenue
Bonds, Series 1997. The 2003 bonds will bear interest at a rate to be determined
by the auction rate process.

     In July 2003, Savannah Electric entered a swap to hedge interest payments
associated with an anticipated debt issuance planned in December 2003. The swap
is for a notional amount of $25 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.025% and
matures in December 2013.

     Savannah Electric plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program to
retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost capital.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS of Savannah
Electric under "Capital Requirements for Construction," "Other Capital
Requirements" and "Environmental Matters" in the Form 10-K for a description of
Savannah Electric's capital requirements for its construction program, maturing
debt and environmental compliance efforts.

Sources of Capital

Savannah Electric plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past. The amount, type and
timing of any financings -- if needed -- will depend upon maintenance of
adequate earnings, regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions and other
factors. See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Financing Programs" in the Form 10-K for
additional information.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Savannah Electric had at
June 30, 2003 approximately $4.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $55
million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks, of which $31 million
expires in 2003 and $24 million expires in 2004 and beyond. Of the unused credit
arrangements expiring in 2003 and 2004, $30 million includes either one or two
year term loan options executable at the expiration date. The credit
arrangements provide liquidity support to some of Savannah Electric's
obligations with respect to its variable rate debt and its commercial paper.
Savannah Electric may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company
subsidiary organized to issue and sell commercial paper and extendible
commercial notes at the request and for the benefit of Savannah Electric and
other Southern Company subsidiaries. At June 30, 2003, Savannah Electric had $32
million of outstanding commercial paper. Since Savannah Electric has no major
generating plants under construction, management believes that the need for
working capital can be adequately met by utilizing lines of credit.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Southern Power's net income for second quarter and year-to-date 2003 was $79.3
million and $102.4 million, respectively, compared to $8.9 million and $13.3
million for the corresponding periods of 2002. The increases in earnings of
$70.4 million for the second quarter 2003 and $89.1 million year-to-date 2003
can be attributed primarily to an after-tax gain of approximately $50 million
related to the termination of PPAs with Dynegy related to Plant Dahlberg Units 8
through 10 and Plant Franklin Unit 3. Reference is made to Note (M) to the
Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information regarding the
termination of these PPAs. The other significant factor contributing to
increased earnings is the sale of wholesale capacity and energy to affiliated
and non-affiliated companies from Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin
Unit 1 beginning in June 2002, and Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units
1 and 2, beginning in June 2003, along with the initiation of PPAs for those
units with Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric.

</TABLE>


     Sales for resale - non-affiliates. During the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003, sales for resale to non-affiliates increased as a result of
additional wholesale capacity and energy sales to non-affiliates that resulted
from commercial operation of Plant Franklin Unit 1, which was not fully
obligated under a long-term PPA until June 2003, and test period energy
transactions for Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2 which were
placed into commercial operation in June 2003.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


         Sales for resale - affiliates. Energy and capacity sales through PPAs
with Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for the full six months
of 2003 caused the majority of the increase in the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003 when compared to the same periods in 2002. Revenues from sales
to affiliated companies through the Southern Company system power pool
("Southern Pool") and energy sales under PPAs will vary depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the
Southern Pool.

     Contract termination. For the second quarter and year-to-date 2003, this
revenue results from the $80 million received from Dynegy in May 2003 to
terminate PPAs related to Plants Dahlberg and Franklin.  Reference is made to
Note (M) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for further information.

     Other revenues. The increases in the second quarter and year-to-date 2003
are primarily due to scheduling and administrative fees on wholesale contracts
that were not in place during the first six months of 2002.

     Fuel expense. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases are
primarily attributed to the full period commercial operation of units at Plant
Wansley and Plant Franklin Unit 1 as well as commercial operation of new units
at Plant Franklin and Plant Harris as mentioned above.

     Purchased power - non-affiliates. During the second quarter and
year-to-date 2003, purchased power from non-affiliates were higher than in the
same periods in 2002 mainly due to the availability of power at prices lower
than Southern Power's self generation or the Southern Pool and the effects of
purchase power provisions in the contracts with the electric membership
cooperatives, the City of Dalton, Georgia and the North Carolina Municipal Power
Authority 1.

     Purchased power - affiliates. In the second quarter and year-to-date 2003,
purchased power from affiliates increased primarily due to the availability of
power at prices lower than Southern Power's self-generation. Expenses from
purchased power transactions will vary depending on demand, availability and the
cost of generating resources accessible throughout the Southern Company system.

     Other operation expense. The second quarter and year-to-date 2003 increases
result from higher administrative and general expenses due to commercial
operation of Plant Wansley Units 6 and 7 and Plant Franklin Unit 1, beginning in
June 2002, and Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris Units 1 and 2, beginning
in June 2003, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002.

     Depreciation and amortization. During the second quarter and year-to-date
2003, the increases in depreciation and amortization are primarily attributed to
the generating units that were placed into service in June 2002 and 2003 as
compared to the same periods in the prior year.

     Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized. The increases in interest
expense, net of amounts capitalized for the second quarter and year-to-date
2003, when compared to the corresponding periods in 2002 are due to the lower
percentage of interest costs subject to capitalization as projects have reached
completion.

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


Effects of Inflation

Southern Power is subject to long-term contracts and income tax laws that are
based on the recovery of historical costs. While the inflation rate has been
relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
Southern Power because of the large investment in generating facilities with
long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not
recognize this economic loss nor the partially offsetting gain that arises
through financing facilities with fixed-money obligations such as long-term
debt.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future earnings. The
level of future earnings depends on numerous factors including completion of
construction on new generating facilities, regulatory matters, energy sales,
creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Super
Southeast and the remarketing of capacity. For additional information relating
to these issues, see Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Risk Factors" and Item 7 -
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential" of Southern
Power in the Form 10-K.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - General" and to Note 5 to the financial statements
of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information on
long-term power sales agreements and PPAs. Southern Power's PPAs with
non-affiliated counterparties have provisions that require the posting of
collateral or an acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that S&P or
Moody's downgrades the credit ratings of such counterparty to below-investment
grade, or, if the counterparty is not rated, fails to maintain a minimum
coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide Southern Power with a stable
source of revenue during their respective terms.

     In June 2003, Southern Power placed Plant Franklin Unit 2 and Plant Harris
Units 1 and 2 into commercial operation. Southern Power expects Plant Stanton A
to be completed and placed into commercial operation during the third quarter
2003. In 2004, Southern Power's PPA with Georgia Power will begin for Plant
Harris Unit 2. PPAs for the other units become effective upon commercial
operation. Southern Power also has Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 under
construction. Reference is made to Note (M) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding a one-time gain of $50 million upon
the termination of PPAs between Dynegy and Southern Power. Under the original
terms of the PPAs, Southern Power would have recognized revenue of approximately
$5.9 million for the remaining period of 2003 following the terminations.
Because of the termination of these PPAs, Southern Power is exploring
alternatives for remarketing its existing capacity and has suspended
construction of Plant Franklin Unit 3. Southern Power may complete limited
construction activities as needed to preserve the long-term viability of the
project. Reference is also made to Note (P) to the Condensed Financial
Statements herein for information regarding the FERC approval process for
Southern Power's PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah Electric for Plant
McIntosh Units 10 and 11. The final outcome of these matters cannot now be
determined.

     In July 2003, Southern Power entered into a five-year contract with
Piedmont Municipal Power Authority (PMPA) beginning January 1, 2006. PMPA is a
full requirements provider to 10 South Carolina cities. The contract is
projected to yield sales of 135 megawatts in 2006, growing to 181 megawatts in
the fifth year of the contract.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in the Form 10-K for information on
the development by federal and state environmental regulatory agencies of
additional control strategies for emission of air pollution from all major
sources of air pollution, particularly electric generating facilities.
Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered.

     Southern Power's business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, has
increased generally throughout the United States; in particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent.

     Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
"Future Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" of Southern Power in the Form 10-K
for information on the formation of an RTO as ordered by the FERC and the notice
of proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and standard
electricity market design. In April 2003, the FERC issued a White Paper related
to its proposed rulemaking regarding open access transmission service and
standard electricity market design in an effort to respond to certain of the
public comments received on the standard market design proposal. Reactions to
the White Paper by Southeastern state regulators reflect significant continuing
differences in opinion between the FERC and various state regulatory commissions
over questions of jurisdiction and protection of retail customers. These
significant differences between state and federal regulators create substantial
uncertainty related to the ultimate approval of SeTrans because state commission
approval of the transfer of operational control of the transmission assets of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries is a prerequisite to the formation of
SeTrans. Pending energy legislation may also impact these issues. Any impact of
the other FERC proposals on Southern Company and its subsidiaries will depend on
the form in which final rules may be ultimately adopted.

     Reference is also made to Notes (A), (E), (L), (M) and (P) to the Condensed
Financial Statements herein for discussion of various contingencies and other
matters which may affect future earnings potential.

Accounting Policies

Critical Policies

Southern Power's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. Southern
Power has three critical accounting policies that require a significant amount
of judgment and are considered to be the most important to the presentation of
Southern Power's financial position and results of operations. The first
critical policy is the recognition of capacity revenues from long-term contracts
at the lesser of the levelized basis or the cash collected over the contract
periods. Second, Southern Power designates qualifying derivative instruments as
cash flow or fair value hedges and marks such derivative instruments to market
based primarily on quoted market prices. The unrealized changes in fair value of
qualifying cash flow hedges are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Any
ineffectiveness in those hedges and changes in non-qualifying positions are
reported as a component of current period income. Finally, Southern Power uses
flow-through accounting for state manufacturer's tax credits. This means that
Southern Power recognizes the credit as a reduction of tax expense when it is
more likely than not to be allowed by the Georgia Department of Revenue.

                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


New Accounting Standards

     Reference is made to Note (J) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein
for information regarding the adoption of FASB Statement No. 143, "Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations" effective January 1, 2003. Southern Power has
no legal liability for asset retirement obligations as defined by FASB Statement
No. 143. Upon adoption, Southern Power recorded a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle of $0.6 million, representing previously accrued removal
costs.


FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The major change in Southern Power's financial condition during the first six
months of 2003 was the addition of approximately $231.4 million to utility plant
related to on-going construction of Southern Power's combined-cycle units. The
funds for these additions were provided by Southern Power's credit facility,
commercial paper program and subordinated loans from Southern Company. See
Southern Power's Condensed Statements of Cash Flows herein for further details.

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Power does not have any credit agreements that would require material
changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating
downgrade. There are certain physical electricity sale contracts, fixed-price
physical gas purchases and agreements covering interest rate swaps and currency
swaps that could require collateral -- but not accelerated payment -- in the
event of a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral
may be provided for by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit or cash. At
June 30, 2003, the maximum potential collateral requirements under the
electricity sale contracts and financial instrument agreements were
approximately $154 million. At June 30, 2003, there were no material collateral
requirements for the gas purchase contracts.

Exposure to Market Risks

Southern Power is exposed to market risks,  including changes in interest rates,
currency  exchange rates and certain  commodity prices. To manage the volatility
attributable  to these  exposures,  Southern  Power  nets the  exposure  to take
advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining  exposure  pursuant to approved risk management  policies in areas
such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.  Southern Power's policy is
that  derivatives  are to be used  primarily  for hedging  purposes.  Derivative
positions are  monitored  using  techniques  that include  market  valuation and
sensitivity analysis.

                             SOUTHERN POWER COMPANY
                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     Southern Power has no outstanding variable rate long-term debt. To mitigate
Southern Power's exposure to interest rates, it entered into interest rate swaps
that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest expenses arising from the
2003 planned debt issuances. Changes in the fair values of these swaps are
deferred in Other Comprehensive Income. Upon the issuance of the debt in July
2003, the swaps were settled at a loss of approximately $93.3 million that will
be amortized to expense over the appropriate periods. Reference is made to Note
(L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for additional information.
Based on Southern Power's overall interest rate exposure at June 30, 2003,
including derivative and other interest-rate sensitive instruments, a near-term
100 basis-point change in interest rates would not materially affect Southern
Power's financial statements. In addition, Southern Power is not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would significantly affect such exposures in the
near term.

     Because energy from Southern Power's facilities is primarily sold under
long-term contracts with tolling agreements and provisions shifting
substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the PPA counterparties,
Southern Power's exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity is limited. To mitigate residual risks in those areas,
Southern Power enters into fixed-price contracts for the purchase or sale of
fuel and electricity. In connection with the transfers of Plant Franklin in 2001
and Plant Wansley in 2002 to Southern Power, Georgia Power transferred
approximately $5.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in derivative assets
relating to electric and gas forward contracts in effect at the date of the
transfers. These contracts were recorded at fair value on the date of the
transfer, which was equal to Georgia Power's carrying amount. Following the
transfer, these contracts are being marked to market through income until
completely realized and settled in August 2003.

     Southern Power had firm purchase commitments that required payment in
Euros. As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for Euros, Southern
Power entered into forward contracts to purchase Euros and had designated these
contracts as fair value hedges of an unrecognized firm commitment. Since the
terms of these Euro contracts mirrored the purchase commitment terms, there was
no ineffectiveness recognized in income. All Euro payments have been made and
the gains associated with the hedges effectively reduced the purchase price of
the equipment, which is included in construction work in progress. As of June
30, 2003, there were no additional Euro hedges outstanding.

     Unrealized gains and losses on electric and gas contracts used to hedge
anticipated purchases and sales are deferred in Other Comprehensive Income.
Gains and losses on contracts that do not represent hedges are recognized in the
Statements of Income as incurred. The fair values of derivative energy contracts
at June 30, 2003 were as follows:

                     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION


     At June 30, 2003, all of these contracts are based on actively quoted
market prices. Realized gains and losses on hedged transactions are recognized
in revenues and/or fuel expense in the Statements of Income as incurred. For the
three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002, approximately $0.2 million and $1.3
million of losses, respectively, were recognized in Other Income in the
Statements of Income. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002,
approximately $0.1 million of gains and $2.6 million of losses, respectively,
were recognized in Other Income in the Statements of Income.

Financing Activities

During the first six months of 2003, Southern Company made subordinated loans to
Southern Power of approximately $3.8 million, net of repayments. In March 2003,
$190 million of notes payable to Southern Company were converted to a capital
contribution from Southern Company. Equity contributions and subordinated loans
from Southern Company are projected to total approximately $900 million to
Southern Power by the end of 2003. No dividends are projected to be paid in
2003.

     In July 2003, Southern Power issued $575 million of 4.875% Senior Notes,
Series C due July 15, 2015. The proceeds from the sale were used to repay a
substantial portion of existing short-term indebtedness, to settle interest rate
hedges associated with this financing and for general corporate purposes.
Reference is made to Note (L) to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for
information regarding these hedges.

Capital Requirements

Reference is made to Item 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Capital
Requirements for Construction" and "Other Capital Requirements" of Southern
Power in the Form 10-K for a description of Southern Power's capital
requirements for its construction program, maturing debt, purchase commitments
and long-term service agreements.

Sources of Capital

Southern Power's current liabilities exceed current assets because of the
continued use of short-term debt as an interim funding source for Southern
Power's ongoing construction program. Southern Power's strategy is to refinance
most of such short-term borrowings with long-term securities following
commercial operation of the generating facilities.

     In February 2003, Southern Power initiated a commercial paper program to
fund a portion of the construction costs of new generating facilities. The
amount of commercial paper will initially represent about 45% of total debt, but
is forecasted to decline to about 7% at year-end 2005 as more construction
projects are completed and refinanced with long-term securities. At June 30,
2003, Southern Power had outstanding $492.4 million in commercial paper.
Reference is made to Note 7 to the financial statements of Southern Power in
Item 8 of the Form 10-K for additional information relating to the commercial
paper program.

     To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Power had at June
30, 2003 approximately $21.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. To meet
liquidity and capital resource requirements, Southern Power had at June 30, 2003
approximately $650 million of unused committed credit arrangements with banks

expiring in 2006. This line also provides liquidity support for Southern Power's
commercial paper program (as discussed above). Amounts drawn under the
arrangements are used to finance acquisition and construction costs related to
gas-fired electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes,
subject to borrowing limitations for each generating facility. The arrangements
permit Southern Power to fund construction of future generating facilities upon
meeting certain requirements. Financing of construction at the McIntosh facility
is subject to FERC approval of the related PPAs. Reference is made to Note (P)
to the Condensed Financial Statements herein for information regarding the FERC
approval process for Southern Power's PPAs with Georgia Power and Savannah
Electric for Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11. Southern Power also has access to
loans from Southern Company to meet any additional Plant McIntosh funding needs
should other funding sources not be adequate.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:

(A)      The condensed financial statements of the registrants included herein
         have been prepared by each registrant, without audit, pursuant to the
         rules and regulations of the SEC.  In the opinion of each registrant's
         management, the information regarding such registrant furnished
         herein reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
         results of operations for the periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002.
         Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
         financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
         generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or
         omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although each
         registrant believes that the disclosures regarding such registrant are
         adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  Disclosure
         which would substantially duplicate the disclosure in the Form 10-K
         and details which have not changed significantly in amount or
         composition since the filing of the Form 10-K are omitted from this
         Form 10-Q.  Therefore, these condensed financial statements should be
         read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
         thereto included in the Form 10-K.  Certain prior period amounts
         have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
         Due to seasonal variations in the demand for energy, operating results
         for the periods presented do not necessarily indicate operating results
         for the entire year.

(B)      Reference is made to Note 11 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
         Earnings Potential - General" of Southern Company in Item 7 of the Form
         10-K for information on the spin-off of Mirant from Southern Company.

         On July 14, 2003, Mirant filed for voluntary reorganization under
         Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Southern Company has certain
         contingent liabilities associated with Mirant. Reference is made to
         Note 9 under "Guarantees" to the financial statements of Southern
         Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Southern
         Company's guarantees of contractual commitments made by Mirant's
         subsidiaries. At July 31, 2003, the total notional amount of guarantees
         outstanding was less than $30 million.

         Reference is also made to Note (E) herein for information regarding
         various lawsuits related to Mirant and guarantees related to Mobile
         Energy. Reference is also made to Note 6 to the financial statements of
         Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding
         joint and several liability with Mirant in connection with the joint
         consolidated federal income tax return. As discussed in Note (C) below,
         the IRS has completed its audits of the consolidated federal income tax
         returns through 1999. Under the terms of the separation agreement,
         Mirant agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with
         these lawsuits, Mobile Energy guarantees and additional IRS
         assessments. The impact of Mirant's bankruptcy filing on Mirant's
         indemnity obligations, if any, cannot now be determined.


                                      102
<PAGE>


NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         On April 30, 2003, Mirant filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
         year ended December 31, 2002. This filing included Mirant's restated
         financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000.
         Mirant's restated net income for 2001 and 2000 decreased by $159
         million and $29 million, respectively. Mirant also announced that it is
         preparing revised quarterly financial statements for 2001 and expects
         to provide the quarterly results as soon as possible. Southern Company
         owned 100% of Mirant through September 2000 and 80% between October
         2000 and April 2, 2001. Due to Southern Company's spin-off of Mirant on
         April 2, 2001, Southern Company's financial statements reflect its
         share of Mirant's net income as discontinued operations. The effect of
         these restatements on Southern Company's financial statements, if any,
         cannot be determined until Mirant's 2001 revised quarterly financial
         statements are filed. The impact of the bankruptcy filing on the timing
         of filing 2001 revised quarterly financial statements, if any, cannot
         now be determined.

(C)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Leveraged Leases" and Note 6 to the
         financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 and MANAGEMENT'S
         DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future Earnings Potential - General" in Item
         7 of the Form 10-K.

         As a large corporate taxpayer, Southern Company undergoes audits by the
         IRS for each of its tax years. The IRS has completed its audits of
         Southern Company's consolidated federal income tax returns for all
         years through 1999. As part of the audit for the 1996-1999 tax years,
         the IRS reviewed Southern Company's four international leveraged lease
         transactions. Based on its review, the IRS proposed to disallow the tax
         losses associated with one of these transactions, resulting in an
         additional tax payment of approximately $30 million, including
         interest, to the IRS. To finalize the audit and eliminate any
         additional interest charges, Southern Company made this payment to the
         IRS in May 2003 and intends to pursue a refund claim for this amount.
         Notwithstanding the position taken by the IRS, Southern Company
         continues to believe that the transaction remains a valid lease for
         U.S. tax purposes and, accordingly, will vigorously contest the
         proposed disallowance. Southern Company has accounted for the payment
         as a deposit. If Southern Company is not successful in its defense of
         the tax treatment for this transaction, it would also affect the timing
         of the related revenue recognition for book purposes. A cumulative
         effect adjustment would be required to reduce net income based on the
         revised cash flows as a result of the changes in the allowed tax
         deductions.

         The IRS did not disallow any tax losses or make any other adjustments
         for the 1996-1999 period with respect to any of Southern Company's
         other lease transactions. However, there can be no assurance that
         subsequent IRS audits would not raise similar disallowance issues.

         The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


(D)      On June 30, 2003, the IRS issued an announcement suspending the
         issuance of new private letter rulings on tax credits for synthetic
         fuels pursuant to Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code upon its
         initiation of a review of the scientific validity of test procedures
         and results that have been presented as evidence that a significant
         chemical change occurred in such synthetic fuel. In addition, the IRS
         indicated that it may revoke existing private letter rulings that
         relied on the procedures and results under review if it determines that
         those test procedures and results do not demonstrate that a significant
         chemical change has occurred.

         Southern Company has investments in two entities that produce synthetic
         fuel and receive tax credits. In April 2001, Southern Company acquired
         a 30% membership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP). In 1998,
         Southern Company acquired a 24.975% limited partnership interest in
         Carbontronics Synfuels Investors, L.P. (Carbontronics). At June 30,
         2003, Southern Company's investments in AFP and Carbontronics totaled
         $25 million and $8 million, respectively.

         Carbontronics has informed Southern Company that, on August 5, 2003,
         the IRS communicated plans to perform an examination of the partnership
         for the years 2000 and 2001. From the inception of Southern Company's
         investment in Carbontronics through June 30, 2003, Southern Company has
         recognized approximately $90 million in tax credits through income
         related to its share of Carbontronics' synthetic fuel production.

         The IRS is currently auditing AFP for tax years 1999 and 2000. Based on
         a conversation between the IRS field agent and the tax matters partner
         for AFP on July 31, 2003, there is an expectation that the IRS may
         challenge the existence of significant chemical change at AFP. A
         written report is expected, but has not yet been received. From the
         inception of Southern Company's investment in AFP through June 30,
         2003, Southern Company has recognized approximately $129 million in tax
         credits through income related to its share of AFP's synthetic fuel
         production.

         Both entities have private letter rulings from the IRS that concluded
         significant chemical change occurred based on the procedures and
         results submitted. In addition, both entities regularly use independent
         laboratories and experts to test for chemical change. These tests
         replicated significant chemical changes consistent with the procedures
         submitted with the private letter rulings. Southern Company has relied
         on these private letter rulings and believes that the test results
         presented in connection with such private letter rulings are valid, and
         that the entities have operated in compliance with their respective
         private letter rulings and Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
         ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

(E)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company, the operating companies and Southern Power in Item 8 and to
         "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of the Form 10-K for information relating
         to various lawsuits and other contingencies.

         MIRANT ERISA LITIGATION

         On April 17, 2003, a retired employee of Mirant filed a complaint in
         the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
         alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and
         naming as defendants Mirant, Southern Company, several current and
         former directors and officers of Mirant and/or Southern Company, and
         "Unknown Fiduciary Defendants 1-100." The plaintiff seeks to represent
         a purported class consisting of individuals who were participants in or
         beneficiaries of two Mirant employee benefit plans and their
         predecessor plans (the "Plans") at any time between January 1, 2000,
         and the filing of the complaint whose plan accounts included
         investments in Mirant common stock or the "Mirant Corporation Stock

                                      104

         Fund." The complaint alleges that the defendants misled
         participants in the Plans by concealing Mirant's alleged
         "participation in the illegal manipulation of energy
         prices in California during 2000 and 2001 as well as other irregular
         and unlawful accounting manipulations tied to energy trading." On June
         3, 2003, a substantially similar complaint was filed in the United
         States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. Neither
         complaint contains any specific allegations of wrongdoing with respect
         to Southern Company. It is expected that these suits will be
         consolidated. Southern Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to
         defend this action. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
         determined.

         NEW SOURCE REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

         Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 and Note 3 to the financial
         statements of each registrant (except Southern Power) under "New Source
         Review Enforcement Actions" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On June 24,
         2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ("Court of
         Appeals") ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to decide the TVA
         appeal because the challenged Administrative Compliance Order ("ACO")
         did not constitute final agency action. The Court of Appeals held that
         the Clean Air Act's statutory scheme for enforcement of the ACO is
         unconstitutional and that the EPA must prove any Clean Air Act
         violations by TVA in federal district court. Until that time, the Court
         of Appeals ruled, TVA is free to ignore the ACO without penalty. On
         July 3, 2003, Alabama Power and the EPA jointly notified the Alabama
         district court of the ruling of the Court of Appeals and requested that
         the stay in that case be continued until expiration of the period in
         which the EPA can request a rehearing. The district court granted the
         parties' request on July 10, 2003. On August 8, 2003, the EPA filed a
         petition for rehearing en banc with the Court of Appeals. At this time,
         no party to the case in federal district court in Atlanta against
         Georgia Power, which was administratively closed two years ago, has
         asked the court to reopen that case. The final outcome of these
         matters cannot now be determined.

         MOBILE ENERGY BANKRUPTCY PETITION

         Reference is made to Note 3 to the Southern Company financial
         statements in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. In July 2003, Mobile Energy
         received the necessary approval of its plan of reorganization under
         PUHCA. Mobile Energy currently anticipates the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
         will also approve the plan of reorganization in September 2003. The
         reorganization will not impact Southern Company's outstanding
         guarantees of certain potential obligations of Mobile Energy that
         represent a maximum contingent liability of $19 million at June 30,
         2003.

         PLANT WANSLEY ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Item 7 -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Environmental Matters" of Georgia Power in the Form 10-K and to Note 3
         to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under
         "Plant Wansley Litigation" in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On June 19,
         2003, the court granted Georgia Power's motion to dismiss the
         allegations regarding hazardous air pollutants and denied Georgia
         Power's motion to dismiss the allegations regarding emission offsets.
         Discovery is ongoing and no trial date has been set. The final outcome
         of this matter cannot now be determined.

         MIRANT SECURITIES LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Note 3 under "Mirant Securities Litigation" of
         Southern Company in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On July 14, 2003, the U.S.
         District Court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed all
         claims based on Mirant's alleged improper trading and marketing
         activities in the California energy market; however, the Court did not
         dismiss the claims based on alleged false statements and omissions in
         Mirant's prospectus for its initial public offering and
         accounting-related issues previously disclosed by Mirant. Such claims
         seek to impose liability on Southern Company based on allegations that
         Southern Company was a "control person" as to Mirant prior to the
         spin-off date. Mirant's bankruptcy filing imposes an automatic stay of
         this action as to Mirant and may affect the proceedings as to Southern
         Company and other parties in this lawsuit. Southern Company's answer to
         the consolidated amended complaint is due on September 3, 2003, and
         discovery begins on that date. Under certain circumstances, Southern
         Company will be obligated under its Bylaws to indemnify the four
         current and/or former Southern Company officers who served as directors
         of Mirant at the time of its initial public offering through the date
         of the spin-off and are also named as defendants in this lawsuit. The
         final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

         RACE DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION

         Reference is made to Note 3 under "Race Discrimination Litigation" of
         Southern Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. On March
         31, 2003, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
         Georgia granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all
         claims raised by all of the seven named plaintiffs. On April 28, 2003,
         plaintiffs filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
         the Eleventh Circuit challenging these adverse summary judgment
         rulings, as well as the District Court's October 2001 ruling denying
         class certification. In addition, plaintiffs appealed some adverse
         rulings on discovery issues. Both parties have filed their respective
         briefs with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and they are
         awaiting the determination of the Court of Appeals. The final outcome
         of the case cannot now be determined.

(F)      Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
         Company and Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
         relating to Alabama Power's retail rate adjustment procedures. In June
         2003, Alabama Power began buying power under a seven-year PPA with
         Southern Power for 615 megawatts of capacity annually from Plant
         Harris. In addition, Alabama Power also began buying power under a
         seven-year PPA with a third party for 630 megawatts; one-half of which
         became available in June 2003, with the remainder scheduled to be
         available beginning in 2004. Both PPAs have been certificated by the
         Alabama PSC. As a result, Alabama Power's retail rates were adjusted by
         approximately 2.6% under Rate CNP (Certificated New Plant), which
         allows Alabama Power to recover costs associated with certificated
         PPAs.

(G)      On May 23, 2003, Georgia Power filed for a fuel cost recovery rate
         increase. The increase will allow for the recovery of fuel costs based
         on an estimate of future fuel costs, as well as the collection of the
         existing under recovery of fuel expenses. The Georgia PSC held hearings
         on July 31, 2003. A final decision from the Georgia PSC is expected on
         August 19, 2003 with an effective date of September 1, 2003. The
         outcome of the filing cannot be determined at this time.

(H)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities"
         to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the
         operating companies in Item 8 of the Form 10-K. The operating companies
         are subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, "Accounting for
         the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." In the event that a
         portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these
         provisions, the company would be required to write off related
         regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable
         and determine if any other assets have been impaired.

(I)      Reference is made to Note 9, Note 4 and Note 4 under "Guarantees" to
         the financial statements of Southern Company, Georgia Power and Gulf
         Power, respectively, in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information
         regarding guarantees of loans to residential customers for heat pump
         purchases. As of June 30, 2003, the total outstanding loans guaranteed
         by all of the operating companies was $14.3 million, of which Georgia
         Power is responsible for $11.5 million and Gulf Power is responsible
         for $0.8 million. Total loan loss reserves of $4 million ($2.4 million
         for Georgia Power and $0.2 million for Gulf Power) have been recorded.

(J)      Effective January 1, 2003, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement
         No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations."
         Statement No. 143 establishes new accounting and reporting standards
         for legal obligations associated with the ultimate cost
         of retiring long-lived assets.  The ultimate costs for an asset's
         future retirement must be recorded in the period in which
         the liability is incurred.  The cost must be capitalized as part of
         the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the
         asset's useful life.  Additionally, Statement No. 143 does not permit
         the continued accrual of future retirement costs for
         long-lived assets which the company does not have a legal obligation
         to retire.  However, the operating companies have
         discussed the financial statement impacts of Statement No. 143 with
         their respective PSCs and will continue to recognize the
         accumulated removal costs for other obligations as part of accumulated
         depreciation.  As of June 30, 2003, amounts recorded
         in Accumulated Depreciation that represent regulatory liabilities
         related to such removal costs totaled $1.2 billion,
         consisting of $562 million, $416 million, $146 million, $75 million
         and $34 million for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf
         Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah Electric, respectively.

         The operating companies had no cumulative effect to net income
         resulting from the adoption of Statement No. 143. As a result, Alabama
         Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and Savannah
         Electric recorded regulatory assets (liabilities) of $(71) million, $21
         million, $0.9 million, $0.6 million and $2.4 million, respectively, as
         of January 1, 2003. At June 30, 2003, the regulatory liability for
         Alabama Power is reflected in the balance sheets under "Asset
         retirement obligation regulatory liability." The regulatory assets of
         the other operating companies are reflected in the balance sheets under
         either "Asset retirement obligation regulatory asset" or in "Other"
         under "Deferred Charges and Other Assets." Southern Power recorded a
         cumulative effect adjustment to income upon adoption of $0.6 million,
         representing removal costs previously accrued.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates
         to Southern Company's nuclear facilities, which include Alabama Power's
         Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plants Hatch
         and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling
         retirement obligations related to these assets as of June 30, 2003 is
         $338 million, $388 million and $726 million for Alabama Power, Georgia
         Power and Southern Company, respectively. In addition, the operating
         companies have retirement obligations related to various landfill
         sites, ash ponds and underground storage tanks. The operating companies
         have also identified retirement obligations related to certain
         transmission and distribution facilities. However, liabilities for the
         removal of these transmission and distribution assets will not be
         recorded because no reasonable estimate can be made regarding the
         timing of the obligations. The operating companies will continue to
         recognize in the income statement their ultimate removal costs in
         accordance with each company's respective regulatory treatment. Any
         difference between costs recognized under Statement No. 143 and those
         reflected in rates will be recognized as either a regulatory asset or
         liability.

         Alabama Power has revised the estimated cost to retire Farley Nuclear
         Plant as a result of a new site-specific decommissioning study
         completed in April 2003. The effect of the revision is an increase of
         $34.5 million for the Statement No. 143 liability included in "Asset
         retirement obligations" with a corresponding increase in property,
         plant and equipment. Based on the new study, the estimated site study
         decommissioning costs are $955 million ($892 million for radiated
         structures plus $63 million for non-radiated structures) and the
         ultimate decommissioning costs are $2,529 million ($2,349 million for
         radiated structures plus $180 million for non-radiated structures). For
         additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements of
         Alabama Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K.

         The following table reflects the details of the Asset Retirement
Obligations included in the balance sheets.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         The adoption of FASB Statement No. 143 has been treated as a non-cash
         transaction for purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows.

(K)      Reference is made to Note 1 under "Stock Options" and Note 7 under
         "Stock Option Plan" to the financial statements of Southern Company in
         Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding non-qualified
         employee stock options provided by Southern Company. Southern Company
         accounts for options granted in accordance with Accounting Principles
         Board Opinion No. 25; thus, no compensation expense is recognized
         because the exercise price of all options granted equaled the fair
         market value on the date of the grant. The estimated fair values of
         stock options granted during the three-month and six-month periods
         ending June 30, 2003 and 2002 have been derived using the
         Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. The following table shows the

(L)      In addition to the fixed price electric and gas contracts used to
         mitigate exposure to volatile energy prices (see "Exposure to Market
         Risks" in MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS herein), Southern
         Company and certain of its subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps
         to hedge exposure to interest rate changes. Swaps related to fixed rate
         securities are accounted for as fair value hedges; swaps related to
         variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for
         as cash flow hedges. The swaps are generally structured to mirror the
         terms of the hedged debt instruments; therefore, no material
         ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings. As of June 30, 2003, the
         following swaps were outstanding:

         In May 2003, Alabama Power completed the issuance of $250 million of
         senior notes due May 1, 2008. In connection with the issuance of these
         notes, Alabama Power settled a related interest rate swap and incurred
         a loss of $10.2 million. Including the effect of this settlement, for
         the twelve month period ended June 30, 2004, a total of $2.8 million
         will be reclassified from Other Comprehensive Income to Interest
         Expense for Alabama Power.

         In July 2003, Southern Power completed the issuance of $575 million of
         4.875% senior notes due July 15, 2015. In connection with the issuance
         of these notes, Southern Power settled the interest rate swaps above
         and incurred a loss of $93.3 million. Including the effect of this
         settlement, for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2004, a total of
         approximately $9.8 million will be reclassified from Other
         Comprehensive Income to Interest Expense for Southern Power.

         Also in July 2003, Gulf Power completed the issuance of $60 million of
         4.35% senior notes due July 15, 2013. In connection with the issuance
         of these notes, Gulf Power settled the interest rate swaps above and
         incurred a loss of $3.3 million. For the twelve month period ended June
         30, 2004, a total of approximately $0.3 million will be reclassified
         from Other Comprehensive Income to Interest Expense for Gulf Power.

         Power and Southern Power for information regarding PPAs between
         subsidiaries of Dynegy and Mississippi Power and Southern Power and
         related letters of credit.

         On May 21, 2003, Mississippi Power and Southern Power entered into
         agreements with Dynegy (the "Agreements") to resolve all outstanding
         matters related to Dynegy, the PPAs and the related letters of credit.
         Under the terms of the Agreements, (1) Dynegy made a cash payment of
         $75 million to Mississippi Power and $80 million to Southern Power; (2)
         the PPAs between Southern Power and Dynegy were terminated, with no
         party having any remaining obligations under such PPAs thereafter; (3)
         Dynegy and Mississippi Power amended their PPA so that no capacity
         payments are due from Dynegy to Mississippi Power for capacity made
         available under the PPA from June 2003 through October 2003 (but other
         obligations and payments by Dynegy under such PPA are not affected
         during such time) and the PPA will terminate effective October 31,
         2003, with neither party having any remaining obligations under the PPA
         after October 31, 2003; (4) Dynegy paid all amounts for which it was
         obligated under the PPAs up to their time of cancellation or amendment;
         (5) Southern Power and Mississippi Power returned the existing letters
         of credit in support of Dynegy's obligations under the PPAs; and (6)
         Dynegy deposited $7 million with Mississippi Power as collateral for
         Dynegy's potential energy purchases under the PPA through October 31,
         2003.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         The termination payments from Dynegy resulted in a one-time gain to
         Southern Company of approximately $88 million after tax ($38 million
         for Mississippi Power and $50 million for Southern Power).

         Because of the terminations of these PPAs, Southern Power has suspended
         construction of Plant Franklin Unit 3. Southern Power may complete
         limited construction activities as needed to preserve the long-term
         viability of the project. The length of the deferral period will depend
         on forecasted capacity needs and other wholesale market opportunities.
         Mississippi Power and Southern Power are also continuing to explore
         alternatives for their existing capacity. The final outcome of these
         matters cannot now be determined.

         After giving effect to the termination of these PPAs, total expected
         capacity payments from non-affiliates are as follows (in millions):

         which could be assessed after a nuclear incident against all owners of
         nuclear reactors to cover third-party liability claims. On or about
         August 20, 2003, the NRC will increase the maximum retrospective
         premium for each licensed reactor operated from $88 million to $100
         million per incident. The maximum assessment, excluding any applicable
         state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power - based on its
         ownership and buyback interests -- is $200 million and $203 million,
         respectively, per incident. The annual retrospective limit of $10

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:  (Continued)


         The Electric Power Supply Association and Calpine Corporation have made
         filings in this proceeding in opposition to the FERC's acceptance of
         the PPAs, alleging that the PPAs do not meet the applicable standards
         for PPAs between affiliates. In April 2003, Southern Power applied for
         FERC approval of these PPAs. In July 2003, the FERC accepted the PPAs
         to become effective June 1, 2005, subject to refund, and ordered that
         hearings be held to determine: (a) whether, in the design and
         implementation of the Georgia PSC competitive bidding process, Georgia
         Power and Savannah Electric unduly preferred Southern Power; (b)
         whether the analysis of the competitive bids unduly favored Southern
         Power, particularly with respect to evaluation of non-price factors;
         (c) whether Georgia Power and Savannah Electric selected their
         affiliate, Southern Power, based upon a reasonable combination of
         price and non-price factors; (d) whether Southern Power received an
         undue preference or competitive advantage in the competitive bidding
         process as a result of access to its affiliate's transmission system;
        (e) whether and to what extent the PPAs impact wholesale competition;
         and (f) whether the PPAs are just and reasonable and not unduly
         discriminatory. Hearings are scheduled to commence on March 1, 2004.
         Management believes that the PPAs should be approved by the FERC;
         however, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

         In March 2003, Savannah Electric transferred to Southern Power 58 acres
         of land to facilitate construction at Plant McIntosh. The transfer was
         made at Savannah Electric's book value of approximately $16,500 in
         accordance with PUHCA and the related SEC order (Release No. 35-27322)
         dated December 27, 2000, which authorized the formation of Southern
         Power and the transfer of assets thereto. On July 17, 2003, the Georgia
         PSC issued an order requiring that Savannah Electric record the
         transfer of this land at the higher of net book value or fair market
         value based on an appraisal by an appraiser selected by the Georgia PSC
         staff. Based on an appraisal performed in November 2002, the estimated
         fair market value of the land is approximately $200,000. The outcome of
         this matter cannot now be determined.

(Q)      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - "Future
         Earnings Potential - FERC Matters" in Item 7 and Note 3 under
         "Transmission Facilities Agreement" to the financial statements of
         Mississippi Power in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding
         the FERC's investigation related to a transmission facilities agreement
         with Entergy Corporation. On July 9, 2003, the FERC approved a
         settlement between Mississippi Power and the FERC Staff. The impact of
         the settlement provides for no refund of prior revenues collected.

(R)      Reference is made to MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS -
         "Accounting Policies - Critical Policies" and "Financial
         Condition - Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements" of Mississippi
         Power and "Financial Condition - Off-Balance Sheet Financing
         Arrangements" of Southern Company in Item 7 and Note 8 under "Lease
         Agreements" and Note 9 under "Operating Leases" to the financial
         statements of Mississippi Power and Southern Company, respectively,
         in Item 8 of the Form 10-K for information regarding Mississippi
         Power's lease of two generating units totaling 1,064 megawatts at
         Plant Daniel from Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"),
         which began in 2001.  Escatawpa raised a total of approximately $370
         million to finance these generating units. Escatawpa was not
         consolidated by Mississippi Power pursuant to accounting
         guidance then in effect. On June 27, 2003, the generating units owned
         by Escatawpa and the related debt were acquired by Juniper Capital L.P.
         ("Juniper"), a limited partnership unaffiliated with Mississippi Power.
         Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement
         with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with
         third parties unrelated to Mississippi Power.  The assets leased by
         Mississippi Power comprise less than half of Juniper's assets. In
         accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Mississippi Power is not

         required to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities.
         Furthermore, the new lease agreement is an operating lease under
         FASB Statement No. 13.

         Principal terms of the Juniper lease remain essentially the same as
         those in the Escatawpa lease. The initial lease term ends in 2011. Like
         the Escatawpa lease, the Juniper lease also includes a purchase and
         renewal option based on the cost of the facility, which was $368.7
         million at the inception of the Juniper lease. Mississippi Power is
         required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial acquisition cost
         over the initial lease term, which is less than the 10% provided for
         under the Escatawpa lease. Eighteen months prior to the end of the
         initial lease, Mississippi Power may elect to renew for 10 years. If
         Mississippi Power elects to renew the lease, the agreement calls for
         Mississippi Power to amortize an additional 17% of the initial
         completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease,
         at Mississippi Power's option, it may either exercise its purchase
         option or the facility can be sold to a third party.

         For each of the six month periods ended June 30, 2003 and 2002,
         Mississippi Power recognized approximately $13 million in lease
         expenses, including approximately $1.6 million related to the
         amortization of the initial acquisition cost. In addition, $10.6
         million in lease termination costs are included in other operation
         expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2003.

         The Juniper lease provides for a residual value guarantee
         (approximately 73% of the acquisition cost) by Mississippi Power that
         is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi
         Power does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and the fair
         market value is less than the unamortized cost of the asset. In
         accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45, Mississippi Power has
         recognized a liability of approximately $16 million for the fair market
         value of this residual value guarantee in its June 30, 2003 balance
         sheet.

                              THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
                                     BY-LAWS

                     As Amended Effective February 17, 2003


                                    OFFICES.

 1. The principal office of the Corporation shall be in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, State of Delaware.

The Corporation shall also have an office in Atlanta, Georgia.

The Corporation may have offices at such other places as the Board of Directors
may from time to time determine.

                                      SEAL.

 2. The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation,
the year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware."

                             STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS.

 3. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the office of the
Corporation in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle, State of Delaware,
except such meetings as the Board of Directors expressly determine shall be held
elsewhere in which case meetings may be held upon notice as hereinafter
provided, at such other place or places within or without the State of Delaware
as said Board of Directors may determine.

 4. The annual meeting of the stockholders shall be held at 11:00 o'clock A.M.
Eastern Standard Time on the fourth Wednesday in the month of May in each year,
if not a legal holiday, and if a legal holiday, then on the next secular day
following, at 11:00 o'clock A.M. Eastern Standard Time, when the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon shall elect the Board of Directors and transact such
other business as may be brought before the meeting. At the annual meeting any
business may be transacted, irrespective of whether the notice calling such
meeting shall have contained a reference thereto.

The time and place named in these By-Laws for the annual meeting at which the
Board of Directors is to be elected shall not be changed within sixty (60) days
next before the day on which said election is to be held. A notice of any change
shall be given to each stockholder twenty days before the election is held, in
person or by letter mailed to his last known post-office address.

                                     - 1 -

 5. At all meetings of the stockholders, the holders of a majority of the shares
of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat present in
person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum requisite for the
transaction of business, except as otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these By-Laws. If, however, a quorum shall not be present
or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to
vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time without notice other than announcement at the meeting,
until the requisite amount of voting stock shall be present. At such adjourned
meeting at which the requisite amount of voting stock shall be represented, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally notified.

 6. Each stockholder entitled to vote in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation or any amendment thereof and in accordance with the provisions of
these By-Laws or of any action taken pursuant thereto shall be entitled to one
vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of stock entitled to vote held by
such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date
unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Except where the transfer books
of the corporation shall have been closed or a date shall have been fixed as a
record date for the determination of its stockholders entitled to vote, as
hereinafter provided, no share of stock shall be voted on at any election for
directors which shall have been transferred on the books of the Corporation
within twenty days next preceding such election of directors. The vote for
directors, and, upon the demand of any stockholder, the vote upon any question
before the meeting, shall be by ballot. At all elections of directors of the
Corporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to as many votes as shall equal
the number of his shares of stock multiplied by the number of directors to be
elected, and he may cast all of such votes for a single director or may
distribute them among the number to be voted for, or any two or more of them as
he may see fit, which right when exercised, shall be termed cumulative voting.
All other questions shall be decided by plurality vote except as otherwise
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation and/or by the laws of the State of
Delaware.

 7. Written notice of the annual meeting shall be mailed to each stockholder
entitled to vote thereat, at such address as appears on the stock books of the
Corporation, at least ten days prior to the meeting. It shall be the duty of
every stockholder to furnish to the Secretary of the Corporation or to the
Transfer Agent, if any, of the class or series of stock owned by him, his
post-office address and to notify said Secretary or Transfer Agent of any change
therein.

 8. At least ten days before every election of directors, the Secretary shall
prepare and make or cause to be prepared and made, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at said election, arranged in alphabetical order,
with the residence of each, and the number of voting shares held by each. Such
list shall be open at the place where said election is to be held for said ten
days, to the examination of any stockholder, and shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of election during the whole time thereof, and subject to the
inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

                                     - 2 -

 9. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless
otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the Chairman of the Board or
the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or President or
Secretary upon the order in writing of a majority of or by resolution of the
Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of stockholders owning ten
percentum of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote. Such request or order shall state the purpose or purposes
of the proposed meeting. On failure by the Chairman of the Board or President or
Secretary to call such special meeting when duly requested, the makers of such
request or order may call such special meeting over their own signatures.

10. Written notice of a special meeting of stockholders, stating the time and
place and object thereof, shall be mailed, postage prepaid, or delivered, at
least ten days before such meeting, to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat
at his last known post-office address appearing on the books of the Corporation.
No business may be transacted at such meeting except that referred to in said
notice, or in a supplemental notice given also in compliance with the provisions
hereof.

                                     JUDGES.

11. At each meeting of the stockholders, the polls shall be opened and closed,
the proxies and ballots shall be received and taken in charge of, all questions
touching on the qualifications of voters and the validity of proxies and the
acceptance and rejection of votes shall be decided, the number of shares voted
shall be counted, the manner of voting said shares shall be ascertained, and the
result of the voting shall be declared by two judges. Such judges shall be
appointed by the Board of Directors before or at the meeting, and if no such
appointment shall have been made, then by the meeting. If for any reason any of
the judges previously appointed shall fail to attend or refuse or be unable to
serve, judges in place of any so failing to attend or refusing or unable to
serve shall be appointed either by the Board of Directors or by the
stockholders' meeting.

                                   DIRECTORS.

12. The business of the Corporation shall be managed by a Board of Directors.
The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be fixed
from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, but in no case shall
be less than three. Directors need not be stockholders. Each director (whether
elected at an annual meeting, or to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship
or otherwise) shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or
until his earlier resignation or removal.

Any director of this Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice
to the Chairman of the Board or President or Secretary of the Corporation. Such
resignation shall take effect at the time specified therein; and, unless
otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be
necessary to make it effective.

13. In case of any vacancies in the Board of Directors through death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other cause, the remaining directors
if less than a quorum, by affirmative vote of a majority thereof, or, if a
quorum, by a majority vote of such quorum, may elect a successor or successors,
and the director or directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual
election and until their successor or successors shall be elected and qualified.

14. The Board of Directors may hold their meetings and have one or more offices,
and keep the books of the Corporation, at such place or places as they may from
time to time determine.

15. A person being a full-time executive employee of the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries when first elected a director of the Corporation (an
"employee-director") shall not be eligible to serve as a director when not an
executive employee, whether by reason of resignation, retirement or other cause;
and a person not an employee-director shall not be eligible for election or
re-election as a director of the corporation after his 70th birthday.

Any employee-director not eligible to serve as a director by reason of the
foregoing provision shall be eligible to serve as an advisory director, as
hereinafter provided for in Section 24 of these By-Laws, until his 70th
birthday. The foregoing provisions with respect to the eligibility of a person
not an employee-director to serve as a director shall not apply to any person so
long as such person shall serve as a member of the Independent Litigation
Committee established and designated by the Board of Directors on September 17,
1986.

In addition to the powers and authorities expressly conferred upon it by
statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation and by these By-Laws, the Board of
Directors may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful
acts and things as may be done by the Corporation as are not by statute or by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws directed or required to be
exercised or done by the stockholders.

                               FEES OF DIRECTORS.

16. Directors shall be reimbursed for expenses, if any, incurred in attending
meetings of the Board of Directors and in otherwise performing duties as such
directors. Directors who perform no paid duties, as an officer, employee or
otherwise than as a director, for the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries,
may be paid by the Corporation such compensation for their services as directors
or as members of a committee authorized by the Board of Directors as may from
time to time be fixed by vote of a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors or by the vote of the holders of a majority of that part of the
capital stock of the Corporation having voting powers which is represented in
person or by proxy at any annual meeting of stockholders or at any special
meeting called for that purpose (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders
be there represented in person or by proxy).

                             MEETINGS OF THE BOARD.

17. The newly elected Board may meet at such place and time as shall be fixed by
the vote of the stockholders at the meeting at which such newly elected Board
was elected, for the purpose of organization or otherwise, and no notice of such
meeting shall be necessary to the newly elected directors in order legally to
constitute the meeting, provided a quorum shall be present, or they may meet at

either personally or by mail or telegram two days prior to such meeting or as

18. Regular meetings of the Board may be held without notice at such time and

on like notice, on the written request of two directors or on the request of the
Chairman of the Board or the President.

20. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, one-half of the number of
directors then in office, or, if there shall be an odd number of directors, then
a majority thereof, shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business, and the act of a majority of the directors present
at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of
Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically permitted or provided by
statute, or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these By-Laws. If at any
meeting of the Board there shall be less than a quorum present, a majority of
those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is
obtained, and no further notice thereof need be given other than by announcement
at said meeting which shall be so adjourned.

                            COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD.

21. The Board of Directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole
Board, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or
more of the directors of the Corporation, which to the extent provided in the
resolution, shall have and may exercise powers of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. The Board of
Directors may designate one or more advisory directors to be a member or members
of any such committee but no such advisory director shall have power to vote as
a member of such committee. The Board of Directors may also, by resolution
adopted by a majority of a quorum of the Board, designate one or more committees

the directors and of such other persons as shall be specified in such
resolution. Such committee or committees shall have such name or names as may be
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

22. The term of office of each member of any such committee shall be for such
period as may be from time to time determined by the Board of Directors but any
member of any such committee may be removed at any time by the Board of
Directors and shall cease to hold such office upon his ceasing to be a director
(or advisory director) or upon his resignation. Vacancies in the membership of
any such committee may be filled by the Board of Directors. Except as otherwise

rules of procedure but shall make a written report or recommendation to the
Board of Directors upon completion of its duties or whenever requested by the
Board.

                                    OFFICERS.

24. The Board of Directors may at any time appoint or reappoint as an advisory
director any person eligible to serve as such under the second paragraph of
Section 15 of these By-Laws whose services as such will be, in the opinion of
the Board of Directors, of value to the Corporation. An advisory director shall
be entitled to notice of and to attend and advise at, but not to vote at,
meetings of the Board of Directors, and any committees thereof to which he shall
be designated, and for his services may be paid, in the discretion of the Board
of Directors, compensation and reimbursement of expenses on the same basis as if
he were a director. The term of office of each advisory director shall terminate
on the earlier of the date when he ceases to be eligible for such position under
said paragraph of Section 15 or, subject to reappointment, the date of the first
meeting of the Board of Directors after the annual meeting of stockholders next
following his appointment.

25. The Board of Directors may appoint such other officers and agents as it
shall deem necessary, who shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as
shall be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.

the Corporation shall hold office until their successors are chosen and
qualified. Any officer may be removed at any time by the Board of Directors. In
the event of any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by reason of



                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>
death, resignation, removal or otherwise, such vacancy may be filled by, or in
the manner prescribed by, the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may
assign, or provide for the assignment or devolution of, the powers and duties of
any officer to any other officer or agent of the Corporation.

                 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.

27. The Board of Directors may from time to time in its discretion appoint from

                      POWERS AND DUTIES OF VICE-PRESIDENTS.

29. The Vice-Presidents shall exercise such of the powers and perform such of
the duties of the President on behalf of the Corporation as may be respectively
assigned to them from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President.
In the absence or inability of the President to act, the Executive
Vice-President, if there shall be a Vice-President designated as such by the
Board of Directors, or such Vice-President as shall have been designated by the
Board of Directors for the purpose, or, in the event of the failure of the Board
of Directors so to designate, then the Vice-President senior in service, or, in
the absence or inability of such Vice-President to act, any Vice-President shall
have and possess all of the powers and discharge all of the duties of the
President, subject however to the Board of Directors.

                       POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE TREASURER.

30. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to have the care and custody of all
the funds and securities of the Corporation which may come into his hands as
Treasurer, and to endorse checks, drafts and other instruments for the payment
of money for deposit or collection when necessary or proper and to deposit the
same to the credit of the Corporation in such bank or banks or depository as the
Board of Directors may designate, and he may endorse all commercial documents
requiring endorsements for or on behalf of the Corporation. He may sign all
receipts and vouchers for the payments made to the Corporation. He shall render
an account of his transactions to the Board of Directors as often as the Board

pursuant to vote of the Board of Directors, give a bond to the Corporation

the duties of the Secretary or Treasurer respectively, and shall perform such
other duties as may from time to time be imposed upon him by the Board of
Directors or by the President. The performance of any such duty shall be
conclusive evidence of his right to act.

33. In case of the absence of any officer of the Corporation, or for any other
reason that the Board may deem sufficient, the Board may delegate, for the time
being, the powers or duties, or any of them, of such officer to any other
officer, or to any director.

                            CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES.

35. The shares of the Corporation shall be represented by a certificate or shall
be uncertificated and shall be entered in the books of the Corporation and

Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the
powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other
special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,

Any of or all the signatures on a certificate may be facsimile. In case any

succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the
Corporation to issue a new certificate or evidence of the issuance of
uncertificated shares to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate

              ACTION IN RELIANCE UPON ORDERS OF REGULATORY BODIES.

44. No present or future director or officer of the Corporation (or his heirs,
executors and administrators) shall be liable for any act, omission, step or
conduct taken or had in good faith which (whether by condition or otherwise) is
required, authorized or approved by any order or orders issued pursuant to: the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935; the Federal Power Act; or any state
statute regulating the Corporation or its subsidiaries by reason of their being
public utility companies or public utility holding companies; or any amendment
to any thereof. In any action, suit or proceeding based on any act, omission,
step or conduct, as in this By-Law described, the provisions hereof shall be
brought to the attention of the Court. In the event that such provisions are
found by the Court not to constitute a valid defense on the grounds of not being
applicable to the particular class of plaintiff, each such director and officer
(and his heirs, executors and administrators) shall be reimbursed for, or
indemnified against, all expenses and liabilities incurred by him or imposed on
him, in connection with, or arising out of, any such action, suit or proceeding
based on any act, omission, step or conduct taken or had in good faith as in
this By-Law described. Such expenses and liabilities shall include, but shall
not be limited to, judgments, court costs and attorneys' fees. The foregoing
rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any director or
officer may otherwise be entitled and shall be available whether or not the
director or officer continues to be a director or officer at the time of
incurring such expenses and liabilities.

                      INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS.

45. Each person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation and who
was or is a party or was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, shall be indemnified by the Corporation as a matter of right against
any and all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by him and against any and all claims, judgments, fines, penalties,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement actually incurred by him in defense
of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, including appeals, to the full extent
permitted by applicable law. The indemnification provided by this Section shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a director or officer of the
Corporation with respect to the defense of any such claim, action, suit or
proceeding may be advanced by the Corporation prior to the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Board of Directors
in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation under this Section or
otherwise; provided, however, that the advancement of such expenses shall not be


                                     - 12 -
<PAGE>

deemed to be indemnification unless and until it shall ultimately be determined
that such person is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.

The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance at the expense of the
Corporation on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation, or any person who is or was serving at the request
of Corporation as a director (or the equivalent), officer, employee, agent or
trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability or expense (including
attorneys' fees) asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity,
or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have
the power to indemnify him against such liability or expense under this Section
or otherwise.

The foregoing rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which any
such director or officer may otherwise be entitled and shall be available
whether or not the director or officer continues to be a director or officer at
the time of incurring any such expenses and liabilities.

If any word, clause or provision of the By-Laws or any indemnification made
under Section 44 or Section 45 hereof shall for any reason be determined to be
invalid, the provisions of the By-Laws shall not otherwise be affected thereby
but shall remain in full force and effect. The masculine pronoun, as used in the
By-Laws, means the masculine and feminine wherever applicable.

                                   AMENDMENTS.

46. The By-Laws of the Corporation may be altered, amended or repealed (a) at
any meeting of the Board of Directors by the vote of a majority of the entire
Board then in office, or (b) by the vote of the holders of a majority of that
part of the capital stock of the Corporation having voting powers which is
represented in person or by proxy at any annual meeting of stockholders or at
any special meeting called for that purpose (provided that a lawful quorum of
stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy), or (c) without a
meeting by the written consent of the holders of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation having voting powers; provided,
however, that the Board of Directors shall not have power to alter, amend or
repeal the provisions of Sections 5, 44 or 46 of the By-Laws and provided,
further, that an alteration, amendment or repeal of any other provision of the
By-Laws by the Board of Directors shall cease to be effective unless submitted
to and ratified or approved at the next annual or special meeting at which a
lawful quorum of stockholders is represented in person or by proxy by the vote
of the holders of a majority of that part of the capital stock of the
Corporation having voting powers which is represented in person or by proxy at
such meeting.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore entered into a Senior Note
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2002, as amended (the "Original Indenture"), with

reference and the Original Indenture, as heretofore supplemented and as further
supplemented by this Second Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the
"Indenture";

         WHEREAS, under the Original Indenture, a new series of unsecured senior
debentures, notes or other evidences of indebtedness (the "Senior Notes") may at
any time be established by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance
with the provisions of the Original Indenture and the terms of such series may
be described by a supplemental indenture executed by the Company and the
Trustee;

         WHEREAS, the Company proposes to create under the Indenture a series of

delivery of this Second Supplemental Indenture and to make it a valid and
binding obligation of the Company have been done or performed.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set
forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.

         "Additional Interest" shall have the meaning assigned to it in the
Registration Rights Agreement.

         "Additional Interest Event" shall have the meaning assigned to it in
the Registration Rights Agreement.

         "Affiliate Subordinated Indebtedness" means the Southern Subordinated

         "Asset Sale" means any sale, lease, sale and leaseback transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of any assets including by way of the issue by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of equity interests in such Subsidiaries
which own any assets, except (a) in the ordinary course of business to the
extent that such property is worn out or is no longer useful or necessary in
connection with the operation of the Company's business or sale of inventory,
(b) if, prior to such conveyance or disposition, each Rating Agency provides a
Ratings Reaffirmation of the 2015 Notes after giving effect to such transaction,

any thereof, and other similar intangibles, (b) all deferred charges or
unamortized debt discount and expenses, (c) all reserves carried and not

fixed-price capacity power contract if a material portion of the capacity price
varies based upon a market index for electric capacity or energy, fuel, weather
or other factor that is external to the facility and the transaction between the
Company and its customer. The method of calculating the energy price shall not
be considered in assessing whether a power contract is a fixed-price capacity
power contract.

Article II

                                   2015 Notes

Section 201. Establishment. The Series C Notes shall be designated as the
Company's "4.875% Senior Notes, Series C due July 15, 2015" and the Series D
Notes shall be designated as the Company's "4.875% Senior Notes, Series D due
July 15, 2015". The Series C Notes and the Series D Notes shall be treated for
all purposes under the Indenture as a single class or series of Senior Notes.

Section 202. Aggregate Principal Amount. The Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver (i) Series C Notes for original issue on the Original Issue Date in the
aggregate principal amount of $575,000,000 and (ii) Series D Notes from time to
time thereafter for issue only in exchange for Series C Notes pursuant to the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement in accordance with the Registration Rights
Agreement or pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the
Registration Rights Agreement, in each case upon a Company Order for
authentication and delivery thereof and satisfaction of Sections 301 and 302 of
the Original Indenture. The aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes shall
be initially limited to $575,000,000. All 2015 Notes need not be issued at the
same time and such series may be reopened at any time, without the consent of
any Holder, for issuances of additional 2015 Notes. Any such additional 2015
Notes will have the same interest rate, maturity and other terms as those
initially issued. No further Series C Notes shall be authenticated and delivered
except as provided by Sections 203, 302, 303, 907 or 1107 of the Original
Indenture. The Series C Notes shall be issued in definitive fully registered
form.

         The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the 2015
Notes shall be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

         Each 2015 Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and
shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most
recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for.

Section 203. Payment of Principal and Interest. The principal of the 2015 Notes
shall be due at Stated Maturity (unless earlier redeemed). The unpaid principal
amount of the 2015 Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per annum
until paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date to the Person in whose name the 2015 Notes are
registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided
that interest payable at the Stated Maturity of principal or on a Redemption
Date as provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable.
The initial Interest Payment Date shall be January 15, 2004. Any such interest
that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holders on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the
Person or Persons in whose name the 2015 Notes are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such defaulted interest to
be fixed by the Trustee ("Special Record Date"), notice whereof shall be given
to Holders of the 2015 Notes not less than ten (10) days prior to such Special
Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent
with the requirements of any securities exchange, if any, on which the 2015
Notes shall be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by any such
exchange, all as more fully provided in the Original Indenture.

         Payments of interest on the 2015 Notes will include interest accrued
to, but excluding, the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for
the 2015 Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on
the 2015 Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on
such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and
without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), with the
same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.

         Payment of the principal and interest due at the Stated Maturity or
earlier redemption of the 2015 Notes shall be made upon surrender of the 2015
Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, in such coin or currency of
the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for
payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on
any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where
applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of
the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security
Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking
institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee
at least sixteen (16) days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled
thereto.

         Additional Interest shall accrue on the Transfer Restricted Securities
over and above the interest rate set forth herein at a rate of 0.50% per annum
from and including the date on which any Additional Interest Event shall occur
to, but excluding, the date on which all such Additional Interest Events have
been cured or, if earlier, the date on which the Transfer Restricted Securities
may first be resold in reliance on Rule 144(k). All Additional Interest shall be
paid to the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities in the same manner and at
the same time as regular payments of interest on the 2015 Notes. In the event
that more than one Additional Interest Events occurs at the same time, the
maximum increase in the interest rate shall be 0.50% per annum.

     Section 204. Denominations. The 2015 Notes may be issued in denominations
of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

     Section 205. Global Securities and Certificated Securities.

          (a) General. The Series C Notes will be resold initially only to (i)
     QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"), (ii)
     institutional "accredited investors" as such term is defined in Rule
     501(a)(1), (2),(3) and (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act (each,
     an "Institutional Accredited Investor") and (iii) Persons other than U.S.
     Persons (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S under the
     Securities Act ("Regulation S"). Series C Notes may thereafter be
     transferred to, among others, QIBs, purchasers in reliance on Regulation S,
     and Institutional Accredited Investors in each case, subject to the
     restrictions on transfer set forth herein.

          (b) Global Securities.

                    (i) Form. Series C Notes initially resold pursuant to Rule
               144A shall be issued initially in the form of one or more
               permanent global Securities in definitive, fully registered form
               (collectively, the "Rule 144A Global Security") and Series C
               Notes initially resold pursuant to Regulation S shall be issued
               initially in the form of one or more temporary global securities
               in definitive, fully registered form (collectively, the
               "Temporary Regulation S Global Security"), in each case without
               interest coupons and with the global securities legend and
               restricted securities legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto, which
               shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Series C
               Notes represented thereby with the Securities Custodian, and
               registered in the name of the Depository or a nominee of the
               Depository, duly executed by the Company and authenticated by the
               Trustee as provided in the Indenture. Except as set forth in this
               Section 205, beneficial ownership interests in the Temporary
               Regulation S Global Security (x) will not be exchangeable for
               interests in the Rule 144A Global Security, the permanent global
               security (the "Permanent Regulation S Global Security"), or any
               other security without a legend containing restrictions on
               transfer of such security prior to the expiration of the
               Distribution Compliance Period and (y) then may be exchanged for
               interests in a Rule 144A Global Security or the Permanent
               Regulation S Global Security only upon certification that
               beneficial ownership interests in such Temporary Regulation S
               Global Security are owned either by non-U.S. persons or U.S.
               persons who purchased such interests in a transaction that did
               not require registration under the Securities Act.

               The Rule 144A Global Security, the Temporary Regulation S Global
          Security and the Permanent Regulation S Global Security are
          collectively referred to herein as "Global Securities". The aggregate
          principal amount of the Global Securities may from time to time be
          increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the
          Trustee and the Depository or its nominee as hereinafter provided.

                    (ii) Book-Entry Provisions. This Section shall apply only to
               a Global Security deposited with or on behalf of the Depository.
               The Company shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance
               with this Section 2.05(b)(ii), authenticate and deliver initially
               one or more Global Securities that (a) shall be registered in the
               name of the Depository for such Global Security or Global
               Securities or the nominee of such Depository and (b) shall be
               delivered by the Trustee to such Depository or pursuant to such
               Depository's instructions or held by the Trustee as custodian for
               the Depository.

                  Members of, or participants in, the Depository ("Agent
         Members") shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any
         Global Security held on their behalf by the Depository or by the
         Trustee as the custodian of the Depository or under such Global
         Security, and the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or
         the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the Depository as the absolute
         owner of such Global Security for all purposes whatsoever.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the
         Company, the Trustee or any agent of the Company or the Trustee from
         giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other
         authorization furnished by the Depository or impair, as between the
         Depository and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices
         of such Depository governing the exercise of the rights of a holder of
         a beneficial interest in any Global Security.

                  To the extent a notice or other communication to the
         beneficial owners of the 2015 Notes is required under the Indenture,
         unless and until Certificated Securities shall have been issued to such
         owners, the Trustee shall give all such notices and communications
         specified herein to be given to such owners to the Depository, and
         shall have no obligations to such Owners.

               (c) Certificated Securities. Series C Notes sold to Institutional
          Accredited Investors shall be issued initially in the form of a fully
          registered, certificated Series C Note ("Certificated Securities").
          Except as provided in this Section 205, owners of beneficial interests
          in Global Securities shall not be entitled to receive physical
          delivery of Certificated Securities.

         Global Securities shall be exchangeable for Certificated Securities if
(i) the Depository (x) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depository for the Global Securities and the Company thereupon fails
to appoint a successor Depository within 90 days after receipt of such notice or
(y) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and the
Company thereupon fails to appoint a successor Depository within 90 days after
it becomes aware of such cessation or (ii) there shall have occurred and be
continuing an Event of Default or any event which after notice or lapse of time
or both would be an Event of Default under the Indenture and payment of
principal and interest has been accelerated. The Trustee shall notify the
Depository (in the case of (ii)) and the Holders of any such event. Upon
surrender to the Trustee of the typewritten certificate or certificates
representing the Global Securities by the Depository, accompanied by
registration instructions, the Trustee shall execute and authenticate the
certificates in accordance with the instructions of the Depository. Neither the
Security Registrar nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of
such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in
relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Certificated Securities, the
Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Certificated Securities as Holders.
The Certificated Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved or may be
produced in any other manner as is reasonably acceptable to the Company, as
evidenced by the execution thereof by the Company, and shall bear the legend set
forth on Exhibit A hereto unless the Company informs the Trustee that such
legend is no longer required.

Securities shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A thereto.

         be made for any transfer or exchange of 2015 Notes, but payment will be
         required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
         charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

(b)      Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities.

               (i) If a holder of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global

          may, subject to the rules and procedures of the Depository and to the
          requirements set forth in the following sentence, exchange or cause
          the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an
          equivalent beneficial interest in the Permanent Regulation S Global
          Security. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as transfer agent, of (1)
          instructions given in accordance with the Depository procedures from
          or on behalf of a holder of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A
          Global Security, directing the Trustee, as transfer agent, to credit
          or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in the Permanent
          Regulation S Global Security in an amount equal to the beneficial
          interest in the Rule 144A Global Security to be exchanged or
          transferred, (2) a written order given in accordance with the
          Depository's procedures containing information regarding the Euroclear
          or Clearstream account to be credited with such increase and the name
          of such account, and (3) a certificate in the form of Exhibit C hereto
          given by the holder of such beneficial interest stating that the
          exchange or transfer of such interest has been made pursuant to and in
          accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the
          Securities Act, the Trustee, as transfer agent, shall promptly deliver
          appropriate instructions to the Depository, its nominee, or the
          custodian for the Depository, as the case may be, to reduce or reflect
          on its records a reduction of the Rule 144A Global Security by the
          aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in such Rule
          144A Global Security to be so exchanged or transferred from the
          relevant participant, and the Trustee, as transfer agent, shall
          promptly deliver appropriate instructions to the Depository, its
          nominee, or the custodian for the Depository, as the case may be,
          concurrently with such reduction, to increase or reflect on its
          records an increase of the principal amount of such Permanent
          Regulation S Global Security by the aggregate principal amount of the
          beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global Security to be so
          exchanged or transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the
          account of the person specified in such instructions (who may be
          Euroclear or Clearstream or another agent member of Euroclear or
          Clearstream or both, as the case may be, acting for and on behalf of
          them) a beneficial interest in such Permanent Regulation S Global
          Security equal to the reduction in the principal amount of such Rule
          144A Global Security.

               (ii) If a holder of a beneficial interest in the Permanent
          Regulation S Global Security wishes at any time to exchange its
          interest in the Permanent Regulation S Global Security for an interest
          in the Rule 144A Global Security, or to transfer its interest in the
          Permanent Regulation S Global Security to a person who wishes to take
          delivery thereof in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global
          Security, such holder may, subject to the rules and procedures of
          Euroclear or Clearstream and the Depository, as the case may be, and
          to the requirements set forth in the following sentence, exchange or
          cause the exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest
          for an equivalent beneficial interest in such Rule 144A Global
          Security. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as transfer agent, of (1)
          instructions given in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or
          Clearstream and the Depository, as the case may be, from or on behalf
          of a beneficial owner of an interest in the Permanent Regulation S
          Global Security directing the Trustee, as transfer agent, to credit or
          cause to be credited a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global
          Security in an amount equal to the beneficial interest in the
          Permanent Regulation S Global Security to be exchanged or transferred,
          (2) a written order given in accordance with the procedures of
          Euroclear or Clearstream and the Depository, as the case may be,
          containing information regarding the account with the Depository to be
          credited with such increase and the name of such account, and (3)
          prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, a
          certificate in the form of Exhibit C hereto given by the holder of
          such beneficial interest and stating that the person transferring such
          interest in such Permanent Regulation S Global Security reasonably
          believes that the person acquiring such interest in the Rule 144A
          Global Security is a QIB and is obtaining such beneficial interest for
          its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the
          requirements of Rule 144A and any applicable securities laws of any
          state of the United States or any other jurisdiction, the Trustee, as
          transfer agent, shall promptly deliver appropriate instructions to the
          Depository, its nominee, or the custodian for the Depository, as the
          case may be, to reduce or reflect on its records a reduction of the
          Permanent Regulation S Global Security by the aggregate principal
          amount of the beneficial interest in such Permanent Regulation S
          Global Security to be exchanged or transferred, and the Trustee, as
          transfer agent, shall promptly deliver appropriate instructions to the
          Depository, its nominee, or the custodian for the Depository, as the
          case may be, concurrently with such reduction, to increase or reflect
          on its records an increase of the principal amount of the Rule 144A
          Global Security by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial
          interest in the Permanent Regulation S Global Security to be so
          exchanged or transferred, and to credit or cause to be credited to the
          account of the person specified in such instructions a beneficial
          interest in the Rule 144A Global Security equal to the reduction in
          the principal amount of the Permanent Regulation S Global Security.
          After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, the
          certification requirement set forth in clause (3) of the second
          sentence of this Section 207(b)(ii) will no longer apply to such
          exchanges and transfers.

               (iii) Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Securities
          that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
          interest in the other Global Securities will, upon transfer, cease to
          be an interest in such Global Security and become an interest in the
          other Global Securities and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject
          to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to
          beneficial interests in such other Global Security Note for as long as
          it remains such an interest.

               (iv) Beneficial interests in Temporary Regulation S Global
          Securities may be exchanged for interests in Rule 144A Global
          Securities or Permanent Regulation S Global Securities if (1) such
          exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of securities in
          compliance with Rule 144A, and (2) the transferor of the beneficial
          interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Security first delivers
          to the Trustee a written certificate (in a form satisfactory to the
          Trustee) to the effect that the beneficial interest in the Temporary
          Regulation S Global Security is being transferred to a Person (a) who
          the transferor reasonably believes to be a QIB (b) purchasing for its
          own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the
          requirements of Rule 144A, and (c) in accordance with all applicable
          securities laws of the states of the United States and other
          jurisdictions.

               (v) During the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial
          ownership interests in Temporary Regulation S Global Securities may
          only be sold, pledged or transferred through Euroclear or Clearstream
          in accordance with the applicable procedures relating to such
          institutions and only (i) to the Company, (ii) so long as such
          security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a Person
          whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases
          for its own account or for the account of a QIB in a transaction
          meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, (iii) in an offshore
          transaction in accordance with Regulation S (other than a transaction
          resulting in an exchange for interest in a Permanent Regulation S
          Global Security), (iv) pursuant to an exemption from registration
          under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under
          the Securities Act or (v) pursuant to an effective registration
          statement under the Securities Act, in each case in accordance with
          any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States.

     (c) Transfer and Exchange of Global Securities and Certificated Securities.

               (i) In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for a
          Certificated Security as provided in Section 205(c), such Certificated
          Security may be exchanged or transferred for one another, subject to
          Section 303 of the Original Indenture, only in accordance with such
          procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions of
          clauses (b)(i) and (ii) above (including the certification
          requirements intended to ensure that such exchanges or transfers
          comply with Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S, as the case may be)
          and as may be from time to time reasonably adopted by the Company.

               (ii) Upon receipt by the Trustee of a Certificated Security, duly
          endorsed or accompanied by appropriate instruments of transfer, the
          Trustee shall cancel such Certificated Security and cause, or direct
          the Securities Custodian to cause, in accordance with the standing
          instructions and procedures existing of the Depository and the
          Securities Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of 2015 Notes
          represented by the Rule 144A Global Security or Permanent Regulation S
          Global Security, as applicable, to be increased by the aggregate
          principal amount of the Certificated Security to be exchanged and
          shall credit or cause to be credited to the account of the Person
          specified in such instructions a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A
          Global Security or Permanent Regulation S Global Security, as
          applicable, equal to the principal amount of the Certificated Security
          so canceled. If no Rule 144A Global Securities or Permanent Regulation
          S Global Securities, as applicable, are then outstanding, the Company
          shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate, upon written order of
          the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, a new Rule 144A
          Global Security or Permanent Regulation S Global Security, as
          applicable, in the appropriate principal amount.

     (d) Certificates. In connection with any transfer described in paragraphs
(b) and (c) of this Section 207, the Trustee shall receive a certificate of
transfer in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto. Additionally, upon any
transfer or exchange to an Institutional Accredited Investor, the Company and
the Trustee shall receive a certificate in the form attached as Exhibit D
hereto.

     (e) Transfer Restricted Security. Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer
Restricted Security (including any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a
Global Security) pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, which shall be certified to the
Trustee and Security Registrar upon which each may conclusively rely:

          (i) in the case of any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a
     Certificated Security, the Security Registrar shall permit the Holder
     thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a Certificated
     Security that does not bear the legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto and
     rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted
     Security; and

          (ii) in the case of any Transfer Restricted Security represented by a
     Global Security, such Transfer Restricted Security shall not be required to
     bear the legend set forth in Exhibit A hereto if all other interests in
     such Global Note have been or are concurrently being sold or transferred
     pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective
     registration statement under the Securities Act.

     (f) Registered Exchange Offer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon
consummation of the Registered Exchange Offer, the Company shall issue and, upon
receipt of a Company Order in accordance with Section 303 of the Original
Indenture, the Trustee shall authenticate Series D Notes in exchange for Series
C Notes accepted for exchange in the Registered Exchange Offer, which Series D
Notes shall not bear the transfer restriction legend set forth in Exhibit A
hereto and shall not provide for Additional Interest, and the Security Registrar
shall rescind any restriction on the transfer of such Series D Notes, in each
case unless the Holder of such Series C Notes (A) is a broker-dealer tendering
Series C Notes acquired directly from the Company or an "affiliate" (as defined
in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) of the Company for its own account, (B) is
a Person who has an arrangement or understanding with any Person to participate
in the "distribution" (within the meaning of the Securities Act) of the Series D
Notes, (C) is a Person who is an "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act) of the Company or (D) will not be acquiring the Series D Notes
in the ordinary course of such Holder's business. The Company shall identify to
the Trustee such Holders in a written certification signed by an Officer of the
Company and, absent certification from the Company to such effect, the Trustee
shall assume that there are no such Holders.

Article III

                                   Redemption

Section 301. Optional Redemption. The 2015 Notes will be redeemable by the
Company in whole or in part at any time upon not less than 30 nor more than 60
days' notice, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the 2015
Notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereto, if any, to the redemption
date, plus the Make-Whole Premium.

                  In the event of redemption of the 2015 Notes in part only, a
new 2015 Note or Notes for the unredeemed portion will be issued in the name or
names of the Holders thereof upon the surrender thereof.
                  The 2015 Notes will not have a sinking fund.

                  Notice of redemption shall be given as provided in Section
1104 of the Original Indenture except that any Notice of Redemption shall not
specify the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

                  Any redemption of less than all of the 2015 Notes shall, with
respect to the principal thereof, be divisible by $1,000.

                  certificate to the effect that, to the best of such officer's
                  knowledge, no default or event of default under the 2015 Notes
                  or the Indenture has occurred and is continuing or, if any
                  default or event of default thereunder has occurred and is
                  continuing, specifying the nature and extent thereof and what
                  action is being taken or is proposed to be taken in response
                  thereto; and

(ii)              promptly after the Company obtains actual knowledge of the
                  occurrence thereof, written notice of the occurrence of any
                  event or condition which constitutes an event of default, and
                  an Officer's Certificate of the Company specifically stating
                  that such event of default has occurred and setting forth the
                  details thereof and the action which is being taken or is
                  proposed to be taken with respect thereto.

         All such information provided to the Trustee as indicated above also

be a single continuing request), to (x) Holders, (y) holders of beneficial
interests in the 2015 Notes or (z) prospective purchasers of the 2015 Notes or
beneficial interests in the 2015 Notes. The Company will furnish to the Trustee,
upon its request, sufficient copies of all such information to accommodate the
requests of such Holders and prospective holders of beneficial interests in the
2015 Notes.

         Upon the request of any Holder, any holder of a beneficial interest in
the 2015 Notes, or the Trustee (on behalf of a Holder or a holder of a
beneficial interest in the 2015 Notes), we will furnish such information as is
specified in paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 144A to Holders (and to holders of

properties and assets substantially as an entirety as described in Article VIII
of the Original Indenture, and other than assets required to be sold to conform
with governmental regulations, the Company will not, and will not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, consummate any Asset Sale, if the aggregate net book value
of all such Asset Sales consummated during the most recent twelve month period
would exceed 10% of Consolidated Tangible Assets as of the beginning of the
Company's most recently ended full fiscal quarter preceding such Asset Sale;
provided, however, that any such Asset Sale will be disregarded for purposes of
the 10% limitation specified above if the proceeds thereof (i) are, within 18
months of such Asset Sale, invested or reinvested by the Company or any
Subsidiary in a Permitted Business, (ii) are used by the Company or a Subsidiary
to repay Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary or (iii) are retained by
the Company or a Subsidiary; provided, further, to the extent that the Company
engages in a sale-leaseback transaction with the Effingham County Industrial

abatement opportunities relating to McIntosh 10 and McIntosh 11, such
transaction shall not be deemed to be an Asset Sale for purposes of this Section
402.

Section 403. Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, issue, assume, guarantee or permit to exist any
Indebtedness for borrowed money secured by any lien on any property of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, whether owned on the date that the 2015 Notes are
issued or thereafter acquired, without in any such case effectively securing the
outstanding 2015 Notes (together with, if the Company shall so determine, any
other Indebtedness of or guaranteed by the Company ranking equally with the 2015
Notes) equally and ratably with such Indebtedness (but only so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured); provided, however, that the foregoing restriction
shall not apply to the following liens:

(i)               liens, if any, in existence on the date the 2015 Notes are
                  issued;

(ii)              pledges or deposits in the ordinary course of business in

(iii)             liens imposed by law, such as carriers', warehousemen's and
                  mechanics' liens, arising in the ordinary course of business;

(iv)              liens for taxes being contested in good faith;

(v)               minor encumbrances, easements or reservations which do not in
                  the aggregate materially adversely affect the value of the
                  properties or impair their use;

(vi)              liens on any property existing at the time of acquisition
                  thereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

                  all or any portion of the cost of acquiring, constructing,
                  altering, improving or repairing any real or personal
                  property or improvements used or to be used in connection
                  with such property or (b) Indebtedness incurred by the
                  Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to, at the time of,
                  or within one year after the later of the acquisition, the
                  completion of construction (including any improvements on an
                  existing property), alteration, improvement, repair or the
                  commencement of commercial operation of the property, which
                  Indebtedness is incurred for the purpose of financing or
                  refinancing all or any part of the purchase price,
                  construction, improvements, alterations or repairs;

(ix)              mortgages securing obligations issued by a state, territory or
                  possession of the United States, or any political subdivision
                  of any of the foregoing or the District of Columbia, to
                  finance the acquisition or construction of property, and on
                  which the interest is not, in the opinion of tax counsel of
                  recognized standing or in accordance with a ruling issued by
                  the Internal Revenue Service, includible in gross income of
                  the holder by reason of Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal

                  at the time of the issuance of such obligations;

(x)               other liens to secure Indebtedness for borrowed money or in
                  connection with a project financing (including a
                  sale-leaseback transaction) in an aggregate principal amount
                  which does not at the time such Indebtedness is incurred
                  exceed 20% of Consolidated Tangible Assets; or

(xi)              liens granted in connection with extending, renewing,
                  replacing or refinancing (or successive extensions, renewals,

                  as there is no increase in the principal amount of the

         In the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall propose
to pledge, mortgage or hypothecate any property, other than as permitted by
clauses (i) through (xi) of the previous paragraph, the Company shall (prior
thereto) give written notice thereof to the Trustee, who shall give notice to
the Holders, and the Company shall, prior to or simultaneously with such pledge,
mortgage or hypothecation, effectively secure all the 2015 Notes equally and
ratable with such Indebtedness. This covenant does not restrict the Company's
ability or the ability of any of its Subsidiaries to pledge, mortgage,
hypothecate or permit to exist any mortgage, pledge or lien upon any assets
(other than an Existing Asset, except to the extent permitted by clauses (i)
through (xi) above) in connection with project financings or otherwise.

or as the proceeds of the issue and sale of shares of its common stock) on its
common stock, or purchase or permit any of its Subsidiaries to purchase any
shares of its common stock or make any payment on Affiliate Subordinated
Indebtedness, unless (i) the percentage derived from dividing Contracted
Operating Cash Flows by Total Operating Cash Flows is at least 80%, or (ii) the
ratio of Recourse Indebtedness to Total Capitalization is 60% or less.

Article V

provided in Section 501 of the Original Indenture, shall be an Event of Default
with respect to the 2015 Notes:

(a)      an event of default, as defined in any of the Company's instruments
         under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or
         evidenced, of any Indebtedness of the Company that has resulted in the
         acceleration of such Indebtedness, or any default occurring in payment
         of any such Indebtedness at final maturity (and after the expiration of
         any applicable grace periods), other than such Indebtedness the
         principal of which does not individually, or in the aggregate, exceed
         $50,000,000; or

         properties in an aggregate amount in excess of $50,000,000 (excluding
         the amount covered by insurance) and such judgment, decree or order
         remains unvacated, undischarged, unsatisfied and unstayed for more than
         60 consecutive days, except while being contested in good faith by
         appropriate proceedings.

Section 601. Defeasance of Certain Obligations. The Company may omit to comply
with any term, provision or condition set forth in Sections 402 through 405 of
this Second Supplemental Indenture and Section 501(4) (with respect to Sections
402 through 405) of the Original Indenture and Sections 501(a) and 501(b) of
this Second Supplemental Indenture shall be deemed not to be Events of Default
on the 123rd day after the deposit referred to in subparagraph (a) hereof if:

     (a)  with reference to this Section 601, the Company has irrevocably
          deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the Trustee (or
          another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section 611 of the
          Original Indenture) as trust funds in trust, specifically pledged as
          security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of
          the 2015 Notes, (i) money in an amount, or (ii) U.S. Government
          Obligations which through the payment of interest and principal in
          respect thereof in accordance with their terms (without reinvestment)
          will provide not later than one day before the due date of any payment
          referred to in clause (x) of this Section 601 money in an amount, or
          (iii) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a
          nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed
          in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay
          and discharge, after payment of all federal, state and local taxes or

          of principal and interest on the Outstanding 2015 Notes at the Stated
          Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or interest;

     (b)  the Company has delivered to the Trustee (i) an Opinion of Counsel to
          the effect that Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for
          federal income tax purposes as a result of the Company's exercise of
          its option under this Section 601 and will be subject to federal
          income tax on the same amount and in the same manner at the same times
          as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and discharge
          had not occurred, and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that
          the defeasance trust does not constitute an "investment company" under
          the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and after the passage
          of 123 days following the deposit, the trust fund will not be subject
          to the effect of Section 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or Section 15
          of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law;

     (c)  immediately after giving effect to such deposit on a pro forma basis,
          no Event of Default, or event that after the giving of notice or lapse
          of time or both would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred
          and be continuing on the date of such deposit or during the period
          ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit, and such
          deposit shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
          default under, any other agreement or instrument to which the Company
          is a party or by which the Company is bound; and

     (d)  The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
          Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be
          subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that
          all conditions precedent with respect to such covenant defeasance have
          been complied with.

     (ii) (A) any purchase of the Notes by us will be for our own account or for
          the account of one or more other Institutional Accredited Investors or

          "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(7) under the
          Securities Act and for each of which we exercise sole investment
          discretion or (B) we are a "bank", within the meaning of Section

          other institution described in Section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities
          Act that is acquiring the Notes as fiduciary for the account of one or
          more institutions for which we exercise sole investment discretion;

     (iii) in the event that we purchase any of the Notes, we will acquire Notes
          having a minimum purchase price of not less than $100,000 for our own
          account or for any separate account for which we are acting;

     (iv) we have such knowledge and experience in financial and business
          matters that we are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
          purchasing the Notes, and we and any accounts for which we are acting
          are each able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment in
          the Notes;

     (v)  we are not acquiring the Notes with a view to distribution thereof or

          for which we are acting as fiduciary shall remain at all times within
          our control; and

     (vi) we acknowledge that (A) we have been afforded an opportunity to
          request from the Company and to review, and we have received, all
          additional information considered by us to be necessary to verify the
          accuracy of the information contained in the offering memorandum
          relating to the Notes dated July 1, 2003 (the "Offering Memorandum");
          (B) we have not relied on any Initial Purchaser or any person

for registration of transfer any Notes acquired by us, except upon presentation
of evidence satisfactory to the Company and the transfer agent that the
foregoing restrictions on transfer have been complied with. We further
understand that any Notes acquired by us will be in definitive, certificated

                           (F) any Business Combination which would not
                  otherwise constitute a Change in Control because of the
                  application of clauses (A), (B) and (C) of Section
                  2.5(a)(iii);

                  referred to as "Surviving Company"), in substantially the same

                           (iv) three (3) weeks' Straight Time Pay for each of
                  the Participant's eleventh (11th) through fifteenth (15th)
                  Years of Service;

                           (v) five (5) weeks' Straight Time Pay for each of the
                  Participant's sixteenth (16th) through twentieth (20th) Years
                  of Service; and

                           (vi) six (6) weeks' Straight Time Pay for each of the
                  Participant's Years of Service in excess of twenty (20) Years
                  of Service.

                  (c)      Welfare Benefit.

                           (i) Except as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, each
                  Participant shall be eligible to participate in the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan for a period of six (6) months for
                  each of the Participant's Years of Service, not to exceed a
                  period of five (5) years, beginning on the first day of the
                  first month following the Participant's Termination Date
                  unless otherwise specifically provided under such plan, upon
                  the Participant's payment of both the Employing Company's and
                  the Participant's premium under such plan. A Participant who
                  receives this extended medical coverage shall also be entitled
                  to elect coverage under the Group Health Plan for his
                  dependents who are participating in the Group Health Plan on
                  the Participant's Termination Date (and for such other
                  dependents as may be entitled to coverage under the provisions
                  of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
                  1996) for the duration of the Participant's extended medical
                  coverage under this Section 3.2(c) to the extent such
                  dependents remain eligible for dependent coverage under the
                  terms of the Group Health Plan.

                           (ii) The extended medical coverage afforded to a
                  Participant pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) as well as the
                  premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with such
                  coverage shall be determined in accordance with the terms of
                  the Group Health Plan and shall be subject to any changes in
                  the terms and conditions of the Group Health Plan as well as
                  any future increases in premiums under the Group Health Plan.
                  The premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with
                  this extended coverage shall be due on the first day of each
                  month; provided, however, that if a Participant fails to pay
                  his premium within thirty (30) days of its due date, such
                  Participant's extended coverage shall be terminated.

                           (iii) Any Group Health Plan coverage provided under
                  this Section 3.2(c) shall be a part of and not in addition to
                  any COBRA Coverage which a Participant or his dependent may
                  elect. In the event that a Participant or his dependent
                  becomes eligible to be covered, by virtue of re-employment or
                  otherwise, by any employer-sponsored group health plan or is
                  eligible for coverage under any government-sponsored health
                  plan during the above period, coverage under the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan available to the Participant or
                  his dependent by virtue of the provisions of this Article 3
                  shall terminate, except as may otherwise be required by law,
                  and shall not be renewed. It shall be the duty of a
                  Participant to inform the Employing Company of his eligibility
                  to participate in any such health plan.

                           (iv) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3
                  hereof, regardless of whether a Participant elects the
                  extended coverage described in Section 3.2(c) hereof, the
                  Employing Company shall pay to each Participant a cash amount
                  equal to the Employing Company's and the Participant's cost of
                  premiums for coverage under the Group Health Plan and Group
                  Life Insurance Plan, if the Participant was participating in
                  such plans on his Termination Date, for a period equal to the
                  total number of weeks of pay the Participant receives as a
                  severance benefit under Section 3.2(b) hereof.

                  (d) Stock Option Vesting. The provisions of this Section
         3.2(d) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Omnibus Plan, the defined terms of
         which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(d) by reference.

                           (i) Any of the Participant's Options and Stock
                  Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the Termination Date
                  which are not then exercisable and vested, shall become fully
                  exercisable and vested to the full extent of the original
                  grant; provided, that in the case of a Participant holding a
                  Stock Appreciation Right who is subject to Section 16(b) of
                  the Exchange Act, such Stock Appreciation Right shall not
                  become fully vested and exercisable at such time if such
                  actions would result in liability to the Participant under
                  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided further, that any
                  such actions not taken as a result of the rules under Section
                  16(b) of the Exchange Act shall be effected as of the first
                  date that such activity would no longer result in liability
                  under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

                           (ii) The restrictions and deferral limitations
                  applicable to any of the Participant's Restricted Stock and
                  Restricted Stock Units as of the Termination Date shall lapse,
                  and such Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
                  become free of all restrictions and limitations and become
                  fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the
                  original grant.

                  (e) Performance Pay Program. The provisions of this Section
         3.2(e) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Performance Pay Program, the
         defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(e) by
         reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a Cash-Based
         Award under the PPP, if the PPP is in place as of the Participant's
         Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is entitled to
         participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to receive cash
         in an amount equal to a prorated payout of his Cash-Based Award under
         the PPP for the performance period in which the Termination Date shall
         have occurred, at target performance under the PPP and prorated by the
         number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         performance period until the Termination Date.

                  (f) Performance Dividend Program. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(f) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, was a participant in the Performance Dividend
         Program, the defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section
         3.2(f) by reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a
         Cash-Based Award under the PDP, if the PDP is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash for each such Cash-Based Award under the PDP held as of
         such date based on a payout percentage of 50% under the PDP for the
         performance period in which the Termination Date shall have occurred,
         and the annual dividend declared prior to the Termination Date.

                  (g) Other Short Term Incentives Under the Omnibus Plan. The
         provisions of this Section 3.2(g) shall apply to any Participant who,
         as of the date of the Change in Control is entitled to a Performance
         Unit or Performance Share award under the Omnibus Plan. Provided the
         Participant is not otherwise entitled to a Performance Unit/Share award
         under the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
         cash in an amount equal to a prorated payout of the value of his
         Performance Units and/or Performance Shares for the performance period
         in which the Termination Date shall have occurred, at target
         performance and prorated by the number of months which have passed
         since the beginning of the performance period until the Termination
         Date.

                  (h) Other Short-Term Incentive Plans. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(h) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, is a participant in any other "short term
         incentive compensation plan" not otherwise previously referred to in
         this Section 3.2. Provided the Participant is not otherwise entitled to
         a plan payout under any change in control provisions of such plans, if
         the "short term incentive compensation plan" is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash in an amount equal to his award under his respective
         Employing Company's "short term incentive compensation plan" for the
         annual performance period in which the Termination Date shall have
         occurred, at the Participant's target performance level and prorated by
         the number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         annual performance period until the Termination Date. For purposes of
         this Section 3.2(h), the term "short term incentive compensation plan"
         shall mean any incentive compensation plan or arrangement adopted in
         writing by an Employing Company which provides for annual, recurring
         compensatory bonuses to participants based upon articulated performance
         criteria, and which have been identified by the Board of Directors and
         listed on Exhibit B hereto, which may be amended from time to time to
         reflect plan additions, terminations and amendments.

         3.3 Coordination with Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Coverage.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, any Participant who is otherwise
eligible to retire pursuant to the terms of the Pension Plan, shall be deemed to
have retired for purposes of all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Employing Company of which the Participant is a participant. A Participant who
is deemed to have retired in accordance with the preceding sentence shall not be
eligible to receive the benefits described in Section 3.2(c) hereof if, upon his
Termination Date, such Participant becomes eligible to receive the retiree
medical and life insurance coverage provided to certain retirees pursuant to the
terms of the Pension Plan, the Group Health Plan and the Group Life Insurance
Plan.

         3.4 Maximum Benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above,
with respect to each Participant, the maximum benefit payable under this Article
3 shall be an amount equal to two (2) times such Participant's "annual
compensation" as defined in Department of Labor Regulation Section 2510.3-2(b),
which, for purposes of this Plan shall be no less than Straight Time Pay plus
thirty percent (30%). When necessary, the Administrative Committee shall reduce
the severance benefits described in Section 3.2(b) and 3.2(c)(iv) hereof to
comply with this Section 3.4.

         3.5 Payment of Benefits. The total amount payable under this Article 3
shall be paid to a Participant in one (1) lump sum payment within two (2)
payroll periods of the later of the following to occur: (a) the Participant's
Termination Date, or (b) the tender to the Employing Company by the Participant
of an effective Waiver and Release (in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto)
and the expiration of any applicable revocation period for such waiver. In the
event of a dispute with respect to liability or amount of any benefit due
hereunder, an effective Waiver and Release shall be tendered at the time of
final resolution of any such dispute when payment is tendered by the Employing
Company.

         3.6 Benefits in the Event of Death. In the event of the Participant's
death prior to the payment of all benefits due under this Article 3, the
Participant's estate shall be entitled to receive as due any amounts not yet
paid under this Article 3 upon the tender by the executor or administrator of
the estate of an effective Waiver and Release.

         3.7 Legal Fees. In the event of a dispute between a Participant and his
Employing Company with regard to any amounts due hereunder, if any material
issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, his
Employing Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees incurred with
respect to all issues in such dispute in an amount not to exceed fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000).

         3.8 No Mitigation. A Participant who receives benefits under Section
3.2 of this Plan shall have no duty or obligation to seek other employment
following his Termination Date and, except as otherwise provided in Subsection
3.1(d) hereof, the amounts due a Participant hereunder shall not be reduced or
suspended if such Participant accepts such subsequent employment.

         3.9 Non-qualified Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.
Subsequent to a Change in Control, any claims by a Participant for benefits
under any of the Company's non-qualified retirement or deferred compensation
plans shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the
procedures and provisions set forth in Article 5 hereof and if any material
issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, the
Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees in the manner provided in
Section 3.7 hereof.

                           ARTICLE 4 - ADMINISTRATION

         4.1 Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee shall be
responsible for the general administration of the Plan and shall be a "named
fiduciary" under Section 402 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended.

         4.2      Duties of the Administrative Committee.

                  (a) The Administrative Committee shall be responsible for the
         daily administration of the Plan and may appoint other persons or
         entities to perform or assist in the performance of any of its
         fiduciary duties, subject to its review and approval. The
         Administrative Committee shall have the right to remove any such
         appointee from his position without cause upon notice. Any person,
         group of persons, or entity may serve in more than one fiduciary
         capacity.

                  (b) The Administrative Committee shall maintain permanent
         records and accounts of Participants and of their rights under the Plan
         and of all receipts, disbursements, transfers, and other transactions
         concerning the Plan. Such accounts, books, and records relating thereto
         shall be open at all reasonable times to inspection and audit by the
         Company and any persons designated thereby.

                  (c) The Administrative Committee shall take all steps
         necessary to ensure that the Plan complies with the law at all times,
         including the preparation and filing of all documents and forms
         required by any governmental agency; maintenance of adequate
         Participant records; recording and transmission of all notices required
         to be given to Participants and their beneficiaries; receipt and
         dissemination, if required, of all reports and information received
         from the Employing Companies; securing of such fidelity bonds as may be
         required by law; and doing such other acts necessary for the proper
         administration of the Plan. The Administrative Committee shall keep a
         record of all of its proceedings and acts, and shall keep all such
         books of accounts, records, and other data as may be necessary for
         proper administration of the Plan. The Administrative Committee shall
         notify the Employing Companies upon their request of any action taken
         by it, and when required, shall notify any other interested person or
         persons.

         4.3 Powers. The Administrative Committee shall administer the Plan in
accordance with its terms and shall have all powers necessary to carry out the
provisions of the Plan as more particularly set forth herein. The Administrative
Committee shall have the discretionary authority to interpret the Plan
(including any ambiguities herein) and to determine all questions arising in the
administration, interpretation, and application of the Plan. The Administrative
Committee shall adopt such procedures and regulations necessary or desirable for
the discharge of its duties hereunder and may appoint such accountants, counsel,
actuaries, specialists, and other agents as it deems necessary or desirable in
connection with the administration of this Plan. The Administrative Committee
shall be the legal appointed agent for the service of process.

         4.4 Compensation of the Administrative Committee. The Administrative
Committee shall not receive any compensation from the Plan for its services.

         4.5 Payment of Expenses. The Administrative Committee shall be
reimbursed by the Employing Companies for its reasonable expenses incurred in
the discharge of its duties. Such expenses shall include any expenses incident
to its duties, including, but not limited to, fees of accountants, counsel,
actuaries, and other specialists, and other costs of administering the Plan.

         4.6 Indemnification. Each Employing Company shall indemnify the
Administrative Committee against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses,
and liability arising from its actions or omissions, except when the same is
finally adjudicated to be the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Employing Companies may purchase at their own expense sufficient liability
insurance for the Administrative Committee to cover any and all claims, losses,
damages, and expenses arising from any action or omission in connection with the
execution of the duties as the Administrative Committee.

                             ARTICLE 5 - ARBITRATION

         5.1 General. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to the Company's obligations to pay severance benefits under this Plan,
or the breach thereof, shall be settled and resolved solely by arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") except as otherwise provided herein. The arbitration shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of any such claim for severance
benefits and the arbitrators' award shall be final and binding. The provisions
of this Article 5 are not intended to apply to any other disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to a Participant's employment by an
Employing Company or the termination thereof.

         5.2 Demand for Arbitration. Arbitration shall be initiated by serving a
written notice of demand for arbitration to the Participant, in the case of an
Employing Company, or to the Administrative Committee, in the case of a
Participant.

         5.3 Law and Venue. The arbitrators shall apply the laws of the State of
Georgia, except to the extent pre-empted by federal law, excluding any law which
would require the use of the law of another state. The arbitration shall be held
in Atlanta, Georgia.

         5.4 Appointment of Arbitrators. Arbitrators shall be appointed within
fifteen (15) business days following service of the demand for arbitration. The
number of arbitrators shall be three. One arbitrator shall be appointed by the
Participant, one arbitrator shall be appointed by the Employing Company, and the
two arbitrators shall appoint a third. If the arbitrators cannot agree on a
third arbitrator within thirty (30) business days after the service of demand
for arbitration, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA.

         5.5 Costs. The arbitration filing fee shall be paid by the Participant.
All other costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Participant and his
Employing Company, provided, however, that such Employing Company shall
reimburse such fees and costs in the event any material issue in such dispute is
finally resolved in the Participant's favor and the Participant is reimbursed
legal fees under Section 3.7 hereof.

         5.6 Interim and Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Article 5 is
intended to preclude, upon application of either party, any court having
jurisdiction from issuing and enforcing in any lawful manner such temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and other interim measures of
relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to either party's interests or as
otherwise may be appropriate pending the conclusion of arbitration proceedings
pursuant to this Article 5 and nothing herein is intended to prevent any court
from entering and enforcing in any lawful manner such judgments for permanent
equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to a party's interests or
as otherwise may be appropriate following the issuance of arbitral awards
pursuant to this Article 5.

                            ARTICLE 6 - MISCELLANEOUS

         6.1 Funding of Benefits. Unless the Board of Directors in its
discretion determines otherwise, the benefits payable to a Participant under the
Plan shall not be funded in any manner and shall be paid by the Employing
Companies out of their general assets, which assets are subject to the claims of
the Employing Companies' creditors.

         6.2 Withholding. There shall be deducted from the payment of any
benefit due under the Plan the amount of any tax required by any governmental
authority to be withheld and paid over by the Employing Companies to such
governmental authority for the account of the Participant entitled to such
payment.

         6.3 Assignment. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any rights to
sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise convey the right to receive the
payment of any benefit due hereunder, which payment and the rights thereto are
expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. Any attempt to do so
shall be null and void and of no effect.

         6.4 Amendment and Termination. The Plan may be amended or terminated at
any time by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the above, no amendment or
termination of the Plan shall be effective if such amendment or termination is
made or is effective within six (6) months of a Preliminary Change in Control
unless such amendment or termination has the effect of increasing benefits to
Participants under the Plan or is determined by the Board of Directors to be
immaterial.

         6.5 Pooling Accounting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if, but for any provision of this Plan, a Change in Control transaction
would otherwise be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests under APB No.16
("Pooling Accounting") (after giving effect to any and all other facts and
circumstances affecting whether such Change in Control transaction would use
Pooling Accounting), such provision or provisions of this Plan which would
otherwise cause the Change in Control transaction to be ineligible for Pooling
Accounting shall be void and ineffective in such a manner and to the extent that
by eliminating such provision or provisions of this Plan, Pooling Accounting
would be required for such Change in Control transaction.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Southern Company Change in Control Severance
Plan has been executed by the Company through its duly authorized officers, this
16th day of May, 2003, to be effective as provided herein.

                                    Exhibit A


                                SOUTHERN COMPANY
                                CHANGE IN CONTROL
                                 SEVERANCE PLAN

                               Waiver and Release

         I understand that I am entitled to receive the severance benefits
described in Article 3 of the Southern Company Change in Control Severance Plan
(the "Plan") if I execute this Waiver and Release ("Waiver"). I understand that

                           (F) any Business Combination which would not

                  Beneficial Ownership of all or substantially all of Southern's
                  Voting Securities or all or substantially all of Southern's
                  assets) (such surviving or resulting corporation to be
                  referred to as "Surviving Company"), in substantially the same

                  Beneficial Ownership, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more
                  of the combined voting power of the then outstanding Voting

                  ownership existed prior to the Business Combination; and

                           (C) at least a majority of the members of the board
                  of directors of Surviving Company were members of the
                  Incumbent Board at the earlier of the date of execution of the
                  initial agreement, or of the action of the Southern Board,
                  providing for such Business Combination.

         shall not constitute a Change in Control;

                  (ii) The Consummation of a reorganization, merger or
         consolidation of an Employing Company (an "Employing Company Business

Gas, LLC in the Plan as an Employing Company shall be limited to Support

         similarly affecting at least ninety-five percent (95%) of all Employees
         of the Employing Company); or (ii) the sum of the Employee's Base
         Salary plus target bonus under his Employing Company's short term bonus
         plan (e.g., the PPP under the Omnibus Plan), as in effect immediately
         prior to the Change in Control (except for a less than ten percent
         (10%), across-the-board reduction of Base Salary plus target bonus
         under such short term plan similarly affecting at least ninety-five
         percent (95%) of all Employees of the Employing Company);

                  (c) Compensation Plans. The failure by the Employing Company

         Employee participates as of the date of the Change in Control or the
         elimination of the Employee's participation in any such plan, (except
         for across-the-board plan changes or terminations similarly affecting
         at least ninety-five percent (95%) of all Employees of the Employing
         Company);

                  For purposes of this Section 2.17(c), the "compensation plan
         or agreement" shall mean any written arrangement executed by an
         authorized officer of the Employing Company which provides for

                  (d) Relocation. A change in an Employee's work location to a
         location more than fifty (50) miles from the facility where the

         new work location is within fifty (50) miles from the Employee's
         principal place of residence at the time of the Change in Control. The
         acceptance, if any, by an Employee of employment by an Employing
         Company at a work location which is outside the fifty mile radius set
         forth in this Section 2.17(d) shall not be a waiver of the Employee's
         right to refuse subsequent transfer by an Employing Company to a
         location which is more than fifty (50) miles from the Employee's
         principal place of residence at the time of the Change in Control, and
         such subsequent, unconsented transfer shall be "Good Reason" under this
         Agreement; or

3.1      Eligibility.

                  (a) Employees. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
         Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by his Employing
         Company at any time during the two year period following a Change in
         Control of Southern or his Employing Company for reasons other than
         Cause or who shall voluntarily terminate his employment with his
         Employing Company for Good Reason at any time during the two year
         period following a Change in Control of Southern or his Employing
         Company, shall be entitled to participate in this Plan and receive the
         benefits described in Section 3.2 hereof, subject to the terms and
         conditions described in this Article 3.

                  (b) Deemed Employees. An Employee who is deemed to be employed
         by a different Employing Company than his actual Employing Company
         under Section 2.13 hereof, shall be entitled to participate in this
         Plan and receive the benefits described in Section 3.2 hereof in the
         same manner as other Employees under Section 3.1(a) hereof; provided,
         however, that such deemed Employee will be considered to be an Employee
         of the deemed Employing Company solely for purposes of determining
         whether a Change in Control has occurred. For all other purposes under
         this Plan, such deemed Employee's actual Employing Company shall be
         considered.

                  (c) Support Employees. A Support Employee shall be entitled to
         participate in this Plan and receive the benefits described in Section
         3.2 hereof, subject to the terms and conditions described in this
         Article 3.

                  (d) Limits on Eligibility. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary herein, an Employee or Support Employee shall not be eligible
         to receive benefits under this Plan if the Employee or Support
         Employee:

                           (i) is not actively at work on his Termination Date,
                  unless such Employee or Support Employee is capable of
                  returning to work within twelve (12) weeks of the beginning of
                  any leave of absence from work;

                           (ii) voluntarily terminates his employment with his
                  Employing Company for other than Good Reason;

                           (iii) is terminated by his Employing Company for
                  Cause;

                           (iv) accepts the transfer of his employment to
                  Southern, any Southern Subsidiary or any employer that
                  acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Southern, a
                  Southern Subsidiary or his Employing Company;

                           (v) refuses an offer of continued employment with his
                  Employing Company, Southern or a Southern Subsidiary, or any
                  employer that acquires all or substantially all of the assets
                  of Southern, a Southern Subsidiary or his Employing Company,
                  under circumstances where such refusal would not amount to
                  Good Reason for voluntary termination of employment and such
                  employer agrees to adopt this Plan as it applies to such
                  Participant; or

                           (vi) elects to receive the benefits of any other
                  voluntary or involuntary severance, separation or outplacement
                  program, plan or agreement maintained by his Employing Company
                  in lieu of benefits under this Plan; provided however, that
                  the receipt of benefits under any retention plan or agreement
                  shall not be deemed to be the receipt of benefits under any
                  severance, separation or outplacement program for purposes of
                  this Plan.

         3.2 Benefits. Upon the Employing Company's receipt of an effective
Waiver and Release, Participants shall be entitled to receive the following
benefits:

                  (a) Employee Outplacement Services. Each Participant shall be
         eligible to participate in the Employee Outplacement Program, which
         program shall not be less than six (6) months duration measured from
         the Participant's Termination Date.

                  (b) Severance Benefit. Participants shall be paid in cash an
         amount equal to two times the Participant's Annual Compensation, but
         not in excess of the Capped Amount. For purposes of this Section
         3.2(b), the Capped Amount shall be the amount otherwise payable under
         this Section 3.2(b), reduced in such amount and to such extent that no
         amount of the payment under this Section 3.2(b), plus all other
         "parachute payments" under Code Section 280G, would constitute an
         "excess parachute payment" under Code Section 280G, but only to the
         extent that if the payment under this Section 3.2(b) were increased by
         one additional dollar ($1.00), a portion of the payment under this
         Section 3.2(b) would be an "excess parachute payment" under Code
         Section 280G. The calculation of the Capped Amount and any other
         determinations relating to the applicability of Code Section 280G (and
         the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) to the payments
         contemplated by this Plan shall be made by the tax department of the
         independent public accounting firm then responsible for preparing
         Southern's consolidated federal income tax return, and such
         determinations shall be binding upon the Participants, Southern and the
         Employing Company.

                  (c) Welfare Benefit.

                           (i) Except as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, each
                  Participant shall be eligible to participate in the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan for a period of six (6) months for
                  each of the Participant's Years of Service, not to exceed a
                  period of five (5) years, beginning on the first day of the
                  first month following the Participant's Termination Date
                  unless otherwise specifically provided under such plan, upon
                  the Participant's payment of both the Employing Company's and
                  the Participant's premium under such plan. A Participant who
                  receives this extended medical coverage shall also be entitled
                  to elect coverage under the Group Health Plan for his
                  dependents who are participating in the Group Health Plan on
                  the Participant's Termination Date (and for such other
                  dependents as may be entitled to coverage under the provisions
                  of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
                  1996) for the duration of the Participant's extended medical
                  coverage under this Section 3.2(c) to the extent such
                  dependents remain eligible for dependent coverage under the
                  terms of the Group Health Plan.

                           (ii) The extended medical coverage afforded to a
                  Participant pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) as well as the
                  premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with such
                  coverage shall be determined in accordance with the terms of
                  the Group Health Plan and shall be subject to any changes in
                  the terms and conditions of the Group Health Plan as well as
                  any future increases in premiums under the Group Health Plan.
                  The premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with
                  this extended coverage shall be due on the first day of each
                  month; provided, however, that if a Participant fails to pay
                  his premium within thirty (30) days of its due date, such
                  Participant's extended coverage shall be terminated.

                           (iii) Any Group Health Plan coverage provided under
                  this Section 3.2(c) shall be a part of and not in addition to
                  any COBRA Coverage which a Participant or his dependent may
                  elect. In the event that a Participant or his dependent
                  becomes eligible to be covered, by virtue of re-employment or
                  otherwise, by any employer-sponsored group health plan or is
                  eligible for coverage under any government-sponsored health
                  plan during the above period, coverage under the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan available to the Participant or
                  his dependent by virtue of the provisions of this Article 3
                  shall terminate, except as may otherwise be required by law,
                  and shall not be renewed. It shall be the duty of a
                  Participant to inform the Employing Company of his eligibility
                  to participate in any such health plan.

                           (iv) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3
                  hereof, regardless of whether a Participant elects the
                  extended coverage described in Section 3.2(a) hereof, the
                  Employing Company shall pay to each Participant a cash amount
                  equal to the Employing Company's and the Participant's cost of
                  premiums for two (2) years of coverage under the Group Health
                  Plan and Group Life Insurance Plan, as such Plans were in
                  effect as of the date of the Change in Control.

         3.2(d) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Omnibus Plan, the defined terms of
         which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(d) by reference.

                           (i) Any of the Participant's Options and Stock
                  Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the Termination Date
                  which are not then exercisable and vested, shall become fully
                  exercisable and vested to the full extent of the original
                  grant; provided, that in the case of a Participant holding a
                  Stock Appreciation Right who is subject to Section 16(b) of
                  the Exchange Act, such Stock Appreciation Right shall not
                  become fully vested and exercisable at such time if such
                  actions would result in liability to the Participant under
                  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided further that any
                  such actions not taken as a result of the rules under Section
                  16(b) of the Exchange Act shall be effected as of the first
                  date that such activity would no longer result in liability
                  under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

                           (ii) The restrictions and deferral limitations
                  applicable to any of the Participant's Restricted Stock and
                  Restricted Stock Units as of the Termination Date shall lapse,
                  and such Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
                  become free of all restrictions and limitations and become
                  fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the
                  original grant.

                  (e) Performance Pay Program. The provisions of this Section
         3.2(e) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Performance Pay Program, the
         defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(e) by
         reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a Cash-Based
         Award under the PPP, if the PPP is in place as of the Participant's
         Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is entitled to
         participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to receive cash
         in an amount equal to a prorated payout of his Cash-Based Award under
         the PPP for the performance period in which the Termination Date shall
         have occurred, at target performance under the PPP and prorated by the
         number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         performance period until the Termination Date.

                  (f) Performance Dividend Program. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(f) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, was a participant in the Performance Dividend
         Program, the defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section
         3.2(f) by reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a
         Cash-Based Award under the PDP, if the PDP is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash for each such Cash-Based Award under the PDP held as of
         such date based on a payout percentage of 50% under the PDP for the
         performance period in which the Termination Date shall have occurred,
         and the annual dividend declared prior to the Termination Date.

                  (g) Other Short Term Incentives Under the Omnibus Plan. The
         provisions of this Section 3.2(g) shall apply to any Participant who,
         as of the date of the Change in Control is entitled to a Performance
         Unit or Performance Share award under the Omnibus Plan. Provided the
         Participant is not otherwise entitled to a Performance Unit/Share award
         under the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
         cash in an amount equal to a prorated payout of the value of his
         Performance Units and/or Performance Shares for the performance period
         in which the Termination Date shall have occurred, at target
         performance and prorated by the number of months which have passed
         since the beginning of the performance period until the Termination
         Date.

                  (h) Other Short-Term Incentive Plans. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(h) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, is a participant in any other "short term
         incentive compensation plan" not otherwise previously referred to in
         this Section 3.2. Provided the Participant is not otherwise entitled to
         a plan payout under any change in control provisions of such plans, if
         the "short term incentive compensation plan" is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash in an amount equal to his award under his respective
         Employing Company's "short term incentive compensation plan" for the
         annual performance period in which the Termination Date shall have
         occurred, at the Participant's target performance level and prorated by
         the number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         annual performance period until the Termination Date. For purposes of
         this Section 3.2(h), the term "short term incentive compensation plan"
         shall mean any incentive compensation plan or arrangement adopted in
         writing by an Employing Company which provides for annual, recurring
         compensatory bonuses to participants based upon articulated performance
         criteria, and which have been identified by the Board of Directors and
         listed on Exhibit B hereto, which may be amended from time to time to
         reflect plan additions, terminations and amendments.

         3.3 Coordination with Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Coverage.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, any Participant who is otherwise
eligible to retire pursuant to the terms of the Pension Plan shall be deemed to
have retired for purposes of all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Employing Company of which the Participant is a participant. A Participant who
is deemed to have retired in accordance with the preceding sentence shall not be
eligible to receive the benefits described in Section 3.2(c) hereof if, upon his
Termination Date, such Participant becomes eligible to receive the retiree
medical and life insurance coverage provided to certain retirees pursuant to the
terms of the Pension Plan, the Group Health Plan and the Group Life Insurance
Plan.

         3.4 Payment of Benefits. The amounts due a Participant under Sections
3.2(b) and (c) hereof shall be payable in one (1) lump sum payment as soon as
administratively practicable within thirty (30) days of the later of the
following to occur: (a) the Participant's Termination Date, or (b) the tender to
the Employing Company by the Participant of an effective Waiver and Release in
the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and the expiration of any applicable
revocation period for such waiver. In the event of a dispute with respect to
liability or amount of any benefit due hereunder, an effective Waiver and
Release shall be tendered at the time of final resolution of any such dispute
when payment is tendered by the Employing Company.

         3.5 Benefits in the Event of Death. In the event of the Participant's
death prior to the payment of all benefits due under this Article 3, the
Participant's estate shall be entitled to receive as due any amounts not yet
paid under this Article 3 upon the tender by the executor or administrator of
the estate of an effective Waiver and Release.

         3.6 Legal Fees. In the event of a dispute between a Participant and his
Employing Company with regard to any amounts due hereunder, if any material
issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, his
Employing Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees incurred with
respect to all issues in such dispute in an amount not to exceed thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000).

         3.7 No Mitigation. A Participant who receives benefits under Section
3.2 of this Plan shall have no duty or obligation to seek other employment
following his Termination Date and, except as otherwise provided in Subsection
3.1(d) hereof, the amounts due a Participant hereunder shall not be reduced or
suspended if such Participant accepts such subsequent employment.

         3.8 Non-qualified Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.
Subsequent to a Change in Control, any claims by a Participant for benefits
under any of the Company's non-qualified retirement or deferred compensation
plans shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the
procedures and provisions set forth in Article 5 hereof and if any material
issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, the
Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees in the manner provided in
Section 3.6 hereof.

ARTICLE 4                                                  - ADMINISTRATION
- -------------------                                        ----------------

         4.1 Administrative Committee. The Administrative Committee shall be
responsible for the general administration of the Plan and may appoint other
persons or entities to perform or assist in the performance of any of its
duties, subject to its review and approval. The Administrative Committee shall
have the right to remove any such appointee from his position without cause upon
notice.

ARTICLE 5                                                   - ARBITRATION
- -------------------                                         -------------

         5.1 General. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to the Company's obligations to pay severance benefits under this Plan,
or the breach thereof, shall be settled and resolved solely by arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") except as otherwise provided herein. The arbitration shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of any such claim for severance
benefits and the arbitrators' award shall be final and binding. The provisions
of this Article 5 are not intended to apply to any other disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to a Participant's employment by an
Employing Company or the termination thereof.

         5.2 Demand for Arbitration. Arbitration shall be initiated by serving a
written notice of demand for arbitration to the Participant, in the case of an
Employing Company, or to the Administrative Committee, in the case of a
Participant.

         5.3 Law and Venue. The arbitrators shall apply the laws of the State of
Georgia, except to the extent pre-empted by federal law, excluding any law which
would require the use of the law of another state. The arbitration shall be held
in Atlanta, Georgia.

         5.4 Appointment of Arbitrators. Arbitrators shall be appointed within
fifteen (15) business days following service of the demand for arbitration. The
number of arbitrators shall be three. One arbitrator shall be appointed by the
Participant, one arbitrator shall be appointed by the Employing Company, and the
two arbitrators shall appoint a third. If the arbitrators cannot agree on a
third arbitrator within thirty (30) business days after the service of demand
for arbitration, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA.

         5.5 Costs. The arbitration filing fee shall be paid by the Participant.
All other costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Participant and his
Employing Company, provided, however, that such Employing Company shall
reimburse such fees and costs in the event any material issue in such dispute is
finally resolved in the Participant's favor and the Participant is reimbursed
legal fees under Section 3.6 hereof.

         5.6 Interim and Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Article 5 is
intended to preclude, upon application of either party, any court having
jurisdiction from issuing and enforcing in any lawful manner such temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and other interim measures of
relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to either party's interests or as
otherwise may be appropriate pending the conclusion of arbitration proceedings
pursuant to this Article 5 and nothing herein is intended to prevent any court
from entering and enforcing in any lawful manner such judgments for permanent
equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to a party's interests or
as otherwise may be appropriate following the issuance of arbitral awards
pursuant to this Article 5.

ARTICLE 6                                                  - MISCELLANEOUS
- -------------------                                        ---------------

         6.1 Funding of Benefits. Unless the Board of Directors shall in its
discretion determine otherwise, the benefits payable to a Participant under the
Plan shall not be funded in any manner and shall be paid by the Employing
Companies out of their general assets, which assets are subject to the claims of
the Employing Companies' creditors.

         6.2 Withholding. There shall be deducted from the payment of any
benefit due under the Plan the amount of any tax required by any governmental
authority to be withheld and paid over by the Employing Companies to such
governmental authority for the account of the Participant entitled to such
payment.

         6.3 Assignment. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any rights to
sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise convey the right to receive the
payment of any benefit due hereunder, which payment and the rights thereto are
expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. Any attempt to do so
shall be null and void and of no effect.

         6.4 Amendment and Termination. The Plan may be amended or terminated at
any time by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the above, no amendment or
termination of the Plan shall be effective if such amendment or termination is
made or is effective within six (6) months of a Preliminary Change in Control
unless such amendment or termination has the effect of increasing benefits to
Participants under the Plan or is determined by the Board of Directors to be
immaterial.

         6.5 Pooling Accounting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if, but for any provision of this Plan, a Change in Control transaction
would otherwise be accounted for as a pooling-of-interests under APB No.16
("Pooling Accounting") (after giving effect to any and all other facts and
circumstances affecting whether such Change in Control transaction would use
Pooling Accounting), such provision or provisions of this Plan which would
otherwise cause the Change in Control transaction to be ineligible for Pooling
Accounting shall be void and ineffective in such a manner and to the extent that
by eliminating such provision or provisions of this Plan, Pooling Accounting
would be required for such Change in Control transaction.


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Southern Company Executive Change in Control
Severance Plan has been executed by the Company through its duly authorized
officers, this 16th day of May, 2003, to be effective as provided herein.

                                 SEVERANCE PLAN

                               Waiver and Release

         I understand that I am entitled to receive the Severance Benefits
described in Article 3 of the Southern Company Executive Change in Control
Severance Plan (the "Plan") if I execute this Waiver and Release ("Waiver"). I
understand that the benefits I have elected to receive under the Plan are in

         I recognize that I may have a claim against the Company under Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans
with Disabilities Act or other federal, state and local laws.

         In exchange for the benefits I elect to receive, I hereby irrevocably
waive and release all claims, of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown
in connection with any claim which I ever had, may have, or now have against The
Southern Company, Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power

claims or causes of action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act which
arise out of events occurring after the execution date of this Waiver.

         In further exchange for the benefits I elect to receive, I understand
and agree that I will respect the proprietary and confidential nature of any
information I have obtained in the course of my service with the Company or any

am obligated to keep confidential and not disclose the terms of this Waiver,
including, but not limited to, the benefits under this Plan, except to my
attorneys, financial advisors, or except where such disclosure is required by
law. However, nothing in this Waiver shall prohibit me from engaging in
protected activities under applicable law or from communicating, either
voluntary or otherwise, with any governmental agency concerning any potential
violation of the law.

         In signing this Waiver, I am not releasing claims to any vested or
accrued benefits that I have under any workers' compensation laws or any
retirement plan or welfare benefit plan within the meaning of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which is sponsored by or
adopted by the Company and/or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries;
however, I understand and acknowledge that nothing herein is intended to or
shall be construed to require the Company to institute or continue in effect any
particular plan or benefit sponsored by the Company and the Company hereby
reserves the right to amend or terminate any of its benefit programs at any time
in accordance with the procedures set forth in such plans.

         In signing this Waiver, I realize that I am waiving and releasing,
among other things, any claims to benefits under any and all bonus, severance,
workforce reduction, early retirement, outplacement, or any other similar type
plan sponsored by the Company except for programs specifically designed for
participants in the Plan.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Waiver to the contrary, I understand
that the Company is not discouraging or prohibiting me from engaging in any
protected activity described in Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act.

         I have been encouraged and advised in writing to seek advice from
anyone of my choosing regarding this Waiver, including my attorney, and my
accountant or tax advisor. Prior to signing this Waiver, I have been given the
opportunity and sufficient time to seek such advice, and I fully understand the
meaning and contents of this Waiver.

         I understand that I may take up to forty-five (45) calendar days to
consider whether or not I desire to enter this Waiver. I was not coerced,
threatened or otherwise forced to sign this Waiver. I have made my choice to
sign this Waiver voluntarily and of my own free will.

         I understand that I may revoke this Waiver at any time during the seven
(7) calendar day period after I sign and deliver this Waiver to the Company. If
I revoke this Waiver, I must do so in writing delivered to the Company. I
understand that this Waiver is not effective until the expiration of this seven
(7) calendar day revocation period. I understand that upon the expiration of
such seven (7) calendar day revocation period this entire Waiver will be binding
upon me and will be irrevocable.

         I understand that by signing this Waiver I am giving up rights I may
have. I understand I do not have to sign this Waiver.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned hereby executes this Waiver this
_________ day of _______________ , in the year ______.

                       SENIOR EXECUTIVE CHANGE IN CONTROL
                                 SEVERANCE PLAN

ARTICLE I                                   - PURPOSE AND ADOPTION OF PLAN

         1.1 Adoption of Plan. Southern Company Services, Inc. hereby adopts
this Southern Company Senior Executive Change in Control Severance Plan. This
Plan is originally effective May 1, 2003. The Plan shall be an unfunded "top
hat" plan designed to provide certain severance benefits to a select group of
management or highly compensated employees, to be paid solely from the general
assets of the respective Employing Companies.

         1.2 Purpose. The Plan is primarily designed to provide benefits to
certain key executive employees of the Employing Companies, whose employment is

                  Company;

                           (ii) the willful carrying out of any activity or the
                  making of any statement by an Employee which would materially
                  prejudice or impair the good name and standing of his
                  Employing Company, Southern or any other Southern Subsidiary
                  or would bring his Employing Company, Southern or any other
                  Southern Subsidiary into contempt, ridicule or would
                  reasonably shock or offend any community in which his
                  Employing Company, Southern or such other Southern Subsidiary
                  is located;

                           (iii) attendance by an Employee at work in a state of
                  intoxication or otherwise being found in possession at his
                  workplace of any prohibited drug or substance, possession of
                  which would amount to a criminal offense;

                           (iv) violation of his Employing Company's policies on
                  drug and alcohol usage, fitness for duty requirements or
                  similar policies as may exist from time to time as adopted by
                  the Employing Company's safety officer;

                           (v) assault or other act of violence by an Employee
                  against any person during the course of employment; or (vi) an
                  Employee's indictment for any felony or any misdemeanor
                  involving moral turpitude.

         No act or failure to act by an Employee shall be deemed "willful"
unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Employee not in good faith and
without reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the best interest
of his Employing Company.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employee shall not be deemed to have
been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to
him a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of the majority
of the Southern Board at a meeting called and held for such purpose (after
reasonable notice to the Employee and an opportunity for him, together with
counsel, to be heard before the Southern Board), finding that, in the good faith
opinion of the Southern Board, the Employee was guilty of conduct set forth in
Section 2.36(a) or (b) hereof and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

         2.37 "Termination Date" shall mean the date on which the Participant's
employment with the Employing Company is terminated; provided, however, that
solely for purposes of Section 3.2(c) hereof, the Termination Date of
Participants who are deemed to be retired pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.3 hereof, shall be the effective date of their retirement pursuant to the
terms of the Pension Plan.

         2.38 "Total Disability" shall mean total disability within the meaning
of the Pension Plan.

         2.39 "Voting Securities" shall mean the outstanding voting securities
of a corporation entitling the holder thereof to vote generally in the election
of such corporation's directors.

         2.40 "Waiver and Release" shall mean the Waiver and Release attached
hereto as Exhibit A.

         2.41 "Year of Service" shall mean an Employee's Months of Service
divided by twelve (12) rounded to the nearest whole year, rounding up if the
remaining number of months is seven (7) or greater and rounding down if the
remaining number of months is less than seven (7). If an Employee has a break in
his service with his Employing Company, he will receive credit under this Plan
for the service prior to the break in service only if the break in service was
less than five years and his service prior to the break exceeds the length of
the break in service.

ARTICLE III                                             - SEVERANCE BENEFITS

         3.1 Eligibility.

                  (a) Employees. Except as otherwise provided herein, any
         Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by his Employing
         Company at any time during the two year period following a Change in
         Control of Southern or his Employing Company for reasons other than
         Cause or who shall voluntarily terminate his employment with his
         Employing Company for Good Reason at any time during the two year
         period following a Change in Control of Southern or his Employing
         Company, shall be entitled to participate in this Plan and receive the
         benefits described in Section 3.2 hereof, subject to the terms and
         conditions described in this Article 3.

                  (b) Deemed Employees. An Employee who is deemed to be employed
         by a different Employing Company than his actual Employing Company
         under Section 2.13 hereof, shall be entitled to participate in this
         Plan and receive the benefits described in Section 3.2 hereof in the
         same manner as other Employees under Section 3.1(a) hereof; provided,
         however, that such deemed Employee will be considered to be an Employee
         of the deemed Employing Company solely for purposes of determining
         whether a Change in Control has occurred. For all other purposes under
         this Plan, such deemed Employee's actual Employing Company shall be
         considered.

                  (c) Support Employees. A Support Employee shall be entitled to
         participate in this Plan and receive the benefits described in Section
         3.2 hereof, subject to the terms and conditions described in this
         Article 3.

                  (d) Limits on Eligibility. Notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary herein, an Employee or Support Employee shall not be eligible
         to receive benefits under this Plan if the Employee or Support
         Employee:

                           (i) is not actively at work on his Termination Date,
                  unless such Employee or Support Employee is capable of
                  returning to work within twelve (12) weeks of the beginning of
                  any leave of absence from work;

                           (ii) voluntarily terminates his employment with his
                  Employing Company for other than Good Reason;

                           (iii) is terminated by his Employing Company for
                  Cause;

                           (iv) accepts the transfer of his employment to
                  Southern, any Southern Subsidiary or any employer that
                  acquires all or substantially all of the assets of Southern, a
                  Southern Subsidiary or his Employing Company;

                           (v) refuses an offer of continued employment with his
                  Employing Company, Southern or a Southern Subsidiary, or any
                  employer that acquires all or substantially all of the assets
                  of Southern, a Southern Subsidiary or his Employing Company,
                  under circumstances where such refusal would not amount to
                  Good Reason for voluntary termination of employment and such
                  employer agrees to adopt this Plan as it applies to such
                  Participant; or

                           (vi) elects to receive the benefits of any other
                  voluntary or involuntary severance, separation or outplacement
                  program, plan or agreement maintained by his Employing Company
                  in lieu of benefits under this Plan; provided however, that
                  the receipt of benefits under any retention plan or agreement
                  shall not be deemed to be the receipt of benefits under any
                  severance, separation or outplacement program for purposes of
                  this Plan.

         3.2 Benefits. Upon the Employing Company's receipt of an effective
Waiver and Release, Participants shall be entitled to receive the following
benefits:

                  (a) Employee Outplacement Services. Each Participant shall be
         eligible to participate in the Employee Outplacement Program, which
         program shall not be less than six (6) months duration measured from
         the Participant's Termination Date.

                  (b) Severance Benefit. Participants shall be paid in cash an
         amount equal to three times the Participant's Annual Compensation (the
         "Severance Amount"). If any portion of the Severance Amount constitutes
         an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined under Code
         Section 280G ("Excess Parachute Payment")), the Employing Company shall
         pay to the Participant an additional amount calculated by determining
         the amount of tax under Code Section 4999 that he otherwise would have
         paid on any Excess Parachute Payment with respect to the Change in
         Control and dividing such amount by a decimal determined by adding the
         tax rate under Code Section 4999 ("Excise Tax"), the hospital insurance
         tax under Code Section 3101(b) ("HI Tax") and federal and state income
         tax measured at the highest marginal rates ("Income Tax") and
         subtracting such result from the number one (1) (the "280G Gross-up");
         provided, however, that no 280G Gross-up shall be paid unless the
         Severance Amount plus all other "parachute payments" to the Participant
         under Code Section 280G exceeds three (3) times the Participant's "base
         amount" (as such term is defined under Code Section 280G ("Base
         Amount")) by ten percent (10%) or more; provided further, that if no
         280G Gross-up is paid, the Severance Amount shall be capped at three
         (3) times the Participant's Base Amount, less all other "parachute
         payments" (as such term is defined under Code Section 280G) received by
         the Participant, less one dollar (the "Capped Amount"), if the Capped
         Amount, reduced by HI Tax and Income Tax, exceeds what otherwise would
         have been the Severance Amount, reduced by HI Tax, Income Tax and
         Excise Tax.

                  For purposes of this Section 3.2(b), whether any amount would
         constitute an Excess Parachute Payment and any other calculations of
         tax, e.g., Excise Tax, HI Tax, Income Tax, etc., or other amounts,
         e.g., Base Amount, Capped Amount, etc., shall be determined by the tax
         department of the independent public accounting firm then responsible
         for preparing Southern's consolidated federal income tax return, and
         such calculations or determinations shall be binding upon the
         Participants, Southern and the Employing Company.

                  (c) Welfare Benefit.

                           (i) Except as provided in Section 3.3 hereof, each
                  Participant shall be eligible to participate in the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan for a period of six (6) months for
                  each of the Participant's Years of Service, not to exceed a
                  period of five (5) years, beginning on the first day of the
                  first month following the Participant's Termination Date
                  unless otherwise specifically provided under such plan, upon
                  the Participant's payment of both the Employing Company's and
                  the Participant's premium under such plan. A Participant who
                  receives this extended medical coverage shall also be entitled
                  to elect coverage under the Group Health Plan for his
                  dependents who are participating in the Group Health Plan on
                  the Participant's Termination Date (and for such other
                  dependents as may be entitled to coverage under the provisions
                  of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
                  1996) for the duration of the Participant's extended medical
                  coverage under this Section 3.2(c) to the extent such
                  dependents remain eligible for dependent coverage under the
                  terms of the Group Health Plan.

                           (ii) The extended medical coverage afforded to a
                  Participant pursuant to this Section 3.2(c) as well as the
                  premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with such
                  coverage shall be determined in accordance with the terms of
                  the Group Health Plan and shall be subject to any changes in
                  the terms and conditions of the Group Health Plan as well as
                  any future increases in premiums under the Group Health Plan.
                  The premiums to be paid by the Participant in connection with
                  this extended coverage shall be due on the first day of each
                  month; provided, however, that if a Participant fails to pay
                  his premium within thirty (30) days of its due date, such
                  Participant's extended coverage shall be terminated.

                           (iii) Any Group Health Plan coverage provided under
                  this Section 3.2(c) shall be a part of and not in addition to
                  any COBRA Coverage which a Participant or his dependent may
                  elect. In the event that a Participant or his dependent
                  becomes eligible to be covered, by virtue of re-employment or
                  otherwise, by any employer-sponsored group health plan or is
                  eligible for coverage under any government-sponsored health
                  plan during the above period, coverage under the Employing
                  Company's Group Health Plan available to the Participant or
                  his dependent by virtue of the provisions of this Article 3
                  shall terminate, except as may otherwise be required by law,
                  and shall not be renewed. It shall be the duty of a
                  Participant to inform the Employing Company of his eligibility
                  to participate in any such health plan.

                           (iv) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3
                  hereof, regardless of whether a Participant elects the
                  extended coverage described in Section 3.2(a) hereof, the
                  Employing Company shall pay to each Participant a cash amount
                  equal to the Employing Company's and the Participant's cost of
                  premiums for three (3) years of coverage under the Group
                  Health Plan and Group Life Insurance Plan, as such Plans were
                  in effect as of the date of the Change in Control.

                  (d) Stock Option Vesting. The provisions of this Section
         3.2(d) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Omnibus Plan, the defined terms of
         which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(d) by reference.

                           (i) Any of the Participant's Options and Stock
                  Appreciation Rights outstanding as of the Termination Date
                  which are not then exercisable and vested, shall become fully
                  exercisable and vested to the full extent of the original
                  grant; provided, that in the case of a Participant holding a
                  Stock Appreciation Right who is subject to Section 16(b) of
                  the Exchange Act, such Stock Appreciation Right shall not
                  become fully vested and exercisable at such time if such
                  actions would result in liability to the Participant under
                  Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, provided further that any
                  such actions not taken as a result of the rules under Section
                  16(b) of the Exchange Act shall be effected as of the first
                  date that such activity would no longer result in liability
                  under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

                           (ii) The restrictions and deferral limitations
                  applicable to any of the Participant's Restricted Stock and
                  Restricted Stock Units as of the Termination Date shall lapse,
                  and such Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall
                  become free of all restrictions and limitations and become
                  fully vested and transferable to the full extent of the
                  original grant.

                  (e) Performance Pay Program. The provisions of this Section
         3.2(e) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of the Change
         in Control, was a participant in the Performance Pay Program, the
         defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section 3.2(e) by
         reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a Cash-Based
         Award under the PPP, if the PPP is in place as of the Participant's
         Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is entitled to
         participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to receive cash
         in an amount equal to a prorated payout of his Cash-Based Award under
         the PPP for the performance period in which the Termination Date shall
         have occurred, at target performance under the PPP and prorated by the
         number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         performance period until the Termination Date.

                  (f) Performance Dividend Program. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(f) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, was a participant in the Performance Dividend
         Program, the defined terms of which are incorporated in this Section
         3.2(f) by reference. Provided the Participant is not entitled to a
         Cash-Based Award under the PDP, if the PDP is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash for each such Cash-Based Award under the PDP held as of
         such date based on a payout percentage of 50% under the PDP for the
         performance period in which the Termination Date shall have occurred,
         and the annual dividend declared prior to the Termination Date.

                  (g) Other Short Term Incentives Under the Omnibus Plan. The
         provisions of this Section 3.2(g) shall apply to any Participant who,
         as of the date of the Change in Control is entitled to a Performance
         Unit or Performance Share award under the Omnibus Plan. Provided the
         Participant is not otherwise entitled to a Performance Unit/Share award
         under the Omnibus Plan, the Participant shall be entitled to receive
         cash in an amount equal to a prorated payout of the value of his
         Performance Units and/or Performance Shares for the performance period
         in which the Termination Date shall have occurred, at target
         performance and prorated by the number of months which have passed
         since the beginning of the performance period until the Termination
         Date.

                  (h) Other Short-Term Incentive Plans. The provisions of this
         Section 3.2(h) shall apply to any Participant who, as of the date of
         the Change in Control, is a participant in any other "short term
         incentive compensation plan" not otherwise previously referred to in
         this Section 3.2. Provided the Participant is not otherwise entitled to
         a plan payout under any change in control provisions of such plans, if
         the "short term incentive compensation plan" is in place through the
         Participant's Termination Date and to the extent the Participant is
         entitled to participate therein, the Participant shall be entitled to
         receive cash in an amount equal to his award under his respective
         Employing Company's "short term incentive compensation plan" for the
         annual performance period in which the Termination Date shall have
         occurred, at the Participant's target performance level and prorated by
         the number of months which have passed since the beginning of the
         annual performance period until the Termination Date. For purposes of
         this Section 3.2(h), the term "short term incentive compensation plan"
         shall mean any incentive compensation plan or arrangement adopted in
         writing by an Employing Company which provides for annual, recurring
         compensatory bonuses to participants based upon articulated performance
         criteria, and which have been identified by the Board of Directors and
         listed on Exhibit B hereto, which may be amended from time to time to
         reflect plan additions, terminations and amendments.

         3.3 Coordination with Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Coverage.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, any Participant who is otherwise
eligible to retire pursuant to the terms of the Pension Plan shall be deemed to
have retired for purposes of all employee benefit plans sponsored by the
Employing Company of which the Participant is a participant. A Participant who
is deemed to have retired in accordance with the preceding sentence shall not be
eligible to receive the benefits described in Section 3.2(c) hereof if, upon his
Termination Date, such Participant becomes eligible to receive the retiree
medical and life insurance coverage provided to certain retirees pursuant to the
terms of the Pension Plan, the Group Health Plan and the Group Life Insurance
Plan.

         3.4 Payment of Benefits. The amounts due a Participant under Sections
3.2(b) and (c) hereof shall be payable in one (1) lump sum payment as soon as
administratively practicable within thirty (30) days of the later of the
following to occur: (a) the Participant's Termination Date, or (b) the tender to
the Employing Company by the Participant of an effective Waiver and Release in
the form of Exhibit A attached hereto and the expiration of any applicable
revocation period for such waiver. In the event of a dispute with respect to
liability or amount of any benefit due hereunder, an effective Waiver and
Release shall be tendered at the time of final resolution of any such dispute
when payment is tendered by the Employing Company.

         3.5 Benefits in the Event of Death. In the event of the Participant's
death prior to the payment of all benefits due under this Article 3, the
Participant's estate shall be entitled to receive as due any amounts not yet
paid under this Article 3 upon the tender by the executor or administrator of
the estate of an effective Waiver and Release.

         3.6 Legal Fees. In the event of a dispute between a Participant and his
Employing Company with regard to any amounts due hereunder, if any material
issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, his
Employing Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees incurred with
respect to all issues in such dispute in an amount not to exceed fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000).

         3.7 No Mitigation. A Participant who receives benefits under Section
3.2 of this Plan shall have no duty or obligation to seek other employment
following his Termination Date and, except as otherwise provided in Subsection
3.1(d) hereof, the amounts due a Participant hereunder shall not be reduced or
suspended if such Participant accepts such subsequent employment.

         3.8 Non-qualified Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans.
Subsequent to a Change in Control, any claims by a Participant for benefits
under any of the Company's non-qualified retirement or deferred compensation
plans shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the

issue in such dispute is finally resolved in the Participant's favor, the
Company shall reimburse the Participant's legal fees in the manner provided in
Section 3.6 hereof.

ARTICLE IV                                                - ADMINISTRATION

         4.1 Administrative Duties. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Compensation Committee shall be responsible for the general administration of
the Plan and may appoint other persons or entities to perform or assist in the
performance of any of its duties, subject to its review and approval. The
Compensation Committee shall have the right to remove any such appointee from
his position without cause upon notice.

ARTICLE V                                                   - ARBITRATION

         5.1 General. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to the Company's obligations to pay severance benefits under this Plan,
or the breach thereof, shall be settled and resolved solely by arbitration in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association ("AAA") except as otherwise provided herein. The arbitration shall
be the sole and exclusive forum for resolution of any such claim for severance
benefits and the arbitrators' award shall be final and binding. The provisions
of this Article 5 are not intended to apply to any other disputes, claims or
controversies arising out of or relating to a Participant's employment by an
Employing Company or the termination thereof.

         5.2 Demand for Arbitration. Arbitration shall be initiated by serving a
written notice of demand for arbitration to the Participant, in the case of an
Employing Company, or to the Compensation Committee, in the case of a
Participant.

         5.3 Law and Venue. The arbitrators shall apply the laws of the State of
Georgia, except to the extent pre-empted by federal law, excluding any law which
would require the use of the law of another state. The arbitration shall be held
in Atlanta, Georgia.

         5.4 Appointment of Arbitrators. Arbitrators shall be appointed within
fifteen (15) business days following service of the demand for arbitration. The
number of arbitrators shall be three. One arbitrator shall be appointed by the
Participant, one arbitrator shall be appointed by the Employing Company, and the
two arbitrators shall appoint a third. If the arbitrators cannot agree on a
third arbitrator within thirty (30) business days after the service of demand
for arbitration, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the AAA.

         5.5 Costs. The arbitration filing fee shall be paid by the Participant.
All other costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Participant and his
Employing Company, provided, however, that such Employing Company shall
reimburse such fees and costs in the event any material issue in such dispute is
finally resolved in the Participant's favor and the Participant is reimbursed
legal fees under Section 3.6 hereof.

         5.6 Interim and Injunctive Relief. Nothing in this Article 5 is
intended to preclude, upon application of either party, any court having
jurisdiction from issuing and enforcing in any lawful manner such temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, and other interim measures of
relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to either party's interests or as
otherwise may be appropriate pending the conclusion of arbitration proceedings
pursuant to this Article 5 and nothing herein is intended to prevent any court
from entering and enforcing in any lawful manner such judgments for permanent
equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent harm to a party's interests or
as otherwise may be appropriate following the issuance of arbitral awards
pursuant to this Article 5.

ARTICLE VI                                                 - MISCELLANEOUS

         6.1 Funding of Benefits. Unless the Board of Directors shall in its
discretion determine otherwise, the benefits payable to a Participant under the
Plan shall not be funded in any manner and shall be paid by the Employing
Companies out of their general assets, which assets are subject to the claims of
the Employing Companies' creditors.

         6.2 Withholding. There shall be deducted from the payment of any
benefit due under the Plan the amount of any tax required by any governmental
authority to be withheld and paid over by the Employing Companies to such
governmental authority for the account of the Participant entitled to such
payment.

         6.3 Assignment. No Participant or beneficiary shall have any rights to
sell, assign, transfer, encumber, or otherwise convey the right to receive the
payment of any benefit due hereunder, which payment and the rights thereto are
expressly declared to be nonassignable and nontransferable. Any attempt to do so
shall be null and void and of no effect.

         6.4 Amendment and Termination. The Plan may be amended or terminated at
any time by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that any material
amendment or termination of the Plan shall not be effective unless approved by
the Compensation Committee upon a recommendation by the Chief Executive Officer
of Southern. Notwithstanding the above, no amendment or termination of the Plan
shall be effective if such amendment or termination is made or is effective
within six (6) months of a Preliminary Change in Control unless such amendment
has the effect of increasing benefits to Participants under the Plan or is
determined by the Board of Directors to be immaterial.

         6.5 Construction. The Plan shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent not preempted by
federal law, disregarding any provision of law which would require the
application of the law of another state.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Southern Company Senior Executive Change in
Control Severance Plan has been executed by the Company through its duly
authorized officers, this 16th day of May, 2003, to be effective as provided
herein.

                               Waiver and Release

         I understand that I am entitled to receive the Severance Benefits
described in Article 3 of the Southern Company Senior Executive Change in
Control Severance Plan (the "Plan") if I execute this Waiver and Release
("Waiver"). I understand that the benefits I have elected to receive under the
Plan are in excess of those I would have received from ________________________
(the "Company") if I had not elected to participate in the Plan and sign this
Waiver.

         I recognize that I may have a claim against the Company under the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act or other
federal, state and local laws.

         In exchange for the benefits I elect to receive, I hereby irrevocably
waive and release all claims, of any kind whatsoever, whether known or unknown
in connection with any claim which I ever had, may have, or now have against The
Southern Company, Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power

officers, directors, employees, agents and attorneys. Nothing in this Waiver
shall be construed to release claims or causes of action under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act which arise out of events occurring after the
execution date of this Waiver.

         In further exchange for the benefits I elect to receive, I understand
and agree that I will respect the proprietary and confidential nature of any
information I have obtained in the course of my service with the Company or any
subsidiary or affiliate of The Southern Company. I understand and agree that I
am obligated to keep confidential and not disclose the terms of this Waiver,
including, but not limited to, the benefits under this Plan, except to my
attorneys, financial advisors, or except where such disclosure is required by
law. However, nothing in this Waiver shall prohibit me from engaging in
protected activities under applicable law or from communicating, either
voluntary or otherwise, with any governmental agency concerning any potential
violation of the law.

         In signing this Waiver, I am not releasing claims to any vested or
accrued benefits that I have under any workers' compensation laws or any
retirement plan or welfare benefit plan within the meaning of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which is sponsored by or
adopted by the Company and/or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries;
however, I understand and acknowledge that nothing herein is intended to or
shall be construed to require the Company to institute or continue in effect any
particular plan or benefit sponsored by the Company and the Company hereby
reserves the right to amend or terminate any of its benefit programs at any time
in accordance with the procedures set forth in such plans.

         In signing this Waiver, I realize that I am waiving and releasing,
among other things, any claims to benefits under any and all bonus, severance,
workforce reduction, early retirement, outplacement, or any other similar type
plan sponsored by the Company except for programs specifically designed for
participants in the Plan.

         Notwithstanding anything in this Waiver to the contrary, I understand
that the Company is not discouraging or prohibiting me from engaging in any
protected activity described in Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act.

         I have been encouraged and advised in writing to seek advice from
anyone of my choosing regarding this Waiver, including my attorney, and my
accountant or tax advisor. Prior to signing this Waiver, I have been given the
opportunity and sufficient time to seek such advice, and I fully understand the
meaning and contents of this Waiver.

         I understand that I may take up to forty-five (45) calendar days to
consider whether or not I desire to enter this Waiver. I was not coerced,
threatened or otherwise forced to sign this Waiver. I have made my choice to
sign this Waiver voluntarily and of my own free will.

         I understand that I may revoke this Waiver at any time during the seven
(7) calendar day period after I sign and deliver this Waiver to the Company. If
I revoke this Waiver, I must do so in writing delivered to the Company. I
understand that this Waiver is not effective until the expiration of this seven
(7) calendar day revocation period. I understand that upon the expiration of
such seven (7) calendar day revocation period this entire Waiver will be binding
upon me and will be irrevocable.

         I understand that by signing this Waiver I am giving up rights I may
have. I understand I do not have to sign this Waiver.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned hereby executes this Waiver this
_______ day of _________, in the year ______.

                                                   Employee's signature


                                                 Employee's printed name

                               FIRST AMENDMENT TO
                              THE SOUTHERN COMPANY
                                  PENSION PLAN

         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Southern Company Services, Inc. (the
"Company") heretofore adopted The Southern Company Pension Plan, as amended and
restated effective as of January 1, 2002 (the "Plan");

         WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 13.1 of the Plan, the Company is
authorized to amend the Plan at any time;

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to amend the Plan to clarify that
Subsections (a) and (b) of Section 1.10, "Earnings," include certain catch-up
contributions made under The Southern Company Employee Savings Plan;

         WHEREAS, the Company further desires to amend the Plan to modify
Section 1.18, "Hour of Service," to address time off under a paid time off
program;

         WHEREAS, the Company further desires to amend the Plan to clarify
provisions in Section 5.7.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the Company hereby amends the Plan as follows,
effective as set forth in each numbered paragraph:

                                       1.

         Effective April 12, 2003, subsections (a) and (b) of Section 1.10,
"Earnings," shall be amended to read as follows:

                  1.10 (a) "Earnings" with respect to any Employee including any
         Employee whose service is terminated by reason of disability (as
         defined in Section 4.4) means (1) the highest annual rate of salary or
         wages of an Employee of any Affiliated Employer within any Plan Year
         before deductions for taxes, Social Security, etc., (2) all amounts
         contributed by any Affiliated Employer to The Southern Company Employee
         Savings Plan as Elective Employer Contributions, as said term is
         described under Section 4.1 of such plan, pursuant to the Employee's
         exercise of his deferral option made thereunder in accordance with the
         requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, (3) all amounts contributed
         by any Affiliated Employer to The Southern Company Employee Savings
         Plan as catch-up contributions pursuant to the Employee's exercise of
         his deferral option made thereunder in accordance with the requirements
         of Section 414(v) of the Code, and (4) all amounts contributed by any
         Affiliated Employer to The Southern Company Flexible Benefits Plan on
         behalf of an Employee pursuant to his salary reduction election, and
         applied to provide one or more of the optional benefits available under
         such plan, but (5) shall exclude all amounts deferred under any
         non-qualified deferred compensation plan maintained by any Affiliated
         Employer.

                           (b) Notwithstanding the above, "Earnings" with
         respect to any commissioned salesperson means the salary or wages of an
         Employee of any Affiliated Employer within any Plan Year, without
         including overtime, and before deductions for taxes, Social Security,
         etc. but applying those adjustments identified in paragraphs (a)(2),
         (3), (4), and (5) above. In addition, "Earnings" for any Employee who
         is a regular part-time employee means with regard to paragraph (a)(1)
         above the highest annual rate of salary or wages based on a forty (40)
         hour work week. "Earnings" shall also include, for appliance
         salespersons, certain nonproductive pay earnings types as determined
         from time to time by the Board of Directors and set forth on Appendix B
         to the Plan, which Appendix may be updated from time to time.

                                       2.

         Effective April 12, 2003, Section 1.18, "Hour of Service," shall be
amended to read as follows:

                  1.18 "Hour of Service" means an Employee shall be credited
         with one Hour of Service for each hour for which (a) he is paid, or
         entitled to payment, for the performance of duties for an Affiliated
         Employer, and such hours shall be credited to the Employee for the
         computation period or periods in which the duties are performed; (b) he
         is paid, or entitled to payment, by an Affiliated Employer on account
         of a period of time during which no duties are performed (irrespective
         of whether the employment relationship has terminated) due to vacation,
         holiday, illness, time off under a paid time off program, incapacity
         (including disability), layoff, jury duty, military duty, or leave of
         absence in which case the Employee shall be credited with Hours of
         Service for the computation period or periods in which the period
         during which no duties were performed occurs; (c) back pay,
         irrespective of mitigation of damages, has been either awarded or
         agreed to by an Affiliated Employer, in which case the Employee shall
         be credited with Hours of Service for the computation period or periods
         to which the award or agreement pertains, rather than the computation
         period in which the award, agreement, or payment is made; and (d)
         solely for the purpose of calculating Vesting Years of Service, he was
         on any form of authorized leave of absence. The same Hours of Service
         shall not be credited under clauses (a), (b), (c), and (d).

                  An Employee who is entitled to be credited with Hours of
         Service in accordance with clause (b) or (d) of this Section 1.18 shall
         be credited with such number of Hours of Service for the period of time
         during which no duties were performed as though he were in the active
         employment of an Employing Company during such period of time. However,
         an Employee shall not be credited with Hours of Service in accordance
         with clause (b) of this Section 1.18 for any unused vacation or unused
         time off under a paid time off program for which payment is received at
         termination of employment or upon an Employee becoming ineligible to
         participate in a paid time off program, or if the payment which is made
         to him or to which he is entitled in accordance with clause (b) is made
         or due under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of complying with
         applicable Worker's Compensation, or unemployment compensation or
         disability insurance laws, or if such payment is one which solely
         reimburses an Employee for medical or medically related expenses
         incurred by the Employee.

                  Provided there is no duplication of Hours of Service credited
         in accordance with the foregoing provisions, if an Employee is on an
         approved leave of absence to serve in the Armed Forces of the United
         States, he shall be credited with such number of Hours of Service with
         respect to all or such portion of the period of his absence to serve in
         the Armed Forces of the United States as may be recognized under
         Sections 1.38(b), 2.3, and 4.2(a).

                  The rules set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of Department of
         Labor Regulations 2530.200b-2 are incorporated in the Plan by this
         reference and made a part hereof.

                                       3.

         Effective January 1, 2003, Section 5.7(c)(2)(iii) is amended to read as
follows:

                  (iii) Forms of distribution. Unless the Employee's interest is
         distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance
         company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as
         of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in
         accordance with Subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 5.7. If
         the Employee's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity
         purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be
         made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the
         Code and the Treasury regulations.

                                       4.

         Effective January 1, 2003, Section 5.7(c)(3)(iii) is amended to read as
follows:

                  (iii) Additional accruals after first distribution calendar
          year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Employee in a calendar
          year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed
          beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year
          immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
          In determining additional benefits, there shall be taken into account
          the value of benefit payments previously made. The receipt by an
          Employee of any payments or distributions as a result of his attaining
          age 70 1/2 prior to his actual retirement or death shall in no way
          affect the entitlement of an otherwise eligible Employee to additional
          accrued benefits.

                                       5.

         Effective January 1, 2003, Section 5.7(c)(5)(iii) is amended to read as
follows:

                  (iii) Death of surviving spouse. If the Employee's surviving
         spouse is the Employee's sole beneficiary, and the surviving spouse
         dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin but after
         Employee dies without having commenced payment of Retirement income,
         this Section 5.7(c)(5) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the
         Employee, except that the time by which distributions must begin will
         be determined without regard to Section 5.7(c)(2)(ii)(A).

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Southern Company Services, Inc., through its duly
authorized officer, has adopted this First Amendment to The Southern Company
Pension Plan this 11th day of July, 2003, to be effective as stated herein.

                              AMENDED AND RESTATED


                         SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION AGREEMENT


         THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION AGREEMENT, made as of
the 12th day of May, 2003, by and between SOUTHERN COMPANY SERVICES, INC.
("SCS"), SOUTHERN NUCLEAR OPERATING COMPANY, INC. ("Nuclear"), ALABAMA POWER
COMPANY ("Alabama") (SCS, Nuclear and Alabama are each referred to herein
individually as "Company" and collectively as "Companies"), and JAMES H. MILLER,
III (the "Employee").

                                 WITNESSETH THAT

         WHEREAS, the Employee is currently employed by SCS as a highly
compensated employee and a member of its management;

         WHEREAS, the Employee was previously employed by Alabama and, before
such employment with Alabama, by Nuclear;

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Employee's prior employment with Nuclear,
Nuclear and the Employee entered into a Supplemental Pension Agreement dated May
26, 1994 for the provision of certain supplemental retirement benefits ("Nuclear
Agreement"); and

         WHEREAS, the Companies and the Employee wish to amend and restate the
Nuclear Agreement in order to recognize the Employee's transfers of employment
from Nuclear to Alabama and from Alabama to SCS and to provide for the payment
by SCS, Alabama and Nuclear of their proportionate shares of the benefits
provided hereunder.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual
covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

         1. If the Employee shall continue to serve SCS faithfully, diligently
and competently to the best of his ability from the date of this Agreement until
either

                  a. such date after his service as an employee shall terminate;
         or

                  b. his retirement in accordance with the provisions of The
         Southern Company Pension Plan ("Plan"); or

                  c. his death while in the service of the Company if his spouse
         is entitled to benefits as a Provisional Payee under the Plan; then the
         provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 hereof shall be operative.

         2. The Companies shall pay to the Employee an amount per month equal to
the difference between the monthly amount payable to the Employee under the Plan
as it shall then be in effect at the time any monthly amount shall be payable in
accordance with this Paragraph and the monthly amount which would have been
payable to him under the Plan if the Employee were given credit for ten
additional years of Accredited Service under the Plan, less any deductions
hereinafter provided. The benefit provided in the preceding sentence shall be
paid to the Employee in monthly installments on the first day of each month in
the same manner and commence at the same time as the Employee's election to
receive Retirement Income under the Plan. For the purpose of computing a monthly
amount payable to the Employee under the Plan, no limitation on benefits imposed
by the Internal Revenue Code as it now exists or is hereafter amended or any
other limiting legislation shall be taken into account. The computations
required for the determination of the monthly payments hereunder and the periods
used as periods of Accredited Service shall be calculated so as to give
appropriate effect in each instance to the exclusion of any portions of such
period on account of eligibility, military service, leave of absence, or
otherwise as may be required under the Plan as it shall be in effect at the time
such monthly payment is to be made.

         3. If, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Employee shall
have a Provisional Payee entitled to receive payments thereunder, then the
Provisional Payee shall be entitled to payments under this Agreement which, when
added to payments to her under the Plan, would be appropriate if the Employee
were given credit for ten additional years of Accredited Service under the Plan.

         4. SCS, Nuclear and Alabama agree to share the cost of any payments to
the Employee and his Provisional Payee under Paragraphs 2 and 3 of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph 4. Each Company's share
of any payment to the Employee or his Provisional Payee under Paragraphs 2 and 3
herein shall be calculated by multiplying such payment by a fraction, where the
numerator of such fraction is the base rate of pay received by the Employee from
the respective Company on his date of transfer or termination, as applicable,
multiplied by the Employee's Accredited Service at such Company, and where the
denominator of such fraction is the sum of all numerators calculated for SCS,
Nuclear and Alabama.

         5. Neither the entering into nor the termination of this Agreement for
any cause shall affect the Employee's right to such salary, fees or other
compensation for his services as an employee, officer or director of SCS as it
has agreed or may agree to pay him prior to or subsequent to his termination of
service nor the Employee's right to participate in and receive benefits under
any plan or plans of SCS now existing, or which may hereafter exist, providing
benefits for its employees.

         6. The Employee shall not, under any circumstances, have any option or
right to require payments hereunder otherwise than in accordance with the terms
hereof and after the terms and contingencies herein specified have been met.
Except as specifically allowed by law, neither the Employee nor any Provisional
Payee shall have any power of anticipation, alienation, mortgage, pledge,
encumbrance or assignment of payments contemplated hereunder, and all rights and
benefits of the Employee and of any Provisional Payee shall be for his or her
sole personal benefit, and no other person shall acquire any right, title or
interest hereunder by reason of any sale, assignment, mortgage, pledge,
encumbrance, transfer, claim or judgment or bankruptcy proceedings against the
Employee or his Provisional Payee.

         7. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to affect in
any manner the existing rights of SCS or the Employee to suspend, terminate,
alter or modify, whether or not for cause, the employment relationship
contemplated by Paragraph 1 hereof.

         8. The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances
upon performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not
be construed as a waiver or a relinquishment of any right granted hereunder or
of the future performance of any such term, covenant or condition, but the
obligation of either party with respect thereto shall continue in full force and
effect.

         9. The parties hereto agree that the validity of this Agreement or any
of the provisions hereof shall be determined under and according to the laws of
the State of Alabama, and that the Agreement and its provisions shall be
interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of that State.

         10. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and any successor to the business of SCS, Nuclear or Alabama,
but neither this Agreement nor any right hereunder may be assigned by the
Employee, and in any event, the Agreement shall, if not sooner terminated,
terminate for all purposes upon the death of the Employee or, if his Provisional
Payee shall survive the Employee and shall be entitled to receive any payments
hereunder, upon the death of the Provisional Payee, and the satisfaction by SCS,
Nuclear and Alabama of their obligations arising theretofore under the
Agreement.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, SCS, Nuclear and Alabama have caused this Amended
and Restated Supplemental Pension Agreement to be executed by their duly
authorized officers and the Employee has executed this Agreement in
quadruplicate on or as of the day and year first above written.

     (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

         reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting; and
